FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: Health reforms answer to demographic change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr KOSTA MANIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the battle of statistics on the National Health Service
('Temperature rises over NHS reforms', February 20), there is a vital one
missing. Within the next nine years there will be a 50 per cent increase in
those aged 85 and over, adding an extra 17 per cent to the health bill.
Bearing in mind that the NHS already spends 40 per cent of its resources on
the old age pensioners, that the medical technology costs are spiraling, and
that there will be a reduction in the tax-paying workforce from a drop in
the birth rate, it is only a matter of time before the Treasury gives up as
the sole provider.
It is therefore inevitable that whichever party wins the next election will
have no choice but to examine new ways of financing health care.
I have recently applied to become a fund-holder because I believe that the
real strength of the reforms is that they have introduced devolution in
medicine, by shifting powers from Whitehall to the districts - Home Rule for
GPs] At a local level the huge problems from the expected demographic
changes can be dealt with much more efficiently.
I was therefore disappointed to read in your leader today that Labour will
abolish the reforms, if elected, and return to a centralised bureaucracy.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Scotland the grave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland will devour the energies and perhaps the spirit of the next British
government. This is the privately-expressed fear of many Westminster
politicians, more than a handful of whom are members of Mr John Major's
cabinet. I hope they are right. The United Kingdom is ill-served by the
historic complacency of the English. If the Scots oblige the infuriating
tribe south of the border to think afresh about how we run our polity they
will benefit everyone. If they puncture the illusion of grandeur that -
nearly half a century after the end of the Second World War - still haunts
the English, we can only cheer.
Mr Major disagrees. Like every prime minister before him, he has begun to
reflect upon the historic greatness of his office. It happens to them all.
Becoming the temporary tied tenant of Number 10 Downing Street is a rush of
Ecstasy to the head. You are host to Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Reagan, Bush. You
take your turn as chairman of the UN Security Council, the Group of 7, the
EC, or appear as first among equals at meetings of heads of Commonwealth
governments. This sense of being in the control room of the civilised
universe is given an electric charge by the thrill of being assured that you
are doing some good. For you are supported by highly competent officials. On
most days, you can reasonably claim, Britain's influence in international
forums is beneficial.
Back on earth, the prime minister's speech in Glasgow on Saturday could be
read as an intimation to the Scots that if they choose separation from the
United Kingdom they will no longer be part of all this. This is to make them
face up to the consequences to themselves of putting the union in jeopardy.
It could, however, be interpreted as a warning that if the Scots go, so
might the Welsh and Northern Irish. That would leave little England exposed
as a small offshore country, deserving of relegation.
The second interpretation is consonant with Mr Major's statement that the
debate on Scotland's future is 'a matter that transcends the election'. A
sense of playing a leading part in world affairs also explains his
passionate affirmation that 'England and Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland together are far, far greater than the sum of their parts'.
The same argument gives verisimilitude to the claim that Conservative
support for the union is disinterested. Floating Scotland free would detach
Labour's majority from Westminster, ensuring Tory rule until kingdom come.
'And yet,' said Mr Major, 'it is our party that supports the union. Not
because it's always been good for us, but because it's always seemed right
to us.'
The Glasgow speech was not all passionate declaration. It set out lines for
Conservative participation in the debate on Scotland's future. The
government may be wrong about Scotland, but at last the prime minister is
taking the argument seriously. Mr Major proclaimed himself The Major choice:
a modified status quo or separation for Scotland
a unionist because, he insists, the true choice is between a possibly
modified status quo and outright separation of Scotland. He rejected a third
option, devolution of powers to a Scottish parliament, as unworkable,
expensive, and likely to lead to separation.
Yet there is nothing in his speech that would prevent a Conservative
government elected on April 9 from turning around on April 10 and accepting
that devolution is on the agenda. The conventional wisdom is that it would
have to do so, since on most calculations there would be a mere taxicab full
of Scottish Tories left in the House. This is not so. As prime minister of a
minority or low-majority government, Mr Major would have at least three
choices.
First, he could attempt to tough it out, and appoint English ministers to
run the Scottish office, following past examples in Wales and Northern
Ireland. Second, he could try to do a de Klerk and challenge the Scottish
Nationalists to a referendum. If the offer was separation or nothing, the
Nationalists might lose. The status quo would be maintained, give or take a
few mollifying gestures in the shape of modifications to the operations of
the Scottish office. His remaining option would be to accept that many
Scottish Conservatives want to revert to its pre-Thatcher pro-devolution
stance.
If he proves happier with the first two of the above options than the third
it will be because of a genuine fear of an unravelling of the United
Kingdom. I believe this to be misplaced. The worst and most unlikely outcome
of devolution would be the eventual choice of Baltic-style independence by
all three Celtic states. That would leave England, with 83 per cent of the
population of the UK, well able to struggle along in the best 54 per cent of
its land area. Within the EC, there would be no frontier checks unless they
were imposed by England in a fit of pique. If Treasury figures about the
cost to English taxpayers of maintaining their burdensome peripheral cousins
are correct, Mr Major could reduce the standard rate of income tax to below
20p at a stroke.
This takes the argument to extremes. The prime minister rightly charged that
Labour's proposals for devolution are financially unconvincing. There is
also the thorny question of Scottish representatives at Westminster voting,
or not voting, on devolved matters. It needs an answer, even if that is no
more than a reduction of the number of Scottish MPs and a restructuring of
the committee system. Labour squirms around this. For Mr Major to say so
serves the politics of the moment, but that is all. The Tories should look
for a satisfactory framework for devolution, including consequential changes
at Westminster. All that is being sought is a regional assembly, or
entrenched local self-government. This is something Spain knows much about
and France is wrestling with. Only England, whose elective dictatorship
deprives its rulers of an understanding of shared power, recoils.

Anyone in any doubt that the Tories will be losing one of their few
remaining mavericks now that Alan Clark is bowing out of the Commons should
look no further than the last Christmas edition of New Statesman &amp; Society.
When the member for Plymouth Sutton was asked to nominate the book that
pleased him most, he chose Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'Love in the Time of
Cholera'. While the choice was not especially noteworthy, the reason given
was more interesting. 'For anyone who has been in love - really in love, I
mean, which (alas for them) doesn't apply to all - this is the book,' he
opined.
Hardly the language one would expect from the minister for defence
procurement. But all the more refreshing.

<TEXT>
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, one of the more colourful members of the French
business elite, has made it back from his short absence in the corporate
desert.
But the title of European development adviser to Novalliance, a medium-sized
French packaging-to-property industrial group with a FFr 10bn turnover,
seems distinctly small fry for the likes of Descarpentries who, until last
September, was in charge of CMB Packaging.
The show-case merger between Carnaud and Metalbox Packaging, two pillars of
the French and British establishment, was, however, dogged by serious
friction between respective management styles. The ebullient
Descarpentries - who made his initial mark by taking CMB executives on a
get-acquainted session to the Jordanian desert - stood aside four months
ago.
Accused by some executives of trying to divide and rule, he had been better
appreciated when engineering the recovery at loss-making Carnaud  - in the
early 1980s a company sorely in need of the
Descarpentries touch. Now Novalliance seems eager for an injection of the
decentralist philosophy which is his trade-mark. It may have got more than
it bargained for.

Following hard on last week's totally blank press release from HM Treasury
comes the almost completely blank invitation to 'a private view of the
launch commercial for the new Volkswagen Golf'. The large white card is
empty save for a half-inch rectangle of tiny print and a VW logo.
On the other hand, Observer now receives so many invites to the launch of
this, that, and the other new advert, that a blank one is quite welcome.
Once upon a time new commercials were simply flung at the unsuspecting
public; now they have to be accompanied by fripperies - champagne,
cassettes, glossy brochures and other gimmicks - which once went with the
launch of something more than 30 seconds of TV time.

The Queen's recent visit to Australia will be remembered for the unusually
large number of faux pas committed by her rebellious subjects down under.
Among the more memorable was the Sydney Morning Herald's. It published a
photo-portrait of Her Majesty in full regalia, only to discover that she was
arrayed in the Order of Canada and the Canadian Order of Military Merit
instead of the Order of Australia.
The error was spotted by Sir David Smith, a former secretary to the
Governor-General, who clearly knows his medals. The Herald is blaming
London, though whether it means its own office, Australia House or the city
generally is not clear. Canada's Conrad Black, the new owner of the Sydney
Morning Herald, is going to have to do better than that if he wants to earn
his knighthood.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Observer: Macleods of that ilk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who was really responsible for the mess at Western Isles council which
invested Pounds 23m in BCCI and lost it?
The obvious culprit, as two external inquiries agreed, was Donald Macleod,
the council's director of finance, who did not act on warnings about BCCI
and was lax in the management of his department. He accepted responsibility,
was dismissed by the special disciplinary committee in December and had his
appeal against dismissal rejected by the council's appeals committee a few
weeks ago.
But what about his superior, George Macleod, the chief executive? When the
loss was revealed he said it was the first he knew of the council's
investment in BCCI and hadn't realised the council had had such large
reserves. Then, the day before the crucial council meeting to discuss the
disaster, he announced that he was resuming his interrupted holiday. He was
eventually coaxed back to work.
The council's disciplinary committee dismissed George Macleod in December
for not overseeing the finance department properly, for not checking that
the finance director had stopped borrowing and on-lending after being
reprimanded for this in 1988 and for his handling of the BCCI crisis. But
last Friday the appeals committee decided by a majority of seven to five to
let him off with a final warning.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Terrorism law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CASE for Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act, debated by the Commons
yesterday, has always been difficult to make. It needs to be made with more
conviction if the act is to remain.
Without question, the act seriously curtails civil liberties. It gives the
police the power to carry out security checks on people entering or leaving
the UK; to exclude suspected terrorists from the UK, Northern Ireland or
Great Britain without charge; and to detain them for 48 hours without
charge, with the possibility of another five days' detention with the
authority of the Home Secretary. These are significant departures from the
rules on the arrest and detention of ordinary criminal suspects.
Terrorism is not to be fought with kid gloves, but the suspension of
fundamental human rights needs to be justified by measurable results. Yet
the number charged with a terrorist offence after detention under the act
has fallen from 26 in 1981 to just four last year. The number detained under
the act has also declined sharply in recent years, but the proportion of
detainees neither excluded nor charged has remained at about 80 per cent.
The government repeatedly seeks to make political capital out of the Labour
party's commitment to repeal the PTA. Yet when the act - first introduced by
a Labour government - was made permanent in 1989, ministers stated that the
necessity for it would be monitored regularly. The last thoroughgoing
independent review was conducted in 1987. If the government wins the
election, it will be time for a further such review. Without one, the
suspicion can only grow that its continuance has more to do with party
politics than with fighting terrorism.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Engineers and a welding job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A COUNTRY preoccupied by recession, unemployment and trains which fail to
run on time, the role and structure of the UK's professional engineering
institutions may seem too timeless a subject to merit scrutiny. Not
surprisingly, therefore, the progress of a steering group charged with
considering a new focal point for the profession scores low on the Richter
scale of news.
But behind the group's work, launched in January and since welcomed by the
government, lies a sad but undeniable paradox: UK professional engineers are
highly regarded overseas for their skills, but at home they are Cinderellas
in terms of pay and status. According to one recent survey, the UK comes
fourth from bottom of the European league in net pay for both experienced
and newly qualified engineers.
Professional engineers pin some of the blame for this on City short-termism
that elevates accountants, rather than engineers, to the top jobs in
manufacturing industry. In the turbulent 1980s, financial engineering often
took precedence over the electrical, mechanical or civil variety in many
large public companies.
But engineers must bear some of the blame themselves: as is implicitly
recognised in the agreement of the Engineering Council (set up in 1981 by
Sir Keith Joseph following the Finniston Inquiry into the profession) to a
proposal which will probably lead to its own abolition.
A personal initiative unveiled last November by Sir John Fairclough, the
council's chairman, calls for it to be replaced by a new federal body to
co-ordinate the engineers' 46 distinct institutions. These bodies in turn
have approved the formation of a steering group to point the way ahead.
Promote the status
There are big issues at stake: how better to encourage young people into
engineering, to stimulate the provision of relevant degree courses, to
promote the status of the engineer within industry and society, and to set
standards of professional conduct to raise the public's confidence in
engineers and their work.
To tackle any of these issues effectively, engineers need a body capable of
speaking coherently and with authority. The Engineering Council, created by
government but lacking the statutory authority that Finniston wanted, has
made limited progress on some of the big issues but remains an
unsatisfactory half-way house.
Too specialised
An unco-ordinated viewpoint on educational priorities, for example, explains
partly why Britain has struggled so long and hard to produce degree courses
to nurture the more broadly educated engineers employers say they want. One
reason why so few engineers reach the boardroom is that too many of them are
too specialised. There is no room in senior management for engineers who
cannot communicate well and think laterally.
The new scheme is a welcome first step towards solving the problem of
institutional fragmentation. A federal structure that brings power to the
centre only on key issues - education, training, codes of conduct and the
environment - should be workable if the more specialist institutions and
their members are given a say, but not the power to veto necessary change.
That said, it must be admitted that the proposed new structure falls well
short of the more unified professional system elsewhere in Europe. By
avoiding shot-gun weddings among the institutions, the reformers should not
duck the case for a season of arranged marriages.
Even with determined institutional reform, it will be a long time before
Britain's 290,000 registered engineers and technicians win the status they
covet.
But reducing structural confusion is a worthwhile start, and ought at least
to help engineers to get their message across. Who knows, if ERM membership
does eventually deliver for Britain a more stable manufacturing sector, the
country's newly articulate and well-organised engineers might indeed be in a
better position to climb the corporate greasy pole. That would be a
desirable outcome from every point of view.

FT  25 FEB 92 / A painful birth: Ukraine's increasing nationalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relations between Russia and Ukraine, the two largest Slav states, are
worsening to the point of alarm.
At the weekend the Ukrainian foreign ministry sent a note to Marshal Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov, commander of the Black Sea fleet, protesting that he had
distorted the Ukrainian position on the fleet. Soon, it may call for his
dismissal. An announcement that Ukraine has agreed with Iran to build a
pipeline from Iran to Ukraine to supply the latter with oil is thought
hazardous because it must run through Russian territory, and is vulnerable
to being blocked. Where Russia claims to see the Commonwealth of Independent
States as a stabilising force to preserve a forum for joint decisions among
the former members of the Soviet Union, Ukraine scorns it as a hollow sham,
to be discarded as soon as possible.
The force of the national movement in Ukraine is the largest threat to the
Commonwealth's continued existence - as all Russian politicians recognise.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian deputy prime minister, said recently that
disintegration of the CIS threatened reform: but disintegration is precisely
what Ukraine wants. The new leaders (many of whom were part of the old) are
striving to build a modern nation state. There can be no doubt about the
depth of the commitment of the new powers to this task, nor about the
concomitant and apparently deepening distaste for the Russians, perceived
increasingly as imperialists (ironically, as they begin the painful process
of trying to cease to act like imperialists).
The Ukrainian flag flies everywhere: symbols are being designed, including
notes for a new currency - the hryvnia - printed in Canada. Meetings begin
with the singing of a Ukrainian hymn. In west Ukraine, which is more
nationally minded because of its more uniformly Ukrainian population and
proximity to central Europe, the Central (Moscow) TV is blocked. Passages
from once-banned Ukrainian historians are read on the radio during the
breakfast show. Early next month, Ukrainian jurists and scholars will meet
with foreign advisers in Prague to finalise the Ukrainian constitution.
No Ukrainian politician sees the CIS as more than a temporary garment, to be
discarded as soon as possible. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president
and a man deeply disliked in Russia, told foreign journalists last week that
he adhered to the agreements of the CIS that underscored the full
independence of its members. In a separate interview, Professor Mykola
Mykhailchenko, his chief political adviser, was less guarded, saying that
the next summit of the CIS on March 20 in Kiev might be its last; that the
Ukrainian leadership had 'very little optimism' about its future and that
'the member states will soon all have their own armies because they all have
their own territorial problems'.
Ukraine wants its own armed forces for the most basic of all military
reasons: to protect the integrity of the state. Any delay in the division of
forces is regarded as intolerable, because it prolongs the existence on its
territory of a foreign army - a concept that the Russian-dominated CIS
military, accustomed to seeing the Union as their recruiting ground and
defensive space, simply refuses to grasp.
The division of the Black Sea fleet, a leading cause of conflict between the
two states, illustrates this. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has
described the fleet as Russian; Marshal Shaposhnikov, tactfully correcting
the president in an interview in Paris, described it as a CIS force.
Either way, the Ukrainians see it as a non-Ukrainian navy occupying
Ukrainian ports in the Crimea. Mr Kravchuk said last week a division must be
made, with his own preference being for one third of it to be assigned to
Ukraine. The protest that Marshal Shaposhnikov had distorted the Ukrainian
position was because he had accused Ukraine of wishing to take over the
entire navy.
In this struggle, Russian politicians have had no inhibition about playing
the 'Crimean card': demanding that the Ukrainian parliament review the
status of Crimea, an area conquered by Russia, still dominated by Russians
and arbitrarily switched from Russian to Ukrainian possession in 1954 by Mr
Nikita Kruschev, the former first secretary of the Ukrainian Communist
Party. man of the important inter-republican committee of the Russian
parliament, said in a recent interview that the 1990 agreement between the
two states to respect each other's borders was no longer valid because it
was signed when both were members of a third state, the Soviet Union.
So firm is the Ukrainians' wish to be wholly independent that they have
renounced all nuclear weapons. The architect of this decision, Professor
Volodymyr Vasylenko, an adviser on the constitution, said that 'you cannot
have a nuclear force which is not tied to the Russian nuclear force, because
of technology and control systems. By being a nuclear power we would not
have full independence. It was this argument which persuaded the
government'.
To these territorial tensions must be added political and economic disputes.
Ukraine wants to 'join Europe' as rapidly as possible (in part to provide
for protection against border wars), and to conduct its own economic reform.
In both cases, it feels crowded out by Russia. Mr Ivan Plyushch, the head of
the Ukrainian parliament, last week accused Russia of blocking the Ukrainian
path to the Council of Europe and ultimately to the European Community by
presuming to negotiate for the CIS as a whole. Mr Oleksander Savchenko,
deputy chairman of the Ukrainian National Bank, said that Russia was
sabotaging the Ukrainian economy through non delivery of goods, refusing to
supply enough roubles (printed by the Russian Central Bank), and conducting
reform without regard to Ukraine's interests.
The suspicion and dislike operates at every level - including that of the
radical parliamentarians, who in the past had forged a comradeship with
their counterparts in Russia. Now, says Ms Laryssa Skrylyk, a deputy from
Kiev, 'the democrats are no different: they have the same imperial thinking
as the other Russians'.
These judgments are unfair: but fairness is not now the point. National
imperatives are influencing all the actors on the Ukrainian political stage,
forcing them to label as 'western propaganda' - as Professor Vasylenko has
done - the foreign press reports that cast doubt on the Ukrainian
nationalist case. Perversely, it causes them to close round the figure of
their president - perversely, because Mr Kravchuk was a lifelong and senior
functionary of the party whom all (including he) now blame for Ukraine's
oppression. Yet to raise this issue is again to be accused of 'western
propaganda'.
Mr Kravchuk enjoys wide support which, alarmingly, led him to say last week
that opposition to him was impossible, because he and all political parties
were for Ukrainian independence. What, then, he asked, was there to oppose?
The reasons for his support were put by Mr Levko Lukyanenko, one of
Ukraine's honoured political dissidents, who spent a total of 27 years in
jails and camps for his nationalist activity before being released in 1989.
For him, as for other Ukrainians, Mr Kravchuk's past has ceased to matter:
it is his present policy that matters. Asked if he was bitter to see a
former oppressor in power, he emphatically said 'no'. 'I am glad Kravchuk
has come to the nationalist point of view. If he can continue to work in
this way and achieve independence, I will support him.'
Mr Kravchuk's metamorphosis from chief ideological opponent of the
nationalists - his assignment when they first formed their mass
organisation, Rukh, in 1989 - into their leader was completed last week,
when he opened formal negotiations with the nationalist opposition on the
formation of a coalition cabinet. After months of promises, Mr Kravchuk
seems to be on the verge of replacing his communist comrades, who currently
dominate the inert cabinet, with his erstwhile opponents. Western observers
hope that such a switch will bring long overdue market reforms to Ukraine's
wilting economy.
This is the attempted birth of a nation: a birth that is painful to the
heart of the former 'motherland', Russia. Like any severance between states
in such a relationship - Britain and Ireland, say, or Sweden and Finland -
there is an over-rich diet on both sides of hypocrisies, false charges,
propagandist nonsense and downright lies. But what matters is the process:
and at the end of that process comes separation.

Generals and admirals use them, businessmen with their car phones depend on
them and any future colony on the moon would need them.
Radio waves underpin military, mobile and space communications, and much
besides. But waves assigned to one service cannot be used by others. If they
are, the result is a jumble of confused signals.
This is the central preoccupation of more than 1,000 government delegates
from about 100 countries who are meeting in Torremolinos, Spain, under the
auspices of the United Nations. Their task is to revise an obscure but
important backwater of international law - the radio regulations. These
regulations specify which radio waves can be used for what purposes.
Current regulations - most recently revised in 1979 - have become outdated
because advances in technology have led to a mushrooming in new services
that need radio waves to operate. But those parts of the spectrum which are
the most commercially exploitable are overcrowded. So new services are
competing with each other and with existing users for a scarce resource.
The World Administrative Radio Conference, as the meeting is called, will
set the framework for the whole gamut of radio-based services until 2000.
At the conference, powerful industrial interests are lobbying to influence
decisions on the allocation of frequencies. Much is at stake because of the
huge investment needed to develop new services. High on the agenda are
high-definition television (HDTV), satellite telephones, global radio
programmes and space communications.
Two main considerations will preoccupy the government-led teams: how to back
their domestic industries, and how to cause minimum disruption to existing
users of radio waves. More than 30 European nations have co-ordinated their
conference aims, creating a powerful voting bloc. The US and Japan also have
clear but rival agendas - largely because their industries have different
technological approaches. It is the horse-trading between various national
interests that forms the substance of the month-long conference.
If a deadlock should result, there is a provision for voting on the basis of
one nation, one vote. A compromise seems the likely outcome, partly because
services from different countries need to operate without interfering with
each other.
An agreement is also necessary because only then can there be global
technical standards and economies of scale. If equipment had to be
manufactured to a variety of standards for each national market, costs would
be high.
So far, delegates have agreed to free up frequencies for more radio
programmes with global reach such as the BBC World Service. There is also
broad consensus on making frequencies available for radio programmes to be
beamed by satellite, telephones in aircraft and communications in space.
But there are two particularly contentious issues.
HDTV. The US, Europe and Japan agree that frequencies should be allocated to
HDTV but have proposed various frequencies. The US and Japan would like to
use frequencies which the Europeans are using for fixed telecommunications
links, while Europe wants frequencies occupied in the US by mobile
communications and satellites.
Mobile communications. The US is backing the idea that the next generation
of mobile phones will involve bouncing signals off satellites, a technology
where American companies are pre-eminent. The European nations favour the
more conventional approach of sending radio signals along the earth's
surface - a technology where their companies have expertise.
The European view of the future of mobile communications is still unclear.
One idea in the industry is that it will be simply an evolution of the
current cellular systems - with higher quality and smaller handsets. Some
visionaries, though, say it will combine a telephone, television and
computer on a terminal the size of a wrist-watch.
Even among those who argue that mobile satellite is the right approach,
there are a variety of opinions. The best known plan is being promoted by
Motorola, the US electronics group. It wishes to launch 77 mini-satellites
that would circle the globe at 413 nautical miles above the earth's surface.
The low height would allow customers to have small handsets similar to
cellular phones because less power would be needed to communicate with the
satellite.
An alternative plan by the International Maritime Satellite organisation - a
multinational group owned by 65 telephone companies whose main function is
to provide communication services to ships - involves satellites at a height
of 36,000 kilometres, as well as at a lower orbit. This would allow them to
be stationary above the earth's surface, thus reducing the need for
sophisticated technology to track moving satellites.
In any event, the decisions in Torremolinos will not be the final word on
radio communications. By the time the conference next meets in perhaps
another decade, radio waves will be even more crowded and demands for
frequencies from imaginative new services even more pressing than they are
today.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Arts: City of London Sinfonia 20 Plus - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eccentrically, since this seems to be their 21st season, Richard Hickox and
his City of London Sinfonia are still celebrating their '20th Anniversary
Season'. They still have the T-shirts on sale, which may explain it. The
'Plus', this past weekend, was for a lot of enthusiastically planned
'collective composition' and 'workshops' during the days, with
schoolchildren involved, besides three full-dress concerts later - mostly of
recent British music - with substantial Arts Council support. The whole
event may have been a great tonic for everybody concerned; I heard only the
final concert, and found it slightly dispiriting.
Not because of the Sinfonia's playing; that was generally expert and full of
verve. Two pieces showed off the Sinfonia strings by themselves. The
American John Adams' Shaker Loops is 13 years old, lightly poised between
minimalism and post-minimalism. The fiddle-patterns of Shaker music sizzle
away for 25 minutes like a bright, unambitious exercise, or very superior
Muzak. Though the programme-note made much of the 'loops' - overlapping
melodic cycles of different lengths - it discussed only the original version
for string septet; with the much larger band Hickox used here, the
asymmetries barely registered.
Barry Guy's new After the Rain, inspired by a well-known Max Ernst painting
('Europe after the Rain'), alternated between busy atonal 'refrains' and
more sedate stuff - banal 19th-century chorale (with heartfelt delivery), a
fair imitation of Britten's super-diatonic string-writing in a 'Chanson',
some raw melodramatic effects: it comes to nothing much. Nigel Osborne's
Flute Concerto, a year-and-a-half younger than the slick Adams piece, made a
familiar Osbornian impression: musical ideas of tantalising potential,
developed too laconically and obliquely to make any decisive effect. Duke
Dobing sounded like a committed soloist, and at least looked like one when
the instrumental balance left him all but inaudible.
Peter Wiegold's new Sinfonia Concertante was specifically a fruit of this
weekend, with seven of its eight movements designed for filling-out by solo
players whose parts were partly sketched in 'workshops' earlier, partly
improvised on the spot. A progress from Daybreak ('primitive, unformed') to
Night 2 ('healing power of the dark') was fixed by Wiegold's prior scenario.
The CLS soloists played up bravely, with much imagination; the pre-set
orchestral shell failed, however, to ensure any telling overall shape. Most
of the 'day' ambled jauntily along like the donkey-movement in Grofe's
'Grand Canyon' Suite - remember that? Wiegold does - and the outer sections
achieved no more than film-music Affekt, even looser than the Kitsch
postcard-sequence of Strauss's 'Alpine Symphony'. Surely we ought to applaud
Wiegold's aim of re-enlisting individual flights of fancy into live
'classical' music; but there must be tougher-minded ways of building them
into a continuous half-hour structure.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Arts: Double Take - The 'meaning' of the Hayward Gallery's
new exhibition is buried in the small print
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With exhibitions, as with so many things, it is always as well to read the
small print. Double Take is the name of the South Bank Centre's major spring
exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, London, (until April 20). Collective
Memory &amp; Current Art runs the sub-title. 'Collective Memory is a phrase', so
its three curators tell us in their joint introduction to the catalogue,
'that can mean all or nothing to different people.' Yes; well; hmmm.
They go on: ' . . . The tension between our public and private selves has
become acute. The artists . . . share an equal distrust of the purely
personal and the securely social. They suggest how the infinite raw material
that contributes to forming our experience of the world . . . remains inert
until brought into play in the present. The doubletake . . . implies neither
a style nor content but rather an approach . . . entailing recognition and
reinvestment of significance where it might otherwise be overlooked or taken
for granted.'
What this turns out to mean is: 'Here is a job lot of soi-disant artists
from here and there, all doing their own fashionable thing, and though we
cannot make head or tail of any of it, perhaps you can?'
It is in fact a useful if depressing statement, by inversion and omission,
of what, to the orthodoxies of current curatorial interest and practice, Art
is, or might be. Is there any mention of the unique force and presence of
the fashioned object or contrived surface, that is the work of art? No. What
of the quality of what is done, in the way it is made? Nothing. And what of
the personal experience of the world, that is all we have, but which the
artist strives to render general? Not a thing, for that, as we have just
read, is now distrusted and disavowed. Nothing is to be made any more, and
nothing truly felt.
And instead? 'New art has a history of getting on people's nerves', runs the
guide. 'The artists challenge us by pushing our understanding of the world
around us beyond familiar limits. They manipulate the images, codes and
conventions of the world itself in order to touch our emotions and
intellect, expressing our fears and desires in new ways that can be amusing,
provocative, evocative, disquieting, spellbinding and beautiful. If art does
not have such an effect somewhere along the line, what does it do?'
It is a good last question in spite of itself, though there is little
comfort to be had of the answer inferred before it. The favoured artist is
no more than an entertainer, striking attitudes, making jokes, playing
tricks. The concept is the thing, to which all is response, with the
material given and the performance conventional.
It is the art of the dandy and the mountebank, ironical, detached,
uninvolved, above all, safe. For there is no danger of personal exposure,
other than in the most literal sense in which Jeff Koons chooses to perform
with his wife, an ex-porn film actress - a hard act to follow, but an act
for all that. There is no emotional risk, no vulnerability, no engagement.
Do we see the point: but there is no point. There is no point: then we have
missed the point. Heads they win, tails we lose. Doubletake indeed.
It has to be said that the exhibition has been beautifully laid out and
installed within an internal structure devised by the Italian architect,
Aldo Rossi. And the three curators, Lynne Cook, now of New York, Bice
Curiger from Switzerland, and Greg Hilty from the Hayward itself, have made
a most salutary international choice. As with the recession, our problems
are clearly not reserved to us alone. And so, what are these brave new
things, and who the artists, all 23 of them, who make us look afresh, and
look again?
There is Philip Taaffe (US/Italy) who reworks in paint and collage
decorative motifs from Islamic tiles, for example, or full-scale images of
modern art, notably the works of Bridget Riley. Glenn Ligon (US) shows a
suite of paintings, each worked with lugubrious ineptitude and carrying
ponderously stencilled and mutually contradictory interpretations of dreams.
Andreas Gursky (Germany) takes immaculate colour photographs of general
working interiors or impersonal landscapes - an electronics production line,
a stock exchange, a motorway junction. Katharina Fritsch (Germany) offers a
group of industrially manufactured golden frames, large and plain, with
surfaces no less plain within, red, blue, yellow, green . . .
Narelle Jubelin (Australia) works tiny landscapes, long and thin, in
petit-point and puts them into old frames. Simon Patterson (UK) has revised
the familiar map, or journey planner as we must now learn to call it, of the
London Underground, each line now a category of heros - footballers,
artists, philosophers.
Tim Rollins-&amp;-KOS (US) stick comic-book pages on to large canvasses,
carefully, one by one. Robert Gober's (US) cast legs burst akimbo through
the wall. And Rachel Whiteread (UK) continues with her casts of domestic
objects, mattresses, morgue slabs and the like, leant and folded against the
wall. '(Her) use of rubber to cast objects . . . allows her a greater
flexibility than her earlier use of plaster,' says the guide. I should
imagine it would.
And outside in the great world itself, Stephan Balkenhol (Germany) has a man
on a raft floating on the Thames, and a huge wooden head on London's
Blackfriars Bridge. Jenny Holzer (US) animates the Festival Hall with her
electronic slogans. Boyd Webb (NZ/UK) has a poster on a hoarding at Waterloo
that sums up the whole enterprise with an unforeseen acuity, an elegiac
image of a a half-deflated geographer's globe floating gently away. O brave
new world, that has such people in't.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Arts: More money for the arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Arts Board yesterday announced good news for more than 140,
mainly small, arts organisations in the capital - collectively they are
going to receive grant increases of more than 20 per cent for 1992-93.
However, this is likely to be the last good news many of them get for some
time - two other sources of funding, their local authorities and the London
Boroughs Grants Scheme, seem set to cut subsidies.
The LAB presented a professional front under its new management of Clive
Priestley, chairman, and director Tim Mason. This time next year they could
well be the funding agency for more, and larger, arts organisations, like
the big four London based orchestras, the Royal Court Theatre, the
Whitechapel Gallery, etc, doubling its budget to over Pounds 20m. So it is
anxious to be reassuring in its policy.
Big gainers yesterday were the Almeida in Islington which received a 60 per
cent uplift to Pounds 398,000, and the Orange Tree in Richmond, which gets
45 per cent more at Pounds 133,226. In dance, both The Place and Chisenhale
were given 26 per cent more while the Battersea Arts Centre gains 40.3 per
cent.
An unusual initiative was the award of substantially more money to Circus
Space which is developing human physical skills to make good the absence of
animals in contemporary circus.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Arts: Parsifal - Houston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most adventurous of the big US opera companies, Houston Grand Opera, is
in a period of forced restraint. Recessionary hard times have been made
harder by the financial shortfall (at least Dollars 500,000 - Pounds 285,700
 -according to rumour) of last May's Mozart festival. One 1991-92 production
has already been cancelled; the number of works to be performed next season
is set to shrink from 12 to seven.
Plainly, this goes against company grain, and that of its general director
David Gockley, a man who has gained the city its worldwide reputation as a
place where artistic risk pays off handsomely. The way he prefers to do
things can be evidenced from such past Houston splashes as the 1989 British
Opera Festival, which included the premiere of Tippett's New Year, and this
month from a boldly out-of-the-ordinary repertory mixture.
Parsifal, staged by the celebrated modern-theatre director Robert Wilson (in
a production first given at the Hamburg Staatsoper last year), has just
completed its run in the company's big theatre; while Desert of Roses, a new
Beauty and the Beast opera by the American avant-garde composer Robert
Moran, alternates in the smaller with Gretry's 1771 version of the same
fable, Zemire et Azor, in a pop updating. (I shall review these two
'Beauties' in a second Houston report.)
The combination of Wagner and Wilson has caused an enormous nationwide stir
and, locally, a gratifying shortage of tickets. The cool,
abstract-sculptural Wilson style, made internationally famous by (among
other things) Deafman Glance, Einstein on the Beach, and the CIVIL warS, has
recently been confronted with 'classic' opera - Gluck's Alceste in Chicago,
The Magic Flute in Paris, Lohengrin in Zurich (on which Andrew Clark
reported on this page).
But Parsifal, most complex and musically rarefied of all great operas,
presented Wilson with his largest challenge so far. He has faced it in a
manner at once raptly serious, elevated, and unfailingly elegant to behold.
The worlds of Kabuki and Noh, Balanchine (a confessed Wilson influence), the
early Surrealists, and the American visual Minimalists meet in his
production, for which Wilson himself designed the set and (with Jennifer
Tipton) the lighting, and Frida Parmeggiani the costumes.
Needless to say, simple representation of the Parsifal locations - forest
clearing, castle hall, magic garden, flowery meadow - finds no part in it.
Rather, the stage becomes a 'Parsifal space', a bare canvas on which
selected images are graved while light intensities of magically clean focus
slowly grow and fade and singer-actors undertake a carefully choreographed
set of motions complete with ritualised hand- and body-language.
Sometimes the mise-en-scene 'fits' with the narrative events: a vast
wing-shape sailing down across the back-screen after the swan's death; an
illuminated white flying saucer with a hole, like a gigantic Polo mint,
landing stage-centre during the Grail rites. Sometimes the connection proves
elusive, and the images, never less than ravishing, stay locked within
Wilson's inner Parsifal vision.
Because it is all so seamlessly made, so graceful in physical unfolding, the
'what does it mean?' puzzle never becomes an irritant; but the decision to
avoid entirely the big gestures of Wagner's drama proves more problematic.
For Wilson those 'klutzy knights walking around with this cup' are
'ridiculous, disturbing, all wrong'; the chorus is banished to the theatre's
highest balcony, and there is no cup - and later no kiss, no anointing, no
dove. The eschewing of all facial expression provided an odd counterpoint to
the shrieks of Kundry, the agonies of Amfortas, the pained growth to wisdom
of Parsifal. (Rather than translating snatches of the German text that might
in some way contradict the staging, the Houston surtitling machine simply
left them out.)
For all its visual wonders I found this Parsifal a frustrating experience.
For many it has allowed a liberation of the drama from the banalities - and,
indeed, the worrying aspects - of its libretto surface. For me it was, in
the end, a cop-out. The many meanings of Parsifal are not, I think, released
by the banishment of those narrative aspects, religious and political,
inconvenient to the late-20th-century Zeitgeist. Certainly, the vibrant
emotional drama that is its richest and most enduring achievement was
stunted in this sexlessly chic slow-motion reading of the piece.
But a less enervated account of the score might well have redressed the
balance. The conductor was Christoph Eschenbach, chief of the Houston
Symphony, a recent HGO regular, and a passionate Wilson devotee; he
certainly 'went along with' the production, in a way that highlighted its
shortage of red blood-cells. It was strange to hear so well-played and sung
a Parsifal so rhythmically slack-muscled, so lacking in strong contours - at
once 'beautiful' and debilitatingly bland.
The cast was distinguished: Dunja Vejzovic (Kundry), Monte Pederson
(Amfortas), Harry Peeters (Gurnemanz), Richard Paul Fink (Klingsor), and
John Keyes (the young American Heldentenor who recently sang Siegmund for
Scottish Opera) in the title role. The impression of smooth musicality was
admirably uniform. But from the singing - as, indeed, from the whole
experience - a whole universe of Wagnerian musical vitality appeared to be
absent.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to find a PC when you
want one - Paul Taylor cuts through the jargon and offers advice on buying a
personal computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is more than a decade since the first IBM PCs appeared on desktops, but
according to recent surveys, many businessmen and women are still
uncomfortable with PC technology.
Help is usually at hand in a large organisation, either from the whiz-kids
in the information department - assuming they can be torn away from the
latest technical journal - or from less intimidated colleagues.
But the small business computer user, or potential user, must seek other
solutions.
The first issues to confront the uninitiated are often the basic questions -
do I need a computer and what can it do for me?
Most computer advertisers and salesmen would like potential customers to
believe that life without a PC is barely worth living and that a PC on the
end of a desk can do just about everything.
In reality many basic office functions, such as keeping a diary or simple
bookkeeping, are more easily and efficiently achieved with paper, pen and
calculator.
Basic data, like sales figures or customer addresses, do not miraculously
appear in a computer's electronic brain.
They have to be put there, usually via the keyboard.
What computers, or rather the software programs that run on them, are
particularly good at, is organising and manipulating information, and
performing complex or repetitive tasks or calculations.
Examples include combining a mailing list of customers compiled on a
database program and a letter written on a word-processing program to send
out details of a special offer.
They are also good at examining what happens to profits if suppliers
increase prices; or calculating tax, national insurance contributions and
pay for employees each week, using a spreadsheet programme.
By far the most common use of PCs is for accounting. A recent survey found
that more than half the small companies with a computer had bought it for
this purpose.
The other main use is as a word-processor, although this may mean that the
machine ends up being little more than a glorified typewriter.
But if you still think you need a computer, the next question is which one?
A quick glance through any of the dozen-plus computer magazines on sale in
local newsagents is enough to deter all but the most determined.
Similarly a visit to a High Street electrical shop will probably only
confuse - most of the machines likely to be on display are underpowered and
overpriced - and the shop assistant is most unlikely to be of any help.
There are, however, other ways to go about buying a computer.
Specialist computer stores are sometimes willing to provide advice, unless
they are of the pile-them-high-sell-them-fast variety.
However, many potential customers also find computer stores intimidating -
after all, who wants to show off their ignorance to a youth half their age?
For those with lots of money to spend, there are computer consultants who
will advise on purchase, find and set up the equipment, load the software
and teach the customer how to use the new toy.
But such advice does not come cheap. A morning's training on a new
accounting package, for example, can cost several hundred pounds.
The only real alternative is often self-help, which need not be terrifying.
In many of the computer magazines there are sections designed specifically
for the novice.
For example, What Micro magazine has a section called 'How to buy' while
Computer Shopper has a buyer's glossary and a section dealing with buying
equipment each month. This has also been put together in a useful Pounds
2.95 book called PC Buying Questions.
Other books for learners include the PC Novice's Handbook - which includes
jargon-busting sections on hardware and software and a chapter on shopping -
the PC Crash Course and Survival Guide, and What to do when a MICRO lands on
your desk.
The standard advice on buying a computer used to be to decide on the
software first. This is less important these days because the IBM-compatible
standard is nearly all-pervasive - the honourable exception being the
user-friendly Apple Macintosh computer family.
Most PC's have become interchangeable machines which will run most of the
serious business software - and the growing number of PC games too.
However it is important to remember that the new software packages require
some pretty heavy duty hardware.
Thus a basic business machine today would be an IBM-compatible based on
Intel's 80386 processor chip with at least 2-Megabytes of Ram (random access
memory), a 40Mb hard disk, a VGA colour screen, mouse pointing device and
Windows, Microsoft's hugely successful operating environment which has sold
9m copies worldwide.
Such a machine has more power than most traditional mainframe computers.
But fortunately computer prices are continuing to tumble.
For example, Dell which pioneered direct sales in the UK, sells its 325P
machine with colour monitor and a 50Mb hard disk for Pounds 1,149 (excluding
VAT).
These days the direct sales channel is well established and most direct sale
computer manufactures provide an on-site maintenance contract for a
reasonable fee and lifetime telephone support - for all those problems,
large and small, that the manual does not answer.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Throwing the book at
directors - Why failure to file accounts can lead to a criminal conviction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEGARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1987, when Judy Dean and her husband Peter set up a company and made Judy
a director, they had no idea that four years later she would end up with a
criminal record.
Yet last December, Judy Dean (not her real name) was convicted under the
Companies Act of failing to file annual returns or accounts on time.
In an average month, Companies House prosecutes about 160 company directors.
In 1991 alone, 3,356 directors of 2,208 companies were prosecuted for
failing to file annual returns and 1,864 directors from 1,284 companies were
prosecuted for failing to file annual accounts. If convicted, they get a
criminal record.
The duty to submit 'certain basic information about a company's structure
and finances' is the quid pro quo for being able to incorporate a limited
company and is the personal responsibility of the company's directors.
Private limited companies have to submit the information within 10 months of
the end of the financial year; plcs have seven months in which to do it.
But it is not the personal responsibility which worries owners of small
businesses and those, like Dean, who fall foul of the system. They are
concerned that the government appears determined to make their mistakes a
criminal offence.
'There seems to be a move among civil servants to criminalise these
offences,' says Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses,
which has published a report* on the penalties facing company directors.
'Everyone recognises that fraud is wrong, but even negligent, honest
mistakes are now seen as serious misdeeds.'
Alambritis says the FSB has been warning its members for some time that
Companies House was taking a tougher stance towards people who file accounts
late. 'Companies House is no longer the lax organisation it was in the
1970s. It's now a government agency and is computerised and very
aggressive.'
Dean was well aware of her responsibilities as a company director, but says
that in her case, the company for which she was fined did not even trade for
a full year.
It was set up to enable her to work flexible hours so she could also care
for her sick husband. But as he became seriously ill, she was forced to give
up work to look after him.
But as he started to recover, Dean found a full-time job in July 1988 . She
thought no more about the now-defunct company until she received a black
bill, followed by a red one, for Pounds 1,000, for failing to file her
annual return and accounts.
She admits that, preoccupied with her husband, working full-time and running
a home, she did not get round to sorting out the bill. She says she
telephoned Companies House to explain her circumstances and was told this
would be taken into consideration.
Dean maintains she did not know her case was to be heard by Cardiff
magistrates last December, or that she could have attended to give her side
of the story.
Officials at Companies House are convinced that late filers receive enough
warning. 'We write to them before the accounts are due, reminding them, and
then after that, we have a set procedure. I can't reveal it because it's
like paying your gas bill. If you thought you could get away with it until
the last minute you would,' said one official. Prosecution was 'a last
resort'.
At present, convicted directors can be fined up to Pounds 2,000 for each
late document, but a new scale of penalties is being introduced. From July
1, directors filing late accounts will receive an automatic fine of up to
Pounds 5,000 for a public company and Pounds 1,000 for a private company.
They will also get a criminal record if convicted.
Says Stephen Alambritis: 'There's a balance to be struck between encouraging
good commercial activity and clamping down on fraudsters. Companies House
seems to be sending out a wide net that catches a number of people, but
discourages some from trading altogether.'

FT  25 FEB 92 / Technology: Great eye sets sights sky high - A European
project to build the world's most powerful telescope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the year 2000 the clearest view of distant galaxies in the universe
will come from a European supertelescope in Chile's Atacama desert.
Eight countries - Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden,
Denmark, Italy and Switzerland - are working together at the European
Southern Observatory (ESO) to try to surpass the achievements of the US
Hubble Space Telescope. And they hope to do this for a fraction of Hubble's
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) cost.
ESO's showcase is the Very Large Telescope (VLT) project. By 1999 four large
telescopes will work in unison to capture the equivalent light of a single
16-metre instrument. The VLT will be the world's most powerful telescope,
nearly three times larger than any operating today. This great eye is
expected to cost DM450m (Pounds 156m).
The VLT's progress is creating as much excitement among astronomers as the
launch of the Hubble nearly two years ago. The Hubble space telescope,
orbiting 300 miles above the Earth's atmosphere, was expected to reveal
uncharted expanses of the universe by 'seeing' seven times deeper into space
than observatories on Earth.
However, Hubble's mission has been partially crippled by microscopic
scratches on the surface of its 2.4-metre mirror. The images being relayed
back to Earth have failed to live up to their revolutionary promise.
Hubble's misfortunes have rekindled interest in a new generation of
Earth-bound telescopes and sharpened the rivalry between US and European
astronomers.
The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy has obtained US
government backing for an eight-metre telescope in Hawaii. Two more 10-metre
telescopes in Hawaii are being financed by the private Keck Foundation.
The VLT, however, remains in a class of its own. It will allow astronomers
to explore three quarters of the universe and study galaxies perhaps as far
as 14bn light years away. The VLT will also be powerful enough to penetrate
the innermost regions of active galaxies, which may harbour black holes at
their centres. As a result astrophysicists will learn more about the
chemical composition of stars and interstellar clouds.
After gathering meteorological data for six years, ESO decided that Cerro
Paranal, 800km north of its existing 14-telescope observatory in La Silla,
was probably the best site in the world for astronomical work. Cerro Paranal
boasts perfect photometric nights for 60 per cent of the year and a very
still atmosphere. Astronomers are looking forward to unexpected discoveries.
'The universe has far more imagination than we have,' says Christoffel
Waelkens, a visiting Belgian astronomer.
The greatest technological challenge for scientists working on the VLT
project will be to cast four identical single-blank mirrors, each 8.2 metres
in diameter. Until recently this was thought to be impossible, because very
large mirrors buckle under their own weight.
But Schott Glaswerke in Germany has already cast the first 8.2-metre mirror
by pouring molten glass ceramic into a rotating concave mould. The spinning
action produced a much thinner and lighter mirror of greater width -
clearing a technological barrier that had limited astronomy for half a
century.
It is not the VLT's size that is the envy of US astronomers, but its
revolutionary image-focusing capability, called 'adaptive optics'. In this
state-of-the-art technology, 200 electronic arms gently push and pull the
telescope's mirror to eliminate the 'twinkling' of stars caused by
atmospheric turbulence. By bringing the fuzzy images into focus, the picture
quality is almost as sharp as if taken from space.
The first telescope to use 'adaptive optics' was inaugurated at La Silla in
1989. It is now capturing images that are several times sharper than those
obtained by telescopes of conventional design. 'From an optical point of
view, we have built the best telescope in the world today,' says Daniel
Hofstadt, La Silla's technical manager.
Hofstadt, however, does not see the VLT project or adaptive optics replacing
the need for telescopes in space. Terrestrial observatories, he explains,
cannot detect faint stars that emit ultraviolet light because this is
blotted out by the Earth's protective ozone layer. 'The VLT and the Hubble
will complement each other,' he says.

FT  25 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Bank must pay compound interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLDEN MED
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst:
February 18 1992
INTEREST DUE to the owners of money retained by a bank in breach of its
fiduciary duty as constructive trustee after the condition on which it was
deposited has failed, is compounded with yearly rests, in that in the
commercial circumstances the bank is presumed to have made the most
beneficial use of the money in its investment business, to earn compound,
not simple, interest.
Mr Justice Hirst so held when giving judgment for the plaintiffs, Guardian
Ocean Cargoes Ltd and others, on a claim for compound interest in an action
for the return of monies deposited conditionally with the defendant bank,
Banco do Brasil, in negotiations to refinance the building of Golden Med.
HIS LORDSHIP said that in the action he gave judgment for Dollars 600,000 in
the plaintiffs' favour on February 14 1991, and adjourned questions relating
to interest.
The Dollars 600,000 comprised three payments of Dollars 200,000 made by the
plaintiffs to the bank as an earnest of their sincerity in a proposed
refinancing deal for a shipbuilder's contract.
Originally the contract was between a Brazilian shipbuilding yard and a
Danish ship-owning group for construction of Golden Med.
The transaction had been financed by the bank. The Danish company ran into
financial difficulties. The plaintiffs, members of a Greek shipping group,
were anxious to take over the contract.
The court found that the Dollars 600,000 was deposited by the plaintiffs
with the bank conditionally, as a token of genuine intent for future use in
the intended acquisition of the vessel, and was to be applied for that
purpose only if the refinancing negotiations were successful.
In other words, the remittances were conditional on conclusion of a
re-financing deal.
The negotiations, having nearly come to a successful conclusion in 1981,
dragged on for five years until November 1986, when they broke down.
The plaintiffs then demanded return of the Dollars 600,000, but the bank
refused to pay.
The money was held intact by the bank in an account with a New York bank
from 1981 to 1986, and beyond.
Due to recent radical re-organisation following a change of government in
Brazil, the bank had been unable to ascertain, despite strenuous efforts,
what rate of interest had accrued to it from that deposit.
In January 1987, the plaintiffs issued the present proceedings, claiming
return of the Dollars 600,000 on the footing that consideration for the
payment had wholly failed; or alternatively on the basis of a constructive
trust in their favour.
The bank's case was that the payments were voluntary and unconditional, and
were therefore irrecoverable.
The court had ruled on both issues in the plaintiffs' favour.
It was common ground that the plaintiffs were entitled to statutory interest
under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981, which empowered the court
to include simple interest in the judgment sum at such rate as it thought
fit, on all or part of the debt or damages in respect of which judgment was
given, for all or part of the period between the date when the cause of
action arose and date of judgment.
The plaintiffs also sought an award of compound interest under the court's
equitable jurisdiction, having regard to the bank's breach of fiduciary
duty, from November 1986 to date of judgment.
It was common ground that the court had jurisdiction in an appropriate case
to award compound interest in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction.
Miss Gloster for the bank submitted that the power should only be exercised
in exceptional circumstances, such as where the defendant had mis-applied
trust money to his own profit. She said the normal basis was simple
interest.
Mr Pickering for the plaintiffs submitted that there was no such limitation,
and that the proper basis of the award depended on the commercial
circumstances which, in the case of a bank defendant, normally warranted
compound interest.
In Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2) (1975) QB 373,388, in which Mr Wallersteiner
was guilty of serious misfeasance in breach of fiduciary duty, Lord Denning
MR said that in equity interest was 'never awarded by way of punishment'. He
said it was awarded where money was misused by anyone in a fiduciary
position who had misapplied the money and made use of it for his own
benefit.
As to whether it should be simple or compound interest, he said on general
principles it should be presumed that the company (had it not been deprived
of the money) would have made the most beneficial use open to it.
Alternatively, he said, 'it should be presumed that the wrongdoer made the
most beneficial use of it. But whichever it is, in order to give adequate
compensation, the money should be replaced at interest with yearly rests,
that is, compound interest'.
In O'Sullivan v Management Agency (1985) QB 428,461, a manager was in breach
of fiduciary duty towards an entertainer under his management. Lord Justice
Dunn distinguished Wallersteiner as concerning a financier who used the
money he obtained in his operations.
He said 'in those circumstances it was presumed that the money was worth to
him the equivalent of compound interest at commercial rates with yearly
rests. In the present case, accepting that the money was used by the
defendants for their business purposes, part of it must have been used for
the benefit of O'Sullivan himself'.
He awarded simple interest.
Miss Gloster's submission that compound interest was only to be awarded in
exceptional cases where the defendant was guilty of serious misconduct, was
not accepted.
The authorities made it clear that the award of compound interest was in no
way punitive, but was related to the commercial circumstances.
Thus compound interest would be inappropriate in the case of a solicitor
trustee who was not engaged in an investment business (see Burdick v Garrick
(1869-1970) Ch App 233.
Conversely, where a trustee was engaged in investment, as in Wallersteiner,
it was to be presumed that he would invest the money in his trade or
business using it in effect as part of his working capital.
Miss Gloster strongly relied on O'Sullivan, and submitted that the court
should adopt the same approach and award only simple interest.
However, an important factor in the decision in that case was that there was
a joint enterprise between the manager and the entertainer; and in any event
the manager was not engaged in investment business.
The present case was comparable with Wallersteiner, apart from the
irrelevant distinction that here there was nothing seriously culpable in the
bank's conduct.
The bank, like Mr Wallersteiner, was essentially engaged in investment
business, and must be presumed to have used its money for normal banking
purposes as part of its working capital, and thus to have been in a position
to earn compound interest.
It followed that compound interest was the appropriate basis.
The evidence was that in New York, where the bank held the Dollars 600,000,
it would have been able to earn the New York prime rate plus 1 per cent.
That was accepted. It would not be appropriate to award the lower New York
Certificate of Deposit rate.
The evidence also was that in New York the rests for compounding interest
would be three-monthly.
The court preferred, in the exercise of its discretion, to adhere strictly
to the Wallersteiner formula, and award yearly rests, which in the
circumstances it considered fair.
Compound interest was ordered at 1 per cent over the New York prime rate
applicable from time to time with yearly rests for the period November 1986
to date of judgment.
If those conclusions were wrong, on the statutory basis the appropriate
award would be simple interest at three months New York Certificate of
Deposit rates applicable from time to time.
The area of dispute was the date at which the cause of action arose.
Mr Pickering submitted it arose on payment in 1981. Miss Gloster submitted
it arose when the refinancing negotiations broke down and the plaintiffs
requested repayment.
To award statutory interest running from any earlier date than November 1986
would not have been just, seeing that throughout that period the bank was
holding the money entirely in accordance with the condition on which it had
been deposited.
For the bank: Elizabeth Gloster QC and George Leggatt (Clifford Chance).
For the plaintiffs: Murray Pickering QC and Elizabeth Birch (Swinnerton
Ashley-Claydon &amp; Co).

FT  25 FEB 92 / Technology: Robots pick up the call - Peggy Hollinger speaks
to a computerised telephone operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most telephone operators who work for Colorgraphic, the Leicester-based
direct marketing services group, are devoid of personality, never get sick
or take days off. Nick Winks, chief executive, wants to keep it that way.
Winks is speaking of his robot operators, which are 60 times more productive
than humans. The speech interactive system recently introduced at the
company's Decisions Voice Response subsidiary, based in Bristol, can handle
up to 120,000 calls a day compared with 2,000 taken by a staff of 16 humans.
Speech interactive is the simple term for a system which recognises letters,
numbers and words as spoken by a caller. The computer then matches
combinations of words, letters and/or numbers to a database which provides
information to be translated back into a voice response.
The commercial use of speech interactive systems is gaining ground in the UK
as consumers lose their inhibitions about talking to computers and as the
direct marketing industry matures.
Until recently, most computer voice systems had been the preserve of
business-to-business transactions, says Jeff Williams of Datapoint, which
designs telemarketing software. However, the success of the 24-hour
telephone bank, First Direct - although not a speech interactive system -
has shown that the consumer-to-computer market is waiting to be tapped.
The biggest challenge to telemarketing in recent years has been volume. With
90 per cent of the response to a television advertisement, for example,
coming in within 15 minutes of the broadcast, it is almost impossible to
staff a switchboard at a viable cost. So the answer has been to advertise at
unsocial hours - when most of your potential audience will be asleep.
Yet computer-operated marketing can solve that problem. Everything from
financial dealing to booking holidays could be organised by computer, say
telemarketing enthusiasts.
In Colorgraphic's case, the computer is used to devise packages for clients,
including a car insurance quotation system and charity fundraising. Winks
says his software is at least 12 months ahead of anything used in the UK. He
claims it is even more advanced than anything used in the US, as most
systems there are based on the touchtone phone rather than the speech
interactive method.
What makes the Colorgraphic system unique is its ability to recognise almost
any accent, ask questions, interpret the answers, provide a customer profile
within seconds, and even make an appointment to call back if the lines are
too busy.
Colorgraphic, which handles the calls for client telephone campaigns, can
also gain access to several outside databases at the same time. 'That's
where Colorgraphic has really scored,' says Williams. 'It has written a
sophisticated software package.'
For example, one of Colorgraphic's clients is a leading UK insurer. Within
minutes callers can receive a quote for car insurance by ringing the
Colorgraphic computers which dip into the insurer's own database for the
criteria to compile the quote. The program is due to be launched in the
spring. The cost for such an exercise can be a low as Pounds 2.15, compared
with Pounds 6 using a live operator.
Other services include house insurance quotes, motor advertising campaigns
where a caller can be referred to the nearest dealer, and stock ordering for
retailers where the computer checks credit worthiness, alerts the warehouse
and issues a delivery note.
If the system is unsure of what it has heard, it is able to flag the call
for a human 'verifier' who replays the tape and types in the correct words.
At any stage the system can divert to a live operator if it, or the caller,
chooses.
Developing the system cost Pounds 1m. To leap the accent hurdle, charities
around the country were offered Pounds 1 per phone call to gather a sample
of 500 different accents for each letter of the alphabet and the numbers
zero to nine.
Now Colorgraphic hopes to draw in advertisers and is working on custom-made
software to meet their needs. For advertisers, the benefits of any such
system are in the immediate response: 'We are looking to turn the operation
round, from the TV campaign to the letter in the post, in a two-hour
window,' says Colin Bond, Colorgraphic's business development director.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Hidden costs in the
superstore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the computing superstore concept catch on in the UK as it has in the
US? Many have their doubts but certainly the UK's first superstore, PC World
in Croydon, South London, seems set to spawn a host of imitators selling
everything from mice to monitors, processors to packaged software.
In the US, superstores are already big, if not necessarily profitable,
businesses. CompUSA claims to be the leading operator of large computer
superstores there. It opened its first superstore in Dallas in 1985 after
some years of selling to corporate and retail customers through more
conventional methods. Now it operates some 20 superstores across the
country. Last year the value of goods sold in its stores ranged from Dollars
22m (Pounds 12.50m) to Dollars 80m.
Superstores represent exactly the opposite of everything the computer
industry has tried to impress on its customers over the years.
Computers are supposed to represent the ultimate in high-technology yet the
superstores pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap like refrigerators and washing
machines.
Service and support is the lifeblood of most computing operations, but at
the kind of profit margins superstores are prepared to consider, service has
to be, at the most, perfunctory. If you know what you want you will get it;
if not, help may be difficult to come by.
There is an inescapable logic behind the success of the superstores. The
price of personal computers has been tumbling in inverse relation to the
amount of innovation in the product. Little differentiates one IBM personal
computer from another these days. The microprocessor chip is the same. The
operating system is the same. Much of the accessory circuitry is the same.
It seems that personal computer manufacturers have become part of the
distribution system for Intel microprocessors, Microsoft operating systems
and Japanese memories. The superstores are simply the volume end of the
distribution process, prepared to survive on minute margins.
CompUSA, for example, says it offers more than 5,000 items in its stores at
prices up to 80 per cent below manufacturer's retail prices.
But its results bear out the delicacy of its balancing act. In 1989 it made
Dollars 1.2m pretax profits on sales of Dollars 137m; in 1990, pretax
profits were Dollars 1.5m on sales of Dollars 300m. Last year, it lost
Dollars 9.7m on sales of Dollars 543m.
In its profitable years, its operating income was between 1 and 2 per cent
of sales. It is therefore no surprise that its catalogue lists a galaxy of
cut-price goodies. An Epson 386SX Plus computer for example for Dollars
1,099 or a Dell System 320SX for Dollars 1,500.
But visitors from the UK looking for bargains were struck recently by how
little real difference there was in the price of systems in the superstores
and in the UK. US superstore prices look cheap, but there are often catches.
A computer which looks a good buy comes without a monitor. Adding a monitor
not only pushes up the price but raises the risk that the power supply for
the screen will be incompatible with voltages in the UK.
Issues such as compatibility of power supplies have long been a factor
behind the apparent lack of harmony between computer prices in the US and
UK. UK prices have often come out twice as high as those in the US.
The evidence of the superstores suggests that at the lower end, at least,
the gap is narrowing if not already closed. The question remains open
whether UK dealers can offer US prices and survive on US profit margins.
Customers might be happier paying higher prices for guaranteed service and a
financially secure supplier.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Waldegrave hints at competition for care cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE possibility of the government extending the concept of local authorities
competing for funds to community care was yesterday suggested by Mr William
Waldegrave, health secretary.
Mr Waldegrave said that the City Challenge approach, under which local
authorities compete for money to finance urban renewal, might help stimulate
councils in their new community care responsibilities.
With the health service reforms introduced, ministers are giving increasing
attention to the second half of the National Health Service and Community
Care Act. This involves changes next year in the care of elderly and
handicapped people in the community.
Local authorities will be responsible for co-ordinating the new
arrangements. Councils around the country are at varying stages of readiness
for the changes.
Mr Waldegrave told the conference there was wide evidence that incentives
built into the health reforms were already releasing pressures to produce
better value for money. Managers were attempting to plan ahead prudently and
avoid the kind of stop-go policies which had made patients subservient to
organisational needs in the past.
Labour said last week that it would abolish the reforms if elected, but Mr
Waldegrave said the changes were gaining momentum and 'a reversion to the
situation prevailing before the reforms is unthinkable'.

FT  25 FEB 92 / World Trade News (FT Conference): Asia-Pacific region
prepares for new jet take-off - Airbus and Boeing are seeking to attract
Japanese partners for their jumbo projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE Asia-Pacific airlines are expected to provide the main market for the
development of a new generation of ultra-large commercial aircraft by the
turn of the century.
Senior executives of both the European Airbus consortium and the US Boeing
company yesterday told a Financial Times conference on Asia-Pacific aviation
that they were already studying the development of new 600-seat jumbo
aircraft with potential airline customers. Both companies were also seeking
to attract Japanese aerospace companies as partners in their proposed new
jumbo aircraft projects.
Mr Adam Brown, Airbus planning director, said the consortium expected the
market for a 600-seat ultra-large aircraft to be highly concentrated, with
60 per cent of the new jumbos being needed by only nine airlines worldwide.
Of these, five came from the Asia-Pacific region, which is expected to
continue showing vigorous growth in air transport during the next 10 years.
The five Asian carriers were Japan Air Lines, All Nippon Airways, Cathay
Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Korean Airways. The four others were British
Airways, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and Iberia.
Airbus expects the development of a 600-seat aircraft to cost about Dollars
6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) and is forecasting an overall demand for 700 ultra-large
airliners, with the first entering service around 2002. 'I believe that the
design and development of this giant aircraft represents the next great
challenge for commercial aviation,' Mr Brown said. 'It could offer an
extraordinary opportunity for the manufacturing industry in the Asia-Pacific
region.'
He has already paid two visits to Japan to sound out possible interest on
the part of Japanese manufacturers to become partners with Airbus in
developing the new jumbo.
The three big Japanese aerospace companies, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji
Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, are currently tied to
Boeing in collaborating in the 100-to-400-seat market. But they would have
the opportunity to co-operate with Airbus in the new 600-seat market.
Mr Brown suggested the Japanese companies could find a partnership with
Airbus on the development of a new jumbo more attractive than continuing
collaboration with Boeing, which has been reluctant to co-operate on core
technologies and know-how. 'I raise the question as to how much longer
Boeing can hope with such an approach to satisfy the legitimate aspirations
of the dynamic developing nations in the Asia-Pacific region,' he said.
He conceded, however, that Japan remained nervous of abandoning its
traditional US partner. 'The question is whether they are psychologically
ready,' Mr Brown said.
Boeing is also talking with airlines about the feasibility of a super jumbo
and has formed a large Airplane Unit at its Seattle headquarters to study
the project. Mr Richard Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, said
the company was looking at three alternatives for developing an ultra-large
aircraft. This included a stretched version of the Boeing 747-400; the
extension of the 747's upper deck over the entire length of the aircraft's
fuselage; and a completely new aircraft with a double-deck fuselage.
Boeing is also considering developing a new extra-large aircraft with a
folding wing tip to enable the aircraft to use existing 747 terminal gates
at airports. The manufacturer is already offering a version of its new 777
twin-engine widebody airliner with folding wing tips, although no airline
has yet opted for this.
Mr Albrecht acknowledged it was too early to say if the market would be able
to sustain more than one new jumbo aircraft project, which would be 'very
expensive' to develop.
McDonnell Douglas of the US is also considering developing a larger version
of its MD12 three-engine jet which it hopes to develop in partnership with
Taiwan and possibly Korea, and is already negotiating the sale of a 40 per
cent stake in its commercial aircraft operations to Taiwan Aerospace for
Dollars 2bn.
The big aircraft manufacturers have their sights firmly fixed on the
Asia-Pacific market because traffic in the region is expected to double by
the end of the decade. At the same time, airport and air traffic congestion
is expected to limit longer-term growth of flight frequencies in the area.
Airbus thus predicts that, during the next 20 years, the average size of
jets operated by Asia-Pacific airlines, already substantially higher than
that of any other region, will rise from 228 to as high as 334 seats. 'This
will obviously require the delivery of substantial numbers of aircraft very
much larger than anything flying today,' Mr Brown said.

<TEXT>
MR Joe Massey, assistant US trade representative, has arrived in Beijing for
a new round of market access talks with some rare good news from Washington
 -the ending of a ban on purchases of high-performance computers, Nancy
Dunne reports.
The talks come as the Senate prepares to vote today on legislation setting
stiff conditions on continuing China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status.
Senator George Mitchell, majority leader, has criticised the administration
for lifting the high-technology ban.
The sanctions were ended after Beijing sent written guarantees it would
observe the 'guidelines and parameters' of the Missile Technology Control
Regime. Beijing welcomed the move, while insisting that it does not supply
arms for offensive purposes.
Mr Massey's attempt to get an agreement to open China's market is part of
the US administration's plan to deal with trade disputes through strong
trade action rather than removing the broader MFN tariff designation, which
puts China on equal ground with most other US trading partners. MFN has
allowed China to garner huge chunks of the US market for textiles, clothing
and electronics.
Mr Massey will be negotiating under a Section 301 trade action launched in
October, giving Beijing a year to lift barriers. Washington complains of
quantitative import curbs, import licences, undue certification and trade
rules. It is pushing for agreement in June.

THE EC yesterday attacked the 'perverse and overtly discriminatory Buy
American Act, and the host of other US discriminatory procurement rules', in
an angry response to US threats of trade sanctions against EC government
procurement legislation.
On Friday, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, set a January 1
deadline for sanctions against the EC, unless it agrees to rule out
discrimination against non-EC suppliers of equipment for telecommunications
and electrical utilities. The European Commission said the decision was
'regrettable' and that the disputed clause of its legislation made
'absolutely no distinction between EC and US suppliers'. The directive, part
of the move to a barrier-free internal market, was approved by EC ministers
in September 1990 and is due to come into effect on January 1.
This latest EC-US row is bound to raise the temperature in negotiations on
government procurement under Gatt. The EC says it has formally offered to
outlaw all discrimination in public procurement, and claims the US is
holding up progress because it will not grant equal access to US markets for
EC suppliers. 'Progress in this field will come from removal of obstacles by
both sides, not from adding to the existing array of American discriminatory
measures,' the Commission said yesterday.
The relevant article of the EC directive applies only to third countries
which have not ensured 'comparable and effective access' to their own
markets. 'The US is being remarkably cheeky,' an official from one EC member
state said yesterday. 'We only put this clause in because the US
telecommunications market is closed.' The clause allows EC governments to
reject any tenders for supply contracts where the non-EC content of the
products supplied exceeds 50 per cent of total value. It says in border-line
cases, preference should be given to tenders where over half the products
are made in the EC, even if the price is up to 3 per cent higher than that
of competing tenders.

THE European Community is expected to increase its aid to Central America
and establish a four-year programme in support of human rights during a

Lisbon.
The foreign ministers of Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia are also attending
the meeting, which ends today.
Discussions were expected to focus on economic co-operation, with EC
ministers emphasising the link between economic and social progress and the
defence of human rights.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister, said the EC would
contribute to national reconstruction in El Salvador - ravaged by a 12-year
civil war which ended in January.
The meeting was also expected to discuss an Ecu50m (Pounds 35.4m) priority
EC aid programme for the country.
Mr Jose Manuel Pacas Castro, the Salvadorean foreign minister, was due to
present details of a national reconstruction plan.
A new Ecu1.5m human rights programme would help to pay for technical
assistance to train the Salvadorean police and armed forces. A special
commission of EC and Central American experts would supervise the programme.
Discussions on trade were expected to focus on Central American demands for
free access to the EC for their agricultural products. The region's
producers fear that they will be excluded from exporting bananas into the
Community once the European single market is completed.

MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday told the Queen his
country was moving away from traditonal ties with Britain. He was
immediately accused by political opponents of bad manners and favouring
republicanism, AP reports from Canberra.
His remarks added fuel to the vigorous debate about whether Australia should
keep the queen as head of state or become a republic under a president.
Addressing a reception at Parliament House, he said Australia, like Britain,
sought partners in its own region. 'Our outlook is necessarily independent,'
he said.
He said members of parliament today were different from those she met on her
first visit in 1954.
'Not a few of them saw the world through imperial eyes,' he said.
'This is an altogether different generation, reflecting the profound change
in our two countries and the relationship between them.'
Dr John Hewson, the opposition leader whose Liberal-National Party coalition
is strongly favoured to win office in national elections next year, labelled
the remarks as 'very embarrassing to say the least.'
Mr Keating had taken the opportunity 'to give a tilt in favour of
republicanism in front of the Queen.'

PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt travels to France today in his continuing
efforts to calm international anger over allegations that Libyan agents were
responsible for downing US and French commercial airliners in the late
1980s.
A spokesman for Mr Mubarak said yesterday that the Egyptian leader in a
planned meeting with President Francois Mitterrand tomorrow wanted to 'reach
a formula' that would save Libya from any harm, and at the same time
'satisfy the world community which is so angry'.
Meanwhile, Libya's Colonel Muammar Gadaffi has told Le Figaro, the French
daily, that Libya understood it was obliged to co-operate in the
investigations into the blowing up of a Pan Am jet in 1988 over Lockerbie in
Scotland, and a French UTA airliner over Niger in 1989.
The Libyan leader made it clear he was responding to threats of a US
military strike which he described as virtual state terrorism. 'America
today is the No. 1 military power in the world and isn't counterbalanced by
anyone,' he said.
'An armed confrontation would crush us. We are aware of the danger. That's
why we prefer to play the card of conciliation, and justice, rather than
defiance.'
The US and Britain are seeking extradition for trial of two Libyans accused
of planting a bomb on Pan Am 103, causing the deaths of 259 people on board
and 11 on the ground. France wants to interview four Libyans, including one
of Col. Gadaffi's brothers-in-law, over the 1989 crash of the UTA jet with
the loss of all 171 passengers and crew.
Tripoli has refused to yield its accused, insisting that it is conducting
its own investigation.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Australia set to increase spending and cut taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government is expected to announce capital spending and
tax cuts of between ADollars 2bn and ADollars 3bn (Pounds 862m-Pounds
1.29bn) tomorrow in an attempt to speed up economic recovery and resuscitate
its fading electoral prospects.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, will announce details in a wide ranging
economic statement which could make or break Labor's chances in the next
federal election, due by mid-1993.
Consultations with business organisations, the trade union movement and
other interest groups have made the statement the most eagerly awaited
policy package since 1986 when Mr Keating, then federal treasurer, warned
that Australia would become a 'banana republic' unless it overcame chronic
economic problems.
The principal aim is to generate business and consumer confidence to
strengthen a patchy recovery from six quarters of flat or negative economic
growth which has pushed unemployment to 10.3 per cent.
Confidence in government claims that the recovery has begun was damaged last
week by figures showing that seasonally adjusted retail trade and private
new capital expenditure contracted in the December quarter.
However, the government must also reverse a drift of support to the
opposition conservatives caused by Labor's handling of the economy and a
damaging leadership struggle between Mr Keating and Mr Bob Hawke, the former
prime minister.
Mr Keating has been unable to reduce a gap of up to 20 percentage points in
the opinion polls since taking over in December.
The statement will concentrate on attempts to stimulate economic activity
quickly through a mixture of personal tax cuts and spending on
infrastructure projects.
The government has been overwhelmed with calls for infrastructure spending,
but is likely to restrict itself to modest improvements to roads, railways
and ports. Major projects likely to to be approved include a standard gauge
railway from Melbourne to Adelaide and airport terminal improvements in both
cities.
The statement will also contain measures to stimulate private investment,
probably through accelerated depreciation allowances. The tax treatment of
banks' bad debts will be changed in an attempt to discourage foreclosures
and stimulate fresh lending.
The government is also likely to give a fillip to the faltering structural
economic reform process through further deregulation of the aviation market
and faster progress towards rail and port reform.
Mr Keating has ruled out a slowdown in the government's 10-year tariff
reduction programme, in spite of pleas for greater protection from the
unions and some industry sectors.
The statement is unlikely to unsettle the financial markets unless the
fiscal stimulus is substantially greater than expected. However, some
economists believe any stimulus could overheat the economy if the recovery
already under way is stronger than it appears.
Access Economics, a Canberra consultancy, said the 1991-92 federal budget
deficit is likely to exceed ADollars 9bn, compared with the government's
estimate of ADollars 5bn, and warned that fiscal pump priming 'is likely to
score high on temporary job creation, but low on durability.'

<TEXT>
MR BEN DUNNE, the Irish supermarket magnate who was charged with drug
trafficking in Miami at the weekend, is not a newcomer to controversy,
writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
As chairman and chief executive of Dunnes Group, one of Ireland's largest
companies and food retail outlets, he has crossed swords with industry,
trade unions and government alike. In 1981 he was kidnapped by an IRA group
in an incident which is believed to have ended with the payment of IPounds
300,000 ransom.
Mr Dunne was arrested in Orlando, Florida, after what the police believed
was a suicide attempt from the 17th floor of his hotel. He was found to have
been drugged with cocaine and in possession of a further 32.5g of the
substance.
Mr Dunne returned to Dublin at the weekend after being released on a Dollars
25,000 (Pounds 14,285) bail, saying: 'I made a terrible blunder. I have paid
a high price. I have fallen a long way.' He has admitted possession of the
32.5g of cocaine for which he was charged, but denied that he is involved in
trafficking. 'I can certainly look people in the eye and say I am not a
dealer. But I was in possession,' he said on Irish radio. He said that he
was not attempting suicide, but felt under threat.
His family company, founded in 1944 by his father, now boasts 75 supermarket
and drapery outlets in Ireland, 6,000 employees and an annual turnover in
the region of IPounds 900m. The company also has 23 stores in Ulster and a
further five in northern Britain.
The Dublin magazine, Business and Finance, recently rated it number five of
Ireland's top 1,000 companies based on turnover. As a private company, it
does not release its figures, but it is believed to have annual profits of
some IPounds 50m.
Mr Dunne is widely viewed as a tough negotiator, using his group's market
strength (about 20 per cent of Ireland's retail food trade) to pare
suppliers' margins in order to boost his own company's profits.
Last year he was boycotted by most of Ireland's dairy suppliers when he
attempted to reduce the retail price for fresh milk through his stores,
threatening doorstep deliveries. He was defeated after a six-week boycott,
which reportedly hit overall sales. He fell out with the Confederation of
Irish Industry in 1990 as he sought to extend suppliers' credit periods. An
important source of the group's profits is thought to be derived through
supplier credit. This allows him to accumulate large sums of cash which are
then invested in the short-term money market.
Mr Seamus O'Donnell of the trade union which represents Mr Dunne's retail
staff said: 'They are a difficult firm to deal with, and they work their
staff pretty hard.'

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S economic growth ground to a halt in the final quarter of last year,
as a collapse in industrial output brought a pause in the country's fragile
recovery.
This left the rise in gross domestic product for the year at a mere 1 per
cent, said Insee, the state statistics institute. The result, slightly worse
than most analysts were expecting, is well below the government's September
budget estimate of 1.4 per cent. It represents a sharp fall from 2.8 per
cent in 1990 and is the lowest GDP growth figure for eight years.
'This is largely corporate retrenchment, as a result of the perception that
order books look low. . . . and that interest rates are too high for
companies to manage ambitious expansion plans,' said Mr Jean-Francois
Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London. Mr Eric Taze-Bernard,
senior economist at Banque Indosuez, said: 'The fall in German demand has
hit French exports and the economy is now waiting for a signal from the US.'
Manufacturing output fell in all sectors in the final quarter by 1.4 per
cent, giving a 1 per cent decline for the year. Cars and transport equipment
were worst hit, down 4 per cent in the last three months, reflecting
October's three-week strike at Renault, the state-owned car-maker. The rate
of stockbuilding also declined in the last quarter.
Industrial investment fell by 1 per cent, the fifth consecutive quarterly
decline, to end 3.6 per cent down for the year.
Consumers' confidence seems unaffected. Household consumption rose by 0.7
per cent in the final quarter, bringing the rise for the year to 1.5 per
cent. The morale of French industrialists continues to improve, according to
Insee, AP-DJ adds.
A survey carried out earlier this month found that optimism among the
industrialists had returned to the level at the end of last year. Top
executives were starting to anticipate a recovery in production levels that
could be led by an upturn in the motor industry.
Opinions on order books had improved after having deteriorated for two
months, the institute said, and opinions on foreign demand were more
favourable, especially in the automobile sector.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Warsaw looks west for a fast track into private hands: A
Polish plan to float half the country's state-run companies by 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DEBATE continues over Polish economic policy following the recent
resignation of Mr Karol Lutkowski as finance minister, but there is still a
broad consensus behind giving top priority to the fastest possible
privatisation of state enterprises.
Using a mix of conventional and non-conventional methods, the aim is to
convert half of Polish industry to private ownership by 1994.
The most innovative plan is a mass privatisation programme involving
western-managed investment funds. It has been in gestation since 1988 and
steadily refined by Polish and foreign economists, lawyers, bankers and
accountants. The details must be debated and approved by parliament, but 200
of the 1,300 state-owned enterprises with an annual turnover above Dollars
10m have been selected for the first round, which should begin by the second
half of the year, and another 200 are being prepared.
The target enterprises will be converted into joint stock companies owned by
the Polish Treasury and their shares transferred to a dozen investment
funds. These will be managed by Polish and foreign fund managers. The
Treasury will retain about 30 per cent of the shares, while up to 10 per
cent will be given to employees. The lead investment group will become the
biggest single shareholder, with 33 per cent of the target company shares,
and 27 per cent will be distributed among the other investment funds.
Tenders are being evaluated from foreign consultants and merchant banks that
have applied to manage the funds for an annual fee and a stake in the
eventual capital gains.
Polish citizens initially will be offered 'participation certificates'
exchangeable next year for a set of shares in the new mutual funds. The
public will not become owners of shares in the actual enterprises, which
will remain in the hands of the funds, until they are eventually liquidated,
probably after 10 years.
All adult Poles originally were to receive a free allocation of shares, but
that idea was dropped as redolent of the now-discredited socialist
egalitarianism. Opponents successfully argued that free shares would not
educate people in the rights and responsibilities of ownership, a key part
of the cultural transformation required to make capitalism work.
Poles, like their Czechoslovak counterparts, will soon be invited to pay a
relatively nominal sum for shares in the new funds. Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, a
former academic who has become minister for privatisation in the new
coalition government led by prime minister Jan Olszewski, says that
privatisation will also be closely co-ordinated with the government's
industrial policy.
Teams of merchant banks and consultants have been carrying out 34 sectoral
analyses of Polish industry in a programme partly financed by the World
Bank, the results of which should provide the government with a clearer
vision of the broader strategic implications stemming from the privatisation
of individual companies, especially those sold to foreign buyers.
A series of highly publicised banking scandals, months of political
uncertainty and the difficulty of getting quick decisions from
over-stretched and under-paid government ministries have delayed several
potential foreign investments. However, up to 30 or 40 possible foreign
purchases in the automobile, pulp and paper, cement, brewing and other
industries are in the pipeline, and the government has made clear that it
will remove any enterprise from the mass privatisation scheme if a foreign
buyer is interested in acquiring it.
The government is hoping for a renewed flow of private investment following
the completion of most sectoral studies. Among recent investors are Asea
Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish electrical group, which already employs more
than 10,000 people in Poland and has taken a 10 per cent stake in the
recently privatised Elektrim trading company, and Unilever, the UK-Dutch
consumer goods multinational. Two German detergent companies, Henkel and
Benkiser, have bought controlling stakes in Polish detergent companies.
Until now, however, Poland has made greatest progress in privatising trade
and retail outlets. Nearly 80 per cent of shops have been privatised within
two years, and more than 46 per cent of Poland's Dollars 14bn imports were
handled last year by the newly privatised trade sector. A retail revolution
has brought unprecedented choice of food and consumer goods in place of
shortages and queues.
While private enterprise has transformed Polish consumption patterns, the
flood of imports has created unprecedently tough competition for Polish
farmers and much of Polish industry, including companies already reeling
from the collapse in trade with the former Soviet Union.
Mr Jerzy Thieme, chief adviser to the minister of privatisation, admits it
would be far better if Poland could import 400 first-class industrial
managers to run its ailing state enterprises.
'Unfortunately,' he said, 'we cannot afford the Dollars 250,000-a-year it
would cost to put a first-class general manager and finance director into
each of our companies.'
Instead, the ministry, which is being advised by SG Warburg, the
London-based merchant bank, expects the new fund managers to exercise
ownership rights and provide strategic assistance and guidance to the
enterprises in their portfolios. 'What we are looking for,' Mr Thieme said,
'are strong team leaders for the funds, professionals with 15-to-20-years'
portfolio experience and previous involvement in the management of
industrial companies. It will be a very hands-on commitment.'
But mass privatisation remains an untried experiment thought up by
academics. To critics, it still looks suspiciously like an attempt to avoid
hard decisions which would lead to bankruptcies and mass unemployment. To
supporters, it is an attempt to inject management disciplines, restructure
enterprises and build up capital.
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa has decided to risk clashing with Poland's parliament
over Ms Hanna Waltz Gronkiewicz, his candidate for head of NBP, the central
bank, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The post has been been vacant
since August.
President Walesa said at the weekend that he would re-nominate the
39-year-old academic for the post even though last December parliament
failed to give Ms Gronkiewicz the absolute majority required for the
position.
'I shall draw far-reaching conclusions if I am not permitted to fulfil my
constitutional duties,' Mr Walesa said in a reference to the possibility
that Ms Gronkiewicz, who has specialised in banking issues, will be voted
down again. The statement suggests that he is prepared to use the issue to
campaign for limits to be placed on parliament's powers, arguing that
deputies were hindering efficient government.
Opponents of Ms Gronkiewicz argued that her lack of banking experience
disqualified her for the post. President Walesa, however, says this makes
her the ideal candidate to reform the banking system, which has been shaken
by a series of scandals.

THE FRENCH centre-right UDF political group secured a narrow victory in the
second round of voting in the local by-election in Nice on Sunday. Its
candidate, Mrs Marie-Jeanne Murcia (pictured left casting her vote),
defeated Mr Jacques Peyrat of the extreme right-wing National Front with
50.65 per cent of the vote to Mr Peyrat's 49.35 per cent.
The result was warmly welcomed by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
leader of the UDF, and by other mainstream French political leaders.
However, the closeness of the result confirms recent indications that the
National Front is gaining ground and can be expected to do well in next
month's regional elections, especially in the south of France.
The Front's leader, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, was elated, saying that Mr Peyrat
had held his own against 'a shameful alliance' of conservatives, Socialists
and Communists. He urged voters nationwide to support 'the party of France'
next month.
Nice has traditionally been a right-wing stronghold, and in the first round
of voting a week earlier, Mr Peyrat had surged to a spectacular lead with
nearly 38 per cent, whereas the traditional conservative vote was split
between rival candidates.
For Sunday's run-off all the mainstream parties, including the Socialists
and Communists, called on the voters to rally behind Mrs Murcia against the
National Front.
In the final tally, the abstention rate fell from 64 per cent to 55 per
cent.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Merger plea for Europe's airlines
</HEADLINE>

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S competition policymakers must allow large European airlines to
merge with other carriers to enable them to expand, improve productivity and
compete in the global airline market, Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air
France, urged yesterday.
Clamping down on large airline mergers and alliances, he warned, 'would
condemn European air transport to a rapid, irrevocable decline'.
Speaking at a Financial Times aviation conference in Singapore, Mr Attali
sharply repudiated recent proposals by Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, to introduce a European competition
policy to control airline mergers and protect smaller carriers.
Mr Chataway called earlier this month for an airline merger policy to
protect consumer interests in Europe. The aim of European air transport
liberalisation had to be to increase competition and allow a multiplicity of
airlines to survive, he said, arguing for strict controls on large European
airline mergers.
Mr Attali. however, said these proposals would distort natural market trends
by increasing regulation. If European airlines were to compete against the
large US and Asian carriers, they had to be able to organise themselves
freely. 'Let us be allowed to gather our strength to avoid being hacked to
pieces by our competitors,' he said. 'Rather than shelter behind an obsolete
set of rules, European carriers will need to speed up their reorganisation
and improve their competitiveness.'
Competition was forcing airlines to streamline their networks and group
together to reduce costs. Mr Attali said the international competitiveness
of large European airlines would be undermined if regulators forced them to
hand over landing slots, give up routes, and dispose of equity holdings in
other companies when they put forward merger proposals.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (11): Less lavish but
going strong - US Conventions Business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION is continuing to affect the US conference and exhibition
industries of the 1990s. Smaller and more cost-effective events are
replacing the lavish affairs of the extravagant 1980s.
The recession has been particularly hard on the US conventions business. A
study by Meetings and Conferences magazine showed a 19 per cent decline in
the number of conventions in the US to 10,200 in 1991 from 12,600 in 1989.
In the same period corporate meetings fell to 806,000 from 867,000, while
the total number of meetings dipped to 1.03m from 1.07m.
The move towards smaller events was highlighted by the growth of association
meetings - one of the few bright spots of 1991. The number of association
meetings, other than annual conventions, rose 15 per cent to 215,000 in 1991
from 187,000 in 1989.
'People do not have the time and money to go away to large conventions where
the subject might not be particularly focused and the main benefit would be
networking,' says Mr David Ghitelman, managing editor of Meetings and
Conventions magazine. 'But there is demand for meetings closer to home that
are focused on more specific subjects, such as updates in tax law.'
The recession's impact on US tourism continues to be good news for meeting
planners. Conventions are an increasingly important revenue source for
hoteliers trying to cope with growing vacancy rates. In resort hotels, for
example, conventions contributed about 43 per cent of the industry's Dollars
6bn revenues in 1990. 'It is very much a buyer's market,' says Mr Ghitelman.
One unexpected by-product of the Gulf war, which severely cut into
international travel, was the growth of the video conferencing market. 'We
had almost written off this industry in the 1980s because, year after year,
it never took off. At about the time of the Gulf war it started to grow and
it hasn't fallen off since then,' he adds.
Revenues at Picturetel, which markets portable video systems for use in
one's own room, grew from Dollars 17m in 1989 to Dollars 37m in 1990, and
1991 revenues are estimated at more than Dollars 70m.
Another indication of the video conferencing market's growth is the growth
in use of telephone meeting lines. Domestic bookings over US Sprint's
meeting channel jumped 30 per cent between January and March of 1991, and
international bookings surged 50 per cent. Although the increase was
directly linked to the Gulf war, 'from what I've heard, it may have levelled
off but it hasn't decreased since then,' says Mr Ghitelman.
Companies have discovered that video conferencing is effective and cheaper
than flying people around the world. Mr Ghitelman expects video conferencing
to continue to develop in areas such as preliminary contract negotiations.
Indeed, with new technology allowing people to work on the same document
around the world, certain types of meetings may not be necessary at all in
the future.
Another growing trend is the use of meetings and conventions as a launching
point for family holidays. 'We noticed that a lot more people brought their
spouses to meetings. With the recession and the growth of the two-income
family, it is becoming more important to combine business with pleasure.'
Partly as a result, convention centres in the US sunbelt and the southwest
are getting a larger share of the business according to Mr David Petersen,
director of sports and convention facility advisory services at Price
Waterhouse at Tampa, Florida.
If you live in the north of the country and want to get away for a week, you
might be more inclined to go to a convention in Orlando, Florida than
Missoula, Montana.
Mr Petersen expects the dominant convention centres in the next decade to be
Las Vegas, New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Orlando and Anaheim (near
Disneyland in California).
The large northern business centres such as New York and Chicago have also
held up well. 'Larger centres are continuing to enjoy good attendance and
high occupancy, and they can also draw from the resident market.'
Overall convention attendance, however, is down as a result of the recession
and the amount of exhibit space rented has also fallen off, particularly in
small and medium-size centres.
With convention centres, as well as hotels, the recession has created a
buyer's market. 'Many facilities are trying to distinguish themselves by
offering quality food and beverages, for example. And meeting planners and
trade show producers are increasingly looking for features that might
attract participants,' says Mr Petersen.
In spite of the current pressures on business, the convention industry is
still counting on future growth. Price Waterhouse's annual convention centre
report found that centres in the largest markets such as Los Angeles,
Atlanta, San Francisco, St Louis and Anaheim were expanding.
Smaller markets doing well include Minneapolis, Seattle and Indianapolis.
Among new centres under construction or recently opened are San Jose,
Charlotte, Austin and Portland.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (10): The mission to
motivate - Incentive Travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE after veteran cruise liner Canberra was on its way to the Falkland
Islands carrying British troops, the ship will this year embark on a
different mission: in June it will be carrying over 600 delegates on a
three-day cruise as part of the Personal Investment Marketing conference and
exhibition being held on board.
The event, organised by Emap Events, will bring together invited top-level
delegates, with more than 70 personal finance companies willing to fund the
cruise for the sake of having a captive audience who, presumably, will be in
a more receptive frame of mind away from their desks.
Such captive cruises are increasingly part of the conference scene and
emphasise that travel - be it by land, sea or air - is a crucial part of the
reason why people attend conferences at all.
Many conferences, in fact, turn out to be thinly-disguised incentive trips
used to motivate key staff or distribution teams. 'The annual overseas
convention is virtually part of the remuneration package of performers in
life assurance,' points out Mr David Hackett, managing director of the
Travel Organisation, which arranges conference travel.
This is how the US conference market has worked for years, largely as a
result of the need to bring together scattered sales forces for regular
motivational sessions.
Although many executives are used to travelling on business, a properly
organised incentive trip offers more opportunity to provide excitement and
luxury than most business travel actually delivers.
The difficulty, however, for those in the travel industry is identifying
when conference travel is really a disguised incentive and when it is a
genuine business conference. Yet the distinction between the two is becoming
so blurred as to be virtually meaningless for many delegates.
But whether it is a conference or an incentive trip, there is little doubt
that the companies paying for the travel are seeking a return for their
investment.
The straightforward incentive travel trip has traditionally been used to
motivate sales forces in industries such as insurance, motors and
pharmaceuticals. Companies in these sectors all depend a great deal on their
sales forces - or dealers - to sell the products. Simply offering
traditional rewards such as a better car or more money only works up to a
certain level, these companies believe. Incentive travel may be more
cost-effective.
Research in the US has also shown that individuals who earn the right to be
on a trip one year often work even harder in the following year to ensure
that they retain the perk, lest the executive lose status in the eyes of his
or her peers.
Yet the problem with such performance-related incentives is that they only
motivate the high-flyer: those without a realistic chance of achieving the
travel award may be demotivated early on.
Incentive travel organisers and their users are seeking ways of getting
round this problem. One approach has been to offer different grades of
travel incentives; a short-haul trip to a European city could be the
incentive for those less successful than the high-flyers who win trips to
more exotic, long-haul destinations.
Another device is to offer special deals, such as the Air Miles/Latitudes
system operated by British Airways. These enable companies to award so many
miles of free air travel according to the particular incentive scheme.
However, the harsher economic climate has made some companies wary about
their key executives being away from home for too long. Experience has shown
that companies prefer flight times of up to 1 1/2 hours for short-haul
flights and up to 10 hours for long-haul. Companies also prefer not to
change aircraft and often to remain at one centre with a strong local
interest and image.
France, not surprisingly, remains the most popular short-haul conference and
incentive destination, followed by Spain and Germany, according to a survey
of over 1,000 companies and conference organisers carried out by the
publishers of the Conference Green and Blue Books which list conference
venues.
North America came next, ahead of Ireland and Italy which are both seen as
difficult conference and incentive destinations for major companies because
of the security implications.
Cruise liners, on the other hand, offer not only high security but also
other benefits. Actual expenditure, for example, can be forecast very
accurately in advance since the bulk of spending - fares, accommodation and
food - are known. Discretionary spending aboard conference cruises is
usually left to the individual.
The current economic climate is, not surprisingly, making companies more
wary of their use of travel incentives. Mr Hackett points out that 'spending
has moved away from incentives committed to achieving high volumes, and
instead towards the need to motivate people simply to maintain market
share.'
He notes that in the motor industry, for example, 'what might have been an
overseas event has reverted back to the UK, and where dealers might have
previously been entertained overnight, in many cases events have been
reduced to daytime only activities.'
Mr Hackett sees no sign of a significant uplift in conference and incentive
travel spending in 1992. 'For some companies this is merely a reflection of
reduced marketing budgets, while for others such activity may be seen as
inappropriate while their business suffers and some staff are being made
redundant.'

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (9): A better deal for
delegates - Hotel Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOTELS ARE the linchpin of the international conference and exhibition
industry. Not only do they provide delegates with accommodation but they are
also the biggest supplier of space for small meetings and other convention
facilities.
Thus, it is surprising that hotels have been so poor in the past in meeting
the needs of this important market. Anecdotal horror stories abound about
poor standards in hotels, both for rooms and conference space, and even some
newly refurbished or designed hotels still manage to get it wrong.
A survey by consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte found, for example, that
hotels accounted for some 36 per cent of revenue and 31 per cent of profits
for all conference venues. Half of all delegate days, moreover, were spent
in large hotel chains.
But times are changing. Several leading hotel chains, conscious of
criticisms in the past, have revamped their approach to conferences.
Forte Hotels, Britain's biggest hotel chain, recently decided to give its
conferences a new look with the launch of its Venue Guarantee scheme. 'Our
research showed us that companies wanted to end the uncertainty they felt
when booking hotel conferences and to have confidence that they would get
what they asked for,' says Mr Geoff Thomas, Forte Hotels' marketing
communications controller.
Under the scheme, which applies to Forte hotels worldwide, each conference
has a specified Venue Guarantee manager whose job it is to see that the
event goes smoothly.
Forte also promises to send a Day Planner, ensuring that nothing is missed
out, to conference organisers within 48 hours of a booking being made. The
Day Planner indicates all the charges and the agreed basis of billing.
The new scheme includes a Customer Satisfaction report placed within the
meeting room, so that if services are not delivered then they can
immediately be deleted from the account under Forte's 'no quibble' bill
policy.
Forte is not alone in developing a scheme to give conference organisers more
confidence when booking a hotel meeting. Hilton International, part of the
Ladbroke Group, is launching its Meeting 2000 conference system - previously
confined to the UK - at 27 of its other hotels worldwide.
Hilton's research of conference users found that the top requirement for
successful meetings was the provision of professional, specially trained
staff who were readily available. Like Forte, Hilton provides a dedicated
Meeting Service manager for each meeting.
Among the other elements of Hilton's conference facilities are a business
and meeting service centre, located close to the main function area,
providing communications services, such as typing, fax, photocopying and
couriers.
'Our initiative is aimed at meetings of up to 50 people which, according to
our research, account for some 70 per cent of the global conference market
and represent its fastest-growing sector,' says Mr Geoffrey Breeze, Hilton's
vice president for corporate marketing.
Former Hilton chief executive Mr John Jarvis, who two years ago set up his
own hotel chain, Jarvis Hotels, with the Pounds 186m acquisition of Embassy
Hotels from Allied-Lyons, has launched a similar scheme.
Called Summit Conferences, it guarantees a totally successful conference or
a refund of the cost of the meeting. 'If equipment does not work during the
conference or messages are not delivered, then the organiser is refunded,'
says Mr Jarvis. 'In addition, a complete four-course lunch can be served
within 55 minutes if required.'
Inter-Continental's response to the increased competition from other chains
has been its European Meetings Portfolio, which also includes a specified
meetings manager. Its published conference rates will be kept for the rest
of this year.
'It is one-stop shopping for a conference which takes all the hassle away
from meetings organisers,' says Mr Bob Davis, Inter-Continental's European
vice-president for marketing.
To make things even easier for organisers, the ITT Sheraton hotel chain has
put its Guide for Meeting Planning in diskette form on IBM compatible
format. It includes information on checklists and guidelines and
automatically processes the user's data.
'This is a 'user-friendly' working tool which de-mystifies the planning
process of successful meetings,' says Mr Mike Prager, ITT Sheraton's
advertising director. 'Not only does it save time and energy on the part of
the conference organiser, but it also ensures that nothing is overlooked.'
Hotels are increasingly waking up to the technological needs of conference
delegates. The new all-suite Conrad Hotel at Chelsea Harbour in London has
the state-of-the-art high-tech equipment which modern conference users
demand. Its meeting rooms can be linked up by video if necessary.
The major hotel chains, however, have not had it all their own way in wooing
the conference organiser. Many small country house hotels have carved a
niche for themselves in offering small meetings in more pleasant
surroundings than city centres. The Lygon Arms in Broadway, Worcestershire,
part of the Savoy Group, last year opened a new Pounds 1.4m swimming pool
and fitness centre, to meet the needs of conference groups which
increasingly demand such facilities.
Mr Kirk Ritchie, the Lygon's managing director, says that such investment is
essential. 'It has helped us retain and attract small meetings and
conferences over the past difficult year,' he says.
Lucknam Park in Wiltshire, which has extensive leisure facilities, also
believes that 'memorable food' helps attract top-level meetings: its chef
has just won a Michelin star.
Other small country house hotels also make clear their willingness - perhaps
not always so obvious in the past - to meet the needs of organisers.
Bishopstrow House in Wiltshire, for example, is closing its tennis courts
for three weeks while they are being used as a mock garage for a motor
dealers' conference.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (8): Grey skies and
Disney - How will the Pounds 2bn complex, near Paris, function off-season?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Pounds 2bn Euro Disney project opens outside Paris in just seven
weeks' time, most attention will be focused on the theme park's attraction
as a leisure destination for children and adults wanting to experience
Disney's unique brand of entertainment.
But the Euro Disney resort could also become one of the most significant
European conference and incentive travel destinations in the 1990s.
Disney's management is only too aware that, while the theme park will be
filled to bursting during the opening, summer months, it will prove more
difficult to attract visitors out of season.
The 1,900-hectare complex - about a fifth the size of Paris - contains six
hotels and about 5,000 bedrooms to fill every night. Disney is emphasising
the resort nature of the area, located some 32km east of Paris, but knows
that when the weather is bad and children are in school across Europe, then
it will need conference delegates to help fill those rooms.
Already there is considerable interest in using Euro Disney as a conference
destination, says Mr Chris Jarvis, Euro Disney's UK manager for conferences
and incentives. 'Paris is already the most popular short-haul destination
for conferences and incentives out of the UK,' he says. 'But we're finding
the level of inquiries and bookings well ahead of projections.'
Not surprisingly, Disney does not want to name UK companies which have
already booked conferences in the theme park but they are understood to
include several large concerns.
Conferences will be accommodated in a purpose-built convention centre
adjacent to the Hotel New York, one of the six themed hotels on the Disney
property and which is likely to be used as the main conference hotel. Other
hotels range from the 'moderately priced' Hotel Sante Fe (with about 21
square metres of room space) through to the first-class Hotel New York (31
square metre sized rooms) and the de luxe Disneyland Hotel (34 square
metres).
The convention centre will offer 3,000 square metres of multi-purpose
meeting space, able to accommodate from 20 to 2,000 delegates, although the
latter number might be a bit of a squeeze.
Facilities include all the expected ability to tailor-make the space for
particular requirements, as well as 16 projection rooms which Disney claims
are the most advanced in Europe.
'Every city in the US has a hotel conference venue on this scale, but the
situation is different in Europe,' says Mr Jarvis. 'We will be the only
place in Europe offering this kind of facility.'
What Disney also has to offer will undoubtedly become the biggest single
tourist attraction in Europe over the next decade. The Euro Disneyland theme
park, similar to the Magic Kingdoms in Florida and California, will be
joined in two years' time by a second park, based on the Disney-MGM Studios
in Florida's Walt Disney World.
Disney is well aware, however, of potential criticism that a theme park
resort is not the most conducive location to keeping conference delegates
working. 'The conference centre is located well away from the theme park, so
there is no direct overlap with the park,' insists Mr Jarvis. 'We have
considerable experience in helping to construct itineraries, which enables
delegates to enjoy both a conference and the facilities that the resort has
to offer.'
After the park closes to the general public - which will be early evening at
less popular times of the year - Disney is expected to allow large
conferences (of more than 500 delegates) to make use of one of the themed
lands within the park for a private party. 'This must be the ultimate
incentive - to have exclusive use of Adventureland or Fantasyland for a
party,' adds Mr Jarvis.
Disney has yet to decide whether or not it will allow alcoholic drinks in
the theme park for these private parties (alcohol is banned at all other
times), although it does permit drink when the park is opened for private
parties at Disneyland in California.
Alcohol is freely available in all the hotels, so conference delegates are
unlikely to stay dry for long. At night delegates will also be able to enjoy
the nightlife at its Entertainment Centre (similar to the Pleasure Island
complex at Walt Disney World), including discos, restaurants, and a live
Wild West Show.
Conference and incentive trips to the new Euro Disney resort, however, are
likely to be short - up to three nights on average - although some
organisers might combine a trip with a night or two in Paris as well.
Disney's determination to woo the conference and incentive business to its
newest park is a far cry from its approach to attracting such business
several years ago at Disney World in Florida. At that time, conference and
incentive groups were not actively sought as the then Disney management felt
that this would detract from the park's fun image.
But under the leadership of Mr Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive
since 1984, the company has taken a more realistic view of the attractions
of high-spending conference business. It has recently opened two new
convention facilities at Disney World, adding more than 90,000 square feet
of meeting space. In all, it now has some 600,000 square feet of meeting
space on site.
One of the new convention centres is 40,000 square feet of space at Disney's
most prestigious hotels, the 900-room Grand Floridian. The other is a 51,000
square feet complex at the Contemporary Resort hotel.
But Disney is not just after the massive conventions market. It has launched
a service called Priority One geared solely to booking meetings of less than
50 delegates. 'We provide smaller groups with the same Disney amenities we
offer larger groups,' says Mr George Aguel, vice president in charge of
conferences and incentives.
To help organisers, it has also published a detailed guide to the resorts
amenities, including on-site catering facilities and meetings space.
Moreover, it can put together special themed parties for conferences. 'With
a cast of thousands available to us, any type of themed party is possible -
from a country hoedown to a beach party,' says Mr Aguel.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (7): 'Marketing is
tough' in Glasgow - Mixed fortunes in the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS obvious that something big was happening at the Aberdeen Exhibition
and Conference Centre because one encountered the nose-to-tail traffic
several miles before reaching the exhibition complex at Bridge of Don.
Inside, the hot late August day made the atmosphere almost suffocating.
Last year the biennial Offshore Europe exhibition at Aberdeen, devoted to
the offshore oil and gas industry, was more popular than ever, with an extra
200 exhibitors bringing the total to 1,500 in the 20,000 sq ft exhibition
space. As usual for this exhibition, most of the stands were housed in
temporary accommodation rather than in the permanent structure at the Bridge
of Don centre.
O f f s h o r e Europe is the largest exhibition in Scotland and last year
was in the happy position of serving an industry whose fortunes are running
in the opposite direction to the rest of the UK economy. At the S c o t t i
s h Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) in Glasgow, the mood is less
ecstatic.
'It's tough for everyone at the moment,' says Mr Victor Brierley, an
executive at the SECC. 'A number of exhibitions have withdrawn recently and
marketing is tough.'
With the recession having begun in Scotland about a year later than in the
rest of the UK, the downturn has only recently hit the exhibition business.
Mr John Todd, chief executive of Scottish Industrial &amp; Trade Exhibitions
(Site), one of the largest exhibition organisers north of the border, says
that the picture is mixed.
'I predicted difficulties for our Scottish engineering show in November but
we're already halfway to selling it out. On the other hand, our Scottish
marketing exhibition has had to be postponed because there wasn't enough
support. It's difficult to predict what is going to go well.'
Success is especially necessary for the SECC because it has rarely been in
the black since it opened in 1985. It cost Pounds 36m, of which Pounds 14m
was provided by the Scottish Development Agency, some Pounds 14m by local
authorities and Pounds 8m by the private sector.
Almost immediately after it opened, it was apparent that financial
projections for the SECC had been too optimistic. After an initial financial
reconstruction, the original public sector backers agreed in 1989 to inject
Pounds 2.75m into the company, while debts were restructured and the
councils approved an annual grant to cut one third from the SECC's very high
rates bill.
In the year to September 30 1990, the SECC cut its loss to Pounds 258,000
from Pounds 2.2m. However last year there was a further setback when a
staging of the musical West Side Story flopped; the loss was more than
Pounds 500,000 and the chief executive resigned.
Mr Brierley says that the rock concerts and other entertainments staged at
the SECC are 'on the up and up.' In 1990 both the Bolshoi Opera and
Pavarotti performed successfully at the SECC. But when the National Audit
Office - the government's watchdog on public spending - looked at the SECC
in 1988 it doubted how far 'entertainment and consumer events' made 'a
significant contribution to the development of Scottish industry' which was
the original justification for public sector investment in it.
Yet if the financial performance of the SECC has been disappointing, it has
become an established part of the Scottish scene and many organisations have
taken advantage of its flexible facilities. The Confederation of British
Industry has twice held its annual conference there.
Edinburgh has so far failed to create its long-promised conference centre.
Its need for a purpose-built centre to seat 1,200 people has b e e n
recognised for many years. By early 1990 it finally seemed ready to go
ahead, as part of a large development project for the Lothian Road area of
the city.
But then the developers of the associated project got into difficulties  -
because of the property crisis in England - and the project was delayed.
Last autumn, however, it appeared to be moving ahead again with Edinburgh
district council and Lothian &amp; Edinburgh Enterprise, the local enterprise
company, committing themselves to starting advance engineering work on the
Pounds 30m project.
The Scottish Tourist Board, meanwhile, has in recent years stepped up its
marketing of Scotland as a conference destination. It has spawned the
Scottish Convention Bureau and produces an elaborate and meticulous 80-page
book, Scotland: Everything a Conference ever needed.
It contains details not only of purpose-built conference facilities in
Scotland but of the many hotels, both in the cities and the rural areas,
which are able to lay on conferences. There are also entries from a number
of famous privately-owned stately homes which offer conference and corporate
entertaining.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (6): Bargain basement
seeks business - Some 350 northern venues are being marketed to European
organisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN ENGLAND may once have been an untapped gap in the European
conferences market but, with the backing of the European Commission's
regional development fund, that seems set to change.
The Commission is paying the first year's rent for the Northern Conference
Bureau, which has been set up in Macclesfield, Cheshire. It markets 350
venues in northern England - principally city and country house hotels and
university accommodation - to industries, companies and trade associations
in Germany, northern France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.
It is run by Mr Bernard Owen, Manchester's former conferences organiser,
with Mr Claude Guilot, a former conferences manager for Philips in
Eindhoven, as his partner in Brussels.
Mr Owen says Manchester Airport, the under-exploited north and its ability
to undercut London and the south-east by 25 per cent on costs are proving
decisive selling points. 'London and Scotland are well organised but many
people in Europe are fed up with the prices and congestion they face if they
organise a conference in the south-east,' he adds.
The bureau offers a one-stop shop and is now recruiting the north's top 50
conference hotels to its database of packages.
In Europe, most people have heard of the Lake District and York and want to
see them. Mr Owen and Mr Guilot are spreading the word that the Derbyshire
Peaks, Liverpool, other parts of Yorkshire, Manchester, Newcastle, Cheshire,
Northumberland, Durham and even North Wales also have much to offer.
The ease of getting about on relatively uncongested motorways and trunk
roads is another benefit. 'The north in general offers so many attractions
within a very short distance of its major cities and towns, as well as good
shopping in the big cities and in historic towns like Chester and York,' Mr
Owen says. The new Sheffield Meadowhall development - Europe's biggest
out-of-town shopping centre - is also an attraction, as is the Metrocentre,
Britain's first, on Tyneside.
'The crux of our market is the meeting of between 50 and 80 people,' he
adds. 'These account for 75 per cent of all conferences and they fit easily
into very many city centre or country house hotels.'
Target markets in the various countries being sold to are conferences about
fast-moving consumer goods, insurance, banking, medicine, and
pharmaceuticals.
'Northern England is the bargain basement of Europe,' Mr Owen enthuses. 'In
the rest of Europe, conference prices are about the same as in south-east
England. With direct flights into Manchester, Leeds-Bradford or Newcastle,
we offer big savings, with the chance to see the British way of life at its
best in places that are still relatively unknown in Europe.'
Offering the north in this way as a niche market is not, of course, new in
the conferences and exhibitions sector. Both main northern exhibition
centres, at Harrogate and Manchester, have been doing so for some years.
Neither is dauntingly oversized and each has a steady schedule of
year-to-year regulars. Harrogate, in particular, has a good base of
exhibitions which are tied to conferences, ensuring overnight stays in the
town and trips by delegates and their spouses to the Yorkshire Dales, Moors
or York.
The six-year-old G-Mex Centre in Manchester is reporting another successful
year, despite the recession, because of its flexibility.
The Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre is a Pounds 22m conversion of the
disused Central Station and its arched, single span roof has created 10,000
square metres of floorspace with no pillars in the way. Temporary structures
outside can provide another 6,500 sq metres if needed.
G-Mex can thus function as a large arena for boxing matches, six-a-side
soccer tournaments and rock concerts, all of which have all proved crowd
pullers, with a spin-off promotion of G-Mex itself as a result of their
being televised.
As exhibitions have contracted or, occasionally, been cancelled in the
recession, Mr Frank Winter, G-Mex's chief executive, has upped the numbers
of concerts or sporting events. The result has been 210 days' full usage in
the last year.
This is far below its 289-day record of the previous year, but Mr Winter
says that was a freak result caused by exceptional demand. In any event, it
equated to a usage rate of 93 per cent - well beyond the 85 per cent optimum
level any exhibition centre prefers to have for ease of maintenance.
Harrogate's International Centre was built nine years ago for Pounds 32m and
caught an expanding market well. G-Mex has not appeared to dent a trend of
long-term growth because the two places operate in complementary niches, in
effect benefiting the northern economy as a whole.
With three 2,000 sq metre indoor areas and another 4,000 sq metres available
in the basement, Harrogate also offers flexibility. Two months ago the local
authority, which owns the facilities, decided to spend up to Pounds 3.5m to
refurbish the exhibition halls after a marketing study revealed long-term
growth potential.
Harrogate has recently suffered a blow from losing its twice-yearly fashion
fair because of a rival event at Birmingham's NEC, but exhibition hall usage
has remained at the 80 per cent level of the last decade. The conference
centre managed 70 per cent, which Mr Paul Lewis, director of resort services
says is 'excellent'.
'Numbers attending most events have been only about 5 per cent down because
of the recession, but some shows have been well up on expectations,' he
says. He forecasts an operating profit of Pounds 250,000 for 1992.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (5): Trade fairs wooed
 -The West Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Exhibition Centre, the largest purpose-built facility in the UK
for trade fairs and exhibitions, has started work on a programme of
expansion. The International Convention Centre, with its symphony hall, is
building up a momentum of activity after its opening last year. The National
Indoor Arena, also opened last year, is finding its role in the marketplace
of sporting and mass musical events.
These three venues with complementary facilities are the focus of
Birmingham's bid to establish itself as an international centre of business
tourism and, in the process, to achieve a better balance in the regional
economy of the West Midlands. Traditionally, the centre of the British
engineering industry, the West Midlands has been vulnerable to the sometimes
violent swings of the national economy. The development of a services sector
is seen as the way to reduce that vulnerability.
Although run as a private sector company at one remove from the local
authority, the NEC, the ICC and the NIA are the children of the public
sector and the ultimate owner of the NEC and the ICC is Birmingham City
Council. Indeed, the council guarantees the loan stock issue which is
financing the expansion of the NEC.
Last November the NEC signed a Pounds 44m design-and-build contract with
Laing Midlands for the construction of four exhibition halls as part of a
Pounds 100m investment programme. The effect will be to add 30,000 square
metres of display space by mid-1993 and bring the NEC's total capacity to
155,000 sq metres.
The expansion will consolidate the NEC's position as the UK market leader
for trade fairs and exhibitions and will keep it in the top 10 of European
venues. The extra halls will provide the scope to attract some of the bigger
trade fairs which hitherto have perambulated around the larger European
centres. The first exhibition to use the new halls will be the International
Printing Equipment Exhibition.
The NEC has consistently made profits since the early 1980s. Its record year
was 1989-90 when, after meeting all its financial charges, it contributed
Pounds 6.65m to the general fund of Birmingham City Council. That figure
nearly halved in 1990-91 when repayments of principal debt fell due. In the
current year, latest figures submitted to the council show, the net surplus
should be slightly higher than 1990-91 at Pounds 3.99m.
Despite the recession, income has held up over the last two years at between
Pounds 53m and Pounds 54.34m. But the level of bookings taken for 1992-3
suggests income of Pounds 68.7m and a net surplus of Pounds 12.23m.
As, for management purposes, the NEC, ICC and NIA are run by one company,
the NEC profits help to offset the planned losses at the ICC and the NIA.
Convention centres traditionally have tended not to run at a profit. Rather,
they act as a focus to bring spending visitors to a city and hence stimulate
the local demand for services.
The ICC, apart from the symphony hall, has 11 conference halls capable of
seating audiences ranging from 120 to 3,000. A very big conference would be
able to use the nearby NIA for plenary sessions and split up into smaller
working groups at the ICC. The NIA is conceived primarily as a sports arena
able to take around 10,000 spectators.
The ICC and the NIA have not been in operation long enough for there to have
been any marked effect on the local economy. Efforts are being made to
market the facilities both in continental Europe and in the US, but, for
these to succeed, it seems likely that there will have to be an expansion of
the direct air links between Birmingham and other European centres and the
start of transatlantic flights.
The ideal for the Birmingham authorities is to have a trade exhibition
taking place at the NEC, to the south of the city, with a linked conference
taking place at the ICC in the city centre. This has been achieved, for
example, with last November's Building Employers' Confederation Conference
and the Interbuild 91 exhibition.
Although, in its first six months, the ICC attracted 174 conferences, which
drew in 60,000 delegates, it is still finding its place in a highly
competitive market: so competitive, in fact, that subventions are provided
to the organisers of the largest events. Domestically, the ICC would like to
bring in events like the party political and CBI annual conferences.
Recently, however, the Conservative Party decided not to confirm its booking
for the 1993 conference.
The ICC and the symphony hall will cost Birmingham City Council Pounds
24.57m in the current financial year and the estimated cost for 1992-93 is
Pounds 27.92m. Annual operating costs are over Pounds 9m and there is a
financial charge of nearly Pounds 11m, rising, in 1992-93, to Pounds 13.05m.
It also has to pay charges to the council of nearly Pounds 6m a year. But
the ICC's income this year will be less than Pounds 2m.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (3): Statistics prove
a point - Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW EFFECTIVE are exhibitions? The industry is well aware that this key
question has worried many users of its services over the past decade: they
think exhibitions work but are a little unsure just why and how.
Hence, recent research carried out by Taylor Nelson Business Services for
the Exhibition Marketing Group provides some of the much-needed statistical
research into the industry's effectiveness.
Some 1,400 respondents across 13 industrial sectors were interviewed as part
of the research, and the exhibitions business fared well in comparison with
other forms of media.
While the trade press was seen as the best medium for a new product launch -
cited by 33 per cent of the sample - trade exhibitions came next with 24 per
cent, well ahead of direct mail (8 per cent), newspapers and public
relations (7 per cent each).
But as the most effective medium for quality sales leads, trade exhibitions
came top - with 24 per cent - followed by the trade press (23 per cent),
sales reps (14 per cent) and direct mail (12 per cent).
And as the best medium for corporate image and public relations purposes,
exhibitions trailed only the trade press by 24 per cent to 28 per cent.
Public relations itself came third with 11 per cent of the sample citing it.
The survey came up with some interesting other information about why
visitors attend exhibitions. Keeping abreast of technology was cited as the
main reason, followed by just 'seeing what's new'. But what exhibition
visitors want to see, the survey shows, is more staff on stands who are
technically minded and knowledgeable about the product; order takers and
sales reps were not particularly sought after, although their role was
acknowledged.
Mr Phil Soar, chief executive of the publicly-quoted Blenheim Exhibitions
Group, believes that exhibitions must sell themselves by being different
from other media, not by competing with them.
'The world will move to more and more narrowcast forms of media,' he
forecasts. 'Exhibitions are the perfect narrowcast medium - they can and do
attract very specific, highly motivated and interested audiences.'
The Exhibition Industries Federation (EIF) has also taken concern about the
effectiveness of exhibitions to heart and has commissioned research studies
into their benefit to exhibitors and visitors alike.
It says that, based on its surveys, the average number of sales leads
generated by exhibitors was almost 300 per exhibitor, with nearly
three-quarters of these new leads. Exhibitors expected that more than a
quarter of their leads would be converted into sales.
More ambitious effectiveness studies are now being carried out by the EIF.
Such efforts are clearly needed as the latest figures from the Incorporated
Society of British Advertisers (ISBA) show that, even before the full impact
of the recession was felt last year, spending on trade, technical and
consumer exhibitions was down for the first time in two decades.
ISBA's survey of advertising expenditure in 1990 found that while total
advertising spending rose from Pounds 9bn in 1989 to Pounds 9.211bn in 1991,
that on exhibitions fell 9 per cent from Pounds 803m to Pounds 761m.
This survey measures only exhibition spending by British companies and so
underestimates the total size of the sector. The Exhibition Industry
Federation, for example, says that its figures for 1990 suggest that Pounds
901m was spent by UK and overseas exhibitors, a rise of 13 per cent on 1989.
The ISBA survey shows that spending on trade, technical and consumer
exhibitions in 1990 totalled Pounds 594m, a decline of 2.3 per cent on 1989.
Private exhibitions, such as those held in hotels or shopping centres, also
experienced a drop from Pounds 173m to Pounds 160m. The reason, says ISBA,
was more exhibitions switched from hotels and shops to mobile sites with
lower cost structures.
Agricultural events, which also make up part of the industry as monitored by
ISBA, were also down: from Pounds 68m to Pounds 52m. ISBA says that this was
partly due to 'consumer and craft displays to a high degree replacing the
more traditional presence of agricultural equipment manufacturers and
suppliers.'
What is clear from the ISBA and EIF figures is that the main cutbacks are
being felt in terms of smaller stands and reduced construction costs. EIF
figures show that the average duration of exhibitions in 1990 was 3.4 days,
compared with about 3.7 days in 1989.
Spending by exhibition visitors also fell in 1990, down 6 per cent to Pounds
502m. UK-based day visitors accounted for almost 88 per cent of exhibition
attendance in 1990 and, as they usually travel from work or home, and incur
no accommodation costs, their overall spending per visit is much lower than
domestic overnight visitors or overseas visitors.
Average spending by domestic day visitors rose by some 5 per cent in 1990 to
Pounds 27 a day, but after taking inflation into account this was a slight
decline in spending. But spending by UK exhibition visitors who used
overnight accommodation fell from Pounds 179 to Pounds 158 per visit. Only
overseas visitors managed to buck the trend: they spent an average of Pounds
487 per visit in 1990, compared with Pounds 443 in 1989.
How to reach such important target customers will be the focus of National
Exhibitors Day at the International Confex exhibition being held at London's
Earls Court this week. Ms Deborah Carlton, managing director of Blenheim
Events, which is staging the exhibition, says that 'much still needs to be
learned about the benefits of exhibitions as part of a sales and marketing
campaign.'
She adds: 'Too many exhibitors fail to set clear aims and objectives before
and after an event or realise the importance of stand presentation during
the exhibition itself.'
The problem (although officially denied) often is that exhibition halls  -
like restaurants - have both good and bad locations: exhibitors in the know
steer clear of the notorious 'black spots' which few visitors seem to pass
by.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (2): A self-financing
trend - Conferences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN ELECTRONICS giants Philips, Sony and Matsushita wanted to increase
awareness among both hardware manufacturers and software developers about
interactive compact discs, they decided collectively to sponsor a conference
for the trade to tell all of them about this new consumer product.
But, unusually in an industry where corporate hospitality is the name of the
game, trade delegates were not given free access by the sponsors. Instead,
they had to pay Pounds 395, plus value added tax, to attend the conference
and associated exhibition.
'We felt that people who were likely to come to the conference expected to
get a lot out of it in such a new and exciting area and so were willing to
pay,' explains Ms Vanessa Cotton, managing director of the Event
Organisation, which put together this and similar conferences.
'Also, our experience has shown that people tend to value more highly events
for which they have to pay and so are more likely to turn up,' she says.
The conference, first held in the Royal Lancaster hotel in London two years
ago and repeated last year, will this year move to the larger facilities
available at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre.
The conferences have achieved the sponsors' aims of involving current and
potential software developers in the new product and demonstrating that the
interactive compact discs work on a single worldwide technical standard.
'This has meant that the target audience has focused on the product and not
on the companies,' adds Ms Cotton.
The use of a self-financing conference to help reach target audiences by the
electronics manufacturers shows that conferences are being regarded as an
important part of the marketing mix, even in a recession.
Such large-scale corporate conferences are the new focus of the conventions
business. 'They have to befirmly targeted at specific groups if they are to
prove successful,' says Mr Neil Thomas, managing director of Hawksmere
Conferences, a London-based organisation. 'For example, we specialise in a
lot of the information type of events dealing with new EC legislation and
tax issues which people need to know about,' he adds.
Mr Paul Swann, managing director of conference production company Spectrum
Communications, agrees. 'Companies are giving more emphasis to setting clear
objectives for both individual events and further long-term communication
programmes,' he says. 'Moreover, there is an increasing practice of
measuring results against those objectives, sometimes taking advantage of
independent market research among participants before and after the event.'
Yet in spite of the popularity of high-profile corporate conferences, the
bulk of the market still consists of relatively small meetings. A survey of
over 1,000 companies and conference organisers, carried out by the
publishers of the Conference Green and Blue Book guides to conference
venues, found that more than two-thirds of all conferences are for between
only 11 and 100 participants. Only one in every 10 of the conferences it
surveyed were for more than 200 delegates.
Another survey, carried out by management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, found that the three main purposes of most UK conferences were for
training, small executive meetings and general management get-togethers.
Yet in the international conference market, the three key types of
conferences were: incentive meetings, trade fairs and product launches and
large international conventions.
The consultants' survey pointed out, however, that 'production companies
consider the number of suitable venues in the UK as very limited and most
are already booked ahead, with the result that many launches probably go
abroad.'
In the UK market, the impact of the recession has been most felt in the
length of conferences held and the number of delegates attending. Mr Sean
Bodkin, sales and marketing manager at the QE II centre, says that 'some
which were traditionally spread over three days are now reduced to a single
day.'
Mr Swann from Spectrum says that 'while a greater diversity of employees,
customers and dealers are participating in conferences, the numbers
attending individual events are smaller as organisers take more care to
ensure that only those for whom they are relevant are invited.'
The consultants' survey, which covered nearly 500 conference organisers and
venues, also found, not surprisingly, that there had been 'a significant
increase in the cost-consciousness of delegates.'
Choosing a conference venue is based less on price, according to the Green
and Blue Book survey, than on the right room capacity, geographical location
and ease of access. Research carried out by the QE II centre found that
catering was also ranked highly when conference facilities were chosen. 'We
have therefore put a lot into raising catering standards, working closely
with our caterers, Leith's,' says Mr Bodkin. The trend, he reports, is for
less alcoholic drink to be consumed at lunches, partly as a result of the
recession but also due to growing health consciousness among delegates.
A more cogent trend than the amount of drink consumed is the growing
sophistication of audio-visual and video equipment and presentations at
conferences. Although the slide as a means of visual presentation still
dominates, it is now definitely in decline. Better computer graphics, video
production and video projection equipment have led to significant
improvements in the quality of videos shown at conferences.
The major development in this area is high definition television, which
gives a quality and picture size closer to conventional films than normal
video. At present, however, there is no system firmly established as the
industry standard, which makes it very expensive to use in conferences:
equipment and production costs are running at about twice those of
conventional broadcast quality television.

 -European Venues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL

<TEXT>
ACROSS EUROPE, conference and exhibition venues often suffer from the same
fault: insufficient hotel space adjacent to the venues to accommodate the
numbers of delegates and visitors.
The problem is most acute in Berlin, Vienna, Copenhagen and Birmingham - in
spite of the opening last year of a new Hyatt hotel next to the
International Convention Centre in the latter city.
Even when venue capacity and hotel accommodation is neatly matched - as in
the Sorrento Palace conference facility - other problems arise. Sorrento,
for example, is served by Naples which cannot easily provide the inter-
national direct flight capacity on scheduled services to match the demand
for the venue.
Other well-planned conference centres which have successfully developed
trade fairs - such as Frankfurt and Paris, for example - also suffer from a
shortage of hotel space even when the conference centre is free.
Finding good convention space can also be difficult when demand is at its
peak. The Milan Fiori complex is a useful standby, helped by being on the
right side of town for Malpensa airport and with easy access to the orbital
road, necessary because there is only one hotel on site.
Nice's convention centre, the Acropolis, opened in the early 1980s, is
fairly big and can accommodate most sizes of meetings, even if its design
leaves much to be desired. Availability of hotels is reasonable and as the
Acropolis is in the town, transport is not a problem. Nice is also well
supplied with flights out of the UK.
The European Federation of Conference Towns says that the most popular
target countries for new conventions business are the UK, followed by the
US. 'Conferences are a major factor in pan-European communications,' asserts
Mr Tuula Lindberg, the Finnish president of the federation.
Mr David Tonnison, managing director of the Marketing Organisation,
conference organisers, believes that 'the opening of Europe as a single
market will fuel a boom in international meetings.'
European conference centres, however, will only maximise their occupancy
rates if, he argues, 'they build the right mix of meeting rooms in the right
place and provide sufficient local bedrooms.'
A recent survey carried out by the Official Meeting and Facilities Guide for
Europe, published by the Reed Group, found that the availability of hotel
and other facilities, ease of transportation, and the distances delegates
have to travel were the three most important factors in selecting a meeting
destination.
The survey, based on 150 corporate meeting planners in Europe, suggested
that nine out of every 10 rated food quality, prices and meeting rooms as
most important when selecting a conference hotel.
The Guide's US version, in a survey of American convention planners, found
that the chief worry among Americans when planning a European meeting was
over-pricing by the convention centre and hotel, along with the availability
of sufficient rooms.
Among the minor factors taken into consideration by the US meeting planners,
the most significant when choosing a European conference destination was
said to be fears about the quality of the drinking water.
Figures from the Marketing Organisation suggest that UK meeting planners
have become less willing to use continental venues over the past year.
Its UK activities rose from 35 per cent in 1990 to 44 per cent last year. At
the same time, short-haul conference and incentive trips to continental
Europe dropped from 42 to 37 per cent.

THE CONFERENCE and exhibitions industry, after what has probably been its
worst-ever year, still faces a far from rosy 1992. Visitors to International
Confex, the main trade show for the conference and exhibitions business
which opens at London's Earls Court today, will know only too well how far
the recession has forced companies to cut back on this sector of marketing
communications.
A survey, published today, of conference organisers in over 200 of Britain's
largest companies indicates a worsening of demand this year, with fewer
events. Those that are held are likely to involve fewer delegates than
usual.
The survey, carried out by the Meetings Industry Association and London's
government-owned Queen Elizabeth II conference centre, found that 40 per
cent of corporate organisers of meetings expected to hold fewer events this
year, with only 26 per cent expecting to hold more. The rest thought the
level of activity would be the same.
But seven out of every 10 companies polled also believed that conferences
would be shorter this year, while virtually all agreed that competition
among conference venues would be fierce.
Ms Deborah Carlton, managing director of Blenheim Events, which is
organising the Confex trade show, says that the 'feedback we have had seems
that while there may be light at the end of the tunnel, we still have a
difficult year ahead.'
This view is shared by others in the conference sector. 'While conference
and incentive travel is a valid marketing tool for many companies, it has
been an area of significant cutback in 1991 and there is no sign of an
expenditure uplift in 1992,' says Mr David Hackett, managing director of
conference organiser the Travel Organisation.
But the exhibitions side of the sector seems to have been less hard hit.
'People are using exhibitions in a more determined way to find out the best
deals on offer in the most cost-effective way,' suggests Mr John Glandfield,
a director of the Earls Court and Olympia complex.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman of the publicly-quoted Blenheim Group, the largest
UK exhibitions organiser, reports that the median attendance at its UK
exhibitions last year was 20 per cent higher than for the same events in
1990.
'We feel that the brand leaders in particular markets which use our
exhibitions are not only slow to feel the effect of the recession but also
seem to be fairly fast in responding to the beginning of its end,' he says.
Yet in both the conference and exhibitions businesses, international
activity is the key to the sector's recovery. 'There is considerable
strength of demand from overseas clients, particularly multinational
companies,' says Mr Paul Swan, managing director of conference production
company Spectrum Communications.
Ms Carlton of Confex points out that there is an increased international
presence at this year's London trade show. 'This indicates how aggressively
European and long-haul destinations are marketing themselves to UK buyers,'
she says.
International affairs are also benefiting some niche sectors of the
industry. Mr Neil Thomas, managing director of Hawskmere Conferences, says
that 'the degree of legislation coming out of Brussels means that there is
considerable interest in the sort of specialist tax and financial
conferences we mount.'
The true state of the conference and exhibitions business, however, is
shrouded by its fragmentation. The meetings business ranges from small
internal management and training conferences held within companies to those
held at specialist venues or in hotels.
Corporately-run conferences can be used to communicate to target groups:
such as a new product launch or investor presentation. The conference
business also encompasses the large-scale trade association meetings and
government-inspired conferences. An important part of the business is
travel, with conferences often used as a thinly-veiled cover for an
incentive trip to motivate staff or reward distributors.
Exhibitions also are fragmented, with the main ones held in major venues
such as Earls Court or Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre, but with
many smaller ones held in hotels and as part of conference venues.
Estimates of the size of the industry vary, but the most recent value placed
on UK conference activity is some Pounds 6bn a year, calculated by
management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. That suggests the sector
is several times larger than previously thought, mainly due to taking into
account small meetings held in hotels and other venues.
The latest figures on spending on exhibitions, calculated by the
Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, suggest that the recession was
already being felt in 1990; some Pounds 761m was spent by British companies
 -a decline of 9 per cent over 1989 and the first time in two decades that
exhibition expenditure had fallen. But spending by international companies
on UK exhibitions rose from Pounds 240m to Pounds 252m.
International conference and exhibition delegates are a key engine of growth
for the industry, according to the British Tourist Authority. 'The actual
expenditure by conference visitors is only the tip of the iceberg,' says Mr
Peter Glover, head of the BTA's business travel department. 'The income to
Britain also includes pre- and post-convention tours and visits, as well as
spending by accompanying visitors during the conference itself.'
BTA figures show that in 1990 (figures for 1991 are not yet available) the
number of international conference visitors to Britain topped 300,000 for
the first time. Moreover, average spending by conference visitors at Pounds
600 was higher than that by the average visitor (Pounds 428) and the average
business visitor (Pounds 488).
The growth of international conference and exhibition activity has spurred
UK venues to upgrade or develop their facilities. Birmingham has put itself
firmly on the international conference scene with its new International
Conference Centre, opened by the Queen last year.
The Earls Court and Olympia complex in London, the UK's most popular venues,
is now concentrating on improving its infrastructure (better access roads
and an improved tube service from Earls Court to Olympia) over the next five
years rather than adding new space.
But the UK industry faces considerable competition for the large-scale
meetings, not only from established continental venues (and newer facilities
such as that offered by Euro Disney) but also from further afield. Hong
Kong, which two years ago opened its new convention centre, will this summer
play host to its largest-ever conference - some 25,000 members of the Lions
Club International.
Much of the growth in the industry, however, is expected to come in the
1990s from small-scale meetings of up to 100 participants. It is these
groups which the leading international hotel chains such as Forte, Hilton,
and Inter-Continental are targeting with special conference packages aimed
at offering a better service for conference groups than hotels have
traditionally provided.
The long-term threat to the growth of international conferences, however,
remains the increasingly sophisticated tele and video conference technology.
The restrictions on international travel during the Gulf War gave a
substantial boost to this style of communication. However, few within the
industry are seriously worried: face-to-face meetings at conferences or
exhibitions give most executives benefits that they will not want to give up
lightly.

FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: SA leisure group net ahead 15%
to R213.3m

<TEXT>
KERSAF Investments, the South African leisure and entertainment group,
overcame deteriorating trading conditions to record a 14 per cent increase
in earnings in the six months to the end of December.
Turnover rose 13 per cent to R1.02bn (Dollars 357m), and operating income
was 10 per cent higher at R274.98m. A lower tax bill, due to heavy capital
expenditure at the group's Bophuthatswana hotel operations, helped lift net
profits by 15 per cent to R213.3m. Earnings attributable to outside
shareholders, however, also rose, thus restricting attributable earnings to
R86.4m, a 14 per cent rise.
Mr Buddy Hawton, executive chairman, said the results were satisfactory in
the light of difficult conditions and the susceptibility of the group to a
slowdown in consumer spending.
Kersaf's main investments are a 80 per cent stake in the Sun International
casino resort and hotel group, and a 38 per cent stake in Interleisure,
which is involved in the leisure and entertainment fields.
Sun International performed well during the period, with casino revenues 25
per cent higher than during 1990. This was due in part to the opening in
November of the Carousel resort. In line with the rest of the industry,
however, hotel occupancies declined, by 4 percentage points to 66 per cent.
Mr Hawton said Interleisure's performance had been satisfactory, with cinema
attendances picking up after a slow start, and buoyant trading at
Computicket, the entertainment booking outlet.
Looking ahead, he said depressed economic conditions were expected to
continue for the rest of the year. Earnings growth, however, should be
satisfactory if conditions did not deteriorate further.
The dividend was lifted by 14 per cent to 66 cents per share, on a similar
rise in earnings to 115 cents per share.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Haitians lose US asylum battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday allowed the Bush administration to complete
the forced return of thousands of asylum-seeking Haitian boat people to
their Caribbean homeland, Reuter reports from Washington.
The high court, by an 8-1 vote, rejected an emergency request by human
rights lawyers to halt the controversial US repatriations on grounds that
the Haitians would suffer irreparable harm and possibly death if sent back.
The court issued the ruling a day after Haiti's quarrelling factions reached
an agreement mediated by the Organisation of American States to restore
democracy and return ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
President George Bush's government had argued strongly in favour of allowing
forced repatriations.
It said the Haitians were fleeing the impoverished nation for economic
rather than political reasons and therefore were not entitled to political
asylum in the US.
The only dissenter was Justice Harry Blackmun, a liberal, who said the court
gave 'full and careful consideration' to whether the Haitians would face
persecution upon returning to their strife-torn homeland.
The court, with a solid majority of justices appointed by Mr Bush or his
conservative predecessor Mr Ronald Reagan, has now sided twice with the Bush
administration during a three-month-long legal battle that has become an
embarrassment for the government.
About 15,000 Haitians have tried to enter the US since Mr Aristide, Haiti's
first democratically elected president, was overthrown in a military coup on
September 30.
Most of the refugees were picked up at sea and taken to the US Navy base at
Guantanamo, Cuba. About one-third have already been returned to Haiti.
The Supreme Court's ruling cannot be appealed, but activists have vowed to
keep fighting in Congress.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Money Markets and Foreign Exchanges: Dollar to lead way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar is again expected to dominate the foreign exchanges this week,
with crucial figures on consumer confidence out on Tuesday.
'Information coming out until now has been perceived to be historic and not
of much interest,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser of Chemical Bank.
The consumer confidence numbers, along with the Chicago Purchasing Managers'
Report on Friday, will be the first significant forward looking statistics.
UK clearing bank base lending rate 10.5 per cent from September 4, 1991 The
dollar is expected to test lower levels if the consumer confidence is worse
than January's 50.4 per cent. However, any decline is not expected to last
long as underlying demand is still strong. Lower levels against the D-Mark
would only encourage the bulls.
Economists suggested that dollar/yen could be subject to further
intervention this week. The Bank of Japan sold dollars for yen twice last
week.
Dr Gerard Lyons, chief economist with DKB International, dismissed rumours
that the Bank of Japan might seek to introduce alternatives to intervention
 -such as a limit on speculative dollar buying. 'The Bank of Japan is more
likely to focus on its reserves as a primary source of defence,' he said.
Sterling is likely to ignore economic data this week, in favour of opinion
polls. 'The pound will be a political animal from now on,' said Mr Cocker.
Speculation over an imminent base rate cut in the UK had virtually been
eliminated by the end of the week, with most players counting on a reduction
just after the March 10 budget.
The Australian dollar faces some uncertainty as the market awaits a
statement on the economy from Prime Minister Paul Keating. 'If they signal
an easing of policy the dollar could have a perverse reaction,' said Mr
Peter Luxton of Barclays.

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Textile recovery dependent on the domestic
consumer - Daniel Green looks at prospects for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY ARE leaner. Many of them are fitter. But after a year of false and
dashed hopes, UK textile companies are still unable to celebrate even the
hint of a recovery
The results season which starts on Thursday with Courtaulds Textiles, the
second biggest company in the sector, should confirm that 1991 failed to
live up to expectations, and could indicate that prospects for recovery in
1992 are equally grim.
In the closed season ahead of the figures companies are not allowed to talk
about trading. But City analysts are in no doubt that life in the textiles
business remains tough.
'We are not looking for any material domestic volume growth this year,' says
Hoare Govett. SG Warburg has reduced profit forecasts across the sector for
both 1992 and 1993.
Textile companies have been hard at work cutting costs. With falling
interest rates, this should limit the damage to pre-tax profits.
Much of the cost control has come in the form of job losses. The biggest
textiles company, Coats Viyella, which reports its final results at the end
of March, has laid off more than 10,000 people over the last three years.
Courtaulds Textiles cut its workforce early in the recession because it was
working on 'pessimistic assumptions', says its chief executive, Mr Martin
Taylor.
Some aspects of the recession have underpinned margins, if not volumes:
Retailers are demanding rapid changes in designs, short production runs,
just in time delivery and better quality control. They are prepared to shun
the cheapest segment of the market to achieve this, and higher unit prices
can mean better margins.
Falling inflation eases one of the long term structural problems in the
textile industry, that of runaway costs. General inflation is historically
higher than the rise in the price of clothes: since 1982 clothing and
footwear prices have risen by less than a quarter while the retail prices
index is more than 70 per cent up A fall in wool and cotton prices - raw
cotton is about one third cheaper than six months ago - has reduced costs
for some. And the continued love affair with natural fibres helps repeat
sales because artificial fibre mixtures last longer, says Mr David Parker,
chairman of Sherwood Group, the third biggest UK sock maker.
Textiles companies face increased reliance on their biggest customer, Marks
and Spencer. It has suffered less than many of its high street rivals in the
recession and plans to increase the number of its outlets in the rest of
Europe.
The buying power of M and S is one factor that is encouraging the continued
consolidation of the UK textiles industry. Coats Viyella is the largest
non-food supplier to M and S. Last year it bought thread-maker Tootal after
a bitter takeover battle. If Coats' results next month show substantial
savings as a result of the acquisition, the commercial pressures for more
mergers can only increase.
Yet these considerations may have only a marginal effect on the fortunes of
the industry. The performance of the economy as a whole remains uppermost in
executives' minds. 'The most important factor in this business is still
domestic consumer confidence,' says Mr Colin Purvis of the British Textiles
Confederation.

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Management buys Budge mining side for
Pounds 106.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 106.5m management buy-out of the mining division of AF Budge, the
civil engineering and open-cast mining group, was completed over the
weekend.
The buy-out of Budge Mining, the biggest of the open-cast contractors to
British Coal, was headed by Mr Richard Budge, one of the two brothers
running the AF Budge group.
Finance of over Pounds 45m for the buy-out was underwritten by a consortium
of investors including Schroder Ventures, Midland Montagu Ventures,
Charterhouse Development Capital and Prudential Venture Managers.
They are the shareholders of the new mining company, together with its
senior management and Mr Budge, who will remain managing director.
Debt finance of Pounds 40m was underwritten by Bank of Scotland and Morgan
Grenfell.
Mr Tony Budge, chairman and managing director of the AF Budge group, said
yesterday that the disposal of the mining division was consistent with the
Budge board's strategy of concentrating on civil engineering, where the
group was a major UK road builder.
The buy-out would considerably reduce the group's overall borrowing level,
he said.
The group was currently tendering for a number of major motorway and
building contracts and it was anticipated that turnover for 1992 would be in
the region of Pounds 200m. In 1991 it was Pounds 270m, of which Pounds 80m
came from open-cast mining.
He said that type of mining was very capital intensive and involved
equipment costs of Pounds 70m. However, he thought that demand for open cast
coal would still be strong.
The buy-out was the result of an amicable arrangement between the two
brothers.
Mr Richard Budge relinquishes his position as deputy managing director of
the group, but would still be on the board of Sheffield Airport, where it
was proposed to build a short take-off and landing airfield.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Gloves come off in fight for Exor: BSN's counter-bid
intensifies pressure on the Agnellis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between Nestle of Switzerland and the Agnelli family of Italy for
Perrier, the French mineral water company, is set to come to a head
following last Friday's intervention by BSN, the French food group.
BSN sent a clear signal that it was siding, not with its old allies, the
Agnellis, but with Nestle, its chief competitor, by announcing a FFr6bn
(Pounds 610m) counter-bid for Exor, the French property company that
controls Perrier and for which the Agnellis have already agreed terms for a
FFr5.6bn friendly takeover.
The BSN counter-bid is clearly designed to intensify pressure on the
Agnellis to negotiate a settlement in the Perrier battle which has been
brewing since Nestle launched its FFr13.42bn hostile bid four weeks ago.
'Nestle wants Perrier. We want Volvic (one of the Perrier waters). The
Agnellis want to make a profit. If we negotiate we can all get what we
want,' said Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's veteran chairman.
Meanwhile, the outcome of two French court cases will be critical for Nestle
in determining its negotiating power. The commercial court in Nimes is
expected shortly to deliver its judgment on whether Exor can exercise full
voting rights over its 35 per cent of Perrier. The second case starts this
Tuesday in Paris when the commercial court considers Nestle's appeal to
annul the recent acquisition of 14 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, the
French sugar company allied to the Agnellis.
Unless Nestle wins at least one case, its bid will fail, given that Exor and
Saint Louis control 49 per cent of Perrier. Nestle would be a minority
investor at loggerheads with the management.
If Nestle wins one or both cases, it will fight for shareholder support
against the Perrier board, chaired by Mr Jacques Vincent, also chairman of
Exor. Mr Vincent would have to decide whether to take on Nestle with a
counter-bid for Perrier by Exor. He may be forced to anyhow, after a ruling
due on Thursday by the French stock market authorities.
The alternative would be for the Agnellis to succumb to pressure from Nestle
and BSN to negotiate a settlement. BSN and Fiat have cross-shareholdings and
the two companies have significant joint interests in the Italian food
industry.
Nestle first tried this approach when it met the Agnellis in Italy in
January. The Agnellis were then in the early stages of their friendly bid
for Exor. The bid, begun as a partial offer for 66 per cent of the company,
had already run into controversy in France after complaints from minority
shareholders, notably the Suez industrial group.
Also at the meeting was Lazard Freres, the Parisian bank which, as a
long-standing adviser to the Agnellis and the biggest single shareholder in
BSN, had been instrumental in fostering their joint interests. Lazard and
BSN had supported the Agnellis's diversification into France until early
last year when the Italians bought a stake in Exor without consulting them.
Lazard became anxious about its relationship with the Agnellis. Nestle was
concerned that the Agnellis's Exor bid would scupper its hopes of buying
Perrier, but the Agnellis decided to continue to support the existing
management under Mr Vincent.
That prompted Nestle's hostile bid for Perrier in conjunction with Indosuez,
part of the Suez group, in which it was advised by Lazard.
Nestle has continued to press for negotiation. Last Monday in Paris Mr
Riboud met Mr Gianni Agnelli of Fiat and older brother of Umberto, who has
led the family's drive into France.
Mr Riboud suggested a solution. BSN would bid for Exor and give its Exor
shares to Nestle in return for Volvic. Nestle would give those shares back
to the Agnellis in return for a 20 per cent stake in Perrier. Mr Agnelli did
not respond. So, on Friday, BSN counter-bid, supported by Lazard and
Indosuez.
Mr Riboud described the counter-bid as a strategic move to 'step up the
pressure on the Agnellis to persuade them to negotiate.' Both he and Mr
Domeniconi say they are convinced the Agnellis would negotiate if it were
not for Mr Vincent's objections.
They may also hope to play on any rift between Mr Gianni Agnelli and
Umberto, whom he has reluctantly named as his heir apparent at Fiat.
So far Mr Umberto Agnelli, as head of the family's French interests, has
called the shots in the Perrier affair, but it is his older brother who
takes the decisions as illustrated by his meeting last Monday with Mr
Riboud.
It remains to be seen whether the gamble will come off. The BSN counter-bid
could make it more difficult for the Agnellis to negotiate without being
seen to lose face. This could be what their opponents want. After all, BSN,
Suez and Lazard resent the Agnellis' investment in Exor.
This raises questions about the wider implications of the Agnellis's
ambitions in France and for the future of their joint interests with BSN in
Italy. Mr Riboud maintains the Italian ventures will not be affected by the
counter-bid. 'France is France. Italy is Italy,' he said. He should soon
discover if the Agnellis agree.

MERGER talks between British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have
reached a critical stage after nearly breaking down last week over the
shareholder structure of the proposed new company.
BA said last night, however, that talks were continuing to try to break the
deadlock over price and the new ownership structure.
On Saturday KLM's supervisory board held an unscheduled meeting in Amsterdam
after the long-running talks apparentlyran into insurmountable difficulties.
The KLM chairman said in his airline's staff magazine last week that the
talks continued to be bogged down on some difficult problems.
Neither side appears to have set a deadline for an agreement which would
form a formidable force in international aviation.
The negotiations are blocked by KLM's insistence on holding a 40 per cent
stake in the enlarged airline operation confining BA to 60 per cent. BA had
sought 80 per cent with KLM holding 20 per cent, but is understood to be
prepared to settle for 70 per cent with KLM holding the 30 per cent balance.
The UK airline has made it clear it regards a 60-40 split as unacceptable.
BA last week reported a five-fold increase in third-quarter profits to
Pounds 100m and is concerned that its overall size and profits potential is
adequately reflected in the new shareholding structure. The Dutch are
equally concerned not to give up control of the national flag carrier at a
price that airline analysts would describe as a 'sell-out' to BA.
Failure to reach agreement on the merger would be a blow for both airlines
and their effort to forge a global alliance.
KLM would provide BA with a new European hub in Amsterdam as well as an
equity interest in Northwest Airlines of the US. Partnership with BA would
enhance KLM's competitiveness against other bigger continental European
carriers like Lufthansa and Air France.
Failure would also come at a time of consolidation among other European
airlines with Belgian authorities expected soon to approve Sabena's proposed
link with Air France.
BA originally attempted to negotiate a partnership with Sabena of Belgium,
but the talks collapsed. Air France plans to invest in a large minority
stake in the Belgian carrier.

FT  24 FEB 92 / LSE poised to alter rules on disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange is poised to drop its requirement that market
makers publish details of large trades, reversing a move to greater
transparency taken a year ago.
However, the exchange's board is also due on Thursday to approve stricter
disclosure requirements for trading in overseas stocks on London's
successful SEAQ International.
The decisions will re-open the dispute over disclosure in the London market.
One large trader said the SEAQ decision could drive business abroad.
Market makers claim too much visibility alerts others to their positions,
exposing them to loss.
In the past, however, the Securities and Investments Board and the Office of
Fair Trading have pushed for greater rather than less, disclosure.
Publication of trades has also become the central issue in the row in the
European Community over the proposed Investment Services Directive.
At Thursday's meeting, the exchange's board will consider three important
changes to London trading: Details of large trades, which have to be
published within 90 minutes, will no longer be disclosed. Instead, an hourly
indication of trading volumes will be published on the exchange's 'ticker'.
The next day, the range of prices at which each stock was traded will be
disclosed.
The SIB and OFT are thought to be more sympathetic to the exchange's plans
than three years ago, when a switch to delayed trade publication prompted
criticisms that London was returning to its pre-Big Bang 'jobbers' cartel'.
Identical rules will be adopted for SEAQ. At present, the only information
published is the total daily trading volume in each stock, disclosed the
next day.
Bringing the UK and international markets together is part of the exchange's
strategy to create a European market in London.
Arrangements will be introduced to protect private shareholders, who
otherwise would suffer from the lower visibility.
The exchange plans to introduce a central 'limit order book' on which
investors can lodge prices at which they want to buy and sell stocks. When a
large trade passes through the market at a better price, individual
investors' orders will be given priority and completed automatically.
A similar arrangement operates in New York and Paris.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Setback for Tsongas in Maine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ATLANTA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN for the US Democratic presidential nomination by Mr Paul
Tsongas, winner of last week's New Hampshire primary, appeared last night to
be in danger of losing momentum as votes were counted in a caucus in
neighbouring Maine.
With 80 per cent of the votes counted in the state, Mr Tsongas had seven
delegates to the national convention and was edged out by Mr Jerry Brown,
the former California governor, whose reward for campaigning hard on his
anti-corruption crusade was eight delegates.
The outcome was a surprise because Mr Tsongas had been expected to build in
Maine on his success elsewhere in New England. However, he had not
campaigned as intensely as Mr Brown, preferring to demonstrate strength
beyond his New England base.
The national front-runner among the Democrats, Mr Bill Clinton of Arkansas,
had sought to shore up his support in the south and Maine yielded him only
three delegates.
Vice-president Dan Quayle was meanwhile defending President George Bush's
record from rightwing criticism by Mr Pat Buchanan, who - although well
beaten by the president in Maine - has mounted a challenge for the
Republican presidential nomination.
Mr Quayle on television described Mr Bush as 'a good conservative' and
commended the jobs package in the budget unveiled last month as a
non-political, pro-family initiative.
However, he immediately went on to acknowledge that it would 'play well in
middle America'.
The Democratic candidates face a gruelling test over the next two weeks,
with 22 states holding their primaries or caucuses, culminating in the
11-state 'Super Tuesday' ballot on March 10.
Last night all five candidates were due to face each other in debate again
in South Dakota, where Tuesday's primary may provide the first winnowing of
the field.
Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa are competing
fiercely there; a loss could prove fatal for one or both.
Mr Tsongas has been gaining on Mr Clinton since his victory in New Hampshire
on Tuesday.
A New York Times/CBS poll at the weekend showed Mr Clinton leading by just
five points (29 per cent to 24 per cent). Before the New Hampshire primary,
one Gallup poll showed Mr Clinton with 42 per cent to just 9 per cent for Mr
Tsongas.
Mr Tsongas sought to consolidate his gains with an interview in which he was
frank in recognising the health fears that surround his candidacy.
He said he had been searching for over a year for a 'superbly qualified'
candidate to run with him, in anticipation of questions about his health as
an ex-cancer sufferer.
With 10 days to go before its primary, Georgia is relishing its role as the
first southern state to vote in the presidential nomination campaign.
Georgia should be home territory for Mr Clinton, who has spent 10 years as
governor of a southern state and who has close links with many of Georgia's
centrist Democrats.
Virtually the entire Democratic establishment - from Governor Zell Miller to
Senator Sam Nunn and most of the state assembly - have endorsed his
candidacy.
But Mr Clinton needs a good result to show he has laid to rest the
difficulties that have dogged his campaign - stories he says are about 'a
woman I didn't sleep with and a draft I didn't dodge'. In the south, with
its conservative family values and strong military tradition, these issues
could be more damaging to Mr Clinton than they proved to be in New
Hampshire.
Maryland is shaping up as another vital battleground. Almost every elected
official in the state below governor has endorsed Mr Clinton but Mr Tsongas
has been picking up strength among more affluent voters.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Cyprus may face beds shortage as it woos the tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKE your next holiday in Cyprus, a Pounds 1m advertising campaign told UK
television viewers last year. With the Gulf war over and war-wracked
Yugoslavia off the tourist map, the Cypriot effort was resoundingly
successful.
So successful indeed that travel companies now fear the number of Britons
arriving in Cyprus this summer might exceed the beds available by as many as
50,000.
The Cyprus Tourist Office is struggling to match demand and supply. UK
travel companies and hoteliers in Cyprus are being warned that bookings are
above expectations.
Tour operators in other European countries are being told that the British,
who traditionally account for more than 40 per cent of Cyprus's visitors,
have already booked many of the rooms.
Travel companies give the tourist office high marks for the speed with which
it has acted. 'Of all the tourist offices, they're probably the most
responsive,' says Mr Roger Allard, managing director of Owners Abroad, the
UK holiday company.
Other operators are worried, however. Mr George Marcall, sales director of
Airtours, another large tour company, insists his customers will get the
holiday they booked. He is not certain all operators can say the same.
Alarm bells rang last month, when Cyprus's share of UK summer package
holiday sales reached 12 per cent, double the previous year's level.
The island's hoteliers were, however, hit by the Gulf war last year. Worried
about another poor season, many sold the same bed to more than one tour
operator to ensure that their hotels would be filled. Tour operators say
this is not unusual.
However if current sales trends continue, there could be 800,000 British
package tourists this summer. Mr Orestis Rossides, the Cyprus Tourist
Office's London director, says there are only about 750,00 beds available
for them.
Mr Rossides promises that no one will have to sleep on the beach. Tourists
whose rooms fail to materialise will be moved to the less crowded
establishments - with the hoteliers bearing the cost.

FT  24 FEB 92 / TUC plans cuts as membership falls: General-secretary Willis
seeks to reduce staff numbers by up to a fifth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress is planning to cut staff numbers by up to a fifth
as part of a package of cost-cutting measures forced on it by a steep
decline in union members.
Proposals include implementation for the first time of a programme for early
retirement and voluntary severance among the 250-strong staff.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general-secretary, says in a paper to be discussed by
union leaders today that there could be a deficit of more than Pounds
500,000 this year, against a targeted surplus of Pounds 500,000, unless
action is taken. The document provides a graphic example of how the TUC and
its affiliates are struggling to cope with growing membership losses on top
of the 4m recorded since 1979, when they had a combined total of more than
12m.
The planned staff cuts would be the second in two years. In the first
programme, about 30 jobs were cut through natural wastage from a total staff
of 280, the highest number ever.
Mr Willis wants to trim the pay bill of about Pounds 2.5m by 20 per cent. He
suggests a reduction in staff numbers and departments and a revised
structure for senior posts.
The plans were drawn up after a confidential survey of TUC affiliates'
memberships.
Although Mr Willis does not reveal the results in his report, two unions -
the AEU engineers and the FTAT furniture workers - have admitted a 10 per
cent decline in the past year and other unions are likely to be similarly
affected.
The TUC will suffer because the amount each affiliate pays to it each year
is based on its membership. This year the affiliation fee for each member is
Pounds 1.23. Mr Willis says the problems follow accumulated deficits since
1989 in the administration fund, used to run the TUC, of Pounds 1.165m. This
has come from reserves which stand at Pounds 3.28m.
The report, which will be discussed today by the TUC's finance and general
purposes committee, says it is unlikely that an economic upturn will result
in any real improvement in TUC affiliation numbers before 1995.
It acknowledges that unions are unlikely to accept anything more than a
modest increase in affiliation fees. These have already risen 23 per cent
from the Pounds 1 a member of 1990.
Mr Willis suggests the introduction of a formula for future affiliation fee
rises based on the average rise in union subscription rates.
He plans to take more detailed proposals to next month's finance and general
purposes committee meeting with the intention of implementing changes 'as
speedily as possible'.

FT  24 FEB 92 / CBI queries value of Maastricht opt-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry has expressed doubts about the
economic value of Britain's 'opt-out' from an extension of European
Community competence in the social and employment field.
A paper approved by the CBI's governing council last month continues in
principle to support the opt-out from the EC's so-called Social Chapter,
negotiated at the European Council summit in Maastricht in December.
However, the paper states: 'There is unlikely to be any lasting advantage to
UK businesses if the rest of the EC is handicapped by a labour and social
affairs regime characterised by a centralised approach to determining
employment conditions.'
This assessment seems to challenge government claims that the 'opt-out'
would benefit Britain's economy by attracting foreign investors.
The CBI says that if the 11 EC members, minus the UK, decide to establish
new employment directives, British business will still be affected. 'All
directives would bear immediately on the operations of UK companies
elsewhere in the EC, and perhaps one day on their activities at home.'
That view reflects the feelings of some personnel directors in UK
multinationals who regret that Britain will have no influence over
employment policy drawn up by the 11. They fear that political or legal
pressure will eventually nullify the opt-out.
A personnel director of a leading UK industrial group, whose chairman
publicly supported the opt-out in December, said: 'The UK multinationals get
it in the neck with this agreement. We would rather have seen Britain stay
with the other 11 and fight its corner on employment matters, and I know my
chairman agrees with me.'
Nonetheless, the CBI paper says the opt-out has prevented some problems from
'becoming more acute'. It also draws some comfort from the controversial
agreement between the European employers federation, UNICE, and the European
Trades Union Congress (ETUC), which allows the two bodies to scrutinise and
propose employment legislation.
That agreement, included in the 'protocol' on employment policy signed by
the 11, was dismissed as 'Euro-corporatism' by some UK ministers. But the
CBI says: 'The agreement will at least provide EC employers with some
ability to protect themselves from burdensome regulation now that the UK
government's vote in the Council is no longer there.'
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, who was angered by the agreement
between UNICE and the ETUC, last week sharply criticised the EC employers'
organisations in general and UNICE in particular.
He told the American Chamber of Commerce in London: 'Dialogue between
employers in Europe is inadequate and UNICE is too Brussels-oriented and
spends too much time trying to lobby the Commission, which is not a fruitful
exercise.' He said he wanted to see employers lobby their own governments
more on EC employment policy.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: Uruguay Round, third of a loaf is better than no
bread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ROY DENMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf attacks yet once again the European Community as the evil
empire of world trade ('The perils of tunnel vision', February 18).
The Uruguay Round has suffered from a number of difficulties. Over the years
the scope of these periodic set piece negotiations has steadily widened. And
recession and elections do not now help to put together a final deal. But
the biggest difficulty of all lay in the vastly over-ambitious American bid
on agriculture - initially that all subsidies distorting trade should be
abolished. This was a mistake for several reasons.
The GATT has learnt to work on the basis that progress can best be achieved
incrementally. No one demanded at the outset of the Kennedy Round (1960s) or
the Tokyo Round (1970s) that industrial tariffs should be abolished. But a
third was lopped off each time; tariffs are now a fraction of what they were
when the GATT started in 1947.
The proposal was a piece of American bluff. It was not a proposal by the US
government. It was a proposal by the executive branch. This can suggest
anything which comes into its head. What matters is what congress decides.
Anyone who thinks that congress would be willing to cut substantially the
massive federal subsidies to dairy farmers, to give only one example, is
either wrong in the head or has never been to Wisconsin.
The result of this grandstanding has been that for years no sensible
discussion of agriculture was possible. Not only is it now dangerously late
in the day to reach agreement, but the gap between the American proposals -
even if now modified - and reality is still big enough for a humiliating
climb back from a far out limb to be difficult to accomplish.
That the Community needs to cut its agricultural subsidies is not in
question. The question is how much how soon. A cut of about a third is all
that is politically possible in 1992 - more will come later. Its partners
need to recognise that this is the most that can be got now, just as their
partners need to recognise that the Americans will do little or nothing to
cut their barriers to agricultural imports and nothing to liberalise air and
maritime transport, that the Japanese will do little to liberalise imports
of rice, and the Australians little to cut their monstrously high industrial
tariffs. But a respectable deal can still be picked up off the table. It is
worth reflecting that a third of the loaf, with more to come, is better than
no bread and a wolf eating your rear end.

How times change. The first British TV documentary on the Royal family in
1969 was watched by an estimated 23m people, a good 40 per cent more than
watched Coronation Street, the most popular TV soap opera at that time.
By contrast, the latest audience research estimates show that 17.9m watched
Elizabeth R, the most ambitious documentary yet to be made about the Queen's
life. This was 2.5m fewer than watched Coronation Street and means that the
Queen also trailed behind EastEnders and Jeremy Beadle's You've been framed.
Since 1969 the number of TV licences has increased from 15.5m to 19.5m.

Judging the importance of the Institutional Investor magazine's annual
ranking of London's stockbroker research teams is like assessing the outcome
of the New Hampshire primaries. The results get everyone rattled but no one
really knows what they mean.
SG Warburg has dislodged James Capel from the top spot in the all-Europe
research table which is in line with the outcome of last year's more
thorough Extel Financial survey. BZW has held its number four position
whereas it dropped from third to sixth position in the Extel survey. But the
oddest performance is County NatWest's. It comes top in terms of UK equity
research but drops from third to sixth position in terms of its overall
ranking.
Will it be enough to persuade Lord Alexander to drop his 'make a profit or
we will close you down' ultimatum? Observer thinks not.

There may be doubt about Poland's economic reforms, but at least the country
should not be without a finance minister for much longer. Andrzej
Olechowski, the deputy foreign trade minister, is tipped to take over the
hot seat.
A tall, silver-haired 45-year-old, Olechowski first came to prominence as a
disc jockey on Polish radio in the early 1970s. By 1981, he was working at
IKC, the Trade Ministry's research institute, where he set up Solidarity's
first cell in the government administrafirst days of martial law, produced a
report reminding the communist government that western sanctions would be
successful and that martial law had to be lifted soon.
After a stint at the World Bank, he returned to Poland's central bank, the
NBP, to run its relations with international financial institutions. When
Solidarity came to power, he was promoted to vice-chairman of the NBP,
before being given the job of handling the sensitive parts of Poland's
association agreement with the EC which was signed last December.
Well-regarded by the World Bank and the IMF, Olechowski's promotion could
help break the log-jam over the renegotiation of Poland's Dollars 10bn
commercial bank debt.

Guess where Chris Hani, general secretary of the South African Communist
Party, has chosen to educate his 10-year-old daughter?
Hani, one of the world's few remaining true believers in communism, has
enrolled his offspring at an elite Johannesburg private school. For R10,000
a year - more than the annual salary of most urban blacks - Lindiwe Hani is
attending Saheti school, a Greek private school where Greek language lessons
are compulsory. According to a Johannesburg newspaper, Hani chose the school
because he was 'interested in Greek culture and religion'.
He could not have been expected to send Lindiwe to a segregated black public
school in Soweto; but he could have chosen one of the many white schools
which have opened their doors to other races - at a fraction of the cost.

<TEXT>
Unlike most of Britain's construction industry chiefs, Tony Budge is
prepared for anything. Parked outside his company's Retford HQ are a Scud
missile-launcher, a squadron of ex-Soviet tanks and enough other second-hand
fighting vehicles to equip a third world army.
'I always wanted to be a Royal Engineer,' says the 52-year-old Budge, a keen
supporter of the military vehicle conservation group and active fundraiser
for the Army Benevolent Fund. But just as he was about to sign on, his
father was taken ill and the would-be sapper was press-ganged into the
family building company as a left-handed bricklayer. Then, after training as
a civil engineer, he started his own company A F Budge. His career has never
looked back.
As chairman of Britain's third biggest road-builder - the M62 corridor is
his main theatre - Budge is better placed than most publicly-quoted
competitors such as Tarmac, Wimpey and Laing. He avoided house-building, and
is gaining from the surge in government roadworks.
However, a recent expansion into open-cast mining had pushed gearing over
the 100 per cent mark. Hence the decision to sell Budge Mining - the UK's
biggest private coal-producer - to management led by his younger brother
Richard. Although the two brothers are going their separate ways they still
share an interest in the new Sheffield airport they are building.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Arts: A test for taste and political judgment - The debate
on the future of London is only just beginning / Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who is on the side of the angels? At this time politicians of all parties
would like us to believe that they have hot lines to the Almighty and that
the future of the country will be safe with them. When it comes to
architecture and the environment there is one body which is supposed to be
apolitical in its dealings and that is The Royal Fine Art Commission. It has
arranged an exhibition* to commemorate the work of the Commission since
1924.
The title of the exhibition, On the side of the angels? at least poses the
question. From the evidence selected for the exhibition, sometimes the
Commission has been on the side of the angels and sometimes it has not. The
RFAC inevitably suffers from the heavy presence of architects on its panels
who are often unwilling and, when you think about it, unlikely to want to
criticise their fellow professionals.
The current chairman of the Commission, Lord St John of Fawsley, seems to
have emphasised the 'Royal' rather than the 'Fine Art' side of the
Commission. In his foreword to the exhibition catalogue he lists with
positive glee the number of times he has entertained members of the Royal
family - speaking of their visits as 'unforgettable days'. This is no doubt
part of his job, but the actual grind of raising standards and awareness is
a more boring and less gracious activity. The Commission has no real powers
and so the catalogue of its achievements makes interesting but not crucial
reading.
What is far more crucial is the work and thought that are going on in the
offices and think tanks of our political parties. If it is true that the
environmental and architectural quality of the capital can be seen as a sort
of litmus paper - a test for taste and political judgment - then it is worth
considering how the parties see London and its future.
In a slightly covert way the Labour party has produced its thoughts on
London as a private enterprise Penguin book rather than part of a political
manifesto (A New London by Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher, Penguin Books,
Pounds 8.99). It is the second contribution from Mr Fisher, the MP for Stoke
on Trent, who also recently edited a series of essays on the state of our
cities (Whose Cities? edited by Mark Fisher and Ursula Owen, Penguin Books,
Pounds 5.99). The red rose joins the penguin in promoting Labour's ideas;
how long will it be before the rose is firmly held in the penguin's beak?
The Conservative party is preparing its answers about London and to date the
most convincing statement of its intentions for the capital remains the
lecture arranged by London Weekend Television and given by Michael Heseltine
last December, entitled 'The Future of London'. The evidence of Conservative
thinking of the last decade about the capital is, of course, also all around
those of us who live in or visit the capital.
By any standards the results of the free market and the political effects of
the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1985 are decidedly mixed. The
creation of the Enterprise Zone in London's Docklands and the establishment
of the London Docklands Development Corporation provide the best visible
evidence of Conservative policies for the capital. The results in visual and
planning terms, especially if judged as contributions to improving the
standards of life for ordinary mortals living in east London, are pretty
disastrous.
In their book Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher offer a powerful contribution
to the debate about cities. They offer the intriguing scenario of a Europe
dominated by what would amount to a series of city states. As national
boundaries change overnight and politicians and their followers swing in
eastern Europe with the abandonment of monkeys, perhaps the future of
civilisation will return to powerful urban fiefdoms run like the old
Venetian Republic. The opportunities are certainly there in Berlin, Prague,
St Petersburg and Warsaw, not to mention the beautiful old towns of the
Baltic that were once part of the Hanseatic League.
London, however you compare it with other European cities, has a lot to
offer. What it lacks at present is any clear vision for its future. Michael
Heseltine sees that as a financial centre London is well ahead in Europe,
although it lags behind New York and Tokyo. As a civilised city to live in
London certainly scores higher than either New York or Tokyo. As an
architectural and cultural city London is still outclassed only by Paris.
No one can claim that any of the new developments in Docklands have
significantly added to our architectural heritage. Those who praise the
American-style Canary Wharf should realise that it offers what should be the
basic minimum standards for any commercial development. What is so
exceptional about marble and fountains? Londoners should demand them, not be
asked to praise them as gifts from god-like developers.
The Rogers/Fisher book and the Heseltine offering both share certain
objectives while disagreeing about how to reach them. More attention to be
paid to the River Thames? - this is an area where all could agree. New
commercial developments to the east of the city? - surely only if the quid
pro quo is an incredible improvement in the deplorable housing stock in too
many London boroughs. New transport policies? - all agree that these are
needed, but who is to pay? A new London government? - is there a place for
another GLC that was spending one billion pounds, when it was abolished, on
only seven per cent of the capital's services? Again, who is to pay?
One perpetually recurring but relatively minor problem has been the need for
a new life for Somerset House, one of the great public buildings in the city
yet at present still mainly occupied by civil servants. Heseltine has asked
for ideas and a prompt response came last week from a newly formed Somerset
House Group. This is a gathering of cultural, educational and business
organisations brought together under the auspices of King's College and The
Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture to prepare exciting plans for
this wasted palace on the Thames. Their initial offerings for multiple
cultural use look promising.
The debate about the future of London is just beginning. The important thing
is that the subject is now high on the political and architectural agenda -
where it belongs.
*The Royal Fine Art Commission, 7 St James's Square, until next weekend.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Economics: View on world slowdown awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEGREE to which the world economy faces a slowdown this year will be
indicated in a rash of economic figures published over the next few days.
One of the highlights for statistical aficionados will be the revised
figures on Friday for growth of US gross domestic product in the final
quarter of last year, measured on an annual basis. Financial markets are
looking for a figure of around 0.7 per cent, indicating that the
much-flagged US recovery may be under way.
Meanwhile, the apparent slowdown in the Japanese economy has provided
shivers of apprehension to onlookers who have become accustomed to Japan
acting as an engine of world expansion.
Analysts believe Japanese industrial production in January, to be announced
on Wednesday, will have shown virtually no change on the month before,
signifying a difficult period ahead for the economy.
In the UK, the only economic indicator of note will be released on Thursday,
when the government publishes details of last month's current account
deficit. This is expected to be slightly higher than December's figure of
Pounds 688m.
Other data from France, Germany and Italy are likely to indicate the poor
conditions for growth that are apparent in these nations, adding to the
shroud which hangs over the world economic outlook.
Highlights of the week are as follows. The figures in brackets are
forecasts, provided by MMS, a business information company.
Today: US, January Treasury Budget (deficit of Dollars 12bn); France,
fourth-quarter GDP growth (0.2 per cent on previous quarter); New Zealand,
January trade surplus (NZDollars 100m); Canada, December wholesale trade (up

Tomorrow: US, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in testimony to Senate
banking committee, January home sales, February index of consumer confidence
(51.5 per cent), car sales for period February 11-20; France, January trade
deficit (FFr3bn).
Wednesday: US, January durable goods orders (up 1 per cent on month) and
shipments; UK, January building society net new commitments (Pounds 2.5bn),
quarterly review from National Institute of Economic and Social Research;
Japan, January retail sales (up 2.3 per cent on year) and industrial
production (no change on month); Australia, December manufacturing output
and input price index, January vehicle registrations (up 1.4 per cent on
month); Canada, January industrial product price index, (up 0.2 per cent on
month).
Thursday: US, Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady speaks to Senate banking
committee, January export and import price indices, money supply data for
week ending February 17 (M1 growth of Dollars 5.5bn, M2  - Dollars 4.8bn, M3
 -Dollars 9bn), jobless claims for week ending February 15 (450,000); UK,
January visible trade deficit (Pounds 750m) and current account deficit
(Pounds 450m); France, January consumer price index, (up 0.3 per cent on
month, 3 per cent on year); Japan, December spending by consumers, and
personal income growth; Australia, December manufacturing output; Canada,
December earnings (up 4.8 per cent on year).
Friday: US, fourth-quarter GDP growth (up 0.7 per cent over year, on basis
of quarter-on-quarter change), fourth-quarter GDP deflator (1.7 per cent),
February agriculture prices, January bank credit and commercial and
industrial loans; Japan, January trade surplus (Dollars 6.5bn), January

these items), January construction orders (down 10.9 per cent on year) and
housing starts (down 20 per cent) and construction starts (down 10.3 per
cent); Canada, fourth-quarter GDP increase (up 0.8 per cent on annualised
basis).
During the week: Germany, January import prices (down 0.3 per cent on month,
2.8 per cent on year), February cost of living index (up 0.4 per cent on
month, 4.2 per cent on year); Switzerland, consumer price indices; Italy,

FT  24 FEB 92 / Management: Hit for six by a demanding Swedish mistress -
How a British factory tried to scramble out from the bottom of the heap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That day in October 1990 was one of the worst in Roddy MacLeod's life. He
learnt that his British factory was hopelessly inefficient and unproductive
compared with its continental European counterparts.
MacLeod runs the British arm of Esab, the Swedish welding products
manufacturer, which two years ago decided to rank all its European plants in
terms of productivity. The British factory, based in Waltham Cross,
Hertfordshire, came last of six on all counts - including costs per hour and
output per hour - and was getting worse.
With overcapacity in the industry, it was not certain that Esab needed six
factories, putting the very existance of the plant in doubt. The way to
recovery has involved some painful decisions, but the experience shows how a
factory, when threatened, can be mobilised to come to terms with a problem.
The Waltham Cross plant is Esab's main UK factory, accounting for about half
its Pounds 50m UK sales. It has been making electrodes since the 1930s and
as factories go, it is not a pretty site. These days it is a high-speed
operation where traditional methods can occasionally be glimpsed amid the
serried ranks of wire drawing machines. For some products, cakes of paste
used as the outer coating of electrodes are thrown together by hand.
The plant was bought from BOC in 1983 when Esab was snapping up welding
businesses from multinationals as diverse as Philips and GKN. After
rationalisation in the mid-1980s, it had three good years from 1987 to 1989
before coming a cropper over new technology.
A new Japanese machine was installed to automate the manufacture of slugs of
paste which coat the electrode. Unfortunately, the executive behind the
decision failed to pass on his vision to colleagues. To maintain production,
Esab was forced to use the machine before anyone on the shopfloor understood
it. It ended up continually going wrong, and increasing, rather than saving
costs.
Although it contributed to the relatively poor financial performance, the
episode was a blessing in disguise. The lesson it taught management about
communication would prepare it for a wider battle ahead for the future of
the factory.
The first thing to be done was to improve communication with the workforce
of nearly 300. This began very much as a one-way process, when the facts
about the factory's performance were laid bare at large meetings with
employees.
The aim was to ensure, as current management jargon puts it, that everyone
at the plant 'owned' the problem. But the meetings also coincided with the
UK's entry into the ERM, and MacLeod was keen to offset media euphoria about
lower interest rates with a few home thoughts on the discipline imposed by
stable exchange rates.
In November 1990, two-way communication began through a series of 35 small
meetings with eight to 10 employees each. Their were four key questions on
the agenda:
How can individuals improve their performance?
How can my department perform better?
How can our department help others?
What can other departments do to help us?
The deluge of suggestions on the last point indicated how little thought had
hitherto been given to such questions.
Helped by a favourable wage settlement and more flexible working
arrangements, such as staggered tea and lunch breaks, the factory began to
show vague signs of improved performance in early 1991.
A longer-term plan was developed based on reducing costs while maintaining
employees' commitment. MacLeod, perhaps fortunately, was not to know until
March that head office in Gothenburg was looking closely at capacity issues,
with initial calculations pointing to the closure of Waltham Cross.
But the plant was reprieved by virtue of the changes already made and the
confidence that improvements would continue. A succession of measures
throughout 1991 maintained this momentum.
The need for more efficiency and the impact of the recession produced two
rounds of early retirements and redundancies, reducing the workforce by 50.
In June, head office approval for a second new production line sealed the
future, but this time proper training was given, and a less automated, more
flexible technique used to allow small-batch production and thus increase
responsiveness to customer's needs.
By October, a second meeting of the six factories' production managers
revealed that Waltham Cross was now fourth best.
Last month, the 180 remaining employees at Waltham Cross learnt that the
plant had swung from a Pounds 500,000 loss in 1990 to a Pounds 1.01m profit
last year, despite lower volumes which dented profits by Pounds 800,000.
MacLeod's target now is to be second in the Esab league this year and to
challenge the German plant for the top spot next year.

FT  24 FEB 92 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the consumer products group, reports tomorrow its fourth-quarter
and full-year figures. With the US poised uncertainly between recession and
recovery, the UK economy still in the doldrums and growth petering out in
continental Europe, the results will depend on Unilever's success in cutting
costs to improve margins.
Analysts' forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits range from Pounds 1.8bn to
Pounds 1.84bn, a modest increase on 1990's Pounds 1.78bn. Much of the
difference between the forecasts is due to assumptions about how Unilever
will allocate extraordinary charges incurred during the year.
British Gas will report results for the 12 months to December 31 on
Thursday. This year the company is changing its accounting year-end from
March 31 to December 31, so it will also supply a figure for the nine months
to December 31. Most analysts expect profit before tax for the year to
December to be between Pounds 1.24bn and Pounds 1.28bn. British Gas has
already indicated it will announce a full-year dividend of 6p.
The City will be most interested in finding out about the company's talks
with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) over OFT proposals to halve British
Gas's industrial market and hand its pipeline business to another company.
British Gas has so far resisted the OFT's proposals and is being threatened
with a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
UK insurers are bracing themselves to report some of the worst-ever results
in the history of the industry next week. Two composites (general and life
companies) - Commercial Union and Royal Insurance - report next week. Both
will post losses for 1991. CU, which reports on Wednesday, will do best with
a loss restricted to between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m compared with a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.4m last year. Royal Insurance, which reports on
Thursday, has been devastated by losses from mortgage indemnity claims and
could see its losses rise to between Pounds 270m and Pounds 310m, up from
Pounds 187m in 1990.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, reports its full-year results tomorrow. Analysts expect the company
will for the first time make a Pounds 1bn profit compared with Pounds 860m
last year.
Analysts will be looking carefully at the growth rate of SmithKline's
pharmaceuticals sales which have been slower than some of its rivals. In
particular, they will be looking carefully at revenues from Kytril,
SmithKline's treatment for nausea in cancer patients. It competes directly
with Glaxo's Zofran.
ICI, the chemicals giant, reports its full-year results on Thursday and is
expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 835m. The figures are
unlikely to demonstrate any sign of an upturn in demand for commodity
chemicals. Attention will be focused on the pharmaceuticals division (about
70 per cent of group profit) and progress of the company's rationalisation
programme. The final dividend is expected to be kept at 34p.
Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is expected on Thursday to
announce increased pre-tax profits of about Pounds 170m (Pounds 126m) for
the year to December 1991.
The increase was mainly due to last year's acquisition of Yale &amp; Valor, the
locks and domestic appliances group. After its recently failed hostile bid
for Racal Electronics the group is aiming to increase profits from organic
growth and agreed takeovers. UK COMPANIES TODAY

FT  24 FEB 92 / The Mood of Britain: Scots landscape that will shape the
political map - Skye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Elgol on the Isle of Skye to Treorchy deep in the Rhondda, the British
electorate is preparing to make its choice. As decision day approaches, the
nation remains tantalisingly undecided, fed up with the fall-out from
recession and yet suspicious of a reconstructed Labour party offering a
fresh start. In the first of five articles, Michael Cassell takes to the
road to see how Britain and the British have changed during 13 years of
Conservative rule and to identify their hopes and expectations for the 1990s
TOM McEache yelled into the wind from the dripping deck of the ferry Loch
Fyne as it crossed the sea to Skye: 'They won't be naming anything after
Thatcher up here. But there's a farmer near Drumnadrochit with an old nag
called Maggie.'
McEache, a van driver on the road from Inverness to Portree, the
pocket-capital of Scotland's 'misty isle', filled the five-minute crossing
between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin with language calculated to curl the
former prime minister's coiffure. He recalls hearing the radio announcement
that she was being made redundant: 'I swear I nearly put the truck in Loch
Ness.'
Alex Finlayson, a hotel worker en route to see Dunvegan Castle - seat of the
Clan Macleod and where a lock of Bonnie Prince Charlie's hair lies - added a
touch of local knowledge: 'Not many people know she crawled out of Loch Ness
in the first place.'
McEache and Finlayson would not have helped Margaret Thatcher win her fourth
term. But she could have counted on Roderick Fraser, a salesman from Oban
nursing a badly dented Sierra. The Plock of Kyle disappeared into the mist
behind him: 'She bit Britain in the bum. Now we're going back to sleep.'
Passengers on the Loch Fyne, along with the rest of the electorate, were
denied by faint-hearted Tory MPs the opportunity to give their ballot-box
verdict on the woman who tried to change Britain.
But in spite of Thatcher's ruthless removal and the subsequent Tory
enthusiasm for resetting the political clock at zero, the general election
contest ahead will be fought on a political landscape of which she remains
the principal architect.
Many of the issues over which the combatants will clash are those that she
identified as worthy of her reforming zeal. Much of the battleground they
cover in the weeks ahead will centre on her successes and failures.
The election will test whether Thatcher inspired an enduring revolution in
attitudes and aspirations on which John Major - successfully distanced from
her more strident postures - can build a fourth successive Conservative
election victory, even at a time of deep recession.
Residents on Skye, first port of call on a journey through Britain to test
the nation's mood as decision-day ap-proaches, accept that the 1980s brought
big changes to a remote corner of the kingdom.
The majority of the residents have grown more prosperous but are reluctant
to give credit to southern, Tory values or to anything else emanating from
Westminster.
Caledonian MacBrayne's ferry service is itself witness to change. The
summertime flow of traffic between the mainland and the island now means
long, impatient queues and occasional roadside punch-ups.
The solution is to build Scotland's first privately-financed toll bridge, a
Pounds 23m project which will render Skye a less magical, more readily
accessible, place.
Most islanders want the bridge. But they are angry at plans for very high
toll fees which, they claim, have the fingerprints of Thatcherism all over
them.
Just as privately-financed public bridges may have been unthinkable 10 years
ago, so was European finance for the local roads. But now they have been
improved with the help of welcome cash from the European Community. In the
1975 referendum the islanders told Brussels to get lost. Now the EC emblem
lines the road to Broadford, which broods quietly under the great domes of
the Red Hills.
George Forsyth, a sprightly pensioner, gives directions to Elgol, the hamlet
on Loch Scavaig where the Bonnie Prince left for the mainland. He accepts a
short lift. 'We can have the bridge but only if we pay for it ourselves over
25 years. What's the point in cutting taxes if we have to cough up extra for
things the government should provide?' he asks.
'Who wants lower income tax if it means Portree has to wait eight years for
a new high school? It's about time we got back to talking about the common
good and heard less about personal gain.'
Personal enrichment for most British people during the 1980s was drawn from
the deepening pool of home ownership, the ripples of which reached as far as
Skye.
There are plenty of pensioners like Forsyth on the island, many of them
immigrants from England who exploited escalating property values to resettle
where Pounds 65,000 can buy a stone-built home with dramatic views of the
bald, black Cuillin Hills.
Harry and Olive Jackson from Chester share a sandwich on the chilly shore of
Loch Sligachan and wait for the Raasay ferry. Olive regards the spread of
home ownership - up from 55 per cent in 1979 to 67 per cent now - as a
permanent achievement of Thatcher. 'People used to be trapped. But we bought
our council house, moved to something nicer and can now afford to retire up
here. She made that possible and she'll always be welcome in my house.'
There is, however, another side to the influx of comfortably-off newcomers
who have settled in spots such as Glendale, dubbed 'Little England' and
boasting views across Loch Pooltiel to the outer isles. It is best
illustrated by the drab caravan parks which are home for those without
permanent foundations under their feet.
Along with the Jacksons, many tenants on Skye bought their homes during the
last decade - some of the 1m British families who did so. But the supply of
replacement public sector homes is very limited and waiting lists have
grown.
Ian McCormack, campaigning editor of the West Highland Free Press, with its
adverts for winkle pickers and Gaelic-speaking childminders, says the local
housing situation reflects a wider, political complaint: 'Some undoubtedly
have done very well for themselves but at what cost to the others?
'There is a flurry of homeless cases in the spring when landlords repossess
properties to rent out to holidaymakers. Those thrown out try and find a
caravan or may have to leave the island altogether.'
He reckons the island's revived prowess at shinty - a demonic form of hockey
for which the wise don helmets and face-guards - is because youngsters
remain on Skye as there is no work available on the mainland.
Jim Hunter, a historian who lives in a modernised crofters' cottage above
the road to Flora MacDonald's grave, challenges the image of continuing
decline and lack of employment: 'Since the 1840s, the island's population
has fallen. But the trend has been reversed and there are more jobs. Pride
and self-confidence has grown, reviving interest in local culture and
language.'
Hunter is not alone in identifying an upsurge in local enterprise on an
island where every croft arguably represents the perfect working model of
self-help. 'There is less dependency and more self-motivation,' he says.
In another snug crofter's cottage, flanked by a couple of inquisitive dogs,
George Campbell, director of the Scottish Crofters' Union, says the
mechanisms and agencies for stimulating enterprise have improved.
He believes living standards have risen but, in spite of national consumer
debt standing three and a half times higher than a decade ago, says
islanders have ignored the siren voices calling on them to borrow more.
It is, perhaps, the same Presbyterian streak which has led most crofters, in
spite of their anger, to pay their poll tax. But he is concerned by what he
sees as a steady erosion of community spirit in a place with only 9,000
permanent residents: 'The collectivist approach is waning. People have
become more individualistic.'
Even so, the institutions of community life on Skye are jealously guarded.
Plans for just one private bed at the McKinnon Memorial Hospital in
Broadford were ditched following a right old 'stushie' which reverberated
from Score Bay to the Aird of Sleat.
Jim Ross, a coach driver leaving Skye on the Loch Fyne, volunteers: 'Most of
us are born in hospital and most of us die there. The NHS is ours and not
for politicians of any party to play around with. Labour won't slice it
away, though I don't see them being able to spend much more on it.'
In Glasgow, beyond a slush-covered Glencoe, the Herald's front page reports
the gathering storm on proposed trust status for some of Scotland's finest
hospitals.
But in The Curlers pub on the busy Byres Road, talk is of the Rangers v St
Mirren match at Ibrox and of players with doubtful Gaelic names such as
Kuznetsov and Mikhailichenko.
Thatcher, of course, even made her mark on football. Joe Gillespie, a
fireman in need of a pint after Saturday morning shopping, says her attitude
to the sport was symbolic.
'I think she despised all sorts of people she knew nothing about and wasn't
interested in,' he says. 'She branded all football fans as louts, in the
same way she saw the poor as lazy spongers who needed a kick up the ass. Got
one herself in the end, didn't she?'
Further articles in the series will appear throughout this week.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Generators accused of overcharging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTRICITY industry is overcharging consumers for the power generated
from coal, according to Mr Malcolm Edwards, commercial director of British
Coal.
His criticism has intensified the pre-election row over electricity prices,
and follows a strongly worded statement from Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy
secretary, that consumers are not benefiting from electricity privatisation.
Mr Edwards said: 'The generators now have a perfectly legitimate way of
fixing the market.' They were pushing up the price of coal-fired power and
keeping the profit. If they would admit that coal could provide competitive
electricity, British Coal would be saved from the likelihood of having to
close all but a dozen pits, he said.
Mr Edwards said the old coal-fired power stations of England and Wales could
produce electricity at between 1.8p and 2.2p a unit.
This meant that the two electricity generators could easily offer the
regional electricity companies, which supply consumers, power at 2.5p a
unit, 'and make a perfectly reasonable profit'.
Instead, he suggested, they were offering power at closer to 3p a unit, and
keeping the difference.
He admitted that coal stations could not sell at 2.5p if they used British
Coal's coal at an average present price to the generators of 185p a
gigajoule, or unit of energy from coal. But British Coal would only need to
cut the price to 'a perfectly respectable' 160p to make coal-fired
electricity at 2.5p feasible. At 160p, Mr Edwards said, British Coal would
not be forced to close many pits.
Mr Edwards said he believed the generators could be deliberately keeping
electricity prices high, because they were committed to building new
gas-fired power stations, which he estimated would produce power at closer
to 3p. They would then close the old coal stations.
The generators hit back at Mr Edwards, saying they could not sell power more
cheaply and survive.
National Power said: 'We are not closing anything that is cheaper than the
new stations, only the older, smaller stations.'
The company said it would not invest in new gas stations that would produce
power at 2.8p or above, and suggested that electricity from its stations
would be closer to the 2.62p price charged by Nuclear Electric, whose
auction of electricity contracts broadly sets the market price. Some large
customers could get prices of closer to 2.2p, if they avoided peak-demand
periods, the company added.
It pointed out that it had to cover the cost of fitting scrubbing equipment
to old power stations to comply with environmental legislation and the cost
of plant it had to keep in reserve to ensure customers' lights did not go
off. 'Our results show we have not been profiteering,' the company said.
PowerGen said that present British Coal prices translated into electricity
at 2p a unit, before the cost of labour, capital, maintenance and other
services.
The company said: 'When investors in this company purchased it for Pounds
1.8bn, it was not on the assumption that it was going to convert British
Coal into electricity and nothing else.'
It added, however, that some independent gas-fired projects which had
purchased gas expensively would probably not be able to produce electricity
much below 3p.

<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS INDUSTRIES, the UK defence and aerospace components manufacturer, is
expected to announce at the Singapore Air Show this week five new aerospace
contracts worth more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 57m).
The new business involves four contracts for commercial aircraft and an
avionics contract for the US strategic defence initiative.
The commercial aircraft contracts cover the development and production of
the primary warning system for the new McDonnell Douglas MD-90 twin-engine
aircraft due to enter service in 1994; retrofit fuel gauging for American
Airlines Boeing 727 jets; a new flight management system for Boeing 737s;
and a contract from Singapore Airlines for the supply of enhanced flight
management computer systems for its fleet of Airbus A310 wide-body aircraft.
The military contract involves the supply of a fibre-optic gyro system for
the missile division of Hughes Aircraft for one of the US strategic defence
initiative programmes.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Confectioners fear Gatt effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S confectionery ex-porters have attacked the dearth of information
available from the European Community to measure the impact on their
industry of proposed world farm trade reforms.
They fear they are to be made 'sacrificial lambs' as European Community farm
ministers - forced to cut agriculture subsidies - try to spare farmers at
the expense of exporters of processed foods.
Mr Paul Williamson, vice-president of the Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and
Confectionery Alliance, said 6,000 jobs could be at stake - almost 7 per
cent of the 90,000 staff employed by the alliance's 200 members companies.
Anxiety focuses on a draft proposal for liberalisation of the world trading
system, released just two months ago by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general
of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
In the report Mr Dunkel has proposed a 20 per cent cut in domestic support
for EC farmers, but a 36 per cent cut in subsidies for farm exports.
The export subsidy cuts, still fiercely contested by EC farm ministers, are
intended to stem the European practice of dumping farm produce on the world
markets as a means of reducing surpluses arising from the heavily subsidised
domestic industry.
Association members, which include companies like Cadbury, Lyons and United
Biscuits, fear EC ministers will fudge the figures, shifting the weight of
subsidy cuts on to processed food exporters, which at present can reclaim
the difference between European and world prices for sugar, milk and cereal
when they sell outside the EC.
Mr Williamson said: 'These are the most important trade negotiations of my
working lifetime. Twenty per cent of our business is affected, and we just
don't know what the data is underpinning the Dunkel proposals. How can we
evaluate the likely impact of the proposals? World leaders are going into
negotiations not knowing what the proposals mean.'
Fears were heightened in the House of Lords two weeks ago when Baroness
Trumpington, minister of state for agriculture, conceded that 'internal
prices would come down very little (under the Dunkel proposals) so that
community processors would continue to face higher raw material costs than
their overseas competitors. But export refunds might be so constrained that
they would no longer bridge the gap.'

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Continuing economic weakness seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL sluggishness, a high savings ratio and tight monetary policy
in Germany suggest a weak UK economic outlook for this year, according to
the London Business School.
The economy will start to recover in the second quarter, thanks to some
relaxation of monetary and fiscal policy, but it will be next year before
output regains a growth rate of 2.5 per cent, by which time unemployment
will have reached 2 3/4 m, says the school.
In their latest economic forecast, built on the assumption that the
Conservatives will win the general election, authors Mr Geoffrey Dicks and
Professor David Currie say that output will grow by 1.2 per cent this year
and by 0.8 per cent in manufacturing.
The report says there is no sign that consumer borrowing is about to
recover. The authors have reversed an earlier forecast that the savings
ratio - currently 11 per cent - would fall this year in response to lower
inflation and the fall in interest rates.
Instead, they argue, it is likely to stay at around 10.4 per cent - which
they predict it fell to in the fourth quarter of last year - because of the
poor state of the housing market and the keenness of consumers to reduce
debts. This implies that consumption will rise in line with real incomes -
1.5 per cent this year, and then between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent a year.
Assuming a 1p Budget cut in the basic rate of income tax, the authors
forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 22bn in 1992-93.
They repudiate the suggestion that the UK recession was the product of an
international downturn. However, they say it has been prolonged by
international sluggishness. They argue that German monetary policy will
remain tight, hindering the scope for UK interest rate cuts.
The forecast singles out North Sea oil, energy and water as bright spots
over the next few months.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Fears over effects of business rate reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will face serious inequities in their tax burdens if the power to
set the business rate is returned to local councils, according to the
Institute for Fiscal Studies, the independent research group.
Councils lost the power to set business rates in 1990. Since then the
government has set a uniform business rate based on a revaluation of
property, the first since 1973. This has broadly favoured businesses in the
north and the Midlands and adversely affected those in the south.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats propose to return power to set
business rates to councils should they win power in the general election.
The business rate will raise nearly Pounds 15bn this year, so its return to
councils would greatly expand the local tax base.
The IFS warns, however, that if the pre-1990 system of locally varying
business rates is re-introduced with no allowance for the degree of business
concentration within each local authority, tax burdens on businesses will be
unfairly shared. Those in areas of low business concentration will be
discriminated against.
To counter this, the IFS report's authors Mr Kevin Denny and Mr Michael
Ridge urge consideration of schemes designed to ensure fiscal neutrality
between businesses across the country.
One proposal is to relate local-business taxes to council expenditure per
business establishment, rather than per head of population as before 1990.
The report suggests using employment levels as the basis for calculating tax
rates might further improve the system.
A redistribution of government grant to councils to provide a broadly
uniform business tax base might also be necessary.
The report notes 'a general confusion' among businesses as to the real
effect of the 1990 changes.

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Call for reduced working hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will become 'the treadmill of Europe' unless working hours are
reduced in line with those proposed by the European Community, according to
the Low Pay Unit, a research organisation.
A report issued today by the unit examines the case for the proposed
European directive on working time, further debate on which has been
adjourned until later this year after British opposition to it at the
Maastricht summit.
According to European Commission research, men worked longer hours in
Britain in 1988 than anywhere else in Europe. British men worked 45.5 hours
a week compared with 41 hours in most other member states.
Mr Chris Pond, director of the unit, said there was no reason to believe the
figures had changed substantially since then, in spite of the recession.
The latest UK research, in the 1991 New Earnings Survey, showed that a fifth
of men in manual jobs and nearly 10 per cent of all men worked 48 hours or
more a week. Fewer women worked similar hours - 5 per cent of those in
manual jobs and 1 per cent of all women.
The unit's report argues that there is a powerful case for improving basic
rates of pay to reduce working hours without loss of earnings. It says:
'This would improve health and safety at work, raise productivity and
generate employment as well as allowing people to enjoy family and social
life.'
It adds that German reductions in the working week made since 1984 have had
a positive effect on the economy for various reasons, including improved
flexible working.

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Decline in members hits union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FURNITURE union, FTAT, lost more than 10 per cent of its membership in
the past financial year and expects to go into deficit next year for the
first time since the mid 1980s.
The figure, disclosed by Mr Colin Christopher, general secretary, is further
evidence of a recession-led fall in union membership. All unions have
suffered, particularly those in manufacturing.
Mr Christopher said the decline at the FTAT was linked to the dependency of
the British furniture industry on the construction industry, which has been
badly affected by the recession.
He said the union was bracing itself for continuing difficulties next year.
'We are losing hundreds of members every month.' Two factory closures in the
past five weeks, costing 700 jobs, were typical.
The union's executive is drawing up cost-cutting proposals, including
scaling down its two-yearly conference and shedding officers through natural
wastage. The FTAT has just more than 32,000 members, down from more than
36,000 at the begining of last year.
More than 22,000 young people in London will have nowhere to go after
leaving school this year in spite of a government guarantee of a training
place, according to the Association of London Authorities.
The association has projected figures from 1989 - 91 to this year to make
the forecast. It said the numbers without any training, job or education had
risen steadily since 1988.

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Rhone-Poulenc dispute over works
council representatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-Poulenc, the French multi-national, is in dispute with its UK unions
over selection of representatives for the company's European works council,
the consultative body established in 1990.
The row, in which the UK unions are being supported by unions in other
European Community countries, caused the postponement of the November
council meeting. The dispute is being watched carefully by other
multi-nationals which are considering introducing European consultative
arrangements.
The UK unions say the company is insisting on the right to nominate the four
UK representatives and is thereby reneging on an agreement with the European
Federation of Chemical and General Workers.
The company says it is not trying to squeeze out the unions - three out of
four of the representatives in 1990 were union officials from UK plants -
but wants the right to take its own 'soundings' about who to send. It also
wants the more important right to decide from which of its UK plants the
representatives should come each year.
Mr Fred Higgs, a national secretary of the TGWU general union, said: 'The
culture in the UK would dictate that the people attending such a forum
should be people appointed by the trade unions, otherwise we will have
people who speak for no one.'
The union believes it has made some concession by agreeing that
representatives should be Rhone-Poulenc employees and not full-time union
officials. Mr Higgs also says that the union has satisfactory agreements on
representation with other French multi-nationals, such as Elf Aquitaine.
Mr Bill Morris, the next leader of the TGWU, said last week: 'The rather
chequered history of works councils in Britain has left a legacy of
suspicion. Works councils have usually been inspired as anti-union
manoeuvres in the same way as sweetheart staff associations.'
However, he said that such suspicions were being allayed thanks to the
positive experience of workers with the new generation of European works
councils.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Budget '92: Industry looks to set its wheels in motion -
Peter Marsh hears a mixed batch of hopes from companies struggling in
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S battered industrialists hope that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, will offer them a few crumbs of comfort in next month's Budget.
After about 18 months of what may turn out to be the longest recession since
the 1930s, industry wants the chancellor to ease its tax burden and possibly
extend help in the form of extra investment allowances.
Some would prefer increased public spending that would help the economy to
recover and assist hard-hit sectors such as construction.
Many industrialists hold out little hope that base rates, stuck at 10.5 per
cent for more than five months, will come down very much in the near future,
because of the need to keep sterling within its fixed band in the exchange
rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System.
Some believe, however, that the high interest rates required by the
mechanism may be more than offset in the next few years by the gains of
lower inflation.
Another factor that leads many industrialists to downplay calls for
assistance is their belief that the ingredients for a slow recovery later
this year are already in place.
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, the building treatment and
services group, is an optimist. He argues that, as the economy is now poised
for an upturn, there is little need for sweeping action in the Budget.
On the issue of cuts in income tax - thought to be under consideration  -
opinions are divided.
Mr Mike Alderson, chairman of the UK arm of Motorola, the US electronics
company, says that reducing the basic tax rate by 1 percentage point would
provide 'a psychological lift' that could help industry by raising overall
spending.
Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of food-maker Northern Foods, argues
against a cut in personal taxation. 'Cutting income tax could be dangerous
as it would probably have the effect of increasing imports and triggering a
balance-of-payments problem in future years,' says Mr Haskins.
Like many in manufacturing, Mr Haskins wants the government to increase the
proportion of new investment that qualifies for tax relief from the current
25 per cent. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive of Graseby, an electronics
company, says the need for new capital spending is so great that the
allowance should be pushed up to 100 per cent 'for an indefinite period'.
Behind such proposals is the sharp fall in manufacturing investment
resulting from the recession, which some believe will hold back UK
companies' ability to compete with overseas rivals. According to the
Confederation of British Industry, by the end of this year manufacturing
investment is likely to have come down by about one third, compared with the
period before the start of the recession in late 1989.
The CBI wants Mr Lamont to increase the investment allowance to 40 per cent,
a move which it says would cost Pounds 1.05bn in 1993-94. The Engineering
Employers' Federation echoes that, arguing that existing tax arrangements
'discriminate against investment in favour of other kinds of business
expense'.
Sir Ivor Cohen, chairman of the Japan Electronics Business Association, a
group of 100 companies that sell equipment and services to Japanese
electronics groups, also supports increased allowances. He is gloomy about
recovery: 'I don't see anything ahead that creates conditions for a
lift-off.'
Some argue that tax allowances have only a marginal effect on capital
spending, with more potent factors being general industrial confidence and
the broad state of the economy.
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of the Lucas
engineering-components group, says any extra government cash would be better
directed towards improving the public-sector infrastructure.
He also wants the government to reduce advance corporation tax, which many
industrialists say unfairly penalises companies with large overseas earnings
by effectively taxing profits twice.
Sir Anthony supports the ERM discipline: 'I accept the pain we're going
through in the cause of getting inflation down.'
Also calling for Mr Lamont to use the Budget to inject extra money into the
infrastructure is Mr Chris Lewinton, chief executive of TI, the engineering
company. 'When you return to Britain from abroad, everything looks a bit
shabby,' he says. 'Improved roads and rail links would have a direct benefit
for industry.' He argues that Britain may be able to afford the extra
borrowing that increased government spending entails, on the grounds that
its debt is much lower than that of many other industrialised countries.
Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of the Unigate food, distribution and
car-auctions company, says a reduction in taxes on new cars would help ease
the pressures on an industry which has seen sales nose-dive in the past two
years.
Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya, head of the Warwick Manufacturing Group, a
research and teaching organisation at Warwick University, says Mr Lamont
should take 'minor' action - perhaps by announcing extra grants to aid
innovation or technology development.
'I don't believe he needs to do anything very much, but even small sums
spent in areas such as grants can have a big psychological effect. The main
thing for Mr Lamont is make people in industry say: 'Hey, you've listened to
us.''

FT  24 FEB 92 / Ministers prepare hard line on EC transport policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS are preparing to take a tough stance over transport policy when
the government assumes the presidency of the European Community in the
summer.
If the Conservatives win the general election, they will resist any attempts
to water down transport liberalisation measures.
Ministers are also concerned about the European Commission's planned 'white
paper' setting out transport policy beyond this year. It is expected to be
published early in the presidency and there are fears it will not prove
liberal enough.
Britain's presidency will mark the deadline for completion of the single
market, but the government is anxious not to allow draft proposals in areas
such as aviation and shipping cabotage to be diluted or gradually phased in
so they lose their impact.
In the government's view, after completion of the single market, the aim
should be to create a more rigorous competition policy by intensifying the
application of competition rules and state aid. The white paper is, however,
likely to be in terms of 'sustainable mobility' with strong emphasis on the
social and environmental dimensions.
Though the tasks for the government will depend to some extent on the
progress made during the Portuguese presidency, officials think it unlikely
that measures on aviation will be fully agreed by the end of June, and are
also expecting to have to deal with road haulage.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said that a backlog of
transport measures had built up as attention had focused on economic and
political union in the approach to the Maastricht summit. The commission, he
said, was concerned that matters which should be uncontroversial - such as
an EC role in planning an integrated transport policy - would fail to make
progress if a Tory administration held the presidency.
Tension is also likely to arise over the issue of what should replace the
arrangements for infrastructure planning and financing at EC level, which
expire at the end of the year.
The government is likely to seek to scale down proposals for EC funding for
transport infrastructure, for example by emphasising the potential for using
private rather than public financing. It may, however, express some sympathy
for the EC having a role in supplying feasibility studies.
Other priorities for the presidency include an initiative on improving
vehicle safety standards.
The government also intends to take action on transport for disabled people,
with the aim of broadening the proposals beyond the mobility of disabled
workers alone.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Labour aims to end row over candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR will this week attempt to clear up remaining pockets of internal
wrangling in the Midlands and Merseyside by completing the selection
procedures for candidates in five strife-torn constituencies.
The process began last night with the confirmation that Ms Clare Short, MP
for the safe Labour seat of Birmingham Ladywood, has been reselected as
candidate by a 52 per cent vote of the local party. This follows a bitter
struggle with opponents from local branches of the EETPU electricians union.
The party's governing national executive is expected to give a final
official endorsement to her on Wednesday as well as to candidates for the
two other 'problem' seats in the Midlands of Nottingham East and Coventry
South East and for candidates for the Merseyside seats of Wallasey and
Liverpool Broadgreen.
All five selections have been closely overseen by the national party to
ensure no fresh embarrassments emerge before the coming general election.
Officials at the party's Walworth Road headquarters in London have closely
vetted the lists of candidates to make certain that charges of extremism,
levelled against the Labour candidates in 1987, are not repeated.
In Wallasey, for example, Mrs Lynda Chalker, the Tory MP, was widely
considered to have slipped in by a narrow majority as a direct consequence
of allegations of Trotskite entryism.
In Coventry South East and Liverpool Broadgreen - the seats held by Mr Dave
Nellist and Mr Terry Fields, the Militant-supporters sacked from the party
last year - Walworth Road is seeking tough candidates ready to fight bitter
struggles against the rebels, now standing as independent socialists.
With the two main parties level-pegging in the polls, Labour cannot afford
to lose Coventry South East and it must gain Nottingham East to stand much
hope of forming a government after the election.
The Nottingham seat, held by Mr Michael Knowles with a Tory majority of 456,
has seen the local Labour party split by fierce rivalries in the Asian
community.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Tories' allies dig deep into their corporate pockets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, MICHAEL CASSELL, DANIEL GREEN and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party approaches the general election buoyed up by an
historically high level of cash contributions from supporters.
Reports last summer suggested that the party fund-raising machine was facing
increasing problems in attracting contributions but Conservative Central
Office now says the party has beaten all records for a pre-election year.
A nationwide appeal specifically for election funds will be made once the
election date is announced and this is likely to involve both Sir John Cope,
deputy chairman responsible for party finances, and Mr Chris Patten, party
chairman.
A senior party official dismissed suggestions that the recession had hit
fundraising. He said that the prospect of the election was giving it an
added spur.
He added: 'Companies are thinking what is best for them over the next five
years. They are worried about the tax implications of Labour policy on
managers and the prospects for higher interest rates and inflation, a
relaxation in trade union laws and greater government intervention in
business.'
A Financial Times survey of 40 top corporate contributors to the party bears
out this assessment. It found that the 40 companies' contributions were
Pounds 1.34m in 1991, down only Pounds 36,000 from the previous year. Most
companies are planning to maintain or increase their payments this year.
Although a number of companies have cut contributions, largely because the
recession has taken a heavy toll on their finances, these cuts have been
largely offset by increases from other companies.
It is thought the election campaign could cost the Conservatives up to
Pounds 20m, about Pounds 5m more than the 1987 election. Most of the money
will be raised from constituency associations but the funds will be
underpinned by a steady flow of contributions from companies led by
increases from a clutch of big givers.
T &amp; N, the motor components group, last week sent the party Pounds 25,000,
having contributed nothing last year. It said it wanted the Conservatives to
win the election because this would be in its shareholders' best interests.
General Accident, the insurance company which has paid Pounds 35,000 to the
party for the last four years, said it normally increased its payments in an
election year. In 1987 it paid Pounds 60,000 against Pounds 25,000 a year in
the previous three years.
BPB Industries, the building materials group which contributed Pounds 10,000
last year, has made additional election contributions in the past. The issue
is likely to be discussed by the board next month.
Taylor Woodrow, the construction group which last year disclosed a cut its
contribution from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 24,000, will soon announce that
its has decided to increase it.
United Biscuits is one of the largest givers. It contributed Pounds 130,000
last year compared with Pounds 112,000 in 1990.
The contribution from Smiths Industries, the aerospace and medical equipment
group, rose by Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 15,000 for the year to last July,
while Sturge Holdings, the insurance group, increased its 1991 contribution
to Pounds 25,000 because the election was in prospect.
Hanson, the industrial conglomerate, increased its donation by Pounds 20,000
to Pounds 100,000 in the year to last September.
Shareholders at Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust may double its
contribution to Pounds 25,000 when they meet at the group's annual meeting
on April 7, just two days before the most likely election date.
The length and depth of the recession is forcing several companies to
consider cutting their contributions. Wimpey, the construction group, is
almost certain to halve its contribution of Pounds 40,000 and Western United
Investment, part of the financially troubled Vestey group, which gave Pounds
100,000 last year is reconsidering its contribution.
Other cuts include Tomkins, the conglomerate, from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds
25,000, Willis Caroon, the insurance brokers, Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 25,000,
and the Rank Organisation by half to Pounds 25,000.
British Airways plans no change to its policy of no contribution this year
against Pounds 40,000 last year.
The 600 Group, the engineering combine, said it had given nothing so far
this year and was unlikely to do so. Adwest Group, the automotive and
electrical engineering group cut its contribution to Pounds 7,500 last year
from Pounds 25,000 in 1989. It said: 'The driving reason behind the cut is
the state of our business but it also reflects some considerable
disappointment with the government's performance'.
Only two companies indicated they might contribute to other parties.
Kingfisher, the retailer which has given Pounds 25,000 to the Tories for the
last five years, has also supported Labour fund-raising events with Pounds
12,000 and plans to include the Liberal Democrats in its 1992 funding
programme.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, gave Pounds 25,000 to the
Conservatives in 1990 but noted that the last time there was a chance of a
hung parliament it shared the Pounds 25,000 between the Conservatives,
Liberal Democrats and Social Democrats.
Most of the Conservatives' big corporate backers have not changed their
contributions and do not plan to.
Those which made no change in the past year include
Allied Lyons (Pounds 110,000); Capital and Counties, property (Pounds
15,000); GKN, engineering (Pounds 25,000); Glaxo, pharmaceuticals (Pounds
60,000); Hammerson Properties (Pounds 25,000); Kleinwort Benson, merchant
bank (Pounds 40,000); Laporte, chemicals (Pounds 20,000); Lucas, automotive
and aerospace (Pounds 25,000); P &amp; O, shipping and property (Pounds
100,000); Racal Electronics (Pounds 25,000); RHM, foods (Pounds 20,000);
Scottish Eastern Investment (Pounds 15,000); Scottish and Newcastle

FT  24 FEB 92 / Army to shed 3,350 uniformed personnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARMY will this week send redundancy notices to 3,350 uniformed personnel
ranging in rank from sergeant to brigadier in the first wave of armed-forces
cuts under the government's Options for Change review.
Further personnel cuts are planned in the next two years, each about twice
as large as this year's and bringing total army redundancies to about
16,000.
The first wave is already bigger than the redundancies across all three
services which followed Labour's 1974-75 defence review. Those were the last
significant redundancies, although there were also several hundred in the
early 1980s.
The Army, faced with much heavier cuts than the RAF or Navy, is pressing
ahead while the other services are still considering their own measures. It
aims to achieve the remainder of its planned 40,000 reduction by recruiting
8,000 fewer soldiers a year than regularly leave its ranks. This will leave
it with 104,000 trained personnel in three years' time.
Almost all those being made redundant have volunteered, except for 160 of
the 850 officers involved. For the 2,500 redundancies among other ranks,
4,000 applications were received.
Voluntary redundancy was offered to non-commissioned officers between the
ages of 30 and 40 and officers between 40 and 52, depending on rank and
specialisation. The army is giving six months' notice, extended to one year
for those facing compulsory redundancy.
The compensation package includes up to 18 months' pay and a gratuity of
three times annual pension, in both cases tax free. Those who have served 12
years or more are entitled to an immediate pension.
General Sir David Ramsbotham, the adjutant general (the army's personnel
chief), said assistance would have to be extended to families, including
training for wives, housing and in some cases a boarding-school allowance.
At a meeting organised by Drake Beam Morin, the out-placement consultants,
last week, he said the deal was 'quite as good as anything anybody else
offers' but added that he expected some appeals against the decisions.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Stock Exchange passes Taurus system milestone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST milestone towards paperless trading on the London Stock Exchange's
long-delayed Taurus system was completed yesterday as users put in place
internationally recognised securities codes.
The Stock Exchange said the exercise represented one of the biggest and most
complex upgrades of its Talisman settlements system since the service was
introduced in 1979.
Some 270 participants - brokers, registrars, custodians and fund managers -
have been involved in the procedure. The cross-over, one of a series of
reforms of trading and settlement recommended by the Group of 30 - an
international think tank of former economic and financial policymakers - had
been originally set for completion in October last year.
The Stock Exchange said that more than 1,000 separate programming changes
were required at the Stock Exchange's central system alone.
'Overall, we think it was a great success,' it said, adding that there were
still a few brokers who had not completed the transfer of old codes.
'There were a few minor hiccoughs, but we think those firms will make the
cross-over by Tuesday or Wednesday,' it added.
Mr Mike Jones, head of the Stock Exchange group overseeing the transfer said
that from today those who did not have the codes in place in their system
were effectively barred from trading. He added: 'They may as well pack their
bags and go home.'
In a letter to Stock Exchange participants earlier this month, Mr John
Watson, Taurus project director, warned that those who failed to make the
transition on time risked falling by the wayside. 'A number of participants
have raised the question of fallback. There is no opportunity to fallback
once the process is underway,' he said, but noted that ample opportunity had
been given to put the system changes into effect.
The exercise will change the identification codes currently used for
different securities into internationally recognised ones - a key first step
in making the Taurus system an effective means of cross-border trading.
The codes, known as International Securities Identification Numbers, are
recognised by the world's main exchanges.
Without the use of these codes, Taurus would not be able to conduct
cross-border transactions with other exchanges when it finally comes on
line. Current targets call for it to be in place by April next year.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Prudent innovator in third world development: Obituary -
Eugene R. Black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUGENE R. Black, who died last week aged 93, will be remembered as a
hard-boiled investment banker who used his talents to reduce economic misery
in the third world.
He served as president of the World Bank from 1949 to 1962 and is widely
credited with having secured its place as the world's pre-eminent
development institution.
In 13 years he nearly doubled its membership from 48 to 80 nations,
increased its capital base from Dollars 8bn to more than Dollars 20bn and
made more than 300 loans to 60 countries.
'He played a central role in rebuilding Europe after World War Two', said Mr
Lewis Preston, the current World Bank president. 'The prosperity of many
nations is a result of work he did decades ago.'
Mr Black used his skills as a bond salesman to secure the bank's access to
capital markets.
He also oversaw its transition from helping reconstruct war-damaged
industrial countries to becoming a leading force for development in the
third world.
He expanded the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
by creating two new affiliates - the International Development Agency (IDA),
which makes concessional loans to the poorest countries, and the Investment
Finance Corporation (IFC) - the bank's arm for promoting the private sector.
The tripartite structure has underpinned the World Bank's success for three
decades.
He established the bank as a leading provider of finance for specific
investment projects in fields such as agriculture, industry and energy.
The approach worked well in the bank's early years but was eventually
criticised for failing to pay sufficient attention to the overall quality of
a country's economic management.
In the 1980s, Mr Black's successors thus complemented project loans with
lending tied to broader structural economic reforms.
Mr Black was born in Atlanta in 1898, the son of a governor of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
He had a pronounced southern drawl and a reputation for bluntness and
prudence.
A graduate of the University of Georgia, he served in the US Navy in World
War One before beginning a career in investment banking where he became
known for his expertise in the bond market.
In New York, he was a senior vice-president at Chase Manhattan bank before
moving to the World Bank in 1947, initially as the US executive director.
He remained active after retiring from the World Bank, serving as an
emissary for President Lyndon Johnston in south-east Asia where he helped
lay the ground for the creation of the Asian Development Bank.
In the 1960s, he was a financial adviser to U. Thant, the United Nations
secretary-general, and helped the UN collect Dollars 120m in unpaid
subscriptions.
He was also a chairman of the Brookings Institution, the liberal Washington
think-tank, the author of 'The Diplomacy of Development' and a non-executive
director of a sheaf of blue-chip companies.

FT  24 FEB 92 / How the exchange rate helps external adjustment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN CHANGES in nominal exchange rates bring about enduring changes in real
rates of exchange? Can changes in real exchange rates bring about changes in
the current account? Policy-makers in western Europe seem to assume that the
answer to both questions is no. But the experience of the 1980s indicates
that this is not necessarily so.
That, at least, is is the principal conclusion of a volume of essays
published by the Washington-based Institute of International Economics late
last year (the concluding essay of which, by Paul Krugman of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was published as number 34 in the
Institute's series, Policy Analyses in International Economics).
In his introduction, Professor Krugman argues that 'the decade's record of
huge swings in exchange rates and trade balances gives us the best
opportunity ever to sort out competing schools of thought in the economics
of international adjustment, and perhaps even to get reasonably solid
estimates of some key economics parameters.' The result? The old wisdom
about the exchange rate and adjustment may not work in theory, but it
certainly worked in practice.
In his column on 'why the case against devaluation is not clear-cut', which
accompanied the above indicators on 20 January 1992, Edward Balls
demonstrated that changes in nominal and real exchange rates were closely
correlated for the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK. The same has been
true for Japan. But it has been less true in the European Monetary System,
where changes in both nominal and real exchange rates have also been
smaller.
The accompanying charts show that there was also a close correlation between
changes in real exchange rates (measured by relative unit labour costs) and
the US and Japanese current accounts. German experience is more complex, but
as revealing.
Having marched to the top of the hill by 1985, the dollar marched back down
again. The current account started to turn around two years later. Japan's
story is almost a mirror-image. The real exchange rate appreciated rapidly
between 1985 and 1988, while the current account surplus fell, from a peak
of 4 per cent of GNP in 1986 to a little over 1 per cent in 1990. Cushioned
by the ERM, the German real exchange rate appreciated rather less than the
Japanese from 1985. Although the surplus did stop rising as a share of GNP,
it did not fall until 1990, when it was eliminated by the demand boost
following German unification.
The German experience reveals that changes in external balances require
changes in demand or, more precisely, changes in the relationship between
aggregate income and expenditure. Fiscal consolidation and monetary
restraint in the US, monetary expansion in Japan and, following unification,
fiscal expansion in Germany all played important parts in the adjustments of
1985-91.
How then do changes in real rates of exchange interact with those in demand?
Ex ante reductions in demand will not, on their own, bring about equivalent
changes in external balances in the short to medium run, except when
elasticities of substitution in production and consumption are high. They
will bring about large domestic recessions, instead.
Changes in demand will themselves lower (or raise) real exchange rates in
the long run, via recession and lower inflation (or vice versa). But the
long run could, indeed, be long.
Depreciation of the real exchange rate would bring about external
adjustment, without any complementary macroeconomic measures, if the
consequent increase in the incentive to produce were greater than in that to
spend. But even if all the income generated by the expansion of net exports
were spent, leaving nothing for improvement of the external account, the
country would still benefit from higher economic activity.
The 1980s have witnessed a strong effort to persuade countries to abandon
the exchange rate as an instrument of policy. Perhaps this new conventional
wisdom needs to be reconsidered.

FT  24 FEB 92 / South African Conservatives may boycott constitution
referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA's white supremacist Conservative party has threatened to
boycott the referendum proposed by President FW de Klerk to test white
support for a post-apartheid constitution.
Mr de Klerk's position in the poll could be strengthened by signs that his
ruling National party and the African National Congress (ANC) have moved
closer to agreement on an interim government which would rule until a
post-apartheid constitution is drawn up. A deal on interim government which
gives the Nationalists a large share of power could help persuade reluctant
whites to vote yes in the referendum.
The date of the poll - and the phrasing of the referendum question - are due
to be announced formally today or tomorrow. However, the South African Press
Association, quoting sources in the NP, said yesterday that it would be held
on March 17.
After several by-election defeats to the opposition Conservatives, who
support a return to apartheid, Mr de Klerk is seeking a mandate to continue
negotiating a new constitution within the multi-party forum called the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa).
The Conservatives refuse to negotiate power-sharing with blacks. They have
imposed conditions for their participation in the referendum - such as
counting of votes by constituency, a method which would heavily favour them
 -and will decide whether to participate when the referendum question is
announced. To boycott the poll would, however, appear a tacit defeat for the
Conservatives.
Over the weekend, it emerged that negotiators had made rapid progress on the
question of interim government, with the ANC believed to be ready to agree
in principle to an elected interim government and executive, which would
effectively be run jointly by itself and the government.
Pretoria is understood to have proposed that parties gaining at least 5 per
cent electoral support would be represented in an interim legislature, while
15 per cent support would be required for the entry to cabinet. This is
likely to mean a cabinet composed only of the ANC and Nationalists.
The Nationalists appear willing to compromise on the issue of special
representation for whites and other minorities in parliament for the interim
period, because whites would be strongly represented in the executive. In a
permanent parliament, domination by one political group (effectively blacks)
would be prevented by devolving powers to regional governments, as well as
by enforced multi-racial power sharing in cabinet.
The exact shape of the interim government, and its duration has yet to be
agreed.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Algerian reshuffle broadens appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S ruling Council of State announced at the weekend the formation of
a new government which includes one Islamic fundamentalist and a dissident
member of the leading lay-opposition party, write Lara Marlowe and Francis
Ghiles.
However, the cabinet reshuffle was greeted with scepticism by some Algerians
who had been expecting more radical changes.
The key portfolios of defence, the interior, foreign affairs and the economy
remain unchanged.
In an apparent attempt to conciliate Moslem militants, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali,
the prime minister, appointed a former senior member of the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), who left the party nine months ago, as a cabinet
minister. Sources close to the FIS in Algiers said Mr Said Guerchi's
participation in the government, where he holds the post of minister of
employment and vocational training, would not diminish their hostility to
the junta in power.
Mr Hashemi Nait-Djoudi, the former deputy leader of Hocine Ait-Ahmed's Front
of Socialist Forces (FFS), was named minister of transport and
telecommunications.
A highly respected economist, Mr Ahmed Ben Bitour, was appointed treasury
minister, a key position considering the difficult financial situation
Algeria finds itself in.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Restructuring looms for Japan car makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING profits, output and exports mean that Japan's motor industry may not
be able to escape the structural shake-outs which have already affected
western car makers, according to a new study from the Economist Intelligence
Unit, writes John Griffiths.
After a decade of what the report* describes as rampant growth, when Japan's
new car market rose by 80 per cent and car output by nearly one-half, 'the
1990s are shaping up to be a period, at best, of consolidation and
restructuring to take account of the major new restraints with which the
sector is confronted.'
For the first time since 1984 Japan's new car market is shrinking,
accompanied by spiralling production costs and sever labour shortages. There
has been a sharp decline in profitability, with the smaller, most vulnerable
producers falling into losses.
The Japanese industry's problems are seen as being not only domestic.
The report warns that the resurgence of protectionist sentiment in the US
could have knock-on effects in Japanese manufacturers' North American
plants, many of which are operating at below break-even and facing the
prospect of over-capacity.

FT  24 FEB 92 / The European Market: EC tornado forces subsidy rules on
Spain's lossmaking industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OVIEDO, ASTURIAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOSE ANGEL Fernandez Villa spent Christmas down a coal mine just outside
Oviedo, the capital of Asturia in northern Spain, to protest at government
plans for the retirement of 6,000 miners from Hunosa, the decrepit state
mining company.
Then, earlier this month, he announced his retirement as leader of the
powerful Soma-UGT mineworkers' union, to take advantage of the very same
retirement scheme. His going was a first victory in what is becoming an
industrial tornado in Spain. Madrid is finally giving in to European
Community subsidy rules with a massive restructuring of its lossmaking
steel, coal and shipbuilding industries before the advent of the 1993 single
market.
Up to 30,000 jobs could be lost in these industries and many experts say
this will not be nearly enough. Only about 20 per cent of the 140,000
employees at the state industrial holding company, INI, work in profitable
companies.
INI has meanwhile decided to go to the capital markets this year to raise
Dollars 1.7bn in new funds for the handful of its companies it considers
viable.
But even these include desperate cases such as Ensidesa, the integrated
steelmaker, which could have lost more than Pta30bn (Dollars 291.3m) last
year and the Inespal aluminium group (losses of Pta25bn), which INI is
trying to sell off to Alcan. Iberia, the state airline, lost Pta50bn last
year and attempts by the government to recapitalise INI's newly created
'viable division' - companies where profits are possible  - are being
monitored by the European Commission in case they are slipped illegal
subsidies.
The sheer scale of the jobs threat has also jolted unions, especially as it
coincides with the drafting of a tough economic convergence plan which the
government hopes will guarantee Spain entry in the first division of the
European Community's economic and monetary union at the end of this decade.
A remark by Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry minister, to the effect that
'the best industrial policy is not to have one,' has also frightened
workers.
In a violent protest a few weeks ago in Murcia, capital of the Mediterranean
region which includes the naval works at Cartagena, the local parliament was
attacked and badly burned.
The government is being very careful, and nowhere more so than in Asturias
which is heavily unionised.
Hunosa, the biggest employer in the region, is Spain's biggest coal producer
and a financial basket case. Since its creation out of 18 lossmaking coal
producers in Asturias in 1967 it has never made a profit. 'As a business,
this is a ruin,' says a refreshingly open official. 'The idea never was to
make any money but to create jobs in Asturias and supply Spain with coal.'
That will no longer do. It costs Hunosa Pta32,000 to bring a tonne of coal
to the surface and imports from South Africa can be landed on Spanish soil
for a sixth of that. Last year the company lost Pta65bn and the European
Commission has threatened legal action unless Madrid stops subsidising the
operating losses.
Under a plan presented in Brussels recently, employment will be cut by a
third, to 12,000. Some 4,500 workers - including Mr Fernandez Villa - will
take early retirement on full pay until they are 68 years old. It is a good
deal.
In regions such as Asturias, the Basque Country and parts of Murcia - which
have suckled for years at the state's financial teat - the trick now is to
implement industrial cuts while financing infrastructural investments which
could help attract new investment to the regions and soothe troubled voters.
Regional politics are crucial to Spain's stability, and a few days after the
Cartagena riot, the government said it was diverting Dollars 800m in new
investment to the Murcia region. In the Basque Country, the possible closure
of integrated steelmaking outside Bilbao is likely to be countered with the
building of a huge steel mill. In Asturias, the government's promised new
investment incentives will cost up to Dollars 4bn.
Asturias is particularly difficult. Unlike the Basque country, it has no
tradition of private enterprise, and has poor road, rail and air links with
Cantabria, the Basque Country and, ultimately, France.
However Mr Victor Zapico, the Asturian industry counsellor, or minister,
insists: 'We are not a lost cause. We just need to bury the notion that the
state will always provide.' Asturians hope a Dollars 1bn chemicals plant
being built by DuPont near the port of Gijon will attract other investors
but replacing lost coal jobs will be hard.
Unfortunately for Asturias, the government's 6,000 job cuts at Hunosa will
draw losses down to just Pta50bn, and EC coal subsidy rules to be introduced
in 1993 will probably be stricter. The present 'plan' is a play for time,
not a solution.
Government officials insist they are determined to cut industrial subsidies,
however, and that they will not be intimidated by violence. 'The stones
(thrown at Cartagena) will not alter a single comma of the restructuring
plan for Cartagena,' said Mr Alvaro Espina, secretary of state for industry.
'The truth is that there are many (industrial) groups making money in the
country (but) really innovative businessmen hardly ever walk the corridors
of this ministry.'

FT  24 FEB 92 / Supreme Court to rule on abortion row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE focus of Ireland's abortion controversy shifts to the Supreme Court
today following the decision of the family of a 14-year-old rape victim to
appeal against a High Court injunction made last week which prevents her
from travelling to Britain for an abortion, Tim Coone reports from Dublin.
At the weekend, some 5,000 demonstrators blocked the streets of central
Dublin in protest at the High Court ruling, and demanded a referendum on the
abortion issue.
Prominent among the demonstrators was Sinead O'Connor, the Irish singer who
has admitted publicly to having had two abortions in Britain. Further
demonstrations are planned for today and tomorrow. The Supreme Court is
expected to make its ruling by Wednesday.
The government has offered to pay the costs of the appeal, and is clearly
hoping that the Supreme Court will overturn the High Court injunction, which
many legal experts in Dublin regard as having been an exceptionally rigid
interpretation of the 1983 'right-to-life' constitutional amendment. If the
Supreme Court upholds the injunction, however, the Irish government may then
be forced to hold a referendum in order to avoid being dragged through the
European Court of Justice.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said last week that he would call
for a referendum on abortion 'as a last resort'. Few political leaders in
Ireland wish to see a re-run of the bitter and divisive debate that took
place in 1983.

not be allowed the same rights in decision making as those which do, Mr Theo
Waigel, the German finance minister, said yesterday.
It was unlikely, he added, that all 12 existing community members would be
able to take part in Emu by 'the end of this century.' In that case, the
European Parliament should have a limited say until all had joined. 'We must
develop new authorities,' he added.
Managing Emu and the European central bank would be 'impossible if countries
with inflation of 15 or 20 per cent had the same rights of co-determination
as those which fulfilled the stability criteria, such as inflation rates of
perhaps 2 or 3 per cent'.
EC leaders agreed at the Maastricht summit in December to press on to full
economic and monetary union, including a single currency, by 1999 at the
latest.
Mr Waigel's proposals - likely to stir resentment in the council of
ministers as well as the European Assembly, which was promised increased
powers at Maastricht - were made in response to persistent and growing
scepticism in Germany about the chances of achieving the degree of economic
convergence needed for full-blown European union.
There were also protests recently at Commission requests for increased
contributions to the Community budget when the stagnating German economy is
also having to prop up reconstruction in the former East Germany. 'We are
clearly not in a position to provide such resources,' Mr Waigel said
yesterday.
The Bundesbank has complained regularly that the summit agreed on Emu
without the necessary commitment to simultaneous movement towards political
union. The minister, however, said he was confident of more progress in
developing common foreign and security policy and issues such as a community
policy towards asylum seekers and refugees. Popular German concerns have
focused on the sacrifice of the D-Mark to what has been called 'Esperanto
money', and the country's difficulties with floods of asylum seekers from
eastern and south east Europe.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Chemicals industry searches for safe CFCs substitute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC environment ministers' decision at the weekend to go for an earlier
deadline on eliminating ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) comes as
the leading chemical companies such as Du Pont and ICI are already well
advanced in phasing out their production.
The difficulty is in providing a safe non-ozone depleting substitute that
will replace essential uses of CFCs.
They are used in aerosols, refrigeration, air conditioning, insulation, fire
extinguishers, and cleaning in engineering, electronics and computers.
Yesterday Greenpeace renewed its call for a complete ban on production and
use of CFCs.
However, the chemical industry and the users of these substances say that
this is impossible until safe substitutes are produced in enough volume to
replace existing CFCs.
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, are a substitute for many CFCs in
refrigerators but still cause some damage to the ozone layer. HFCs
(hydrofluorocarbons), produced by ICI and Du Pont, do not destroy ozone but
environmental pressure groups object to them on the grounds that they can
contribute to global warming.
In any case present production of HFCs is only large enough to meet about 5
per cent of demand, says ICI.
ICI, which produces CFCs at is Runcorn, Cheshire plant, in the UK yesterday
welcomed the result of the Estoril meeting. It will cease CFC production by
1995 and will stop producing the two big ozone depleters, CFCs 11 and 12, by
1993.
However, it has arranged to buy in supplies of CFC 11 and 12 from Akzo, the
Dutch chemical company, so that it can continue to supply a declining market
until substitutes are provided.
Meanwhile, in Germany, Mr Klaus Toepfer, the environment minister, is
pressing industry to stop producing and using CFCs by next year.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Conservative party raises record funds in spite of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party has raised more funds in the past 12 months than in
any previous pre-election year, according to Central Office officials.
The party does not disclose total funds nor their source, but a survey by
the Financial Times revealed contributions from business supporters have
remained virtually unchanged in the face of severe recession.
The survey of 40 top corporate contributors to the party found that they
contributed Pounds 1.345m last year, down only Pounds 36,000 from 1990. Most
companies are planning to maintain or increase their payments this year,
providing the Tory party with a steady flow of contributions to underpin its
election effort.
Party coffers have also been swelled by some large, personal contributions.
Last year, for example, it emerged that Mr John Latsis, the Greek shipping
tycoon, gave Pounds 2m to the party organisation. Although a number of
companies such as British Airways and Taylor Woodrow, the construction
group, have made well-publicised cuts in their contributions, they have been
largely offset by some big donations.
T &amp; N, the motor components group, last week sent the party Pounds 25,000
after suspending its contribution last year. General Accident, the insurance
company, which has paid Pounds 35,000 to the party in each of the past four
years, said it normally increases its payment in an election year.
Other companies which have increased their contributions or are considering
doing so include United Biscuits, Hanson and Foreign and Colonial Investment
Trust.
Taylor Woodrow will soon disclose it has decided to increase contributions
following its 1990 cut. However, some large contributors, which are either
disenchanted with government economic policy or under financial pressure,
have reduced their donations.
These include BA, which said last week its decision to suspend payments was
unchanged; Wimpey, the construction group which is almost certain at least
to halve its normal Pounds 40,000 contribution; and Western United
Investment, part of the financially troubled Vestey empire.

FT  24 FEB 92 / EC agrees to accelerate the elimination of CFCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ESTORIL, PORTUGAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community has agreed in principle to phase out
chlorofluorocarbons and all other ozone-depleting substances by the end of
1995.
This is 1 1/2 years earlier than the EC's original target, which was for
CFCs only, and four years earlier than stipulated by the Montreal Protocol,
the international agreement.
Environment ministers of the Twelve, meeting informally in Portugal at the
weekend, took the decision even though the European Commission - which
initiates all EC legislation - has yet to draw up a formal proposal.
Mr David Trippier, the UK's junior environment minister, said at the weekend
he would meet representatives of the chemical industry on Friday to
negotiate reductions even faster than the EC envisages.
The EC's move follows the US decision two weeks ago to advance by five years
its own date for phasing out CFCs and 'most other ozone depleting
substances' from the end of 2000 to the end of 1995.
It also follows a wealth of new scientific evidence about the destruction of
the ozone layer, including predictions of a new ozone 'hole' above the
Arctic circle, and forecasts of an increase in eye cataract conditions and
skin cancer caused by the ultra-violet radiation which the ozone layer
serves to filter out.
The 12 environment ministers expect formally to approve on March 23 the
earlier end to CFCs, which are used mostly in refrigeration, aerosols, air
conditioning and insulation.
The other chemicals whose production and use will be phased out are: carbon
tetrachloride, a dry-cleaning solvent; halons used in fire-extinguishers;
and methyl chloroform, used to clean precision engineering components and
printed circuit boards.
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, said his proposal would
call for an 85 per cent reduction in all these chemicals by the end of next
year. He also wants the new targets written into the Montreal Protocol.
Germany, Denmark, the UK and Luxembourg had decided independently to
accelerate the CFC phase-out to 1995 in what Mr Ripa di Meana called 'an
escalation of virtuous behaviour'.
The EC's precipitate move on ozone is partly an attempt to wrest back the
environment policy initiative from the US ahead of June's 'Earth Summit' in
Rio de Janeiro.
Mr Ripa di Meana in particular wants to keep up momentum behind his
controversial plan to introduce a mixed carbon and energy tax in the EC,
equivalent to Dollars 10 (Pounds 5.70) on a barrel of oil, by 2000.
John Hunt writes: Imperial Chemical Industries, Europe's main CFC producer,
welcomed the EC decision. The company has already said it will phase out
production by 1995 and announced last week that by 1993 it will stop making
CFCs 11 and 12, the two main ozone-destroying products, at its plant in
Runcorn, Cheshire.
Friday's meeting with Mr Trippier will consider an ICI proposal that a
national council be established to co-ordinate and speed up the phasing-out
of CFCs.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Tories keep tax options open: Opposition attacks stepped up
on rumoured 'give-away' budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT refused yesterday to rule out an increase in borrowing to
finance pre-election tax cuts as opposition parties stepped up their claims
that the Conservatives are planning an 'irresponsible' give-away Budget.
Under close questioning in the BBC's On the Record programme, Mr David
Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, insisted that the government
intended to keep firm control on public expenditure.
But when asked if the government would raise the public sector borrowing
requirement above the levels needed to compensate for the recession, Mr
Mellor evaded giving a direct reply.
Emphasising that the government remained determined to balance the Budget
over the economic cycle, he said: 'You have to take a judgment as to what is
in the best interests of the country.' His cautious reply was clearly
intended to calm fears on the Tory right of an imprudent Budget while
leaving the door open for tax cuts.
It came after Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, gave the clearest
indication yet of an April 9 poll. He told TV-am: 'We have now reached the
stage where you begin to clear the decks and the government comes out firing
its guns and starts campaigning.'
With the Tories on the defensive over their tax and borrowing plans, Mr Roy
Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, drew attention to a newspaper report
claiming Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had been told by the Treasury
that the PSBR could reach Pounds 30bn.
'I now have no doubt that the government is embarking on an all or nothing
gamble - nothing to help the economy - and all they care about is the
general election,' he said.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat economics spokesman, also took up the
charge, accusing the government of 'gross economic irresponsibility'.
Tory officials dismissed the Pounds 30bn PSBR claim.
In a separate development, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, wrote to Mr
John Major protesting that the prime minister had misled the Commons by
saying British growth had exceeded that of Germany between 1981 and 1991,
when, in fact, it had not.
As speculation grew about the scale of the expected tax cuts, it also
appeared that the Tories had maximised their room for manoeuvre. One party
official suggested that the Treasury might be intentionally talking up the
PSBR figure to allow Mr Lamont to cut taxes but also appear prudent on
Budget day. 'The Budget has to be seen as responsible and relevant to
economic needs,' the official said.
Similar comments have led some observers to speculate that the Budget will
also include some measures to relieve recession-hit industry. A time-limited
rise in tax breaks for investment might also be backed by concessions for
small businesses including VAT relief and reductions in the uniform business
rate.
Labour campaign organisers, meanwhile, are convinced that the Tories' Budget
dilemma has handed them an issue that could be election-winning. Appearing
on the same programme as Mr Mellor, Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief
secretary, said: 'What we have always said is that borrowing for investment
is okay. Borrowing to spend for today for consumption is totally wrong.'
She highlighted as inadequate Mr Mellor's replies ruling out a value added
tax rise. While he had denied any plans for a rise in the short term, she
claimed he had failed to take the opportunity to rule out any extension of
the coverage of the tax.
In fact, Mr Mellor had said that while there was 'no need, no plans and no
requirement to widen VAT' a sensible chancellor was always aware that
'circumstances can alter down the years'.
The report, in the Independent on Sunday, that the Treasury has warned Mr
Lamont of a Pounds 30bn budget deficit in the next financial year - even
without a tax-cutting Budget - was treated cautiously by some City
economists.
Economic growth of less than 1 per cent this year would cause the PSBR to
rise substantially in fiscal 1992-93. But City forecasts which allow for
some tax cuts in the Budget are averaging less than Pounds 25bn.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Montagu, said the Pounds 30bn
figure was 'way over the top'. He said: 'To go from Pounds 12bn to Pounds
30bn in one year would be fairly amazing.'
Last week saw a steady escalation in estimates of the possible size of next
year's PSBR and the amount of tax cuts in the Budget.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Nato will ask former Soviets to join council
</HEADLINE>

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATO is inviting all but one of the former Soviet republics to join its
Co-operation Council in one of the most striking steps towards closer
east-west relations since the end of the Cold War.
Mr Manfred Worner, secretary-general of the Atlantic alliance, said in Kiev
yesterday Ukraine had agreed to attend a March 10 meeting of foreign
ministers in Brussels and an April 1 gathering of defence ministers. Today
in Moscow, he is expected to extend the invitation to Russia and all other
Commonwealth of Independent States members but not to the troubled former
Soviet republic, Georgia.
'We are turning confrontation to co-operation,' Mr Worner said. 'We see our
main objective now in providing and protecting stability. This is why we
have extended the hand of friendship to our former enemies.'
He did not spell out the precise role which was envisaged for the republics
within the Nato structure, saying only that in addition to consultation and
co-operation, a third aim was the 'exchange of information with as much
transparency as possible'.
Mr Worner said that Nato's top concerns were ratification of the
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) and Start treaties, adding that
Ukraine's non-nuclear stance should facilitate the implementation of Start.
Nato was also anxious that CFE ceilings should not be exceeded. Ratification
of the CFE is stalled as Ukraine and Russia bicker over their share of the
allotted quotas.
At the weekend, relations between the two republics deteriorated. The
Ukrainian foreign ministry sent Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, commander of
the United Commonwealth Forces, who has sought to preserve a single Soviet
military, a note protesting at his 'distortion' of the Ukrainian position on
the Black Sea fleet. The note questions Mr Shaposhnikov's neutrality and
could foreshadow a Ukrainian call for his dismissal.
Despite these differences, the new geopolitical order was underscored for Mr
Worner's hosts by the timing of his visit. Yesterday was traditionally Red
Army Day, an occasion the old regime celebrated with displays of military
hardware and parades of soldiers.
Mr Worner rewarded Ukraine's efforts to rid itself of nuclear weapons,
assuring the nation that a peaceful Ukraine 'will not be threatened by any
of our weapons'.
Senior Nato officials confirmed that Mr Worner's remark implied that no Nato
weapons are targeted on Ukraine, which has transformed the conventional
Soviet forces stationed on its territory into a Ukrainian army.

FT  24 FEB 92 / The power behind Greenspan's throne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Mullins seems in his element as vice-chairman of the Federal
Reserve. Although sworn in as Mr Alan Greenspan's deputy only last July, he
is already emerging as a power behind the throne.
'He is well organised intellectually and as influential as any vice-chairman
of the past two decades,' says Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper
Financial Services in Chicago.
'He has charged out of the starting blocks,' says Mr David Jones, a Fed
watcher at Aubrey Lanston, the Wall Street brokerage. 'He is a rising star:
he does his homework, works well with people and is persuasive at board
meetings.'
Mr Jones credits Mr Mullins with having played an important role in securing
last December's aggressive one-point cut in the discount rate - possibly the
Fed's most important monetary decision in recent years. Up to that point,
the Fed had favoured a gradualist approach, involving frequent, small rate
cuts.
The bold December move lifted gloom in financial markets and prompted an
economically beneficial decline in long bond yields.
At 45, Mr Mullins has enjoyed a meteoric rise. Five years ago he was a
finance professor at the Harvard Business School with no plans for public
service. In 1987, Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury secretary, asked him to
serve on the official committee investigating the stock market crash. In
1988 he joined the Treasury as an assistant secretary and helped mastermind
the bail-out of bankrupt savings and loan (S&amp;L) institutions. He moved to
the Fed as a governor less than two years ago.
In conversation, Mr Mullins displays a lively mind. Analytical by nature, he
provides neatly structured answers to questions. Indeed, in a town where
many political appointees have only a hazy grasp of their briefs, he reminds
one of the European mandarin class of civil servant.
Fed vice-chairmen, like US vice-presidents, have often enjoyed only symbolic
power. The articulate Mr Mullins is well positioned to wield influence,
partly because the composition of the seven-member Fed board has changed
markedly. In November and December, two new Bush appointees  - Mr Lawrence
Lindsey and Ms Susan Phillips - were sworn in as governors. Mr Lindsey, a
former White House aide, is a well-known 'supply-sider'. Both new governors
are regarded as 'pro growth'.
Mr Mullins says there has been a 'subtle change' in the Fed's objectives.
'Our primary goal is to maximise growth,' he says. 'Price stability is a
means to that goal.' He contrasts this with the view of some previous
governors who saw price stability as an ultimate objective. He also draws
attention to the political costs of trying to achieve price stability too
quickly. If the Fed consistently pursued excessively tight policies, it
would risk losing its independence on monetary matters.
But Mr Mullins is anxious not to be cast as soft on inflation. He says the
way to maximise growth is by reducing inflation to 'de minimis levels'. If
the US could restore the inflation levels of the 1950s, interest rates could
stay low permanently, providing a spur to investment. He also regards low
inflation as the best route to stable exchange rates and hence as a way to
encourage trade flows.
On the economy, he cautions against excessive optimism about an imminent
recovery. In spite of recent interest rate cuts, the public mood remains
sour and the economy extremely sluggish. The Fed stands ready to ease again
if growth does not materialise.
He regards the recession that began in July 1990 as 'pretty much over', in
spite of recent falls in employment and production. But the painful process
of 'wringing out the imbalances of the 1980s' may continue for several more
quarters. If it proved necessary to reduce debt ratios to the levels of the
early 1980s before households and companies felt free to spend, the recovery
could take longer to arrive than widely envisaged.
'The upturn may start in the second quarter but it is likely to be mid-year
before we get a growth rate of 2 to 3 per cent,' he says. And that, he
fears, may not be fast enough to convince people that a recovery really is
under way.
He says the Fed can do nothing about the biggest long-term drag on growth:
the prospect of another decade of huge budget deficits. The best evidence of
deteriorating fiscal trends is the rise in the 'operating deficit' - the
federal deficit minus debt interest and extraordinary items such as the cost
of the S &amp; L bail-out. This has risen by Dollars 120bn in the past year.
The US, he says, 'must go back to the drawing board' and find a better way
of controlling federal deficits. But he is not hopeful of progress. This
year's fight over tax cuts will exhaust patience on Capitol Hill and lessen
the chance of a comprehensive attack on the deficit in 1993 - the first year
of a new presidency and thus the best opportunity for fiscal restraint.
Mr Mullins's rapid rise has sparked speculation that he could be a future
candidate for Treasury secretary. He discourages the idea. He is a 'problem
solver' who has 'never had much ambition for the public spotlight'. The Fed,
with its 200 economists, provides an agreeable setting for an ex-academic,
comparable with that of a 'world-class university'.
'I'm very happy here,' he says with a smile. 'It's a setting where you can
do real analytical research yet also have a real policy impact.' Perhaps his
ambitious eye is set on the Fed chairmanship when Mr Greenspan's term
expires.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Monday Profile: Whitehall's youngest mandarin - Peter Marsh
on the rise of Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the UK Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ahead of next month's Budget, Mr Norman Lamont is not the only person
feeling the pressure. While the chancellor will make the important
decisions, he will rely heavily for advice on Sir Terry Burns, permanent
secretary at the Treasury and the great survivor of UK economic policymaking
over the past decade.
The soccer-loving Sir Terry has been a leading influence on four chancellors
since his appointment as the Treasury's chief economic adviser in 1980 by
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister. He was promoted to the top
Treasury job last April.
Views differ over his record. Some see him as the Mr Fixit of the
government's economic service, who, through his pragmatic approach and
presentational skills, helped lay the ground for a string of election
victories for the Tories. Indeed, he has been so closely involved with the
Conservative government that some have criticised him for abandoning the
traditional non-partisan approach of the civil service.
Others say Sir Terry made crucial mistakes in judging the direction of the
economy. According to critics, the errors included the failure first to
foresee the 1986-88 economic boom, and then to choke it off quickly enough,
through monetary or fiscal tightening.
The long period of high interest rates which were eventually brought in to
dampen the demand explosion almost certainly exacerbated the current
recession - the longest since the second world war.
Some of the forecasting mistakes seem large - even allowing for the
difficulties of economic management and that many of the errors were shared
by non-government economists. In November 1987, for instance, the Treasury
predicted a 1988 current account deficit of Pounds 3.5bn; it turned out 342
per cent higher at Pounds 15.5bn.
The Treasury's mistakes around that time were based on an underestimate of
demand and inflationary pressures. But at the start of the recession, it
misread the economy in precisely the opposite direction. Thus in November
1990, the Treasury said gross domestic product in 1991 would grow by a
modest 0.5 per cent. In the event, as figures last week showed, output
slumped by a steep 2.5 per cent, the biggest annual drop since the 1930s.
Viewed in terms of the economic developments of the past five years, Sir
Terry's record looks less than impressive. But in the debate about what went
wrong, he has emerged largely unscathed. Among the less reverent, he is
called Teflon Terry.
This is not a sobriquet which would appeal to Mr Lamont, who is thought to
have a good relationship with his senior official. The chancellor will find
Sir Terry's skills invaluable in packaging the March 10 Budget, which is
expected to unveil tax cuts that could cheer voters up in time for the
general election.
But one former Treasury official - with good political connections - is
negative about Sir Terry. He says: 'Choosing Terry as permanent secretary
may have been a mistake. The things he's good at - macroeconomics and
forecasting - are the things that have gone wrong in the past five years.
The questions for the 1990s are in microeconomic areas like training,
education and public services, where he lacks expertise.'
As the recession has dragged on, Sir Terry has undoubtedly been feeling the
heat. Lord Croham, who worked as Treasury permanent secretary in the 1970s,
says: 'I'm sure Sir Terry feels responsible (for some of the problems of the
UK economy), but not enough to push him out of his stride.'
Indeed, Sir Terry has in recent months been looking his normal sprightly
self - and has told friends he is enjoying his new job. As well as being
resilient, Sir Terry is adaptable. Mr Geoffrey Dicks, head of economic
forecasting at the London Business School, where Sir Terry once worked,
says: 'He's the ultimate insider. Give him the clothes and he'll play the
part.'
This is despite the fact that in many ways Sir Terry is the antithesis of
the traditional, smooth-talking Treasury mandarin. With a working-class
background in the industrial north-east and a Geordie accent, Sir Terry is
one of only five of the 23 people at permanent-secretary level in the
government who did not attend Oxford or Cambridge. At 47, he is also the
youngest.
On several occasions, Sir Terry has demonstrated flexibility on economic
principles. While working in the 1970s as an economist at the LBS - which he
joined after an economics degree at Manchester University - Sir Terry
followed an approach to the economy based on the then-dominant Keynesian
orthodoxy of managing demand through fiscal and monetary tuning. Later in
the 1970s, he caught Mrs Thatcher's attention because of his move to a
monetarist approach - which emphasised the control of inflation by limiting
monetary growth.
In the early 1980s, when this policy did not seem to be the answer to
Britain's problems, Sir Terry switched to support for the semi-fixed
exchange rates of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). He was a
leading influence backing ERM entry in October 1990, a step that at one time
he had opposed because of the rigidities it would impose on monetary
policies.
Sir Terry also has a gift for presentation. He lent his name, for example,
to the so-called Burns doctrine - according to which the balance of payments
is a problem for government, only if the public sector is borrowing.
Otherwise it is a problem for the private sector. Sir Terry is also believed
to have formulated the argument that many of the Treasury's forecasting
mistakes of recent years can be laid at the door of faulty statistics -
sharing the responsibility with government statisticians.
Some go so far as to say that, under Sir Terry, the Treasury's 100-strong
economics unit has become less a dispassionate provider of economic analysis
as an uncritical cheer-leader for government policies. One former colleague
says: 'By tarring (the economic service) with a Tory brush, he's brought it
into disrepute.' By this he means that the unit has not done enough to ask
questions about underlying trends in the economy - such as persistent
current account deficits and the impact of financial deregulation in the
early 1980s in boosting inflation - where the answers might have jarred with
ministers' overall laisser-faire approach.
Perhaps the key quality about Sir Terry is his management skills, and
ability to get on with people. Inside the Treasury he is given credit for an
ability to push through decisions and to link up well with other parts of
Whitehall. The unpretentious side to his nature is apparent in his support
since the 1960s for Queen's Park Rangers, the London soccer club. Mr Richard
Thompson, QPR's chairman, says Sir Terry is 'down-to-earth and intelligent'.
In spite of Sir Terry's charm, a view has gained ground recently among some
Tory MPs and industrialists that Treasury officials have escaped lightly in
the debate about the inadequacies of economic policies in recent years.
According to this view, Mr Nigel Lawson (chancellor between 1983 and 1989)
has taken too much of the responsibility for the errors. One former Bank of
England official says: 'I don't see why chancellors should carry the can for
poor advice from their officials.'
Sir Douglas Hague, a former economic adviser to Mrs Thatcher, says he
brought to Sir Terry's attention early in the 1986-88 boom the rising house
prices that he felt could trigger a surge in inflation. 'I don't think Terry
was wary enough (about inflationary pressures) early enough,' he says. A
senior industrialist adds that last year he told Sir Terry that Britain was
facing not just a mild recession but a serious one. 'He didn't listen.'
Many outside economists find it difficult to square the Treasury's
inaccurate forecasting in recent years with Sir Terry's good record at the
LBS and in his early days as economic adviser to the Treasury. At the LBS,
says one former co-worker, Sir Terry often worked into the small hours,
twiddling his computer equations to get predictions that 'felt' right. This
person says Sir Terry has lost much of his zeal for accuracy by working too
long in the public sector.
An intriguing question concerns Sir Terry's future if Labour forms the next
government. The official view from Labour is that it would be happy to work
with Sir Terry. But some Labour sympathisers - such as Mr Neil MacKinnon,
chief European economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house - think
Sir Terry is too closely identified with Tory policies to remain in office
if Labour won the election. Should this happen - and bearing in mind the
different approach that Labour would take to policy areas such as industrial
policy and training where the Treasury has a vital say - Sir Terry might
once more be called on to make a switch in direction.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Justinian: How to avoid trial by ordeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The length of the Blue Arrow and Guinness trials, completed or abandoned in
recent weeks, has highlighted the difficulties of trying complex frauds by
jury.
There is a radical solution, but it will not be found within the criminal
justice system as we know it, or within whatever the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice is likely to devise for the future. The iron equation of
crime and punishment must be abandoned for most frauds (the straightforward
theft as in Barlow Clowes could safely be left to criminal justice) and
replaced with an investigation of fraudulent conduct by a public inquiry,
together with steps to eradicate the conditions that fostered the
fraudster's art.
Fraud cases take a long time coming to trial, because the process of
garnering and ordering the mass of documentary material and taking
statements from witnesses is time-consuming. The accused's anxieties,
induced by the delay, are comparatively tolerable.
Trial by ordeal is not tolerable. In former times guilt or innocence was
left to supernatural decision. Nowadays the ordeal is a protracted court
proceeding, with the verdict in the hands of those uninitiated in the
financial world's ways.
The worst example of the marathon fraud trial has just ended in Nottingham
Crown Court. In September 1990 four persons accused of a medium-scale fraud
went on trial. Two hundred and fifty days later, at a cost of more than
Pounds 3m, they were convicted. The main defendant was sentenced to four
years' imprisonment, a considerable discount having been given, no doubt,
for the time that the threat of imprisonment hung over him.
The apparent leniency of suspended sentences on the Blue Arrow defendants
was due as much to the length of the trial as to the reduced criminality of
the convicted. Financial ruin and ill-health are also powerful factors for
displacing imprisonment. Mr Ernest Saunders, convicted in August in the
first Guinness trial, suffered from pre-senile dementia, prompting a
reduction in sentence on appeal. In the second Guinness trial Mr Roger
Seelig was stretched beyond the limits of endurance.
Mr Justice Henry, who tried the Guinness cases, has rightly called for
radical reform, 'not just a tinkering of the process'. The Royal Commission
on Criminal Justice will no doubt heed his words, but because realistically
the body politic will not countenance the abolition of trial by jury, it is
hard to see how criminal justice can cope. Jury trial will always take much
longer than a professional tribunal.
A 'radical solution' was proposed in 1986, at the very moment the Guinness
fraud was exposed. Lord Roskill, a retired law lord, proposed an alternative
tribunal, composed of a High Court judge and two assessors with expertise in
business and finance to try complex fraud cases. The trial by jury lobby
prevailed upon government to reject such a sensible solution.
As Jonathan Caplan QC, chairman of the Bar's public affairs committee, said:
'Before we actually get rid of jury trial in a certain category of cases, we
should want to be convinced that there is no satisfactory way to maintain
the status quo.' Neither the status quo, nor the status quo ante can provide
a satisfactory way. If a trial for serious crime must be by one's peers,
then we must look elsewhere for a solution than in criminal justice.
The main purpose of criminal justice is to satisfy society that an offender
has been proved guilty in order to legitimise punishment, with imprisonment
as the ultimate sanction. The procedural safeguards must be stringent, to
avoid unfairness in the trial process and to reduce the risk of wrongful
conviction.
The potential loss of liberty a criminal faces is a powerful incentive to
all those administering criminal justice to ensure that the highest
standards are met. There is a heavy price to be paid, however, in lengthy
trials and huge cost to the public purse.
The law must constantly adapt its procedure to meet new challenges to social
equilibrium. The Financial Services Act 1986, which implemented many of Lord
Roskill's recommendations about handling fraud cases, has probably done most
to stem the tide of some fraudulent activities. Clever fraudsters will,
however, continue to find new loopholes.
If the prime purpose of the law is both to expose and prevent fraud, there
should be a new form of justice, in which society will have to forgo the
power of imprisonment. Instead of jury trials, there must be a public
inquiry which will investigate all circumstances of a fraudulent enterprise
so that the truth - and not just the unreasoned verdict of an ill-equipped
jury - may be paraded before the public in the form of a full report.
Miscreants would be named in a final report by the committee of inquiry, and
their wrongdoings recorded. The committee would have the power to order any
person found at fault to pay the costs of the inquiry, reasonably
proportioned to the defaulter's part in the fraud. Other administrative
penalties - such as disqualification from company directorships,
disciplinary actions by professional bodies, disqualification from voting
and removal of honours - could form part of the system. In addition, the
persons committing the fraud would remain liable to actions in the civil
courts.
The perpetrators of institutional fraud would have more to fear from these
measures than from a short spell in an open prison, followed by the
opportunity to re-establish themselves without apparent commercial ill
effects.
If it is objected that fraud should be treated no differently from murder,
it is well to note that fraudsters are more likely to destabilise society
than are dangerous gangsters. Criminal justice cannot protect the modern
democratic society against the fraudster. An alternative system of
administrative justice must replace it.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Syndicated Loans: Turkish borrower to launch Dollars 100m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOC, one of Turkey's two largest industrial conglomerates, is launching its
first substantial international financing, consisting of a Dollars 70m club
loan and a DM50m private placement of bonds.
The Dollars 100m medium-term financing is interesting for two reasons:
first, because Koc hopes to raise its profile in the international capital
markets and, secondly, because Turkish names have tended to borrow
short-term in the loans market recently, but are keen to extend their debt
maturity profile.
Koc, a family-controlled group, is listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange and
has subsidiaries in the banking, tourism, textiles, consumer durables and
auto sectors. It is not well-known in the international capital markets. In
the past, the group has met its financing requirements from its cash flow or
with the help of domestic banks. Although it issued DM30m in Eurobonds in
1989, using a private placement, Koc has not made any other significant
borrowings in the international markets.
The Dollars 100m financing is seen as a means of establishing relations with
a small group of banks in preparation for further international borrowings -
possibly to help finance acquisitions in Europe. So far Koc has not made
such acquisitions to expand outside its home base.
'The advantage of doing this (Dollars 100m) financing now is that if Koc
decides to do an acquisition later on, it would be better-known in the
capital markets, and could raise the necessary financing more easily and
more quickly than if it had not borrowed in the capital markets before,'
says one banker associated with the deal.
The five-year club deal has three arrangers: International Finance
Corporation (IFC, the World Bank affiliate devoted to private sector
investment); Commerzbank (which is leading the D-Mark bond placement); and
JP Morgan. Deutsche Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland, and Bank of Tokyo are
lead managers and underwriters. Three of the lenders - IFC, JP Morgan and
UBS - have triple A ratings.
The margin is around 100 basis points over the London interbank offered rate
(Libor). Clearly, Turkish borrowers have had to agree to more generous
pricings since the last medium-term loan - the Republic of Turkey's
three-year Dollars 200m syndicated credit launched last summer with a margin
of 90 basis points over Libor. At the time, the deal was described as
aggressively priced and met with a poor reception.
Several Turkish borrowers tapped the syndicated loans market after the the
Gulf war, although many of them have used one-year deals. While Turkish
borrowers are keen to extend their debt maturity profile, bankers point out
that it is difficult to attract lenders for longer-term loans.
British Bank of the Middle East has agreed a 10-year Dollars 56.6m financing
for the United Arab Emirates' latest Airbus A310-300. The airline is
expanding its fleet, and three A310s are to be delivered this year.

FT  24 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Attention switches to World Bank's
global yen plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL investors gave a warm welcome to Spain's giant Y125bn bond
issue last week, underlining the appetite of investment managers for Euroyen
assets - if they are sensibly priced.
The caveat could be important as the market braces itself for another huge
issue of yen bonds, against a background of uncertain market conditions.
Attention has now switched to the World Bank's planned 10-year global yen
bond issue, expected early next month. The deal will be of at least Y150bn,
and possibly as large as Y250bn, dwarfing even last week's deal.
Nomura International, IBJ International and JP Morgan have been awarded a
joint mandate to lead-manage the transaction, the first global offering in
yen.
The strong underlying demand for yen bonds is based on the outlook for
Japanese interest rates, which are likely to fall as the economy slows. The
overnight discount rate was last cut by  1/2 a point to 4.5 per cent on
December 30.
However, it remains uncertain just when the Bank of Japan will cut rates
again, and the bond market has been engaged in a game of cat-and-mouse with
the authorities this year.
Japanese government bond prices peaked in mid-January as the market began to
discount another monetary easing. But the central bank deliberately squashed
expectations of another early cut in interest rates, squeezing money-market
rates higher and causing the bond market to retreat.
Government bond yields touched 5.185 per cent on January 22 at the peak of
the market, but bounced back to 5.475 per cent on February 2. They have
since been caught in volatile trading range.
There is also uncertainty over the direction of the Japanese currency. In
the run-up to last month's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers
from the Group of Seven industrial countries, there were expectations of
co-ordinated action to strengthen the yen. The argument ran that
policy-makers would use a stronger yen to cap Japan's huge trade surplus -
which rose 50 per cent to Dollars 78.2bn last year.
However, the G7 meeting did not result in any firm commitment on exchange
rates. Although the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan have since
intervened in the foreign exchange markets to prop up the yen, many
investors still see the chance of gradual depreciation of the Japanese
currency against the dollar.
Hence, while there is strong underlying interest in Euro-yen bonds, the
immediate market conditions for 'jumbo' issues are not altogether
auspicious. Spain recognised this by pricing its bonds at a sensible level.
The deal was seen among syndicate officials as a triumph for consensus
pricing. Nomura, which won the mandate to lead-manage the deal following a
competitive bidding process among top underwriting firms, eventually priced
the bonds in consultation with its competitors.
It remains to be seen whether the World Bank will be as accommodating.
Outstanding World Bank bonds trade at a yield lower than Japanese government
bonds, a record which the borrower will be hoping to extend.
Against this, the Euro-yen market has seen a move in favour of larger, more
liquid issues in recent years as institutional investors have demanded
greater liquidity. Last year saw only fractionally more new issues than in
1988, yet average size of the deals more than doubled over the same period.
The World Bank global issue will be the most liquid of all yen instruments
available internationally. It will be traded in all time zones and will be
of a credit quality to attract all types of investors, including central
banks. Even so, investors are waiting to see whether the World Bank will
trim its ambitions to fit market conditions.
Gefco, the UK government-backed export finance agency, launched a rare
Pounds 350m three-year floating-rate note issue on Friday.
The only outstanding sovereign-backed issue in the sterling FRN sector is
New Zealand's Pounds 200m deal, which was launched in June 1986 and is no
longer traded actively.
Floating-rate notes of sovereign credit quality are used by central banks to
manage short-term liquidity. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the lead manager,
estimated that around 75 per cent of the deal was placed with central banks
and supranational agencies overseas.
The bonds pay a margin of 25 basis points less than the six-month London
interbank offered rate. The paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed
price of 99.875, where the discounted margin is 20 basis points under Libor.
In the past, Gefco has met most of its funding requirements, used to
refinance loans made by commercial banks to overseas borrowers, in the
fixed-rate bond market. However, the proceeds of Friday's issue were swapped
to give Gefco fixed-rate funding at an interest rate comparable to that
achieved by the government in the gilts market.

FT  24 FEB 92 / German Bunds: Investors ponder indicators amid uneasy calm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Bund market has now entered a reflective phase. The surge in
prices which followed the Bundesbank's interest rate move just before
Christmas has given way to an uneasy calm as investors ponder the
implications of this month's settlement in the steel sector and the outlook
for money supply and inflation.
On all these counts, there has been a worsening of sentiment since the end
of last year. Investors - largely international investors - then bought
heavily because they assumed the Bundesbank's shock tactics would drum
moderation into the unions and deal a fast blow to headline inflation, thus
creating the conditions whereby interest rates could be brought down again
sharply.
In fact, there was a consensus earlier in the year that rates would be cut
as early as April, assuming that shortly before then there would emerge
conclusive evidence that inflation in the western part of Germany was not
going to reach the feared annualised rate of 5 per cent at all. Thus there
were fairly general predictions that the yield on the 10-year long Bund
would tumble to 7.5 per cent by the middle of the year, down from 8.25 per
cent before December's rate cut.
The outlook for inflation has not worsened in the intervening weeks, but
perceptions about the Bundesbank's interest rate stance have. The market
senses a growing likelihood that the hoped-for rate cut will not come until
the third quarter of the year at the earliest. Hence the Bund yield is
currently lodged at 7.94 per cent - fractionally down on its best for the
current year - and pundits are more reluctant to predict further imminent
price gains.
It is too strong to say the market has been infected by outright pessimism.
However, the strike settlement, with a pay increase of an effective 6.35 per
cent, was undoubtedly higher than the central bank would have liked and is
bound to have an impact on the forthcoming wage negotiations in the public
and engineering sectors. The steelworkers' settlement is therefore deemed
likely to act as a spur to prolonged vigilance in monetary policy.
The news on inflation is more positive: Dieter Wermuth at the Caisse des
Depots et Consignations in Frankfurt points out that import prices have been
falling at an annualised rate of 5 per cent since June last year, and that
export prices for January are likely to have risen by only 1.2 per cent year
on year. The year-on-year rate for consumer prices is likely to be 4.1 per
cent for February. 'An excellent result,' says Mr Wermuth, and one which
makes 5 per cent look less probable later in the year.
On the other hand, figures out on Friday showed that money supply grew at an
annualised rate of 9 per cent in January - well outside the 3.5 to 5.5 per
cent range set for the whole of 1992. The Bundesbank is determined to choke
off this growth - another reason why rates are unlikely to be brought down
in the short term.
On balance, commentators believe the medium-term prognosis is favourable,
that interest rates will be on their way down again within six months or so.
But that is not what international investors were hoping for when they
bought so vigorously earlier in the year and, in the short term, the market
seems likely to stagnate at current levels.

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Gilts: Prices up slightly despite weak data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC sector borrowing requirement figures released last week confirmed
what the gilt market already suspected: the government's deficit for the
full financial year is likely to top Pounds 12bn. January's figures may have
shown a net repayment of Pounds 3.7bn, but they came against a background of
steadily deteriorating government finances.
So far, however, the market has remained relatively sanguine at the prospect
of burgeoning government borrowing, and has already discounted an
'electoral' budget in which the government gives away some Pounds 3bn to 4bn
in tax cuts. Because of this, the likelihood is that the PSBR will rise to
at least Pounds 24bn in fiscal 1992-1993.
Last week the market failed to react adversely to the steady stream of bad
economic news delivering blows to the government.
Prices over the week crept slightly upwards, with a consequent small decline
in yields. The 10 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2001 rose nearly  1/4
point on the week, closing on Friday night at 103 23/32 , yielding 9.37 per
cent. The longer-dated 9 per cent, conversion stock (type-B) due in 2011
rose  7/32 to 98 to yield 9.14 per cent.
The tolerance of the market to the weak economic data - which may reduce the
Conservatives' chances for re-election - stems from long-term optimism over
inflation. As Mr Nigel Richardson of SG Warburg Securities says: 'The
inflation background is winning out at the long end. The PSBR is an onerous
level of funding but it is offset by the background of extremely good
inflation.'
Headline inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, is 4.1 per cent,
while core inflation, as measured by the price of manufactured goods at the
factory gate, is 4.5 per cent - its lowest level for 3 1/2 years. As lower
wage settlements feed through into the inflation rate, many economists
believe that headline inflation will fall below 3 per cent by the end of the
year. All this is encouraging for gilts at the long end.
However long-term optimism is being clouded by short-term uncertainty, and
there are several reasons why there is a need for caution in the market.
First, there is the question mark over the election, which looks
increasingly likely to take place on April 9. An opinion poll on Friday put
Labour four points ahead of the Conservatives, a lead which, given the
recent run of poor economic news, could become a trend. The market feels
concerned about the prospects of a Labour government, arguing that it could
lead to higher inflation in the long term.
Secondly, overseas investors avoided the UK gilts market last week, fearful
perhaps of the government's more open endorsement of fiscal reflation and
the political uncertainty.
Meanwhile, the question on everyone's mind during the week concerned the
Pounds 1.25bn tranche of 9 per cent Treasury tap stock due in 2012, which
the Bank of England issued on February 10. So far only about half of the
stock has been sold.
The remainder continues to cause mild indigestion, failing to attract
buyers. On Friday the market was almost one point off the tap level after a
second week of failing to break through.
Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, says the haste
with which the Bank issued the tap helps explain why the market is finding
it difficult to make short term progress.
'One feels that the recent healthy appetite for all sterling bonds from the
overseas sector could have caused the Bank to misjudge the current buying
interest of the domestic institutions,' he says.
If it is still there in another two weeks, the Bank will have to withdraw
the stock or cut its price. After all, it has to get on with its funding
requirements and cannot afford to wait around for ever.

FT  24 FEB 92 / US Money and Credit: Fed adds to confusion and gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US fixed-income market starts this week disheartened and distinctly
confused by the latest thoughts and actions of the Federal Reserve and their
implications for interest rates.
Last week's market activity was dominated by two Fed developments. On
Tuesday, it announced it was cutting the proportion of checking account
deposits that banks have to hold as reserves, which do not accumulate
interest, from 12 per cent to 10 per cent.
The move, which does not come into effect until April, will lower banks'
cost of funds, improve their balance sheets, and - hopes the Fed - encourage
them to lend more to US business and help the nascent economic expansion.
The following day, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, went before Congress
and gave his semi-annual report on the economy and monetary policy. His tone
was distinctly upbeat, albeit hedged around with caveats.
The economy, he said, was poised for recovery. He estimated it would grow
this year at an inflation-adjusted 1.75 to 2.5 per cent, while inflation
would drop to the lowest rate in a generation.
All this thoroughly depressed the bond market. The reduction in reserve
requirements was seen as monetary easing in another form, and thus a move
which reduced the likelihood of a further cut in interest rates. And gloom
was increased by the thought that Mr Greenspan's optimism might actually be
right, for the fixed-income market dislikes economic growth, with attendant
inflation, which undermines the value of its securities.
However the gloom could be a little overdone. First, the market may have
read too much into the change in reserve requirements. For as the bond
analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette point out, when the Fed undertakes
reductions in reserve requirements it usually sterilised the effect of the
move by draining excess reserves from the banking system.
Mr Geoffrey Dennis, of brokers James Capel, says the move is 'yet another
effort by the Fed to kick-start bank lending, which has continued to be held
back in recent months both by supply constraints imposed by the banks and a
lack of demand from customers'. Second, if the Fed really believes the
economy is poised for recovery, why does it need to add a further stimulus
to the banking system now?
A logical explanation is that it is not yet fully convinced that recovery is
sustainable, and the banking move is a relatively low-cost, non-inflationary
means of bolstering the financial system. Certainly, the past week has
produced a rash of statistics which, at first sight, support some economic
optimism.
Car sales jumped in early February; January retail sales were strong; and
the housing market has shown further signs of a pick-up, albeit from a very
low base and in limited regions of the country.
Money supply has also started expanding strongly: M2, the broad money
measure closely followed by the Fed, rose Dollars 9.5bn in the latest
reporting week, putting it comfortably within the bank's 2.5 to 6.5 per cent
target rate for 1992 growth.
None of all this provides conclusive evidence of sustained growth. Cynical
analysts point out that many of these same factors also occured last year,
offering a false dawn of economic recovery.
Yet there are huge differences this time around: interest rates are much
lower; the banking system has gone a long way to repairing its balance
sheet; and corporate America has also been through a wholesale
restructuring. The Fed's hopes for a gradual recovery seem to leave its
monetary policy on hold for now. If fresh signs of weakness emerge, such as
a disappointing February employment report, due early in March, it could yet
cut the Fed funds rate from 4 per cent to 3.75 or 3.5 per cent.
But if it thinks the recovery is sustainable, the US may already be at the
bottom of the interest rate cycle - and that thought produced substantial
falls in bond prices last week. At one point, the benchmark Treasury 30-year
bond rose almost to the psychological barrier of an 8 per cent yield.
The market is focusing far more on Mr Greenspan's growth forecasts than his
more encouraging inflationary expectations, which he predicated upon
'appropriate economic policies'. For in an election year, with President
Bush suffering a severe setback in New Hampshire last week, it would be
unwise to bank on either Congress or the White House acting appropriately.

warrants range
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE AMERICAN Stock Exchange (ASE) has begun trading a currency warrant based
on the performance of the US dollar against the British pound. It already
trades foreign currency warrants based on the Japanese yen and German Mark,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Currency warrants are derivative financial instruments which allow investors
to buy a specified amount of currency at a predetermined time and exchange
rate, although warrants traded on the ASE can be settled in cash at any time
before the contract expires.
The pound warrants are aimed at institutional investors who participate in
long-term investment or hedging strategies linked to the pound. They act
much like call options in the dollar, and their value fluctuates as the
value of the US dollar rises or falls against a specific currency.

approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's financial regulator, has
approved a revised version of the colony's takeovers code. It will come into
effect on April 1, writes Simon Holberton.
Mr Ermanno Pascutto, executive director of the SFC and chairman of the
takeovers committee, said the final draft was close to the document the SFC
released in November.
The most important of the revisions, however, is a tightening of the
definition of acting in concert.
Persons will be deemed to be acting in concert if they co-operate to obtain
or consolidate control of voting rights in a company, whether by purchasing
securities or by coming together for such purpose. Previously, the code
referred only to the acquisition of securities.

<TEXT>
FOREIGN bank creditors to Agrifactoring, the Italian factoring concern
linked to the troubled Federconsorzi farm services group, are set to be
repaid their outstanding loans in full, writes Haig Simonian.
The agreement concludes one of the most acrimonious episodes in relations
between Italian and foreign banks in recent years, and should restore
harmony to links between foreign financial institutions and the state-owned
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in particular.
Foreign bank creditors to Agrifactoring, which is 50 per cent owned by the
BNL group, had taken the bank to task over its refusal to repay loans to
Agrifactoring following the collapse of Federconsorzi last year. BNL
disclaimed responsibility for Agrifactoring.
Under the compromise, BNL, along with Banco di Santo Spirito and Efibanca,
the two other Italian bank shareholders in Agrifactoring, will subordinate
their L429bn (Dollars 346.5m) lending to Agrifactoring to that of other
financial institutions.

FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: Borrowing on capital markets
hits record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORROWING on the world's international financial markets in 1991 reached a
record Dollars 518bn, a 'remarkable achievement' in light of the poor
performance of the world economy and widespread pessimism about the future,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said.
However the boom in borrowing was restricted largely to international bond
markets, says the OECD's latest report on Financial Trends.
By contrast, syndicated bank credits fell to Dollars 113.2bn, their lowest
level since 1987, as borrowing costs rose sharply. In 1990, Dollars 124.5bn
in syndicated bank credits were recorded.
The sharp drop in bank lending reflects growing anxiety about credit quality
internationally, the OECD said. That anxiety, coupled with the effects of
capital adequacy guidelines, has stiffened margins and fees to their highest
levels since the early 1980s.
The overall borrowing picture, however, brightened towards the end of the
year when higher-rated corporations found it easier to raise funds for
capital expansion or restructuring. Thus, while conditions remained
difficult for highly-leveraged or non-prime borrowers, there are signs that
the rise in fees may be tapering off.
Meanwhile, the dip in long-term interest rates appeared to have fuelled the
boom in all forms of bond issues, including equity-linked securities.
Following a sharp decline in 1990, these surged by 30 per cent to Dollars
41.3bn, largely reflecting a pick-up in borrowing by Japanese corporations.
On the bond markets, there was a shift in the growth patterns of currencies,
with so-called traditional issuing currencies lagging well beyond newer
ones. In particular, Ecu-denominated bonds surged by 78 per cent over 1990,
despite the uncertainties over negotiations on the treaty on European
Monetary Union.

FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: Saab Auto on the road to
recovery - Chances for a turnround at the Swedish-US venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saab Auto's 1991 results, to be announced today, will be better than most
observers expect, says Mr David Herman, the company's American-born chief
executive. But he is the first to admit Saab Auto has some way to go before
it starts making an annual profit.
'If we can sell 100,000 cars this year, and the exchange rate is at SKr6.50
to the dollar, then we will be in profit,' he says. But in 1991 Saab sold
only 87,500 units and its main markets - the US, Britain and Scandinavia -
are where the recession is at its deepest.
This year's sales outlook remains grim even if Saab is doing better than
other foreign car-makers in the US market. Only a few days ago, the company
announced temporary six-hours-a-week production cutbacks would continue
until the end of April.
Ever since early 1990, when Saab Auto was formed as a jointly-owned
partnership between Saab-Scania and General Motors, it has been grappling
with financial difficulties.
In its first three months of trading, pre-tax losses were SKr995m (Dollars
166m), while for the whole of 1990 a deficit of SKr4.64bn almost wiped out
the company's original SKr6.4bn equity capital.
Mr Herman was compelled to shut down Saab's new SKr1.3bn assembly plant in
Malmo, in southern Sweden, early last year. He also had to push through a
tough rationalisation programme which will have cut the payroll by more than
a third by the end of this year.
By last autumn, the size of Saab's losses began to decline - with a SKr699m
deficit in the second quarter of 1991 and a loss of SKr574m in the third
quarter - despite flat sales and heavy start-up costs for the Saab 9000 CS
model.
The company was helped with a SKr5.5bn cash injection from its joint owners
last June, while in the autumn Saab Auto raised Dollars 750m through a
syndicated financing for its planned product and marketing developments in
the 1990s.
It has been an uphill struggle, however. A plain-speaking, though modest,
man, Mr Herman was 'shocked' at what he saw in Saab's plants when he first
arrived. 'I just could not see what everybody was doing. There were too many
people with unclear work assignments,' he explains.
Saab was also being crippled by a 25 per cent annual job turnover rate, and
more than 10 per cent daily absenteeism among its blue-collar workers.
Contrary to expectations, however, he did not march in and impose a GM
management style on the company Instead, he sought to work with, and not
against, the grain of Swedish labour practice.
He focused on cutting costs and boosting productivity through greater
efficiencies, turning Saab's independent work groups into teams with
'continuous training', and developing jobs with career prospects. Wage
differentials based on merit and skill have been introduced. Managers are
more integrated into the production process.
Saab's performance has certainly improved. Productivity is up, with a cut in
production time per car from 85 hours to 60 hours. This has brought Saab
more into line with European levels of output, though it still lies far
behind the 30 hours achieved in some Japanese plants. Staff turnover is down
to 8 per cent a year and absenteeism to 5 per cent.
Synergies in product development between Saab and GM, as well as joint
sourcing of components and a merger of dealer networks in Sweden, is helping
the company claw its way out of trouble.
However Mr Herman remains cautions; 'I am not a saviour. It is the Swedes,
not me, who have been making the changes.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALITALIA, Italy's national airline, sharply reduced group net losses to
L34.5bn (Dollars 27.9m) last year from L97.7bn in 1990, despite the affects
of the Gulf war on load factors.
The war was the main factor in a 4.6 per cent fall in international
passenger traffic over the year, the company said.
Overall, passenger numbers fell to 17.28m in 1991 from 18.20m the previous
year. The load factor slipped to 61.3 per cent from 64.5.
Alitalia's group turnover rose 7 per cent to L6,000bn last year. The company
estimated that the Gulf fighting caused a L280bn loss of potential sales. At
parent company level, turnover increased by 5.4 per cent to L4,700bn, while
losses declined to L43.7bn from L114.2bn in 1990.
Alitalia's performance was boosted by an undisclosed number of aircraft
sales during the first half of last year, which improved cash flow and
generated revenues of L177bn at group level. However, the company stressed
it had also kept tight control on costs, with measures to improve efficiency
contributing L50bn for the group.
Part of the savings came through job cuts, with a fall of almost 1,100 in
staff numbers at the parent company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CENTRAL stock clearing system for the Hong Kong stock market could be
operational before the summer following agreement between the regulator and
representatives of the market.
Mr Paul Chow, the exchange's chief executive, said agreement on all
outstanding issues had been reached between the exchange, the Securities and
Futures Commission - the colony's financial watchdog - and the Hongkong
Securities Clearing Company, the entity which will operate the system.
This agreement has paved the way for the SFC to recognise the clearing
company formally. It is hoped the new system will be operational on a
trade-for-trade basis within eight to 12 weeks.
After the colonial government has enacted its Securities (Clearing Houses)
Bill, market risk will be centralised within the company. However, brokers
will be required to take out professional indemnity insurance and make
monthly transaction reports.
Governance of the clearing house has been one of the main stumbling blocks
to agreement, with the SFC and government wanting to see sufficient outside
representation on its board.
The board will consist of 22 members: 11 from the exchange; five appointed
by the financial secretary; five from the banks; and the chief executive of
the clearing company.

FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: CS First Boston returns to
health with Dollars 215m net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS FIRST BOSTON, the global investment bank which suffered heavy losses and
internal upheaval in 1990, will today underline its return to health by
reporting net earnings of Dollars 215m for 1991.
The New York-based firm is a subsidiary of Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank,
which in 1990 had to launch a financial bail-out for CS First Boston when
its Dollars 1.2bn exposure to troubled corporate 'bridge loans' prompted a
Wall Street crisis of confidence in First Boston's liquidity.
The 1991 profit compares to a loss of Dollars 587m in 1990, when it took
provisions against exposure to the bridge loans and the property market, and
suffered a difficult trading year and a round of cost-cutting. It made just
Dollars 11m in 1989.
Last year's figures are broadly in line with sharply increased profits
reported by many investment banks, thanks to strong equity and debt markets.
However, First Boston may have been more conservative than some rivals in
committing funds to trading on its own account, which was a particularly
profitable Wall Street activity in 1991.
Mr John Hennessy, chief executive, said the group's two biggest operating
units - Credit Suisse-First Boston in Europe and First Boston Corporation in
the Americas - had contributed roughly equally to profits, with a smaller
but positive contribution coming from the group's growing Asian operation.
He added that 1992 had got off to a good start, and that January's worldwide
results had been 'some of the strongest we have ever recorded'.
The upheavals of 1990, including staff cuts or defections and a shrinking
balance sheet, led some analysts to question whether First Boston would be
able to retain the strength of its franchise as one of the world's
pre-eminent investment banks.
However, the company points out that 1991 league tables compiled by
Securities Data show it placed second in global debt security underwriting,
third in global underwriting of common stocks and initial public offerings,
and third in global announced merger and acquisition transactions.
During the year, its equity capitalisation rose 21 per cent from Dollars
706m to Dollars 858m, while all the company's bridge loans have now been
permanently refinanced. It received Dollars 535m in cash last year from the
sale of some of these investments.

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Decision on Chelsea ground likely this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK looks like being a crucial one for Cabra Estates, the property
company which owns Stamford Bridge, home of Chelsea football club, writes
Jane Fuller.
Tomorrow, SB Property, which is 83.5 per cent owned by Cabra, will seek a
High Court injunction to force Chelsea to pay Pounds 22.85m for the ground.
The price was set by an independent valuer last November and it relates to
Chelsea's 1988 exercising of an option to buy.
A case involving a counter-claim for damages from Chelsea, which Cabra has
applied to the court to strike out, may also be heard.
Chelsea, which is chaired by Mr Ken Bates, is taking other legal action. It
wants to buy Stamford Bridge, but Mr Bates has yet to give any details about
finance.
Mr John Duggan, Cabra's chairman, said the aim was to get Chelsea to
complete the contract. If it did not, action would be taken against it.
Eviction of the first division club is one possibility.
Cabra, which last year lost Pounds 11.3m pre-tax and had year-end debt of
Pounds 52m, has delayed the publication of its interim results for more than
two months because of the uncertainty over Stamford Bridge.
The figures for the six months to September 30 are due to come out on
Thursday. In the first half of 1990-91, the company lost Pounds 5.24m.
Its share price has fallen to 7p from nearly 120p in mid-1989, when Mr
Duggan became chairman after the takeover of Marler Estates which brought in
both Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, Fulham football club's ground.
This month has seen further buying of Cabra shares by Mr Ashraf Marwan, an
Egyptian financier, who now owns about 27 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Mahony, chairman of control systems group Harland Simon for ten years
until 1990, returns to chair the board following the retirement of Roy
Ashman, who had been chief executive, and chairman since the end of 1990.
Harland Simon, holder of a Best British Company award for its performance
over the past five years, issued a profits warning just over a week ago,
which resulted in the share price tumbling from 585p to 173p last Friday.
The collapse of the Maxwell empire has cost it some Pounds 2.75m, and other
important high margin contracts have also failed to emerge.
Mahony, who is currently very occupied reassuring institutional
shareholders, is also an industrial adviser to Hambros Bank, chairman of
Applied Holographics and on the board of a number of private companies.
Hinting that his reappearance in the chair may be relatively brief, he says
the company is looking for other board members. While he sold a sizeable
chunk of his shares last October, Mahony says he was back buying in the
market recently 'to demonstrate this is not a one-way trade'.
Harland Simon, which supplies drive controls to most UK dailies, has already
had a costly brush with Polly Peck and a Turkish newspaper venture. Mahony
sums up the position: 'Our difficulty lies with the sort of people who go
round buying newspapers.'

Pounds 1.3m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Brooke Tool Engineering almost halved to 7 1/4 p on
Friday as it announced a Pounds 2.6m downturn to a loss of Pounds 1.3m, the
passing of the final dividend and a change in top management.
By mutual agreement Mr Idris Jones has stood down as managing director and
will not seek re-election as a director. He has been with the group for 21
years.
Mr John Dashper has been appointed chief executive.
The group, which as its main activity supplies consumables to the
engineering industry, saw its profit fall to Pounds 80,000 at the operating
level, compared with Pounds 2.39m last time.
Turnover fell from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 25.3m as UK sales dropped 20 per
cent with margins in certain areas moving towards 'unacceptable levels'.
However, exports rose 14 per cent and now represent 30 per cent of total
sales.
Charged in the loss were relocation and redundancy costs of Pounds 408,000
and interest payments of Pounds 968,000 (Pounds 1.09m). The workforce was
reduced by 18 per cent in the year and by a further 10 per cent to date.
As part of the reorganisation and rationalisation, plans had been made to
dispose of certain non-core assets to enable gearing to be restored to a
more acceptable level and one major sale was being negotiated.
Many product areas had remained strong and maintained market share.
Losses per share came to 2.5p (earnings 2.2p). Omission of the final
dividend means the total is 0.25p (1.225p).

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Redland to attack Steetley values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDLAND, the building materials group, is to sharpen its attack on Steetley,
the target of its Pounds 626m hostile bid, following the collapse of joint
venture talks between Steetley and Tarmac last week and the resignation of
its prey's broker, Cazenove.
In particular Redland will focus on asset valuations and will claim that
Steetley's acquisition of Gobitta for Pounds 92m in 1990 overvalued the
private French aggregates company.
The attack is aimed to pre-empt Steetley's defence document, which is due
late this week once the Office of Fair Trading has accepted Redland's
undertakings on the disposals of plant in areas where it would have a
dominant position after a successful bid.
Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director at Redland, said that while some of
Steetley's UK assets could be revalued, as they had not been adjusted since
1984, the French assets may be worth less than book value.
Gobitta has 150m tonnes of sand, gravel and limestone reserves, but
permission to extract only 40m of this had been received. Furthermore some
of the limestone reserves appeared contaminated and Steetley did not appear
to be going ahead with extraction on some permitted sites, Mr Corbett said.
At the time of the Gobitta acquisition, analysts in the UK were not told
that only 40m of the 150m tonnes had received consent for extraction, as a
result of what a Steetley adviser called 'an error of translation' from the
French contract by an eminent City firm of solicitors.
The adviser said Steetley had only made part of the payment to Gobitta. He
would not be drawn on speculation about the group's asset values but said
that Redland was only able to judge the French sites by 'looking at them
over the fence.'
After the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's decision to refer the Tarmac
joint venture last week - a decision which triggered the collapse of the
joint venture - Steetley still had the finest and lowest cost brick
producing company in the country, the adviser said.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Economics Notebook: The challenge facing Asia's growth cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Japan sneezes, will Asia catch a cold? The question arises because recent
years have seen increasing investment by Japanese companies in production
capacity in other Asian countries, and a sharp rise in trade in the region.
Economists talk of Asian economic growth being self-generating, with rapid
development fostering markets for Asian-produced goods within Asia. This
would make the area less vulnerable to cyclical swings elsewhere in the
world.
The fast-growing countries of the region - the four newly industrialising
economies and their aspiring rivals in south east Asia - have proved fairly
resilient to the recession in the US, upon which they once depended for
export markets.
However, a severe slowdown in Japan, the region's largest and most developed
economy, could engender fears the whole process of Asian development might
be undermined.
Many Japanese companies suffering unprecedented pressures on profits - like
Sony which last week forecast an operating loss for its current financial
year - have transplanted much of their production to countries such as
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Japanese electronics companies have set up
about 600 plants in the Asia/Pacific region outside Japan.
Asia's remarkable development is stratified: Japan's factories develop and
produce the newest, highest technology goods. These become standard
products. Switching manufacture abroad leaves home plants to turn to the
next stage of technology. In recent years, not only Japanese but also
Korean, Taiwanese, Singaporean and Hong Kong companies have invested
substantially in this manner.
In theory, this should result in significant transfer of technology and
management skills, though evidence of this occurring seems questionable. If
it were, it would help provide a base for self-sustaining development in
countries receiving investment. It should also increase 'layering' of
development as, for example, Thai industry in turn farms out production to
Vietnam.
The process depends on constant development of new technology in the
countries originating investment, especially Japan. Here, views are divided
about the future. Though Japan is looking ahead to new products such as high
definition television and mini-compact discs there are some doubts about
whether these will have blockbuster impact.
On the other hand, production and sales of electronic consumer goods are
high and markets are growing, especially in Asia.
The market for lower value-added products such as refrigerators and air
conditioners could continue to expand as markets like China and India open
up. So the prospects for the new industries of south east Asia may remain
healthy.
For some economists, a sign that growth will feed on itself is the
development of sub-zones, each including a technical, financial and
marketing services base and an area of cheaper labour.
Prof Edward Chen, director of the Centre of Asian Studies at Hong Kong
University, sees five such zones developing:
South China zone, centred on Hong Kong and including four southern provinces
of mainland China and Taiwan;
Yellow Sea zone, including South and North Korea and north east China;
Japan Sea zone, which adds Japan and Asiatic Russia to the Yellow Sea zone;
'Greater Indochina' zone, centred on Thailand and including the Yunnan
province of China, the three Indochina countries and Burma;
The 'growth triangle' of Singapore, the Malaysian state of Johore and
Indonesia's Batam island.
The last of these is being fostered by government impetus. The others are
developing mainly through private sector initiative and, as can be seen,
circumventing political barriers.
The most striking and well developed is the South China zone. Hong Kong
industrialists estimate there are 25,000 factories in Guangdong province
either owned by or sub-contracting for Hong Kong manufacturers. They employ
3m Chinese workers.
Though this creates the prospect of endogenous growth within Asia, the
reality is that the mainstay of development is export of manufactured goods
to the developed world.
Mr Quek Peck Lim, head of research at Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities in
Singapore, says: 'The last 10 years have underwritten some degree of growth
over and above vulnerability to the OECD countries.' A major economic shock
in the west would not cause a collapse in most Asian economies as it would
have done 20 years ago, he says.
For the foreseeable future, however, access to western markets remains
crucial, which is why Asia views anxiously European integration and the
north American free trade agreement.
Its most effective response to these will be a continuing drive to export
goods as competitively as possible.
Attempts at trade agreements within Asia have not got far because, in spite
of the development of the cross-border zones, Asian countries mainly compete
with each other for markets outside the region and do not want to risk
upsetting customers. The recent accord between south east Asian nations may,
however, have some importance as intra-regional trade grows.
The sluggish economies of the US and Germany, more than that of Japan, lead
forecasters to predict slower growth for most Asian economies this year.
Ms Sarah Hewin, senior economist at American Express Bank in London, is
predicting an average of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent growth for the
NIEs and south east Asian countries compared with between 6 per cent and 8
per cent for 1991 - though this masks significant divergences and special
factors. Indonesia and South Korea are still wrestling with inflation and
other overheating problems, while Hong Kong and Taiwan will be boosted by
big spending on infrastructure.
Nevertheless, the region remains extraordinarily dynamic. Economic reforms
in China - and in the hitherto insulated south Asian countries particularly
India - suggest further rapid growth, increasingly generated within the
region.
Asian governments need to ensure investment and trade climates continue to
improve, that overheating is kept in check, and strains on infrastructure
are eased and anticipated.

FT  24 FEB 92 / NFC sees flat profits at year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the freight and trucking group, is unlikely to see any real
improvements in earnings in 1992, with pre-tax profits forecast roughly
steady at Pounds 90m to Pounds 100m in the year to September 1992. Last
fiscal year, the company earned pre-tax profits of Pounds 93.7m.
Mr James Watson, chairman, said: 'At the start of the new year, we had
expected some recovery. We are not seeing that now.'
Mr Watson said that NFC, 45 per cent owned by its employees, managers and
pensioners, planned further redundancies and cutbacks in its trucking fleet
in the second quarter. In the first quarter ended January 25 1992, it made
500 people redundant at a cost of Pounds 4m.
If economic activity falls further, he said, profits would be at the low end
of the forecast.
NFC is forecasting 1992 earnings per share at 13.0p to 14.5p against 13.6p
in 1991.
Yesterday, the company announced first-quarter profits of Pounds 18.8m,
against Pounds 18.1 a year ago, and increased its dividend to 1.30p per
share.
The higher earnings are largely due to improvements in the Excel Logistics
division which provides transportation and warehousing facilities for goods
sent from manufacturers to distributors.
NFC's traditional transport division reported a 22 per cent fall in
operating profit with truck and trailer rentals continuing at low levels. In
the home services division, turnover rose 12 per cent while profits fell 16
per cent, partly reflecting investment in information technology in the US.
All 1991 figures have been adjusted to reflect the sale of Pickford's travel
agency.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Some risque reading for the risk-averse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So the bulls were right. Falling inflation is indeed producing falling
yields in the equity market, even if not by much, and not in the manner you
may have been led to expect. And P/Es are going up, too. As long as the
market continues to discount a recovery some day, falling earnings can do
the job quite effectively. Making industry more efficient by means of
putting relentless pressure on profits is a rather unusual approach from a
Conservative government, but it is the policy we have, and it is working.
But when I hear last year's squeeze on profits described as a nasty
surprise, as I did from the top table at the Society of Investment Analysts'
excellent dinner last week, I am reminded of Mr Denis Healey's complaint
about 'the young men who write brokers' circulars'. Even the middle-aged
analysts, with a few honourable exceptions, behave as if they were young -
too young, that is, to remember anything but the most recent past.
You have to go back more than 30 years, after all, to the previous time that
anyone questioned the idea that equity investments would always pay best in
the long run; faith in equities survives even now, even among the
pessimists. The Norwich Union, for example, appears to share my belief that
bonds are the logical holding in times like these. But it talks only of a
narrowing of the yield gap - not of the reappearance of the traditional gap,
in which equities yielded more than bonds because they were riskier.
Yet logic suggests that this ought to be somewhere in the forecasters'
sights, even if only as one end of a range of possibilities. Indeed, in one
sense the traditional yield gap reappeared a decade ago, when indexed gilts
first became available. To nobody's surprise, these bonds, offering a
risk-free real return, have nearly always yielded less than equities, and
may well put a floor under British equity yields. Any brief fall in yields
below this benchmark has rightly been read as a sign of bull-market excess,
and that was in an inflationary world.
It is fashionable at the moment to play with the idea that the great
post-war inflation is going away. Nobody seems to draw the obvious
conclusion, which is that if this did happen, the other yield gap - that
between indexed and conventional gilts - might become very narrow. Indeed,
if prices started falling, as they have over quite long periods of economic
history, the coventional bonds would outperform the indexed, let alone
equities.
Look at it another way. The cult of the equity was started by Mr George
Ross-Goobey as director of the Imperial Tobacco pension fund in the 1950s.
Inflation was low at that time, but real growth was about equal to
inflation. As he argued to a rapidly growing audience of converts, that made
equities the ideal backing for a final-salary scheme. Taking one year with
another, equities were a holding in money national income, and salaries
would have a pretty constant share in that income. That is still true, and
it is hard to imagine a future in which equities would not be a core holding
in any decently-managed fund.
But not, surely, virtually the sole holding. The numbers that matter here
are those indicating the relation between the risk premium the market
demands - measured in Britain at the moment by the gap between equity and
indexed yields - and the expected real growth rate. Since the gap is
normally in the 1-1 1/2 per cent range, and real growth at that rate is
still only a matter of hope for the future, the indexed enthusiasm of a Mr
Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu (and a few sages) explains itself. This is
the logical home for the risk-averse.
Most fund managers, however, like to think that they have redder blood in
their veins than that. Indeed, if indexation became really fashionable, many
of them would be out of a job. But if you want to take risks, what would you
rather back, in the next few years at least - real growth rising towards its
old trend rates, or falling inflation? Or to put the question more
precisely, would you back an average growth rate of more than 2 per cent, or
a 2 per cent fall in trend inflation? And if you are hesitating even for a
moment over that answer, why are you still up to 70 per cent in equities?
The fact is that after the appalling experience of the 1970s, gilts are
still seen as too risky for any respectable fund, and the equity market will
still be supported for many years by funk money in search of an each-way
bet. But even those who do not take the bold step of re-balancing their
portfolios should at least try to loosen up their thinking. Otherwise they
may find themselves in the same position as those who thought Mr Ross-Goobey
was being a bit too fast for comfort.
A bolder approach by fund managers would make the economy a good deal easier
to manage, since governments which borrow at rates of interest higher than
the likely growth of their revenues are mortgaging the future. They are
likely to remember this, except in election years, so do not base your
strategy on the hope of a fiscally-led recovery in times like these. A
keener demand for bonds might drive down yields across the board, thus
justifying the hopes of the forecasters after all. So you could even regard
a serious re-examination of gilts as a patriotic duty . . . well, as being
prudent, at any rate.
Prudence of quite another kind, however, will in future be demanded of
others in the City. If there is one lesson which comes out of the recent
results of financial intermediaries of every kind, it is: stick to your
last. Even if managers had resisted speculative fever and sheer
growthmanship, they would have lost heavily by conduct which they saw as
enterprising.
Clearing banks which ventured overseas, or into estate agency; savings banks
which tried merchant banking; US savings and loans which got into shopping
development or mining; London discount houses which forgot that they are
essentially a privatised dealing room for the Bank of England, and took
position - all have lost their shirts. Does this sound like a plea for the
old days, when equities yielded more than gilts, and houses knew their
place? Why, so it does.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr BRUNO DETHOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was astonished to see that on February 12 you carried on the front page a
table entitled '1992 EC Budget', quoting the European Commission as its
source. The Commission has consistently refused to publish any such table
showing a breakdown of net balances by country.
Given that the debate about net balances now appears to be running in the
UK, I think it appropriate to point out that European Community integration
makes such calculation increasingly difficult. How, for example, do you
break down and assess the efforts made at Community level by each member
state in order to improve research and training and to meet the EC's
commitments abroad? There could be a margin of error of up to 15 per cent,
which clearly illustrates the shortcomings of such an exercise.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: FT coverage of Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL R RAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Under a banner headline, 'Lloyd's in cash talks with the Bank', on your
front page (February 18), you declare that 'Lloyd's of London, government
ministers and the Bank of England are discussing measures to ease a
liquidity crunch at the insurance market, according to a senior broker
involved'. This statement, relying upon a non-attributable source, was
picked up by other newspapers and media, no doubt because of the high regard
held for the FT as a journal of financial record.
It would seem that both Lloyd's and the Bank very quickly declared this
statement to be untrue. And yet coverage in the FT of February 19 of this
important rejection is confined to page 8, in the midst of a piece written
under a totally different heading - 'Lords to consider Lloyd's duty to
Names'. To quote: 'Lloyd's said yesterday that 'centrally' it had not been
involved in any discussion with the Bank of England about possible financial
assistance. It also said that it had made no request for assistance from the
Bank or from ministers.'
Surely, given the importance of the Financial Times as a journal of record,
it is incumbent upon you to give, to a denial or rejection, exposure with
similar weight as the original report. Failure to do so could quickly erode
the respect and regard with which the FT is viewed.
Paul R Rawson,
Springwood,
Audlem,

Editor's note: The report should have begun: 'Talks are under way between
senior figures at Lloyd's. . .' We regret that this distinction was not made
clear.

FT  24 FEB 92 / UK monetarist golden age - alas a myth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a curious myth that the Conservative government presided over a
successful, if initially unpopular, monetarist policy, up to the mid-1980s,
which was then wantonly abandoned in pursuit of the snare of the D-Mark
exchange rate target from which all our discontents are supposed to arise.
This myth has resurfaced in the February Economic Outlook of the London
Business Group in an article by Professor Patrick Minford in which he
challenges the Outlook's support for the European exchange rate mechanism.
'Going back to monetarism' is his alternative. His own unequivocal yardstick
for monetary policy is M0 - notes and coins plus banks' voluntary balances
with the Bank of England.
Unfortunately Minford does not appear to have looked very closely at his own
charts. Indeed, I often wonder whether economists - and not just Minford or
those on his side - take their own charts seriously or merely use them to
decorate their articles. One of the consolations of not being an
econometrician is that I take a great deal of trouble to link my charts to
my articles, as harassed members of the FT graphics and statistics
department will confirm. The chart in this article is a slightly clearer
version of Minford's own to which has been added M4 - the favoured measure
of 'broad money', which includes bank and building society deposits.
Several features stand out from the M0 line on the chart.
There was an extremely savage drop in the growth of M0, far more severe than
anything in the past couple of years, during the early Thatcher period.
Minford is free to argue that the present squeeze is much tighter than
anything then; the truth is we still do not know. But he cannot base his
conclusions on his own preferred yardstick.
There was a quick recovery in the growth of M0 from late 1982 onwards.
Minford approves, at least in retrospect. But the usual policy platform of
the technical monetarists is a stable or gradually falling growth of the
money supply, which can be monitored in a straightforward way.
In the period up to the end of 1987, when the credit boom was gathering
momentum, the growth of M0 was stable or even slightly declining. Nigel
Lawson's real mistake was to give M0 too much rather than too little house
room. Whenever I raised this matter at the 'Gooies' (group of unofficial
economic advisers) Minford would loudly inform the chancellor that 'M0' was
the government's policy.
I have a little more sympathy with the rival version of the story told by
Tim Congdon in recent Gerrard and National Economic Reviews. Congdon favours
the broader M4 aggregate, and can at least tell a causal story. But his
version is also flawed. For, as the chart shows, M4 shot up in the early
1980s, during a very severe squeeze when inflation was tumbling. In fact it
was growing as rapidly then as in 1988-89 at the height of the recent boom.
Indeed, it was the traumatic experience of the early 1980s that led to the
gradual shift from a money to an exchange rate objective. It was only well
into 1987 that M4 gave an extremely muted warning of expansionary or
inflationary forces. As for bank and building society lending their growth
exceeded 20 per cent a year in the squeeze year of 1980 and then remained
consistently below that level until 1989 when the boom was starting to run
down.
The real money supply - that is money adjusted for inflation - to which
Congdon now wants us to pay attention, may be a helpful diagnostic tool for
the real economy. But it is hopeless for a nominal framework aimed at
reducing inflation itself.
To come forward to the present situation, Minford cites me as saying that
the UK will soon return to growth in spite of high real interest rates. I am
sure he writes in all sincerity. But I wish he and his mentor, Sir Alan
Walters, would read my actual words carefully before going up in flames. The
article that Minford cites (Economic Viewpoint January 9) simply said that
high real interest rates 'need not' prevent recovery and had not done so in
1981-82. I leave readers to decide whether my words and his paraphrase mean
the same thing.
Unfortunately I have left myself no time to discuss a more reflective
argument in favour of a UK devaluation within the ERM by Simon Wren-Lewis in
the same Outlook. But he is well answered by the Outlook's editors. The
latter's arguments are reinforced by a new Institute of Economic Affairs
Research Monograph by Cliff Pratten entitled Overseas Investments, Capital
Gains and the Balance of payments, out today (Pounds 7.95), which suggests
that the UK balance of payments is in much better shape than generally
contended.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Italy's season of indignation: The April 5 election could
see an exceptionally strong protest vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the opening of the shooting season in Italy, when hunters take to the
field and shoot at almost anything that moves, the campaign for
parliamentary elections on April 5 has begun with shots being fired in all
directions.
The campaign promises to be dirty. This is not surprising. For a number of
reasons - the changes in the international climate, the growth of regional
sentiment, widespread disenchantment with the political system, and the
challenges facing Italy's economy in Europe - these are unusually important
elections.
In purely domestic terms, the elections will determine whether the ruling
Christian Democrats can retain the hegemony they have enjoyed since 1946,
the longest any party has held power in post-war Europe.
The vote will also test the strength of the left following the collapse of
communism in eastern Europe and the metamorphosis of the Italian Communist
party, once the strongest in Europe, into the Party of the Democratic Left.
In addition, the emergence of the populist Lombard League movement in
northern Italy threatens to fragment the political arena and accentuate the
divide between the rich north and the poor south.
Internationally, the elections will determine whether Rome can provide a
government with sufficient unity and purpose to bring the country into line
with its chief partners in the EC. During the next two years Italy needs to
reform public finances, reorganise public administration and strengthen
industry if it is to comply with the EC convergence criteria agreed at the
Maastricht summit in December.
Mr Gianni de Michelis, the outgoing foreign minister, rightly claims that
the main achievement of his government has been to commit Italy irrevocably
to European union. Thus, the electoral agenda is largely being set by a
combination of the dictates of Brussels and the consequences of the collapse
of communism.
Although Italy has enjoyed a vibrant democracy over the past four decades,
with arguably a broader range of political parties and opinion than anywhere
in western Europe, the electoral process has always been profoundly
conditioned by east-west tensions. The uninterrupted rule of the Christian
Democrats in 50 governments has ultimately depended on a fear of the
Communist party's taking power through the ballot box.
The removal of communism from eastern Europe, and the formal winding up of
the Italian Communist party last year, have eliminated this constraint. The
implicit, and sometimes explicit, backing of Washington for the Christian
Democrats has evaporated and their traditional ally, the church, has begun
to distance itself from a party which has tolerated corruption. The business
community too has moved away from the party, and in the north is threatening
to embrace the calls of the Lombard League for clean government.
'The country has the hope and the will for a big change,' says Mr Giorgio la
Malfa, leader of the small opposition Republican party.
Italy's system of proportional representation has produced 45 governments
since 1948. In only 15 of these have the Christian Democrats ruled alone.
The rest of the time, the party has depended on a revolving series of four
coalition partners - the Socialists, the Republicans, the Liberals, and the
Social Democrats.
Already Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, has announced he would
accept an invitation to form a government with the Christian Democrats on
the understanding it would be the Socialists' turn to control the
premiership. Such a carve-up of power between rivals may occur; but the
system, which favours weak coalition governments, has reached the limits of
usefulness.
President Francesco Cossiga almost never ceases to call for change. The main
parties have put forward ideas for electoral reform whose common thread is
the search for a means to produce majority governments, stronger coalitions
and the elimination from parliament of groups which obtain less than 5 per
cent of the vote.
Such proposals merely respond to a profound desire for change among the
electorate and alone are unlikely to attract votes. Opinion polls show that
what voters most want are improvements in public services, and solutions to
problems such as traffic, pollution and crime. The ingredients exist for a
strong protest vote. For the first time, polls have revealed that most
voters - 40-45 per cent - are uncommitted.
The record of the outgoing four-party coalition has contributed to this big
floating vote. Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, leaves a public
sector deficit equivalent to 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product, a
near-worthless 1992 budget due to last year's overspending and a string of
incomplete reforms.
The 73-year-old Mr Andreotti, who has been prime minister seven times,
epitomises the current impasse. Nobody would deny his consummate skills as a
survivor able to navigate the channels of factional power and bureaucratic
intrigue. But these are the skills of a discredited political class which
regards government as a system of finely-balanced favours, rather than as a
process that responds to citizens' needs and rights.
What is almost palpable is popular frustration with constantly changing
governments which recycle the same faces without addressing fundamental
issues. These frustrations were underlined last June, when 27m voters,
despite the hostility of the main political parties, endorsed a referendum
ending the system of multi-preference votes in parliamentary elections. The
innovation, to be tested in April, is designed to limit the power of party
bureaucracies over the choice of candidates.
The referendum has come to be seen as the most effective means of forcing
change on an ossified parliament. No fewer than 10 referendums could be
presented to Italian voters next year, on subjects ranging from the
introduction of a first-past-the-post voting system for the Senate to the
abolition of the Ministry for State Share-holdings. A central figure in the
referendum movement is Mr Mario Segni, son of a former president and one of
the rare new faces to emerge within the Christian Democrats.
Until now the surge of opposition support has grouped round the Green and
Radical parties, minority interest groups (such as pensioners) and small
regional blocs, such as the one active in Sardinia. Above all, the protest
vote has been galvanised by the eruption of the Lombard League in northern
Italy, inspired by the fiery senator, Mr Umberto Bossi. He aspires to win
more than 10 per cent of the vote nationwide, making the League the
fourth-largest party in parliament.
Mr Bossi has found a receptive audience for his outspoken criticism of
corrupt central government which favours a 'decadent south' at the expense
of the 'industrious north'. He has thrown down the gauntlet in his
stronghold, Bergamo, saying: 'The mafiosi politicians know that if, by 1995,
there is no change in the rules of the game, we will establish a Cisalpine
constituent assembly at Pontida (near Bergamo).' This threat to establish an
assembly for northern Italy alone may be no more than political blackmail,
but it pleases his audience.
In local elections in the north, the League has already proved it can split
the Christian Democrats' vote. To keep its share of the vote above 30 per
cent, the Christian Democrats are appealing to the electorate's fear of the
unknown. They are also relying on their powers of patronage in the Rome
area, and in the south. The Socialists too are on the defensive. Never
having obtained more than 14 per cent of the vote, their strength has
depended on a willingness to co-habit with the Christian Democrats.
The one-year-old Party of the Democratic Left is struggling to establish an
identity round an uncertain form of social democracy. Mr Achille Occhetto,
its leader, has failed to convince the Socialists that his party is a worthy
electoral ally. The party's strength remains the former communist heartland
round Bologna and Florence. But a hardline communist rump has regrouped
under the banner of Reconstituted Communism (Rifundazione Communista) and
could absorb 10 per cent of the Democratic Left's vote.
'Above all else, the elections are going to be a huge opinion poll which
will allow everyone to take stock,' says Mr Giuseppe Roma, deputy director
of Censis, an independent research institute. Once politicians see how the
pieces fall, they may realise that the party picture has become even more
fractured than it is now, and that fresh elections with the promise of real
reforms offer the only solution.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: Why companies should retain right to publish
unaudited data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P K WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am concerned at attempts by the auditing profession to restrict
companies' ability to issue public statements on their financial position,
including interim results and preliminary announcements of full year
results, without having that information signed off by an external auditor.
It is important that companies retain the freedom to publish unaudited data.
Interim figures and full year preliminary announcements are not audited
currently in the UK or in the more tightly controlled US environment.
Waiting for all routine audit confirmations to be completed would unduly
delay announcements and increase the risk of insider dealing. It would also
add to already expensive audit costs.
A prudent company will ensure that full year announcements are agreed
informally by the external auditors and that either internal or external
audit checks are performed on interim announcements. The survey you refer to
('Move for broader auditing of results', February 20) shows preliminary
announcements agree with audited figures and demonstrates this process
works.
It is not surprising that share prices do not move when audited figures are
released since the same unaudited figures are already in the public domain.
The system works well. Why change it to the obvious detriment of
shareholders?

FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: On a flight of fruity fancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SARAH MYINT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Michael McGannon, in his article on avoiding jet-lag (Management,
February 19), is no doubt scientifically correct, but I have a simpler
solution. I order a fruit diet. The day before the flight I eat a lot of
vegetables. On the flight I eat nothing but fruit (despite the additions
they put on my tray) and drink nothing but fruit juices or water or weak
black tea. On arrival, I am not at all tired. I am talking about long
flights. Next day I eat less than usual and am ready for anything. My
daughter once didn't like the meals and just drank fruit juice. She was
amazed how well she felt on arrival.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Leading Article: A role for Mr Rabin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE EAST peace talks reopen in Washington today against a more than
usually dispiriting backdrop. The cycle of violence between Israeli forces
and Lebanese guerrillas over the past week has set back the prospects for
worthwhile negotiations. Moreover, the Israelis, by invading Lebanon, again
showed a disdain for the wishes of the international community which
scarcely encourages optimism about a peace process that has depended thus
far on external pressure.
It would be premature to write the effort off, however. The fact that Syria,
Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians are still planning to sit down with
Israel - after two rounds of largely procedural talks and repeated
affirmations by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, that he has
no territorial concessions to offer - testifies that all sides still see
mileage in not being blamed for aborting the negotiations. And developments
over the past week in Israel - with general elections due in June - suggest
that its position may not be set in stone.
The event that has raised at least the possibility of progress is the
re-emergence of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, a 69-year-old former prime minister who
consistently tops the polls as Israel's most popular politician, as leader
of the opposition Labour party. The result may be a modest revival in Labour
fortunes - and, perhaps, an Israeli government more amenable to territorial
compromise.
Pragmatist
Mr Rabin is no dove. He is as tough as any graduate of the Israeli defence
establishment. As defence minister when the Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip broke out in 1987, he was
responsible for a policy of repression that makes his Likud successor seem
liberal. Yet unlike Mr Shamir, who believes in Israel's eternal sovereignty
over the West Bank, he is a pragmatist concerning Israel's need to trade
land for peace with the Arabs, and opposes extending Jewish colonisation of
the occupied territories.
He is also someone with whom Israel's allies think they can do business. If
the US administration had a vote in the coming election, Mr Rabin would
undoubtedly be its choice - a matter of some importance when Israel is
attempting to secure from Washington loan guarantees worth Dollars 10bn to
help it absorb hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants from Russia.
Land concessions
The prospect thus opens up of a genuine electoral contest between Likud and
Labour - one focused for the first time on a negotiation in progress, fought
over the central issue of Jewish settlement in the territories, and perhaps
unfolding against a background of real pressure from the US, which is tying
approval of the loan guarantees to a freeze on settlement-building in the
occupied territories. Implausible as it may seem to outsiders, Mr Shamir
will compete with Mr Rabin for the mantle of peacemaker-from-strength - in
other words, for the centre-ground of Israeli politics, where polls
consistently show that most voters favour peace talks and sometimes that
most favour territorial concessions. One not inconceivable result would be
the formation of another so-called national unity government incorporating
both main parties, as happened after the 1988 election.
From the point of view of the peace process, this would not be a disaster.
Mr Shamir and Mr Rabin have worked together before, notably in producing a
plan for Palestinian elections and self-rule that may resurface in the
current peace talks. A Likud-Labour coalition might be strong enough to
bypass fractious party politics, ignore the extremists to Mr Shamir's right,
and pay serious attention to the critical issues concerning Israel's future
that are now under discussion.
Outside powers have every interest in encouraging Israelis to elect a more
accommodating government, and should not be squeamish about using political
or financial pressure to show them where their real interests lie. There is
a reasonable chance that, in this election more than in the past, the
message will be understood.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Scent of victory for fighter: The UK is confident that the
EFA project will go ahead, despite German uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first prototype of the revolutionary, multinational and decidedly
controversial European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) looks unremarkable at first
sight.
It stands in the middle of a hangar, trailing strands and bunches of
electrical cables from its half-filled belly and wings, like some wounded
beast with its entrails hanging out. Its state-of-the-art carbon fibre
composite bodywork (70 per cent of the total surface area, another first) is
dull grey, yellow and ochre, more like heavy-duty linoleum than space-age
material.
The development hangar is in the heart of the Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm
(MBB) manufacturing complex at Ottobrunn, just south of Munich, where the
multinational Tornado was first put together.
As a multinational exercise, however, it looks and sounds rather more
impressive: three British electricians are working in the cockpit, two
Italians under the left wing, and a Spaniard is perched on top of the right
wing, while Germans are ferrying parts to the fuselage, all communicating in
English.
It is going to have to be impressive, if it is to survive in the harsh world
of post-Cold war military budgets.
This is the last year of EFA, but only in name. By next year it is due to be
re-baptised. Managers are urgently searching for a title more appealing to
the taxpayers of four countries, who stand to pay more than Pounds 20bn on
the most complex flying machine ever built in Europe.
Above all, they need a more popular image in Germany, the partner nation
whose commitment to the project - known there as the Jager 90 - has been
most in question.
In the UK, confidence has been growing in the past few months that the
two-engined, single-seat, delta-winged, fly-by-wire fighter will go ahead.
But it will not be quite the way it was planned. It will happen less
rapidly, the partner nations will between them buy fewer aircraft, and
Britain will have to assume a more dominant role.
The partners - comprising the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain - are now
completing an Pounds 8bn development phase. The debut flight was to take
place about now, but has been set back several months. It is uncertain
whether it can be the star performer at the Farnborough air show in
September.
'The cockpit is still very empty. That is the worst,' says Dr Achim Aehlig
of the EFA programme division at MBB. 'There is work-sharing on every
instrument, and on top of that we have transport problems within the EC.
'Sometimes parts have to spend six or eight weeks at the customs because
these are classified as military exports,' he says with a grimace. 'It's
easier to get cocaine from South America.'
A decision on investment to set up EFA production was to have been made by
the end of this year, but this may well move into early 1993. The target
date for bringing the first aircraft into service has already slipped from
1996 to 1997, but planners say it should still be possible to meet that
deadline.
With the decision on production investment, the partners will have to
reorganise the share-out of work. As with the Anglo-German-Italian Tornado
programme, now almost over, work is given to each country in relation to how
many aircraft it buys. For the development phase the UK and Germany assumed
33 per cent each, Italy 21 per cent and Spain 13.
Already, Spain is saying it wants to buy fewer machines - 87 instead of the
original 100, according to Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, the defence minister.
Germany - assuming that it stays in the programme - now appears unlikely to
want aircraft until quite late in the delivery schedule, and it is expected
to buy closer to 150 aircraft rather than the 250 envisaged at the outset.
Any reduction in Bonn's commitment means that the British government - still
pledged to buying 250 of the fighters - would be paying a larger proportion
of the bill. Project managers say that this would probably mean only a
marginal increase in the absolute cost to the UK.
They are hoping for a 'reasonable' production run of at least 500-600
aircraft. But even with only 400, the 'flyaway' cost - the basic cost of
each aircraft, not counting the money that has already been spent on
development - would not be significantly higher, they say.
If the UK government were to assume the main responsibility for the project,
the programme would be more exposed to public debate, particularly if there
were any serious glitches. So far, EFA has enjoyed all-party support in the
UK, in stark contrast with Germany, where opposition is strong.
To palliate this resistance, Bonn has set up a series of reviews on possible
alternatives to EFA. The key working group consists of six members of the
ruling coalition. The Free Democrats, the junior coalition partners, are
most divided on the issue, with Mr Jurgen Mollemann, their economics
minister, on the record as saying: 'This is one bird which will never fly.'
The six are to report by the summer.
The opposition Social Democrats are much more solidly opposed. 'The cost
explosion of the Jager-90 is simply no longer bearable,' says Mrs Ingrid
Matthaus-Maier, the party's finance spokesman. 'It is time for iron savings
measures, and not for blowing more money on militarily unnecessary grand
projects.'
UK planners are optimistic that, even if Germany opts out, Italy and Spain
will remain committed and keep the project from collapsing. Germany's
work-share could be redistributed among the other partners, or the work
could be subcontracted to the same German companies.
At MBB and its parent group, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), they are confident
that the decision can only go in favour of EFA, unless the design parameters
are completely redrawn.
All the partners looked in detail at rivals, such as McDonnell Douglas's
F/A-18, before they signed away the money for EFA development. However, one
aircraft they did not look at then, but which the Germans have looked at
since, is the Russian MiG 29. Bonn inherited 24 of these from the former
East German air force.
They would be cheaper to buy than EFA, but they have a comparatively short
useful life, adding to their long-run cost, and the German air force has
already had problems obtaining spares. Dasa says that the aircraft is 'no
longer seriously under consideration'.
More likely options would include the French Rafale, due for service with
the French navy from 1996 and the air force from 1998. However, the Rafale
is built for a different requirement and could prove as expensive as EFA.
The EFA's 'flyaway' price is reckoned to be about Pounds 20m at today's
prices - some 20 per cent less than that of a Tornado fighter-bomber.
Also under review in Germany are US fighters from the current
top-of-the-range F-15 to its planned successor the F-22. Choices include
future developments of the F/A-18 and General Dynamics' successful F-16. The
F-16 would be cheaper than EFA.
But, like Sweden's new Gripen fighter, it has only one engine - and that is
anathema to the German air force after the notorious sequence of crashes,
beginning in the 1960s, which involved the single-engined F-104
Starfighters.
Conceived in the Cold war, EFA is now touted as an aircraft versatile enough
for contingencies around the globe. But its performance requirement is still
measured against the best Russian product - no longer seen as the MiG 29 but
potential improved versions of the Su 27 counter-air fighter.
According to projections by British Aerospace (BAe), none of EFA's rivals
would do as well against an upgraded Su 27 in air-to-air combat except for
the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics F-22. But, say EFA project managers,
the latter will be much bigger and heavier than EFA; it is unlikely to be
able to take off from a 500m strip (one of the EFA requirements); and it is
not meant for a secondary ground-attack role. It is also highly secret, not
yet exportable, and probably at least twice the price of EFA.
There are strong industrial arguments for Germany remaining in the EFA
programme. Its aircraft industry was reorganised with government
encouragement in 1989, when Daimler-Benz took control of MBB to form Dasa.
EFA is the largest collaborative military programme it is likely to have for
a long time to come. The company would benefit from EFA exports, for which
there are high hopes. Any alternative would be unlikely to offer it more
than a production sub-contracting role. Dasa wants to work from the
experience of Tornado and EFA to form a joint European military aircraft
company, which would eventually bring in Dassault of France.
Nobody believes Europe can afford to split ranks again and produce two
aircraft of this kind simultaneously - Dassault is already talking with BAe
about the next generation of supersonic combat aircraft that would succeed
EFA and Rafale some time after 2020. Bonn's risk, if it withdraws from EFA,
is that German industry would be left on the sidelines.
But Germany has a tight budget for buying a new fighter - DM 12bn (Pounds
4.1bn) between now and 2005 - and has already started looking for ways of
cutting its EFA costs. It has pulled out of an infra-red sensor system for
the aircraft and is looking for cheaper electronic warfare equipment than
the system chosen by the other partners.
The partners have cut the number of prototypes from eight to seven and are
studying changes in assembly arrangements. The aircraft is planned like the
Tornado, with each partner producing separate bits. EFA's front end is
British, its middle German, its rear end Spanish and Italian, its fin
German, its left wing Italian and its right wing sometimes British,
sometimes Spanish.
Under the Tornado model, each country would carry out its own assembly and
its own flying tests. It may be possible to reduce the number of test
centres, but partners will be reluctant to lose their assembly lines, which
would cost jobs.
Tight cost limits were imposed for the development programme, with
performance targets written into the contract, and companies bearing the
penalty if costs exceed the budget. But it is clear that a serious overrun
would test the determination of governments. Would they pursue their strict
principles to the point of bankrupting their national aircraft companies?
As defence budgets shrink, other services look askance at the amount of
available funds that EFA will eat up. But at the same time, the aircraft it
is due to replace - including Italian F-104s, and German and Spanish F-4
Phantoms - are becoming increasingly expensive and difficult to maintain.
EFA's proponents are banking on the lack of an alternative. The development
money is already spent. Whether there is any other realistic choice that
would not, at this stage, prove more expensive is doubtful. It is almost
certainly too late for Dasa or any of its counterparts in the other EFA
countries to play a significant part in an alternative project. And there is
no other military aircraft programme in the offing until well into the next
century - not one that could sustain a full capability for designing and
making front-line fighters. That is something that neither Britain nor
Germany is probably yet prepared to relinquish.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Leading Article: An excess of prudence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN the British clearing banks are revealing depressingly large
provisions for bad and doubtful debts. And once again they are seeking to
reassure shareholders and depositors with the thought that their capital
position is strong by international standards. All very comforting, until
you recall that this is not saying much.
The capital base of some of the biggest US money centre banks remains
dismally weak, while Japanese bank capital is both fragile and uniquely
vulnerable, under the forthcoming capital adequacy rules of the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), to the mood swings of the Nikkei index and
the domestic real estate market. And although the British banks may be
better placed, there is still room for speculation about the ability of the
UK banking system to finance an economic recovery.
No depositor in Britain need worry about a big clearing bank going to the
wall. But customers do have to worry this year about the impact of bad debts
on the availability and cost of credit. In any downturn in the credit cycle
the banks invariably widen the spread between the interest they charge on
loans and the interest they pay on deposits; and they justify this by
pointing to the deterioration in their customers' creditworthiness. Yet this
time, they are prey to unfamiliar pressures arising from the extraordinary
build-up of indebtedness in the personal and corporate sectors in the 1980s,
combined with government policy that perpetuates high real rates of interest
in a protracted recession.
Problems compounded
These problems are compounded by disintermediation - the process whereby the
banks' largest corporate customers by-pass the banking system by going
direct to the money and debt markets for funds. There are fewer corporate
customers from whom to extract increased margins. Yet bank lending is still
sufficiently important within the wider financial system for this increase
in margins to put a brake on recovery. If the banks fail to pass on base
rate cuts in full, the transmission mechanism between looser monetary policy
and economic recovery becomes more tenuous. A bigger interest rate cut is
needed to generate any given increase in economic activity.
Nor is the threat posed by bad debts to bank capital entirely negligible. In
today's conditions it would not be easy to raise fresh equity capital. So
whether the banks are able to finance a recovery depends largely on how
quickly they can build up retained profits through increased lending. The
problem here is that creditworthiness is a subjective concept: a sound
borrower is one to whom lenders will lend. This leads to a vicious circle.
If the banks fail to advance credit they undermine the creditworthiness of
their own customers. Bad debts multiply, with adverse consequences for
profits and capital.
Bank profits
Confronted with this situation in the US the Federal Reserve has, in effect,
made bank profits a target of monetary policy. It has repeatedly cut
interest rates and relaxed bank reserve requirements in order to reactivate
bank lending. And to good effect: there are now signs of an upturn in the
housing and car markets. In contrast the UK authorities are unable to
re-establish the creditworthiness of bank customers by cutting interest
rates because they are boxed in by the exchange rate mechanism.
In the short run this is neither here nor there, in the sense that sluggish
growth of broad money and bank credit is probably more a reflection of weak
demand than credit constraints. But it could soon become more serious. In a
recent circular Mr Giles Keating of Credit Suisse First Boston concludes,
after testing the credit crunch hypothesis on various assumptions, that
recovery is at risk unless base rates fall later this year to 8 per cent. In
other words the UK is waiting on the Bundesbank. It is an uncomfortable
predicament; and while the odds are on a serious credit crunch being
averted, many small to medium sized businesses around the country will feel
the squeeze before the year is out.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Arts: 1953 - Glasgow Citizens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Glasgow Citizens Theatre has just put its own house into new order.
Where there was only one theatre, now there are two more. What was the
downstairs bar is now the third theatre (seats 70); and an upstairs chamber
is now the second (seats 130). And yet the building is far from cramped.
Audiences from separate shows mingle beforehand or in the intervals without
crush.
The first three plays to run simutaneously at this 'new Citz' add up as a
bravura gesture of eclecticism: Alonso Alegra's Niagara (directed and
translated by Robert David MacDonald); Craig Raine's 1953 (a version of
Racine's Andromaque, directed and designed by Philip Powse); and PG
Wodehouse's Summer Lightning (adapted and directed by Giles Havergal). I
shall write later this week on Theatres One and Three; here I talk of the
Raine.
Everyone agrees that Racine is the most untranslatable of playwrights; and
yet in recent years we have seen several new translations of him performed
on British stages, and, even more remarkably, many leading poets in our
century have rushed to render him into the English language. Robert Lowell's
Phaedra is especially famous or, you may say, notorious. And between 1980
and 1990 three of the most celebrated living poets set their highly
dissimilar hands at Andromaque: Richard Wilbur, Douglas Dunn and Craig
Raine. Please note, too, that Dunn's and Raine's were, like John
Cairncross's 1966 version (now in Penguin Classics), each first presented by
BBC Radio. Raine's was heard there in April 1990; it is said that it was
first planned as the text for Jonathan Miller's 1988 Old Vic production.
But, as its title shows, Raine's is no straight translation.
The title tells you that 1953 transposes the Greek and Trojan characters of
the classical mythology that Racine's audience knew so well into the modern
era, and in this Raine follows the example of Tony Harrison, who put Phedre
into British India as Phaedra Britannica. Racine's Trojans and Greeks are
Raine's British and Germans. Raine's 1953, however, is not the actual
historical past but the era that might have been. The Fuhrer still rules;
the British Empire is extinct; the night when London fell to the Germans is
still famous; and, by the by, Churchill had already died - in his own sick,
after a night of heavy drinking with Brendan Bracken.
The setting is Italy. Il Duce's son, Vittorio Mussolini, rules. Annette Le
Skye (Andromache) is in prison garb with yellow star. The Germans want her
son Angus - half Bowes-Lyon, half-Jewish - to be packed on the train to
Germany. Vittorio (Pyrrhus) is in love with Annette, but engaged and
politically bound to the Princess Ira, a loyal German of Hohenzollern blood
(Hermione) who has been his devout mistress for some time. Her cousin, Klaus
Maria von Orestes, sent to Italy to demand little Angus, is mainly obsessed
by his own futile and self-punishing passion for her.
Various forms of emotional masochism rule each of these upper-class
characters. The sick soul of Europe, which so many film-makers and writers
have returned to with horrid nostalgia, here becomes astoundingly real.
For the rational and classical austerity of language which Racine's
characters deploy with such violent eloquence, Raine has substituted the
literate and urbane style of modern English high-class parlance, often
ironic and sometimes effete. Where Racine's characters plunge straight into
analysing their emotions, Raine's often take an oblique line.
Raine's use of this language is virtuoso. That these characters are
hypersophisticated eventually only heightens their intensity. (Klaus to Ira:
'Underneath this mask there are third-degree burns, like a Kokoschka oil . .
. You used me like a tablenapkin, not a lover.') The bitter wit, the
emotional abuse find striking modern equivalents. The basic metre is iambic.
The Citizens' Second Theatre is a small chamber with the audience banked on
four sides of the action. Philip Prowse's designs are chillingly elegant.
The most daring stroke in his casting of this already politically loaded
play is to give Annette LeSkye to the black actress Julie Saunders (as with
Josette Simon in his recent White Devil at the National). The
stiff-upper-lip nobility of Saunders's playing justifies his decision. She
performs with a beautiful calm that goes beyond emotion; she is the same
paragon through every volte-face or gear change.
Julie Blalock and Greg Hicks are uncannily perfect as Ira and Orest, victims
of their own elegance. As young Mussolini, Patrick O'Kane has a wonderful
blend of fire, cruelty, narcissism and pantherine softness.
1953 holds its audience riveted on every level. Concept, dramaturgy,
designs, language, utterance and movement are all on a high, high level.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Arts: Pelleas et Melisande - New Theatre, Cardiff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh National Opera's new production of Pelleas et Melisande has been
eagerly awaited, not only as Peter Stein's third staging for the company,
following his memorable Otello and Falstaff, but because it signals Pierre
Boulez's return to the opera house 13 years almost to the day after he
conducted the premiere of the complete Lulu in Paris. At the first night on
Friday every ounce of that accumulated expectation seemed triumphantly
justified. This Pelleas is a glorious achievement, one of those rare
operatic occasions that truly justifies the description of revelatory, in
which theatrical and musical genius seem democratically balanced and
concerned with nothing except the most comprehensive realisation of the work
itself.
It should be no surprise that Stein's and Boulez's contributions appear
indivisible: as the director makes clear in an essay in the programme book,
he was introduced to the work by Boulez, who 'deciphered the score for me
and showed me all the little details'. That freshness, uncluttered by the
burden of the opera's performing history, has given Stein the freedom to
work outwards from the work itself, to take what the text and music could
offer and with his designers Karl-Ernst Hermann (sets) and Moidele Bickel
(costumes) to select a coherent set of visual and dramatic references.
Their starting point was the pencil drawings of Seurat; for an opera that
moves into daylight for only two scenes, they have created a symbolist world
of blacks and greys, of glistening surfaces and profound depths, which
meanly rations the available light, striking it harshly against hard edges,
squeezing it between trees or through doorways. Such parsimony gives
implacable force to the few moments en plein air, so that when in the third
act Golaud and Pelleas emerge into sunlight from the cellars the audience
too is dazzled by its brilliance: we share in their physical exhilaration,
touch their awe and relief.
For Stein never forgets that this is a piece of theatre, a deliberate
artifice; any suspension of disbelief must be earned, never taken for
granted. There is no dream-like easing from reality to make-believe, every
change of scene is laid bare and each image is uncompromisingly framed,
caught within a precise geometric shape. By parcelling up the stage with
sliding panels and half curtains, and providing precisely the space needed
for each scene, it offers a constantly shifting perspective, at one moment
close, intimate, at the next distant and detached. We are watching
make-believe: Golaud addresses his opening phrases to the audience, as if
the first scene is a preface, a fairy-tale beginning from which everything
else unravels. And when she reads her letter in the second scene,
Genevieve's gestures are grand and rhetorical, suggesting her audience too
is much larger than the blind Arkel.
This is a very strange opera, Stein is saying, in which nothing is what it
seems, reality and fantasy are enmeshed and nothing can be explained away as
a product of dreamy irrationality. There are stylised trees and cardboard
cut-out ramparts, yet a fully detailed bedchamber for the final scene, a
real sheep for Yniold's encounter with the shepherd, and real doves (a
mistake, this) for the tower duet.
He presents the tragedy through a series of implacable images, creates his
characters as lost figures, caught in a struggle for survival. Pelleas, so
wonderfully, passionately sung by Neill Archer, is straight out of Edgar
Allan Poe, a Roderick Usher right down to his frock coat and breeches; the
Melisande of Alison Hagley is timeless and impermeable, a projection of male
images (Arkel's as well as those of her husband and her lover), who is never
quite of this world. This Golaud (Donald Maxwell) develops in divergent ways
out of his chivalrous stereotype and goes disastrously wrong: jealousy is
something eternal, Stein observes, 'whether in fairy forests in the middle
ages or in your one-room apartment'.
All three roles are sung and acted with absolute commitment and authority;
their every word is made to tell, every phrase is perfectly weighted. There
is also a sonorous Arkel from Kenneth Cox and upright Genevieve from
Penelope Walker. The Yniold of Samuel Burkey sings with affecting assurance,
so that the scene in which he is forced by Golaud to spy upon the lovers is
as traumatic as Golaud's later attack upon his wife.
All are given the most magnificent possible support and musical guidance by
Boulez, whose command of this score is absolute. His attention to detail and
texture has always paid dividends in this opera, and now it is fused with a
flexibility and, yes, sensuousness that make this the most compelling and
moving account of the opera I have heard, realised by the WNO orchestra with
unfailing vividness. The crux of Boulez's approach is now the interludes,
where the music opens out, allows in the vistas and images that the tightly
focused action proscribes, and in which the ghost of Wagner's Parsifal
emerges from the shadows.
Already one feels this to be a landmark in the interpretation of Debussy's
masterpiece. The production plays in Cardiff for three more performances,
before touring in March and April to Southampton, Birmingham and Bristol. It
should not be missed by anyone remotely interested in the history of opera
in the 20th century or in the ways in which a great conductor and a great
director can remake a work through their own creative powers.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Management: Looking west for inspiration - Japanese
companies are for the first time seeing a rise in worker-power.  Steven
Butler investigates how executives are coping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese management is facing a serious challenge. An acute shortage of
labour is edging the balance of power toward employees. Working hours are
going down, job hopping is on the rise, and big companies are having to hire
mid-career employees.
These may be common trends in the west. But this is Japan, where lifetime
employment at large companies has traditionally given Japanese executives
unusual flexibility to manage their businesses.
It has been a critical ingredient in the world-beating success of Japanese
corporations. Yet this critical ingredient is coming under pressure.
'Eventually the system of lifetime employment will be destroyed,' predicts
Akira Ono, an economist at Hitotsubashi University.
Lifetime employment was a two-way contract, at least in theory. Companies
guaranteed security of employment, while employees gave back loyalty and
commitment, even to the point of accepting wage cuts during hard times and
giving up holiday entitlements.
Can Japanese companies continue to excel without it? This is more than a
speculative question. Toyota Motor, Japan's biggest car maker, slashed
production by 150,000 vehicles this fiscal year because it kept a promise to
employees to cut 100 hours from the annual work load of 2,300 hours.
It was unable to hire enough workers to make up the difference.
Conveniently, demand for cars has also slumped.
Toyota had no realistic choice but to cut working hours. Otherwise it would
have had even more trouble retaining and hiring workers. Toyota - and other
big manufacturers - are being forced to think about management in a way that
never appeared necessary in the past, when they managed the workforce pretty
much as they liked.
Daiken Trade and Industry, a fibreboard maker, has just announced a 'New
Personnel System' that includes fast-track promotion for capable employees.
Kazuhiro Izumi, personnel manager, says the company needed to overhaul the
promotion system or risk losing talented employees. 'People want to be told
what their potential is and they want to know where their skills fit into
the company's plans,' Izumi says.
Yet the system upsets another of the 'rules' of Japanese management: that
harmony should be maintained by basing all promotions on seniority. Daiken
managers are now fielding complaints from long-serving workers who are left
behind by fast-trackers.
Rising affluence combined with greater choice afforded to job seekers has
also changed attitudes, making motivation of the workforce a new problem.
Toshihiro Takahashi, general manager of human resources at Toyota, says:
'The young generation does not see the value of manufacturing, does not see
what it means to the country as a whole'.
Yoshio Higuchi, an economist at Keio University, is concerned about the
impact of the labour shortage on in-company training programmes, which are
effectively the only places for Japanese workers to get practical training.
'If the job separation rate gets higher, then on-the-job-training doesn't
work.'
He fears companies will not get a sufficient return on investment in
training if employees are hired away after finishing an in-house programme.
Masamichi Shimizu, general affairs manager of the Japan Management
Association, says that Japanese management style is rigid in dealing with
individual workers' needs, and that changes in the work environment prompted
by the labour shortage will highlight that rigidity. 'There are many
admirable managers in Japan, but if the working environment continues in the
present direction, what westerners regard as Japanese management style may
not be appropriate,' Shimizu says.
Japan's birth rate is falling, with the average number of children born to a
women at 1.53 in 1990, far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable
population. School graduates will peak next year at 1.23m and decline
relentlessly to 960,000 by the turn of the century.
Roughly twice as many new jobs are on offer as there are applicants, a ratio
that has declined only marginally as a result of Japan's economic slowdown.
Big employers like Toyota and Nissan have for several years filled vacancies
by hiring mid-career employees, unheard of in the past.
About 9 per cent of Japanese workers are changing jobs each year. This is an
historic high, and compares with a ratio that has fluctuated between 8 per
cent and 6.5 per cent in the past 15 years. The job hopping rate for
technical and professional employees has risen steadily over the period.
These trends can only become more severe in the years ahead. At least as far
as the workers go, the trends are positive.
Ono says: 'The labour shortage has given workers a good opportunity to put
an end to unreasonable practices'.
Men often work for extended periods, separated from families, because they
have to accept orders to work anywhere in Japan. Workers are unable to say
no when the boss asks them to do overtime, or give up the annual holiday.
Shigehiro Murakami, of Nippon Gasket, a supplier of parts to Toyota Motor,
says the lifetime employment system was a product of post-war poverty, not
the choice of workers.
'The security that lifetime employment offered was a great attraction for
people afraid of the poverty that went with unemployment. Now, instead of 10
people fighting for one job, young people have a choice of jobs.' he says.
Employers are competing among themselves to offer better recreational and
housing facilities and are investing heavily in plant and equipment aimed at
making work easier and more pleasant.
The new power of the employee has changed the chemistry of management
relations within the corporation.
Koji Matsumoto, a former official at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, argued in a recently translated book* that lifetime employment and
the relative powerlessness of employees were key pillars of the Japanese
corporate system.
The mere knowledge by company employees that they have the option of
changing jobs could erode this atmosphere of trust and prevent a company
from pulling together to see the way through bad times.
It is plainly too early to predict the downfall of the Japanese corporate
system. Yet life at the top is already becoming more difficult for Japanese
managers.
Just as western managers have found inspiration in Japanese success, western
models may soon have far more relevance in Japan.

Thomas I Elliott, Kegan Paul International, 1991, Pounds 45.

CONDER PROJECTS, a division of the Winchester-based Conder Group, has been
appointed design and build contractor by The Harbour Club for a regeneration
project in the heart of London which will transform part of the redundant
Fulham power station site.
Built in the 1930s and covering over 12 acres, the power station was
decommissioned in the early 1980s and sold by the CEGB.
Much of the land has been used since then for multi- storey apartments,
underground car parks and retail outlets. The remaining 2.7 acres is to be
transformed into The Harbour Club.
Conder Projects offered a design solution, utilising the existing basement
structure to construct 10 indoor and five outdoor tennis courts, a 30 metre
swimming pool, restaurant, fitness gymnasium, exercise studios and a health
and beauty suite on four floors within the original power station, main
boiler house and turbine area.
Total contract value to Conder Projects is Pounds 6m and completion is
anticipated in December.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Lord Young admits DTI fault on Clowes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was at fault over its handling of the Barlow Clowes affair,
Lord Young, the former trade and industry secretary, has admitted.
Lord Young, now chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications group,
agreed the Department of Trade and Industry could be blamed for failing to
properly license the Barlow Clowes investment empire that collapsed in 1988.
This month Mr Peter Clowes was jailed for 10 years for defrauding investors
of Pounds 150m.
Speaking in a Channel 4 television interview to be broadcast later this
week, Lord Young said the government had been reluctant at the time to admit
any responsibility. He was trade secretary when Barlow Clowes collapsed.
It was only after the ombudsman's report, which criticised the DTI for
maladministration, that the government agreed to pay investors compensation
totalling Pounds 150m.
Lord Young said concern over setting a precedent was behind the government's
reluctance to take part of the blame.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Call for reduced working hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will become 'the treadmill of Europe' unless working hours are
reduced in line with those proposed by the European Community, according to
the Low Pay Unit, an independent research organisation.
A report issued today by the unit examines the case for the proposed
European directive on working time, further debate on which has been
adjourned until later this year after British opposition to it at the
Maastricht summit.
According to the most recent international comparison, men in Britain worked
longer hours than anywhere else in Europe. In 1988, according to research
published by the European Commission, British men worked 45.5 hours a week
compared with 41 hours in most other member states.
Mr Chris Pond, director of the unit, said there was no reason to believe
that the figures had changed substantially since then, in spite of the
recession.
The latest UK research, in the 1991 New Earnings Survey, showed that a fifth
of men in manual jobs and nearly 10 per cent of all men worked 48 hours or
more a week. Fewer women worked similar hours - 5 per cent of those in
manual jobs and 1 per cent of all women.
Long hours were put in by men in a wide variety of occupations, but
especially in road and rail transport, farming, security work, baking and
food processing.
The report argues that there is a powerful case for improving basic rates of
pay to reduce working hours without loss of earnings. It says: 'This would
improve health and safety at work, raise productivity and generate
employment as well as allowing people to enjoy family and social life.'
It adds that German reductions in the working week, made since 1984, have
had a positive effect on the economy for various reasons.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Managers lack finance skills, says survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE AND senior managers in big UK companies have only a minimal
understanding of corporate finance and more than half admit they are not
happy with their own level of financial proficiency.
A survey by KPMG Management Consulting among 120 managers, drawn from some
of the country's largest businesses, highlights widespread lack of knowledge
over fundamental aspects of financial management.
Mr Edward Cook, a KPMG Management Consulting partner, said: 'In recessionary
times the general lack of understanding about financial matters is extremely
worrying.' Respondents did not include managers with formal training in
accountancy, economics or finance.
Asked why profitable companies ceased to trade, 43 per cent of the managers
cited lack of cash, 28 per cent insufficient investment, 11 per cent loss of
key managers and 9 per cent poor or bad management.
Among the findings: Cashflow: Only 42 per cent of managers considered
cashflow could be a problem if a company achieved a sales growth of 50 per
cent in one year. Thirty-four per cent cited cashflow problems specifically
while another 8 per cent mentioned overtrading.
The survey's authors noted that the dangers of coming out of a recession and
achieving volume growth did not seem to be recognised. Nearly one in five
managers said they could foresee no difficulties.
Profit and Loss: Managers did not appear to understand the basic purpose of
a profit and loss account. One in three managers, and 42 per cent of senior
managers, believed that a profit and loss account showed an organisation's
true worth at a point in time.
Working Capital: Although the management of working capital is a vital part
of financial control, a high percentage of managers did not understand what
comprised working capital. Almost half (48 per cent) thought reserves formed
part of working capital, 38 per cent identified sales and 27 per cent cited
overheads. Only 38 per cent correctly identified just cash, stock and
debtors.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL begins formal negotiations today with the Paris Club group of
official creditors, confident of rapid approval for the restructuring of its
Dollars 22bn (Pounds 12.5bn) debt.
Following last month's ratification by the International Monetary Fund of a
Dollars 2.1bn loan, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, and
senior central bank officials have been touring European financial centres
and Japan to lobby for support in the Paris Club. They believe they could
have an umbrella deal in place by Wednesday.
'We have a very reasonable proposal on the table and expect to be able to
turn that page this week,' said Mr Arminio Fraga, international director of
the central bank, in an interview with the Financial Times. 'We believe more
than Dollars 1bn in new credits could be forthcoming, largely from the
Eximbank of Japan.'
Diplomats doubt that the matter will be resolved in two days but admit that
negotiations are taking place in a far more optimistic atmosphere than last
year when Brazil demanded forgiveness of part of the debt.
This time, Brazil is requesting a rescheduling of Dollars 14bn in debt and
arrears over the next 18 years. This encompasses debt which has already been
rescheduled: a matter that some countries are unhappy about. A second
rescheduling is against Paris Club tradition, but Mr Fraga says it is
necessary in Brazil's case because 'current obligations mean an excessive
concentration of payments over the next two years'.
Brazil is expected to offer an immediate payment of Dollars 1bn on its
arrears. Brazil has not been paying interest to the Paris Club since its
moratorium of 1989, although it started paying 30 per cent of due interest
on its commercial debt a year ago.
Paris Club members want equivalent treatment for these arrears as that
received by private banks in a deal last year. They will point out that
Brazil's reserves are now at their highest level since the debt crisis,
increasing its capacity to pay. In the last five months, reserves have risen
from critical levels of Dollars 7bn to more than Dollars 11bn and creditor
banks are pressing Brazil to increase the percentage of interest paid to
compensate for the reduction in LIBOR.
Providing the Paris Club negotiations go smoothly Mr Moreira will fly to
Europe to sign the bilateral agreements and then go straight to the US to
resume talks with the commercial banks. The main sticking point with private
creditors remains the guarantees Brazil is offering on new bonds but the gap
has been reduced to just over Dollars 1bn.

<TEXT>
THE resignation last week of Mr Pedro Tinoco as president of Venezuela's
central bank has left the Venezuelan government and investors jittery in the
wake of the failed military uprising of February 4.
The resignation comes at a time when President Andres Perez is trying to
gain broader support for his government and is expected to announce cabinet
changes.
Mr Tinoco's departure seemed to cause most concern among Venezuelan bankers,
who worry that his successor may not provide as much support for the
domestic banking system. The government has proposed a series of reforms of
Venezuela's financial system, including opening it up to foreign investment.
Some of these are strongly opposed.
Mr Tinoco is a major shareholder in one of Venezuela's largest commercial
banks, Banco Latino. His departure had been rumoured since last year, with
unconfirmed rumours that he was leaving for health reasons.
In announcing his departure, Mr Tinoco, who will be 65 later this year, gave
no indication that he was in disagreement with government policies.
On February 21, the day after the resignation was made public, the Caracas
Stock Exchange Index fell by 1.5 per cent and Venezuela's currency, the
bolivar, declined less than one per cent against the US dollar. The value of
the bolivar has been falling against the dollar since the beginning of the
year.
No one has been named to replace Mr Tinoco, but President Perez has
reiterated his intention to push ahead with the unpopular economic reform
programme his government initiated three years ago. This suggests that the
new Central Bank chief will, like Mr Tinoco, support the reform plan.

FT  24 FEB 92 / US-China trade fuels MFN debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW US-China trade figures are expected to provide ammunition in the Senate
debate, due to begin soon, over legislation imposing stringent conditions on
China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status, writes Nancy Dunne from
Washington.
The US International Trade Commission said China's imports in the first nine
months of 1991 rose from Dollars 11bn in 1990 to Dollars 13.1bn. Textile and
clothing accounted for Dollars 3bn of this, but shipments of bicycles and
costume jewellery were also up. Retailers continue to rely heavily on
imports of toys, games, and sports and electrical equipment.
The US, which is trying to negotiate away Chinese trade barriers, had a
Dollars 9bn trade deficit with China in the first nine months. Its largest
exports to China were fertilisers (Dollars 728m), and aircraft (Dollars
641.5m).
China disputes US trade figures principally because it separates direct
exports from exports to the US transferred through Hong Kong.
Aside from trade issues, the debate over MFN will focus on China's arm sales
to Iran and the Middle East. Leading the attack, Senator George Mitchell,
the majority leader, is also highlighting China's human rights abuses and
prison labour exports.
President Bush will veto the legislation. However, he is likely to get a new
version if, as expected, he opts to continue China's MFN status, without
conditions, at its yearly renewal date in June. Meanwhile, his China trade
policy is coming under attack in the presidential primaries.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, is carrying the weight of the
defence. In the administration's Section 301 trade case against China, she
emphasises: 'initial progress in beginning the process of reducing
prohibitively high tariffs, import licensing requirements and improving
transparency.'

FT  24 FEB 92 / FT Conference: Aircraft industry sees cancellations increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world commercial aircraft industry is facing a growing short-term crisis
because of the oversupply of aircraft in a financially depressed airline
market.
Airlines cancelled 138 orders for new aircraft last year, the highest total
since the 1982 recession, Mr Gunter Eser, the director general of the
International Air Transport Association (Iata), said in Singapore yesterday
in an address to a Financial Times Conference on Asian-Pacific aviation.
Mr Emmanuel Vasseur, executive vice-president of France's Banque Indosuez,
also warned that manufacturers including the European Airbus consortium,
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US were coming under increasing pressure
as airlines reduced their new aircraft commitments and cut their longer-term
fleet acquisition programmes.
Mr Eser said the airline industry would be lucky to contain its overall
losses last year to between Dollars 3.5bn and Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2bn and
Pounds 2.29bn).
'The immediate fall-out from this is evident. Aircraft orders and deliveries
are being delayed or cancelled,' added the head of the association grouping
202 airlines.
Airlines received 650 new jet aircraft last year and still have more than
3,000 on order. But the signs of a cutback are clear.
Mr Eser said orders placed last year dropped by 60 per cent compared with
1990 from 1,218 to 467 aircraft.
Iata's two largest member airlines - American Airlines and United Airlines -
have already announced big cuts. American is deferring or dropping options
on 93 aircraft valued at more than Dollars 5bn; United has cut 123 aircraft
worth Dollars 6.7bn from its fleet plans for the next five years.
In Europe, the German carrier Lufthansa, which has just announced its first
loss since 1973, is delaying orders for 11 new Boeing 737 and Airbus A320
airliners.
The growing problems now facing aircraft manufacturers were to a large
extent of their own making by encouraging airlines to acquire more new
aircraft than necessary in the late 1980s creating a significant
overcapacity in the market, Mr Vasseur argued.
The manufacturers are focusing their attention on the Asia-Pacific airline
market which continues to hold the best prospects for growth.
Mr Eser said Iata's latest forecast expected to see Asia-Pacific passenger
traffic grow by 8.6 per cent a year between 1991 and 1995 and by a further
7.5 per cent a year between 1995 and 2000.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Environmentalists prepare to lock horns over 'megafauna'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL lobby groups from across the world are gathering in Kyoto in
Japan at the end of this week, preparing to wage war over the plight of the
world's 'charismatic megafauna' - large, noble animals such as the elephant
and rhinoceros.
Pariah of the triennial conference of the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species (Cites) will be Zimbabwe, which along with four other
southern African states is pressing for a resumption in the world trade in
ivory.
Staff of the Lausanne-based Cites secretariat are perhaps most concerned
that international obsession with a handful of 'charismatic megafauna' will
trample underfoot debate on trade in an array of equally important flora and
fauna - ranging from Cunningham's orchid or Wagner's viper to American
mahogany or the trade in live parrots.
They are concerned that amid the heated and pious debate between traders and
conservationists, few will be enthusiastic to put money where their mouths
are. At present, Cites' 10 professional staff subsist on a meagre total
budget of SFr3.9m (Pounds 1.5m) a year. They are pressing for a 43 per cent
increase to SFr5.57m, but fear few of Cites' 112 member governments are keen
to dig deeper into their pockets.
The 12-day conference, which starts next Monday , is likely to be dominated
by angry debate on the ivory trade. A total ban has been in place since
1989, following a decade in which Africa's elephant population slumped from
1.2m to 600,000.
Inside Europe, delegations from Britain, Germany and France have split the
EC by opposing a Commission proposal to allow a resumption of trade in
elephant hides and meat, but not ivory.
Zimbabwe, along with South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Malawi, claims that
effective management of native elephant herds has resulted in such growth in
local populations that culling is needed. They want a resumption in trade of
ivory and other elephant products to enable them to generate more funds for
protection and preservation.
They say the trade ban does little to protect the elephant, and argue that
problems faced in Kenya and other east African states arise from corruption
and poor park management. Arrayed against Zimbabwe, speaking in highly
emotional unison, are the world's conservationist groups who fear an end to
the ban will annihilate the progress made over the past three years, as
elephant herds have begun to recover.

Mr Rabin was responding to reports that the US had issued an ultimatum on

Ministers in Mr Shamir's Likud government said yesterday they would reject

FT  24 FEB 92 / Arafat watches from the sidelines: The PLO leader's waning
role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and LAMIS ANDONI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are not the easiest of times for the newly-wed Mr Yassir Arafat, the
Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman. Not only does he continue to be
confined to the margins of the Arab world due to his unpopular Gulf war
stand, he is also being obliged to cope with persistent internal criticism
over where, if anywhere, he might be leading an organisation whose role
these days seems much less clear cut.
Nagging questions about the PLO's relevance are nothing new, nor is the fact
that some of the strongest criticism is coming from within the ranks, but
debate has been sharpened by a number of factors, including most especially
the rise of new leadership faces from within the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, home to about one-third of the 6m strong Palestinian community
worldwide.
While Mr Arafat will have his moments of publicity this week with bilateral
talks resuming in Washington between Israel and its Arab neighbours,
including the Palestinians, the PLO leader will seek as usual to be seen
pulling the strings from Tunis. This is unlikely to still the unease felt
throughout his organisation at what is seen as the continued erosion of its
position. Indeed, for many of the senior cadres the issue goes well beyond
relevance to questions about the PLO's very survival in its present form as
an old-style national liberation movement in the post-cold war era.
Talk in Tunis and elsewhere in the Palestinian diaspora has been turning
towards the creation of a 'modern PLO' with reforms of the organisation's
structure to enable wider popular participation that more accurately
reflects the will and talents of Palestinians inside and outside the
occupied territories.
Change will not come easily to an organisation, however, where an old-guard
leadership still holds sway and where privileges are jealously guarded. And
lurking in the background is the perennial question of whether Mr Arafat
himself is capable of accepting democratic reforms of an organisation over
which he has exerted obsessive control for the past 23 years.
Against the odds Mr Arafat has survived and confounded his legions of
critics; but the end of the cold war, the withdrawal of East bloc support,
and perhaps most important the collapse of Arab financial backing has
exposed the PLO's 'structural' weaknesses as perhaps never before. It can
hardly pretend to be a functioning liberation movement, since its fighters
are scattered throughout the Arab world and have not engaged the 'enemy' for
almost a decade.
While Mr Arafat's role of 'puppeteer' in the peace talks allows him to claim
that he is still firmly in control, this is not a substitute for direct
participation, and the PLO leader must fear that somewhere down the road an
autonomy agreement between Israel and the Palestinians of the occupied
territories will further marginalise both himself and his organisation,
although such agreement could not possibly be concluded without his
imprimatur.
Mr Arafat must also suspect the flickering support he receives from more
powerful Arab states such as Egypt has much less to do with their commitment
to the PLO as the 'sole, legitimate representative' of the Palestinians than
it does with the perceived need to preserve the organisation as a distant
guarantor of Palestinian participation in the peace process, and as a cover
for Arab steps towards the normalisation of relations with Israel.
The PLO, in its present weakness, has precious little room for manoeuvre.
For better or worse, it is wedded to a process whose success might,
ironically, signal the end of its existence without the fruits of victory
the Palestinians of the disapora have craved for so long. However it feels
obliged to stay the course provided the US continues to exert pressure on
Israel to stop settlement-building in the occupied territories.
Senior PLO officials say this is the sine qua non of their continued
co-operation, and there seems no reason to doubt them.
Perhaps the most interesting consequence of the peace process, as far as the
Palestinians are concerned, is the changing and evolving balance in
relations between what is known as the 'inside' and the 'outside' ' that is
between the Palestinians of the occupied territories and those of the
diaspora, represented by the Tunis leadership.
There is no question that the influence of the 'inside' has risen relative
to the 'outside' since the latest effort to bring peace to the Middle East
was launched with much fanfare in Madrid last October, but representatives
from the territories are still extremely careful about making suitably
respectful gestures towards Tunis, to the extent that some Palestinians in
Jerusalem grumble that their spokesmen and women ' the Faisal Husseinis and
Hanan Ashrawis ' are 'too loyal.'
In the meantime, Palestinian institution-building is continuing apace in the
territories with committees being established to deal with such grassroots
questions as housing, health and education in preparation for possible
interim-self rule under an autonomy agreement. The Tunis leadership is
obliged to watch all this and give cautious support ' at a distance.
While Mr Arafat may be able to console himself with the fact that he remains
the 'symbol' of Palestinian hopes, his exclusion from direct participation
in negotiations on the future of at least part of his flock would certainly
not accord with his aspirations at this critical time when voices are being
raised for long overdue PLO internal reforms.

FT  24 FEB 92 / Merchant ship orders highest for 15 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY demand for new merchant ships has brought the highest level of
activity for 15 years to the world's shipbuilding industry, figures
published today show.
The London-based Lloyd's Register of Shipping says gross registered tonnage
(grt) of merchant shipping on order from all the world's yards at the end of
1991 was more than 8 per cent up on the previous year's level at 43.2m grt -
the highest level since June 1977.
The latest figures continue the upward trend which began in 1989 following a
long recession in the world's shipbuilding industry.
Mr Nick Granger, of the London-based Shipbuilders &amp; Shiprepairers
Association, said the recovery in the shipbuilding market had been caused
not by any sudden surge in world trade or by a growth in the market for
carrying goods by sea, but by the ageing of the world fleet.
'What we are seeing is quite simply replacement demand for all that tonnage
that came onto the market in the mid-1970s,' he said.
The Lloyd's Register report shows that Japan and South Korea remain by far
the busiest shipbuilding nations. Japan had 15.7m grt on order at the end of
1991 and South Korea had 9.4m grt.

<TEXT>
ABOUT 5,000 communist demonstrators yesterday seized upon the former Red
Army's traditional holiday to attack the Russian leadership and demand the
restoration of a country and parliament which no longer exist.
Bearing pictures of Lenin and Stalin and placards saying 'Peoples of the
USSR Unite' and 'Hurray to the Soviet Army', the crowd tried to push its way
through police barriers to march on the Kremlin.
The aim was ostensibly to pay homage to the armed forces at the tomb of the
unknown soldier at the foot of the Kremlin walls.
Armed Forces Day has been renamed, dropping the word 'Soviet'. Yesterday, it
provided an opportunity for supporters of the outlawed Communist party -
mostly pensioners, officials and professionals, with a few token officers -
to vent their anger at the collapse of the Soviet Union and harsh market
reforms.
'Our government are traitors,' complained Ms Elena Dvortsova, a retired
Communist chemical worker. 'They've betrayed the workers. They've turned our
savings into nothing. They've sold out to the Americans and they got rid of
the Soviet parliament in just one day. If this is democracy, we don't want
it.'
'The democrats are surrounding us like the Germans at Stalingrad,' was how a
retired engineer described the city authorities' decision to forbid
demonstrators to proceed to Manezh Square.
'We'll get through next time,' shouted another old age pensioner, explaining
that a similar demonstration would be held on March 15 to back demands for
the reconvening of the Soviet parliament.
Also present were the predictable communist-nationalist duo of Colonel
Viktor Alksnis, a former co-chairman of the hardline Soyuz (Union) faction
in the Soviet parliament, and Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose so-called
Liberal-Democratic Party wants to reconstitute the Soviet empire.
President Boris Yeltsin, who laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown
soldier and watched a march-past of soldiers carrying the Russian flag, may
have taken comfort from the relatively small size and marginal nature of the
demonstration.
Although there were a few violent scuffles when demonstrators tried to break
through a line of baton-wielding police backed by a line of trucks, there
were no serious injuries.
It also provided a low-key parallel to last March, when President Mikhail
Gorbachev tried to ban a much larger demonstration in support of Mr Yeltsin.
Nonetheless, it was no coincidence that the Armed Forces holiday has been
preceded by a series of statements by President Yeltsin and Marshal Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth commander-in-chief, trying to combat the
discontent in the armed forces. President Yeltsin on Thursday issued a
decree raising officers' minimum pay to Rbs1,800 a month, and promising
measures to deal with the military's acute housing shortages. His government
has also publicised plans to expand arms sales abroad - to help finance
increased spending on the army's welfare and the conversion of military
factories to civilian output.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, meanwhile, has cautioned against haste by republics
seeking to imitate Ukraine in establishing their own army. In a weekend
newspaper interview, he said Azerbaijan should not create its own army until
it had resolved the conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh by political
means.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leaders of the three main national groups in Bosnia-Hercegovina at the
weekend agreed to recognise the existing borders of the central Yugoslav
republic to ease tensions in the run-up to the republic's referendum on
independence.
The agreement, reached during European Community-brokered talks, represented
a concession by the leaders of Bosnia's Serb and Croat communities to Mr
Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia.
But, at the same time, Mr Izetbegovic said he had compromised and accepted
the formation of several national territorial units within Bosnia.
Moslems account for 44 per cent of the 4.4m population, followed by Serbs
(33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent). Although Slavic, the Moslems see
themselves as Bosnian and believe that any division of the republic between
Serbia and Croatia would leave them homeless.
On his return from the weekend talks in Portugal - which holds the EC
presidency - Mr Izetbegovic yesterday said his concession would enable the
continuation of talks with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's
Serbian Democratic Party, and Mr Mate Boban, who heads the Croatian
Democratic Union.
Serb and Croat leaders have urged re-organisation of the republic along
regional lines to limit central control.
A western diplomat said: 'It appears that every Serb and Croat politician in
Bosnia has a copy of the Swiss constitution. They want to see if it is
possible to transplant Swiss cantons to Bosnia.'
Serbia and Croatia have held talks over the division of Bosnia.
In an effort to prevent the carve-up of the central republic, leaders of
Bosnia's Moslems insist on a 'republic of citizens rather than of national
groups'.
Mr Jose Cutileiro, a Portuguese diplomat who chaired the talks among
Bosnia's leaders told journalists: 'We have achieved some progress so far
and I hope that we will continue to make more.' He said that talks on the
future constitutional arrangement of Bosnia would be continued on Thursday
under the auspices of the EC peace conference on Yugoslavia.
The talks could ease tensions among Bosnia's volatile population before the
referendum set for February 29 and March 1. But extremists from the Serb and
Croat communities, who hope to join their kin in neighbouring republics,
still threaten to secede from Bosnia.
It is uncertain whether the more moderate national leaders will be able to
honour their agreement to respect Bosnia's existing borders. They must bring
check hardline nationalists and take control of the political agenda.

UKRAINE at the weekend moved to protect itself from a looming economic war
with Russia by signing a deal to purchase 4m-5m tonnes of crude oil annually
from Iran - about 10 per cent of Ukraine's consumption - in exchange for
construction materials,
Mr Konstanin Masyk, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, met Iranian
officials in Tehran. According to Mr Viktor Hladuch, Ukraine's minister for
industry and transport, the two countries agreed to build three pipelines,
with an annual capacity of 25bn cubic metres, from Iran to Ukraine via
Azerbaijan and Russia.
The cost of the project, which was not revealed by officials, is to be split
between the Ukraine and Iran (45 per cent each) and Azerbaijan (10 per
cent).
Eventually Iranian oil and gas could be refined in Ukraine - which has a 60m
tonne capacity - and sold to Europe.
Mr Hladuch said Ukraine had also begun to expand port facilities in Odessa.
Odessa's capacity is less than 10m tonnes, leaving Ukraine dependent on the
overland route through Russia and thus vulnerable to an economic blockade.
Mr Hladuch said Ukraine, which would have a trade deficit with Russia of
upwards of Dollars 10bn at world prices, hoped to avert economic warfare.

ROMANIANS voted yesterday for mayors in most of the country's big cities in
a second-round ballot testing opposition strength ahead of general elections
this spring, AP reports from Bucharest.
Polls took place in 1,611 participating municipalities. In the first round
of local elections on February 9, which took place mainly in small towns and
villages, the governing National Salvation Front beat the opposition
Democratic Convention.
The results, however, indicated a loss of support for the Front.
The Front took power during the December 1989 anti-communist revolution and
then won general elections overwhelmingly.

IRAQI opposition leaders met yesterday to try to forge a united front
capable of toppling President Saddam Hussein, AP reports from Riyadh.
The closed-door session at Riyadh's Conference Palace was the first meeting
of Iraqi opposition figures sanctioned by Saudi authorities since the end of
the Gulf war.
The conference indicates that the Saudis, who have kept their distance from
most Iraqi exile groups and especially the Iran-backed Shia Moslem factions,
are taking a higher profile in organising efforts to overthrow Mr Saddam.
The meeting was attended by Hojatoleslam Mohammed Bakr al-Hakim, leader of
the Tehran-based Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the
main Shia opposition movement. Also there was Arshad Tewfiq, who resigned
several months ago as Iraq's ambassador to Spain.
Arshad Tewfiq, who claims to have contact with anti-Saddam cells within the
Baghdad regime, said most of the discussions involved working out an agenda.
The Al-Khaleej newspaper,published in Sharjah, reported that the Iraqi
opposition leaders were preparing for a general congress to produce a
'formula for . . . unified political action in co-operation with the
governments concerned with the situation in Iraq and the region'.

PORTUGAL'S opposition Socialist party (PS) yesterday chose Mr Antonio
Guterres, an energetic 42-year-old pragmatist, as its new leader in an
effort to revive its fortunes after last year's election defeat, Reuter
reports from Lisbon.
Mr Guterres, who replaces the dry intellectual Mr Jorge Sampaio as
secretary-general of the centre-left party, was overwhelmingly elected by
1,800 delegates at a three-day party congress.
He immediately challenged Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva to a televised
debate on the budget  - presented earlier this month  - which imposed value
added tax on food.
The congress also elected a new 200-member National Commission dominated by
Mr Guterres' supporters.
Mr Guterres challenged Mr Sampaio for the leadership after the PS, out of
power since 1985, lost badly to Mr Cavaco Silva's centre-right Social
Democrat party (PSD) in elections last October. the PS won only 29 per cent
of the vote.
Mr Guterres has said he wants to rejuvenate the PS leadership and make the
party more attractive to young people, whose interest has slid away from
politics to making money in Portugal's economic boom. He also promised to
widen the party's appeal to voters in the middle ground of the political
spectrum.

FT  22 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers to clear
21,000 again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
CONTINUED HOPES of an early cut in the discount rate to stimulate the
economy, and an overnight rally on Wall Street encouraged dealers to buy
equities, and the Nikkei average recovered to the 21,000 level for the first
time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The average rose 519.89 to the day's high of 21,291.81, a gain of 2 per cent
on the week. It opened at the day's low of 20,849.98, but later rose on
arbitrage-related buying and bargain-hunting.
Volume remained unchanged at 200m shares. Gainers led losers by 807 to 188
with 133 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced
28.25 to 1,551.66 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.82 to
1,188.88.
Traders noted a lack of sellers, such as investment trusts which have been
selling heavily recently to meet redemptions.
Market participants, heartened by the record low money supply growth
announced on Thursday, found additional support in the central bank's
confirmation of its commitment towards a stronger yen. Short-term interest
rates fell on expectations of an easing in credit policy.
Hopes that the government will announce fiscal measures to activate the
slowing economy lifted stocks likely to benefit from higher public spending.
Budget deliberations resumed this week after a two-week suspension due to a
dispute between the ruling party and opposition over a bribery scandal.
Housing stocks firmed, with Sumitomo Forestry adding Y40 to Y1,730, and
Daiwa House Industry advancing Y20 to Y1,840.
Interest rate-sensitive large capital issues were also higher. Nippon Steel,
the most active issue of the day, rose Y5 to Y352 and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries advanced Y6 to Y634.
Bargain-hunting lifted high-technology issues which have been sold heavily
following downward revisions in earnings forecasts. Toshiba rose Y14 to Y610
and TDK added Y100 to Y4,140.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange said yesterday that individual investors turned net
buyers of stocks last week for the first time in 44 weeks. Individuals
bought a net Y20.4bn in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.
Foreign investors remained net buyers, while institutions, including
insurers, banks and investment trusts stayed net sellers. Corporate selling
shrank from Y24.6bn to Y2.6bn.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 218.19 to 22,679.16 in volume of 65.4m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, added Y200 to Y10,900 on
bargain-hunting.
Roundup
WALL STREET's overnight gains had a relative muted effect on the region.
HONG KONG reversed a mid-week decline with the Hang Seng index 20.47 higher
at 4,736.47, still 0.8 per cent lower on the week, as turnover rose from
HKDollars 1.87bn to HKDollars 2.13bn.
The index opened strongly on the back of Wall Street with a rise of more
than 40 points, but profit-taking soon took over the initiative.
NEW ZEALAND moved in similar fashion, the NZSE 40 index closing 9.97 higher
at 1,499.69 after a 19-point rise in the early morning. JAKARTA halted a
week-long fall in the official index, up 3.50 to 279.89 in half-day trading.
MANILA reflected the gains of Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) in
New York, the composite index ending 16.72 higher at 1,156.08, down 3.8 per
cent on the week.
PLDT rose 35 pesos to 870.
AUSTRALIA, however, got no Wall Street kick from News Corp, which dropped 58
cents to ADollars 17.60 after a large gain last week. The market ended lower
on mixed economic data, the All Ordinaries index easing 1.5 to 1,621.5, 0.2
per cent higher on the week.
TAIWAN's weighted index fell 44.95 to 4950.37 following a rise of 155.90 on
Thursday. It fell 0.5 per cent on the week. SINGAPORE bounced back from
profit-taking, the Straits Times Industrial index closing 5.78 better at
1,519.05.
SEOUL's composite index was up 0.25 to 632.91, 3.9 per cent lower on the
week.

FT  22 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Investors offer tepid response to
Milan's new image - The long-awaited reforms have not delivered the expected
rise in turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year should be the watershed for Italian equities, thanks to new laws
bringing unprecedented transparency to the market and boosting liquidity by
curtailing off-floor trading.
The stalking horse for the changes is the new Societa di Intermediazione
Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's novel form of broking, underwriting and fund
management hybrid. The Sims are set to revolutionise the bourse, thanks to
their high capital requirements and the much tougher reporting rules.
Although many of Italy's small, privately-owned stockbrokers are still in
business, most have set up Sims, either independently or in conjunction with
more powerful banking partners. Such alliances have helped many overcome
what looks set to be a fierce battle against a background of high costs
following the introduction of screen-based trading at the same time as
commissions are whittled down by increased competition.
However, early results from the Sims have been mixed. Although the market's
image has improved, providing a temporary boost to confidence and volume at
the start of the year, turnover has not surged as many brokers hoped. Daily
trading has hovered around L100bn (Dollars 83m). The Comit index closed at
536.57 yesterday, up 3.49 on the day, and up 6.3 per cent since the end of
1991.
That has not lifted the mood among many brokers, who complain of the much
higher cost base they now face. According to a study this week by Banca
Commerciale Italiana, a medium-sized Sim would need a daily turnover of
between L6bn and L13bn to make an acceptable return on its capital.
Some dealers blame the market's relatively low turnover on teething troubles
with software and the fact that only a handful of Sims were ready when the
new law came into force this year. However, most acknowledge that the
explanation for the relatively small increase in turnover this year is based
more on fundamentals than technical hitches.
The prime cause for investors' tepid response to the Sims is political
uncertainty ahead of April's general elections. The widespread expectation
of a weak government and deeper political divisions has dented hopes of
getting to grips with Italy's spiralling budget deficit.
Figures confirming that the recession is growing and pointing to
unfavourable 1991 earnings have exacerbated the gloomy short-term
expectations. Last month's preliminary results from Fiat suggested that 1991
net profits would slump to around L1,100bn; Olivetti stands to lose at least
L290bn, and probably more, depending on the allocation of restructuring.
Special situations have at least added a touch of spice to the market.
Legislation approved last month introducing greater protection for minority
shareholders' rights in takeover bids has focused speculative interest on
some stocks which might be affected by the new rules.
Cementir, the cement group controlled by the IRI state holding company,
topped the list. Its stock has been driven in recent weeks by investors
hoping that IRI's plan to sell its 51.78 per cent holding would oblige the
buyer to launch a full bid.
As it happened, this week's L480bn sale of the stake to the Rome-based
Caltagirone building group did not trigger the bonanza speculators had been
banking on. The deal was concluded just before the law came into effect.
Hence minority shareholders in Cementir had no chance to share in the
reward, despite the fact that Caltagirone paid a 100 per cent premium to the
current market price. Both stocks fell heavily following the announcement.
Despite the disappointment, the new takeover law, whose complexities are
being mastered by the lawyers, is still fuelling speculation in other
stocks, particularly companies where the stock market float is very thin.
Standa, the stores group which is majority owned by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest concern, this week became the latest focus of such attention.
The market expects further privatisation deals following the government's
approval for a law to boost the sale of state-owned assets this year. And
the prospect of further bourse reforms, including the arrival of cash
settlement and futures and options, could lift the market further, as could
the arrival of big institutional money should Italy authorise the creation
of pension funds.
Once the elections are out of the way, investors may turn their attention
again to market reforms and the stream of new flotations probably in the
pipeline for this year.
The initial public offering for Istituto San Paolo di Torino, the big
Turin-based banking group, will feature prominently on most lists. Pencilled
in for early April, the San Paolo deal should raise around L1,500bn and get
the flotation season off to a strong start in view of the bank's high
reputation. San Paolo will be one of Italy's first bid public-sector banks
to use new banking liberalisation to float part of its equity, and the deal
should also be helped by the relative scarcity of such paper.
Further down the road are possible initial public offerings for a number of
other public-sector companies. Agip and Snam, two subsidiaries of the Eni
energy and chemicals group, and Ilva, IRI's steel-making arm, are all tipped
for a 1992 stock market debut.
With most of the legal framework for a well-functioning market now in place,
Italy has now overcome most of the structural barriers to a more liquid
equity market and wider share ownership. With a new flotation wave in sight,
political factors are the single most important factor in whether the bourse
will realise it new potential.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIZBOLLAH militiamen returning to southern Lebanon within hours of a
withdrawal by Israeli forces fired a rocket into northern Israel yesterday,
killing a five-year-old girl.
Israeli forces responded quickly to the first Israeli civilian death since
Hizbollah (Party of God) began a series of rocket attacks in revenge for
Israel's killing on Sunday of Sheikh Abbas Mousawi, the organisation's
leader.
Heavy artillery bombardments were directed at villages north of the security
zone - now largely deserted by their inhabitants  - including areas from
which Israeli tanks and troops had just withdrawn after their 24-hour strike
into United Nations-patrolled Lebanese territory. Officials said further
action on the ground would be taken if necessary.
The withdrawal - after an operation aimed at stamping out the rocket threat
to the 'security zone' Israel occupies just north of its border with Lebanon
 -followed international protests led by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, and urgent US calls on the Israeli, Lebanese and Syrian
governments to exercise 'maximum restraint'.
However, the spate of violence which has gripped the area for the past week
went on unabated and is certain to sour the atmosphere when the Middle East
peace talks resume in Washington on Monday.
Last night Mr Boutros Ghali said he would send two senior aides to Beirut
and Tel Aviv for urgent talks 'in view of the deteriorating situation'.
Mr Marrack Goulding, a Briton in charge of peace-keeping operations, and his
assistant, Mr Kofi Annan of Ghana, will leave for the region today.
Yesterday's attack confounded Israeli army claims that its thrust into
Lebanon had been 'a complete success'.
Hizbollah fighters were reported to have poured back into the two villages
the Israelis had captured, accompanied by gunmen from the Amal militia,
another Shia group which had previously been at odds with Hizbollah.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, has rejected retaliatory action
on the scale of the 1982 invasion, but promised to use 'all Israel's might'
to end the attacks.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Ownership of Wace Group to be investigated by DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry has appointed inspectors to investigate
the ownership of Wace Group.
The appointment of Mr Anthony Robertshaw and Mr Christopher Mayhew was
announced yesterday. It follows an internal inquiry by Wace into share
dealings ahead of an uncontested takeover in 1990 of its main UK rival,
Parkway Group.
Wace is the world's largest specialist in pre-press printing. It said it
found 'potentially unlawful' dealings in Parkway shares.
The Wace findings, passed to the DTI, included share transactions carried
out by relatives of Mr John Clegg, its former chief executive. Mr Clegg, 33,
resigned three weeks ago, three days after the company had denied that it
had connections with the IRA.
The denial was issued because of a newspaper article which linked an unnamed
publicly quoted UK company to an IRA money-laundering scheme.
It emerged that share dealings surrounding the Parkway takeover had been
investigated by the London Stock Exchange's insider dealing group. A dossier
was shown to the Royal Ulster Constabulary in June last year. A brief police
investigation which was carried out into suspicions of IRA connections
dismissed them.
The DTI said it was looking at the information passed on by Wace. The
inspectors have been appointed under Section 442 of the 1985 Companies Act
which covers investigations into who has financial interests in a company's
success or who may control or influence company policy.
In the months before Wace launched its bid on August 1 1990, nearly 4m
Parkway shares were bought and registered in the names of six of Mr Clegg's
relatives and seven people sharing their addresses.
Mr Clegg, in a statement released by his solicitors this week, said he had
never provided price sensitive information to anyone.
Mr Frans ten Bos, Wace chairman, yesterday welcomed the DTI investigation.
'The company has nothing to fear from its findings. Our only wish is that
the position should be speedily resolved,' he said.

FT  22 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has several motives for its recent wholesale interference in
the electricity industry, not least a pre-election wish to prove to domestic
consumers that privatisation can bring tangible benefits in the form of
lower nominal, as well as real prices. But the crux of the negotiations
between Whitehall and the two generating companies in particular is the
future of British Coal. The irony can scarcely pass unremarked: the
government is seeking to safeguard a future privatisation by pulling strings
in a supposedly unfettered industry.
In effect, the generators are being asked to forgo some of the extra profits
they stand to make after next year from cheaper imported coal. It is
difficult to quantify, but if a deal over future deliveries of UK coal is
struck, the generators might increase annual profits by 15 instead of 20 per
cent.
Far from damaging the companies' shares, the effect of lower revenues would
be amply offset by the simultaneous removal of political and regulatory
uncertainty. A pre-election deal securing a UK coal industry with, say, 40m
tonnes of output from 28 pits, is unlikely to be overturned by a Labour
government relieved of the need for a subsidy. Nor is it likely to offend
the regulator, even though it would do little to promote competition in
electricity generation. Some of the gas-fired power stations planned by new
entrants to the market would still be uneconomic even given the slightly
higher cost of coal.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While UK investors agonise over whether to switch from equities to gilts,
the opposite debate is raging in Germany. That was illustrated by
yesterday's close above 1,700 on the DAX index despite a background of
gloomy economic news. Admittedly the market remains vulnerable to a
prolongation of the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy. But it is benefiting
from the widespread perception that the medium-term outlook favours equities
for reasons that go beyond the cycle.
In theory, equity market reform should remove at least some of the
discrimination against minority shareholders that has deterred buyers
hitherto. European single market reforms promise increased competition in
the insurance industry, leaving it uncomfortable with the safe, but
relatively modest, returns available from the bond market. For the first
time in modern German history, individuals are accumulating inherited wealth
and wondering what to do with it. Since they are already affluent, they are
more likely to take the risks of equity investment - all the more so since
unification should push up the medium-term trend rate of German growth.
Even if the Bundesbank goes in for overkill and the promised recovery does
not materialise, bonds may not regain their traditional appeal. There is not
much scope for a further fall in yields now those in the US have turned up.
A large part of unification spending is still being dissipated in
consumption, while wage rises have pushed up industry's cost base. Both
factors speak for stubborn inflationary pressures even in a downturn. The
choice seems to be between cash and equities: bonds are running a distant
third.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of the London market to respond to yet another record close on
Wall Street was merely the latest in a series of striking reminders that UK
equities are thoroughly becalmed. Since the start of the year, the FT-SE
index has risen by 50 points, or just 1.7 per cent, more than half of that
increase occurring this week. Granted, the market has been restrained by
political worries: yesterday's opinion polls were reason enough for the
market to reflect a note of caution. As the corporate results season gets
into full swing, there is sufficient concern over dividends to limit
investors' enthusiasm. Equally, it is fashionable to turn the argument
around and contend that US investors are impossibly optimistic about
economic recovery - the yield ratio between US bonds and equities has
reached its highest level since the 1987 Crash.
It is thus the more interesting to note that the FT-SE would now be some 45
points higher, but for the notable underperformance since mid-January of
three very large stocks - Glaxo, BP and Shell. One implication is that the
broader performance of equities has been surprisingly positive.
Unfortunately, that could mean London will be even more vulnerable to bad
news.

FT  22 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds sets the pace
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FT-SE Index: 2,542.3 (
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
1.1)
It would be easy to jump to the conclusion from Lloyds' results that its
days of outperformance against the bank sector are numbered. Bad debt
provisions at 2.3 per cent of loans were somewhat worse than the market
expected, which bodes ill for Midland's results next week. Lloyds' loan book
has shrunk by nearly 10 per cent, admittedly because of exchange rate
effects and disposals as well as sliding UK credit demand. The main force
driving up operating profits thus remains the remorseless squeeze on costs.
Consider the looming competition in life insurance from Abbey National and
National Westminster, and one might think the best news is already in the
price.
That could yet be rash. Even though provisions will be steep again this
year, costs will remain under pressure: more jobs are to go and the savings
from last year's cut of 8,500 staff will be felt for the full year. The
shrinking loan book has boosted Lloyds' capital ratios substantially. If
National Westminster's experience has been similar, that could lift some of
the rights issue and dividend worries surrounding its shares. But Lloyds
itself stands to benefit whatever happens to the economy. It has room both
to expand in a recovery and to maintain or even increase its dividend if one
does not materialise - especially given the reserve of untapped profits from
its over-generous developing-country debt provisions.
Assuming that low inflation holds down loan growth, Lloyds might sooner or
later find itself in the unusual position of having a chronic surplus of
capital. The question, then, is whether even its disciplined management
would be tempted down a ruinous acquisition trail, though at some stage a
few extra outlets for the insurance products would doubtless come in handy.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Labour accuses government of buying votes: Poll gives Tories
two-point lead as Kinnock steps up attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK yesterday stepped up his efforts to pre-empt a pre-election
Budget tax cut as a new opinion poll showed the Conservatives holding on to
a two-point lead over Labour.
The opposition leader warned that the government was playing its last
electoral card by trying 'to buy votes with borrowed money'.
In a speech to parliamentary candidates in Birmingham, he went on to stress
the voters' choice between Labour's plans to invest in improved public
services and 'the economics of embezzlement'.
To the government's embarrassment, his comments were echoed by Mr Cecil
Parkinson, former Tory chairman. He told a BBC radio interviewer that voters
were 'not prepared to be bribed' by excessive borrowing. Mr Parkinson's
remarks came as clear evidence of behind-the-scenes divisions among Tory
backbenchers about the best shape of a Budget, now thought certain to be the
starting-gun for the general election campaign.
The claims were brushed aside by Mr John Major. Interrupting a tour of the
East Midlands, the prime minister told reporters it was time Labour
clarified its tax and spending plans which remained 'a mystery piled on an
enigma'.
For Tory campaign managers, there was considerable relief in a new
Gallup/Daily Telegraph opinion poll showing the party's lead had dropped
just half a percentage point on last week in spite of relentless opposition
attacks on the continuing recession.
The figures gave the Conservatives 39 (-1 point), Labour 37 (- 1/2 ) and the
Liberal Democrats 19 (+1 1/2 ) - a stark contrast with yesterday's NOP poll
that put Labour four points ahead.
Both parties disputed the accuracy of the findings, with Labour arguing that
Gallup exaggerated the Tories' strength and the Conservatives claiming that
the reverse was true of NOP.
Earlier, Mr Kinnock had expressed regret that Labour was not more than four
points ahead. But he added in a BBC interview that fear of the recession did
not 'naturally make people lunge for change.'
Labour's recovery to neck-and-neck from just 28 per cent support in 1983
left him certain of an election victory, he said.
In London, senior Tory ministers shifted their target to Labour's
nationalisation plans, claiming their opponents supported 'massive state
intervention and interference'.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, cited as evidence comments by
Mr Frank Dobson on Wednesday that a Labour government could use its 40 per
cent shareholding to impose directors on the boards of the electricity
utilities.
However, the Labour energy spokesman was unrepentant yesterday, adding that
a government would also be within its powers to halt the building of new
port facilities planned to handle coal imports.
Today, Mr Major will take the pre-electoral battle to Glasgow where he will
spearhead a new Tory drive to discredit the arguments for a devolved
parliament or full independence.
Yesterday, Mr Tom King, defence secretary, used a visit to Aberdeen to warn
that 'the catastrophic effect' of independence would mean the loss of 45,000
jobs in the armed services and the defence industries.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Morse warns on bank bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Jeremy Morse, Lloyds Bank chairman, warned yesterday that UK banks' bad
debts were unlikely to fall in 1992. He was disclosing that his bank had
made a record charge of Pounds 885m to cover the risk of losses on its loans
to UK companies and individuals.
'Banks' bad debts are at their worst since the 1930s,' he said. 'My
prediction is that bad debts in 1992 will be about level with 1991.'
Lloyds still made pre-tax profits of Pounds 645m in 1991, up 9 per cent on
the previous year and higher than City analysts expected. Faced with
difficult economic conditions the bank has cut costs. It reduced staff by
8,500 last year and Mr Brian Pitman, the chief executive, said there would
be '2,000 or 3,000 job losses this year'.
Lloyds was the first English clearing bank to disclose its 1991 results.
Analysts expect it will be the most profitable, even though it is far
smaller than National Westminster Bank and Barclays. In 1991, the four
clearers are thought to have suffered bad debt charges of about Pounds 4.5bn
in aggregate.
Lloyds' total bad debt charge was Pounds 918m, up from Pounds 778m in 1990.
Sir Jeremy said there had been a trend of falling losses on loans to big
companies, but losses on exposure to smaller businesses had been increasing.
More recently a rising proportion of loans to personal customers had been
going bad.
The trend has been obscured by the collapse of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's
business empire. Lloyds made provisions against its Maxwell exposure of at
least Pounds 80m, according to analysts.
Sir Jeremy warned that even when an economic recovery came - and he stressed
there was no sign of one yet - bad debts would continue to rise.

FT  22 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow holds its ground in spite
of afternoon loss
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER Thursday's 50-point gain, US stock markets settled down yesterday into
a holding pattern, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.45 at 3,280.19.
Although the index spent most of the day only a few points either side of
the previous night's record close, share prices did fall more than 20 points
mid-afternoon before a round of buying restored the lost ground.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 2.46 at 411.44,
while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks fell 2.48 to 629.75.
Turnover on the NYSE was 263m shares.
Although the session opened with prices firmer, there was little conviction
behind the buying, and investors appeared to be staying on the sidelines,
wary of how the market would react in the afternoon to the expiration of
options contracts on derivatives markets.
However, the underlying tone in the market was firm, and even further
declines in bond prices - the benchmark 30-year bond dropped nearly a
half-point, pushing the yield up to 7.94 per cent - failed to unsettle
stocks, which remained underpinned by hopes of a recovery in economic growth
and corporate earnings.
Among individual stocks, Time Warner rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 100 after
a delayed opening due to an order imbalance. The rush of demand for the
stock came as investors welcomed the surprise news late on Thursday that Mr
Nick Nicholas, designated successor to Time Warner chairman Mr Steven Ross,
had resigned because of differences with the management of the company. Mr
Nicholas' departure ends what appears to have been a fierce power struggle
at the top of the big entertainment group. His post as president and
co-chief executive was taken by Mr Gerald Levin.
Drug stocks were mostly higher, although all ended below their highs for the
day. Bristol-Myers Squibb rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 , Schering
Plough added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 56 3/4 and Pfizer firmed Dollars 1 to
Dollars 72. The exception was Merck, which has outperformed the sector
recently, falling Dollars 1 to Dollars 146 1/4 .
Motor stocks, favoured by investors in recent days after reports of higher
car sales and in anticipation of improved earnings, fell back. General
Motors lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 , Ford gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 37 1/2 , and Chrysler slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 17.
Unisys fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 9 5/8 in turnover of 3.8m shares after a
leading newspaper columnist reported that some analysts think it is time to
sell the stock, which just over a year ago was languishing at Dollars 2.
Among over-the-counter stocks, fourth-quarter earnings continued to drive
sentiment. Healthdyne climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26 1/8 after posting
net income of 26 cents a share, compared with 5 cents a share a year ago.
Zeos International fell Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 in heavy trading on
fourth-quarter earnings well up on a year ago but disappointing to analysts.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed mixed in moderate trading to cap off a week
characterised by declining prices. The TSE 300 eased 0.41 points to 3536.61,
bringing the week's fall to about 37 points. Declines outnumbered advances
by 330 to 254 on volume of 29.7m shares, valued at CDollars 382.3m.
Goodyear Canada soared CDollars 9 to CDollars 48 1/4 as its parent, Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber, said it will offer CDollars 48 a share for the common shares
of Goodyear Canada it does not already own.

FT  22 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Budget hopes steady equity nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of an expansionary Budget from the UK government on March 10
continued to shield the UK stock market from the effects of this week's
barrage of bad news from the international oil companies. Share prices
closed steadily ahead of the opening on Monday of the last equity trading
account before Budget Day.
London benefited initially from the effects of Wall Street's overnight gain
of 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had prompted
advances across the range of other European bourses. But gains were soon
eliminated as the stock index futures reacted sharply to a weaker trend in
sterling and to the latest UK public opinion polls which indicated a lead of
four points for the UK opposition Labour party.
The implications for dividend yields in the UK market of the disappointing
statements from BP and Shell also kept share prices subdued yesterday. By
the close of trading, the market was no more than mixed.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,542.3 for a net loss on the day
of 1.1 points. In early trade, the market was ahead by 11.7 but lost impetus
as, once again, the institutions stayed away from UK equities until the
outlook is clearer.
The Footsie 2,550 mark is still seen as an important hurdle and strategists
remained confident for the near term outlook in equities. A cut of half a
point in UK base rates between Budget Day and the general election, expected
on April 9, has now been virtually discounted by the London stock market.
At last night's close, the FT-SE Index showed a gain of 25.1, or nearly 1
per cent, over the two week equity account. The gain came this week on
sudden hopes in the City that interest rates might be cut earlier than
expected.
However, Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull was among those to warn that the
trading results from BP and Shell may have sharply changed the market's
earnings profile for the medium to longer term, and that projections of a
fall of 12 per cent in earnings may now be shifting to around 17 per cent.
This could undermine many projections for UK equities both for this year and
next. Confidence in London is also restrained by continuing worries over
what is seen as an over-generous valuation of Wall Street.
Good results from Lloyds Bank helped London yesterday but left unanswered
the underlying rumours that the UK banking sector will be the stage for a
substantial restructuring during the current profits season.
Retail, or customer, volume in equities rose sharply at the beginning of the
week on hopes of early cuts in base rates but has now receded.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Appointments: London Stock Exchange - Bank dividend pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT figures from Lloyds Bank were at the very top end of analysts'
expectations and triggered a steep rise in the share price. There was no
news, however, regarding possible acquisitions from the troubled Midland
Bank, which had been widely rumoured earlier in the week.
Lloyds' shares rose steadily throughout the day, closing a net 17 higher at
404p; turnover in the stock reached 5.6m, well ahead of usual levels of
activity.
Dealers said the stock had responded to a flurry of support prompted by the
good dividend. Analysts agreed that the bank had performed exceptionally
well during a difficult period; 'Lloyds is a core holding in the sector,'
said Mr Mike Fesemeyer at Nomura, the Japanese-owned investment bank.
The Nomura analyst said Lloyds had focused on providing return on equity or
shareholder value. 'Some banks chose to focus on kudos and ego, while Lloyds
chose to focus on profit and cash,' said Mr Fesemeyer.
Shearson Lehman's banks team described Lloyds as 'the quality stock in the
sector,' highlighting the bank's exceptional return on equity -'53 per cent
against 32-3 per cent for the other banks', said Shearson's Chris Wheeler.
RHM setback
A profit downgrading by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and suggestions that another
broking house had placed a substantial line of stock, knocked Ranks Hovis
McDougall (RHM) down 8 to 207p, in hefty turnover of 14m shares. The placing
was said to have involved a block of 6.1m shares at 207 3/4 p.
BZW visited the company on Thursday and has decided to cut its profit
forecast for the year to October 1992 from Pounds 115m to Pounds 110m and
for the following financial year from Pounds 125m from Pounds 119m. The
broker said that possible problems with the bread, milling and cake
divisions had resulted in the downgrading.
Euro Disney firm
An announcement that Euro Disney is to join the CAC 40 - the top 40 listed
shares in Paris - at the expense of Source Perrier, lifted the stock 40 to
1,555p. Turnover in London was a meagre 184,000 shares, compared with 2.1m
in Paris. The move, scheduled to take place on March 19, will mean that
funds tracking the CAC 40 will automatically buy into Disney.
Oils rally
A tumultuous week in the oils sector closed with the 'majors' staging a
determined fight back after a number of serious setbacks earlier in the
week. BP rallied 4 1/2 to 258 1/2 p after revealing details of its latest
drilling at its Cusiana field in Colombia. BP has a 40 per cent stake in
Cusiana as has Total of France. In New York, shares in Triton Energy, holder
of 20 per cent of Cusiana, fell sharply following the announcement.
One London analyst said the Cusiana news was 'certainly nothing to worry
about. It's a good flow rate.' Turnover in BP erupted again, totalling 30m
shares and boosting the number of shares traded in BP since their
disappointing preliminary results were published last week to more than
230m.
Shell, which dropped like a stone after its disappointing figures on
Thursday, stabilised yesterday as large-scale switching out of Royal Dutch
and into Shell in overnight deals in the US was absorbed. Shell ended
another hectic trading session 8 higher at 448p with turnover topping 15m.
The post-results analysts' meeting did little to bolster confidence.
British Gas, announcing profits figures on Thursday - County NatWest expects
historic net income of Pounds 1.275bn against Pounds 1.211bn - eased 2 to
252p on 3.9m.
Positive reflection on Glaxo's results saw the shares add 9 to 825p in brisk
turnover of 5.7m. But the outlook for the shares remained uncertain in view
of the doubt cast on prospects for sales of Zantac, Glaxo's highly
successful anti-ulcer drug.
Specialist valve manufacturer Bespak, a tightly traded stock, gained 21 to
525p as a buyer moved into the market.
Vodafone outpaced the rest of the telecoms stocks, moving ahead to 357p
before settling a net 4 1/2 firmer at 355p; turnover reached 2.3m shares.
BZW prompted strong support.
BZW's telecoms team said it now saw a receding threat to Vodafone from PCN,
the new personal communications network. BZW said it was now looking at one
regional mobile competitor to Vodafone/Cellnet from 1993 with only two
eventual competitors and fully national mobile coverage not until 1996 or
1997.
Previously it had expected three new regional PCN competitors by 1993 and a
national PCN service and price competition by 1995.
A repeated buy recommendation from SG Warburg lifted Argos 7 to 292p.
Warburg said the company came out well in a survey on staff costs and the
implications of any introduction of a minimum wage if Britain adopts
European Community regulations.
In the food manufacturing sector Berisford lost 5 1/2 to 20p, on plans to
raise Pounds 14.8m via a rights issue of loan stock. This is to provide
finance for its associate company Rayner Coffee International after a sharp
fall in coffee prices. Berisford is guaranteeing up to Dollars 115m in bank
borrowings to Rayner, in which it holds a 45 per cent stake.
Greencore fell 3 to 252p following the Irish government's decision to sell
off 15 per cent of its stake. The sale comes one week before Irish high
court inspectors are due to report on Greencore's financial dealings.
Unilever maintained a firm tone, rising 9 to 964p on speculation that next
Tuesday's figures will show a rise to Pounds 1.80bn-Pounds 1.84bn in 1991
profits from Pounds 1.782bn.
Broker Robert Fleming turned sellers on Ladbroke, the shares slipping 6 to
225p in busy turnover of 4.4m. The house also cut its profit forecast by
Pounds 30m to Pounds 210m for 1992. Analyst Mr David Kadarauch, while not
bearish on the fundamentals of the company, said: 'I cannot see the basic
trading position of the group improving until 1993.'
Turnover in British Aerospace rose to 7.2m as the shares jumped 10 to 310p
after institutional investors bought stock to take advantage of Monday's
dividend payout.
Vickers retreated 6 to 162p after Smith New Court reiterated its belief that
the company would announce a dividend cut with Monday's full year results.
Bid speculation returned to Dowty Group sending the shares 2 1/2 higher at
122 1/2 p on high volume of 6.4m. Tiphook bounced from recent falls, gaining
13 to 312 as bargain hunters picked up stock.
Cookson closed unchanged at 116p having touched 115p earlier in the session.
There were reports that Kleinwort Benson had easily placed a block of 1.2m
shares. Total volume reached 4.6m.
P &amp; O were once again hurt by speculation of problems at Chelsfield, its
joint venture partner in Pall Mall Properties. The shares fell 15 to 387p on
turnover of 1.2m.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi attracted another wave of heavy buying interest, closing
3/4 higher at 16 3/4 p, with turnover topping the 30m-mark.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar consolidates its gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar traded in a narrow range of between DM1.64 and DM1.65 yesterday,
content to consolidate the gains of recent days, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The US currency managed one brief rally to DM1.6565 on the back of a large
buying order rumoured to have been the institutional investor, American
Trust. However, it soon drifted back to below DM1.65 in what traders
described as a 'very, very thin market'.
The dollar closed in London a touch stronger at DM1.6495, compared with
DM1.6470 on Thursday.
Economists stressed that the dollar's quiet day did not mean the market was
turning bearish. 'A positive sentiment continues to be driven by the view
that the US economy is recovering and interest rates have bottomed out,'
said Dr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International.
There was a subdued atmosphere on foriegn exchanges around the globe with
the most notable feature being the lack of movement in virtually all
currencies.
The dollar/yen rate was slightly stronger, although fears of central bank
intervention kept most players away. The Bank of Japan was rumoured to have
been checking prices overnight. The dollar closed at Y128.70, compared with
Y128.50.
Sterling fell against the D-Mark early in the day as an opinion poll
suggested a four-point lead for the Labour Party over the Conservatives in
the forthcoming general election. The pound fell to DM2.8775 on the news,
although it recovered to close unchanged at DM2.8825.
'Opinion polls will become even more important to the market (in sterling),'
said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank.
The pound remained firmly on the floor of the exchange rate mechanism, even
when the peseta eased against the D-Mark during the day. This should have
allowed it a greater cushion, said Mr Michael Feeny of Sumitomo Bank. He
suggested that, as a result, sterling's recent resilience within the ERM had
not been real. 'It has been forced up as the floor has gone up,' he said.
By the end of the day, however, the peseta was only slightly weaker at 62.64
per D-Mark, compared with 62.62 on Thursday.
The D-Mark continued to strengthen against the Swiss franc, reinforcing
fears that the Swiss National Bank was pursuing a policy of back door
devaluation. The D-Mark closed at 90.57 centimes, compared with 90.42 on
Thursday.
The Canadian dollar enjoyed early gains against the US unit, as better than
expected inflation figures gave the currency support. Trade was thin,
however, as the market was looking ahead to the budget next week.

FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: Time Warner rises on shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Time Warner, the large US media group, rose sharply yesterday
morning as Wall Street reacted positively to a management shake-up involving
the resignation in a policy dispute of Mr Nicholas Nicholas, president and
heir apparent to Mr Steven Ross, the chairman.
Time Warner announced Mr Nicholas's unexpected departure late on Thursday,
after the closure of the New York Stock Exchange. It said he had been
replaced as president and co-chief executive by Mr Gerald Levin, the group's
chief operating officer.
Shares in the group, which has been dogged by controversy ever since the
1989 merger between Time, the blue-chip publishing house, and Warner
Communications, a much brasher film and entertainment group, stood at
Dollars 100 3/4 at lunchtime, and closed at Dollars 100 for a net gain of
Dollars 2 1/8 .
Mr Nicholas, aged 52, had a mixed reputation on Wall Street, where he was
seen as a good manager, but possibly lacking the rapport with creative
artists helpful in running a media business.
Despite this, Mr Nicholas had been due to succeed Mr Ross under the terms of
the 1989 merger between Time and Warner Communications. Mr Ross himself is
undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.
Mr Levin, who is also 52, is highly regarded by brokers' analysts, who view
him as a good manager with a creative touch and understanding of the film
industry.
In the 1970s he was closely involved in Time's development of its Home Box
Office cable television channel, which specialises in showing feature films.
Although both Mr Nicholas and Mr Levin are veterans of the Time side of the
business, and were both closely involved in the negotiation of the
controversial 1989 merger, company executives said Mr Levin had grown much
closer to Mr Ross and his ideas on the group's future.
Mr Nicholas gave no details of the clashes which led to his departure. He
said merely that 'for a company to fulfil its potential requires a clear
strategic focus shared totally by its leadership'. There was sufficient
difference between himself and the management and board that his resignation
should 'enable a single and consistent view to prevail'.
However, company insiders suggested there had been a series of clashes
between Mr Nicholas and Mr Ross over Time Warner strategy decisions.
These appear to have included the terms of an agreement last autumn, under
which Time Warner sold a 12.5 per cent stake in its film and cable business
to Japanese companies, Toshiba and C. Itoh, for Dollars 1bn. The group has
also been looking for strategic partners in Europe.
They may also have involved a decision for the highly-indebted company to
raise Dollars 2.7bn last year through a controversial rights issue of
shares, which had to be embarrasingly restructured when it ran into investor
opposition. Mr Nicholas, 52, had a mixed reputation on Wall Street, where he
was seen as a good manager, but one possibly lacking a rapport with creative
artists

FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: BSN enters Perrier fray with
FFr6bn bid for Exor
</HEADLINE>

BSN, the French food group, yesterday raised the temperature in the fight
for Perrier mineral water by launching a FFr6bn (Dollars 1.07bn) counter-bid
for Exor, the French property company that controls Perrier, against the
Agnelli family.
The BSN bid marks a new phase in the Perrier affaire, which has turned into
a bitter battle since Nestle, the Swiss food group, last month mounted a
FFr13.42bn hostile bid for Perrier with Indosuez, the powerful Parisian
bank.
BSN has secured the support of both Nestle, one of its chief competitors in
the European food market, and Indosuez in the bid for Exor, which controls
35 per cent of Perrier.
The French food group is also being assisted by Lazard, another prominent
Paris bank and BSN's biggest single shareholder. It had, until recently,
been seen as an ally of the Agnellis.
The BSN camp is offering FFr1,420 for each Exor share, valuing the company
at just over FFr6bn. This pitches its bid above the FFr1,320 offered by
Ifint, an Agnelli vehicle, late last year.
The Italian family speaks for 54 per cent of Exor, however,
and last night, Ifint said it would not accept the BSN bid.
The announcement of the BSN bid, after the Paris stock market had closed,
followed a day of frantic speculation. Early yesterday the French stock
market authorities issued a statement suspending Exor's shares pending the
announcement of an 'imminent counter-bid'.
BSN was immediately mooted as a likely candidate. It is an established
partner of the Agnellis, with whom it has several joint ventures. However,
it appeared to switch allegiance in the Perrier bid by agreeing to buy
Volvic, a Perrier still water business, from Nestle, thereby reducing the
risk of monopoly problems if the latter's bid succeeded.
Yesterday there was speculation in the French press that BSN had been trying
to engineer a rapprochement between Nestle and the Agnellis, possibly by
counter-bidding for Exor. Exor's chairman, Mr Jacques Vincent, who also
heads Perrier, has led the fight against Nestle and Indosuez.
'BSN is in a difficult position,' said Mr John Graham, European food analyst
at UBS:Phillips &amp; Drew in London. 'The Perrier battle has become very messy.
BSN is helping Nestle by buying Volvic, but it will also want to protect its
joint ventures with the Agnellis.'
Meanwhile, the legal battle over Perrier should come to a head next week
when the French commercial courts conclude two critical cases.
Also next week, Exor and its allies - Societe Generale, the French bank, and
Saint Louis, the sugar company - will discover whether they will be forced
to comply with a recent French stock market ruling to make a full bid for
Perrier.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: John Michael Clegg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Michael Clegg, pictured bottom left, was on the fast track in London
during the 1980s. Qualifying as a solicitor at Nabarro Nathanson, a
prestigious City firm, he moved briefly to Minster Trust before buying into
Wace in 1983 at the age of 24.
The money came, he said repeatedly, from an inheritance of Ms Jayne Wright,
his cousin, who had emigrated to South Africa.
Recent investigations revealed, however, that she is in fact his
half-sister, born out of wedlock to his father Mr John Henry Clegg. She is
pictured bottom right outside her Durban home this week.
Mr John Henry Clegg, pictured top left during his heyday in Sheffield in the
early 1960s, was a notorious local figure. Like his twin brother Albert he
was convicted on numerous charges. Bankruptcy proceedings were brought
against both brothers by the Inland Revenue in the early 1980s.
Several Sheffield relatives say they have seen little of either man since.
Albert remains an undischarged bankrupt. For some years both men have had
investments in South Africa.
In recent days, Ms Wright has refused to answer questions put to her by
reporters visiting her Durban home. Speaking briefly on her behalf have been
her husband Mr Keith Riley and a man who gave his name as Frederick Turner.
One day this week, Mr Turner arrived at the Riley home in a pick-up truck
belonging to Ace Panel Beaters. Mr Antonio Bernardi, at the company, said he
did not know of a Mr Turner but he did know Mr John Henry Clegg. He was his
wife's uncle and lived at 42 Connemara, in Durban.
The name Clegg is on the letter box but Mr Turner, who speaks with a
northern England accent, answered the door (picture top right). He said he
was not John Henry Clegg.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Extended family ties stretched from Chicago
to Durban - Relatives of the ex-Wace chief appear on takeover share
registers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, RICHARD DONKIN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL THREE weeks ago Mr John Michael Clegg was one of Britain's most
successful entrepreneurs. At the age of 33 a glittering business career
stretched ahead of him. In one week last month it was shattered.
In his own words, his departure from Wace Group, the company he created
eight years ago and built into the UK's largest printing services company,
has caused him 'great anguish'. But the reasons for his departure remain a
mystery.
He now sits behind drawn curtains in his house in an affluent suburb of
Chicago, where he moved a year ago from London to devote his time to Wace's
expansion in the US, the greatest commercial challenge he had faced. His
wife shields him from knocks at the door and the insistent telephone calls.
The only clue he has given to his sudden exit was to say that 'he had little
alternative but to resign', because of 'continuing rumours regarding myself
and my family . . . which might be damaging to Wace'.
The comments, however, are unlikely to die away. Since he left, Wace said
its internal inquiry had revealed a pattern of 'potentially unlawful
dealing' in the shares of Parkway Group, its main rival and one of its
biggest acquisitions.
Last night the Department of Trade and Industry announced that it had
launched a formal inquiry into the shareholdings of Wace Group and Parkway.
One task of the inquiry will be to establish whether insider dealing took
place - trading in shares while possessing sensitive information not
generally available.
The shareholder registers of Parkway and Tinsley Robor, a second acquisition
target of Wace, contain the names of relatives of Mr Clegg and others
connected with them.
Mr Clegg has stated through his solicitors that he has 'never acted on or
provided to others any price-sensitive information', and that he is 'more
than happy to co-operate' with the DTI.
A number of questions arise:
Nearly 4m shares were bought in Parkway in the months before Wace launched a
bid on August 1 1990 in the names of 15 people. Of these, 11 are the names
of relatives of Mr John Clegg - either directly or by marriage - and the
other four share the relatives' addresses. Who are these people, and what
led them to buy the shares?
Six of these names - and three names of other relatives of Mr Clegg  -
appear in 1990 on the share register of Tinsley Robor, recording the
purchase of 1.4m shares in the company, a printing company which Wace
considered taking over in early 1990, although the deal was not concluded.
Do these purchases reveal a co-ordinated 'dealing circle', trading on
information about Wace's plans?
Did the registered owners of the shares know that shares were being bought
in their names?
Where did the money to buy the shares come from? Where did the money from
selling them go?
The pursuit of the answers will take the DTI inspectors not just to Chicago,
but to affluent suburbs of Durban, South Africa, to a decaying tower block
in north-west London, to Belfast, to Dublin, and to the streets of
Sheffield, Mr Clegg's home town.
The trail takes in two generations of Cleggs. But the complexity of the
family connections is a formidable obstacle. Mr John Clegg's father and
uncle, identical twins, each had two wives, produced between them eleven
children, and Albert employed numerous aliases.
The share deals scrutinised by Wace in its internal inquiry involve names
scattered through the extended family tree. Financial Times reporters have
followed the trail over three continents to shed light on the mystery.
The first key to the puzzle lies in Berea, Durban, half a world away from Mr
Clegg's Chicago home - but not immune to the pressures which have turned his
life upside down. Visitors are kept firmly out behind the steel gates,
inscribed with the names Jayne and Keith, and telephone callers are now
threatened with lawyers' injunctions.
Mr Clegg has always described Mrs Jayne Riley as his cousin, previously Ms
Jayne Wright. He has repeatedly said that she gave him, from the proceeds of
a family inheritance, the Pounds 700,000 he used to buy into Wace in 1983.
However Mrs Riley is his half-sister, the daughter of Mr John Henry Clegg,
his father, and Ms Anne Lilian Wright, of Sheffield. She married Mr Keith
Riley on emigrating to South Africa.
Shortly before the Wace purchase, an investment in Helical Bar, a property
and development company, made a profit of around Pounds 200,000 for Mr
Albert Clegg, Mrs Riley's and Mr Clegg's uncle. Although the Helical Bar
shares were registered in Mrs Riley's name, they were bought by a Mr Michael
Clark, an alias used by Mr Albert Clegg in the past.
In 1988 Mrs Riley's 30 per cent stake in Wace was sold. The company's
outstanding growth meant that the stake fetched some Pounds 8.5m. The DTI
inspectors are likely to consider not just the original source of money but
the destination of that profit.
Among other questions is whether any of the proceeds were used to buy into
Parkway and Tinsley Robor.
Between May and August 1990 650,000 shares in Parkway were registered in the
names of Jayne and Keith Riley, and 490,000 shares in Tinsley Robor were
registered in the name of Keith Riley in 1990.
However the Rileys' shares were registered not in South Africa but at
addresses in north London and at the Anglo Irish Bank in Dublin.
One of those addresses, a dingy ground-floor flat in a north London local
authority tower block was the second key to the puzzle. It was used to
register shares in Parkway by seven other people - according to one of
Wace's advisers, the piece of the pattern that 'set alarm bells ringing'
among the advisers.
A Financial Times reporter visiting the flat this week knocked hard for
several minutes with no response. Inside the open door was a small untidy
room, the furniture strewn with clothes. On the walls were large oil
paintings in gilt frames. A young man with short-cropped red hair, appeared
at the kitchen door.
He would not give his name but said he was the nephew of Mr John Henry
Clegg, Mr John Michael Clegg's father, who he said owned the flat. Mr Clegg
snr is registered at the address on the electoral role. The man said he knew
nothing about the 1.25m Parkway shares that were registered there before the
Wace bid.
In nearby Hendon, is a smart detached house whose registered occupants
include a Mrs Jean McHale - the sister-in-law of Mr John Henry Clegg. She
was also registered as the buyer of 575,000 shares before the Wace takeover.
Another 600,000 shares bought about the same time were registered at the
same address in the name of Mrs Vivienne Johnston.
The third key to the puzzle lies in Sheffield, where Mr John Henry Clegg
spent most of his life, and where his son John was brought up.
It has become clear that a total of 120,000 shares in Parkway were
registered at two Sheffield addresses in the name of four Cleggs - Vivienne,
David, James Robert, and Christopher Stephen. Some 25,000 shares in Tinsley
Robor were also registered in the names of Mr David and Mr Christopher Clegg
in 1990.
These are all children of Mr Albert Clegg by his first wife Jeanne - and are
thus Mr John Michael Clegg's cousins.
The first Sheffield address, used to register the share purchases in the
name of Mr David Clegg, was that of Ms Jeanne Clegg's spinster sister, who
calls herself Auntie Noreen. She told the Financial Times that she recalled
letters for David popping through her letterbox but took no interest in them
and merely passed them on, she said. They were a good family, she said.
The second Sheffield address, in Westbourne Road, is occupied by Christopher
Clegg. Outside stands his Jaguar, with its personalised number plate.
Wace's brokers handling the Parkway purchase noticed some of these dealings
in the name of Clegg at the time of the deal and questioned Mr John Michael
Clegg, their client and then chief executive of Wace. He assured them in
writing that he had not communicated with these cousins for years.
Other questions arising include dealing by Mr Albert Conroy in Tinsley Robor
shares - registered at the north London tower block. Mr Conroy was one of
several aliases used by Mr Albert Clegg.
It will also look at dealings in Parkway and Tinsley Robor registered in the
names of Kathleen and Daniel Dunne, sharing the same address in Belfast.
Kathleen Dunne was the name of John Henry's first wife.
The DTI's final port of call will be to Dublin, to the Anglo Irish Bank. Mr
John Clegg resigned as a director of the AIB when he left Wace.
Much of the Parkway share-buying went through the same broker - Porter
Irvine, a subsidiary of AIB. Mr Henry Irvine, its principal at the time,
handled many of the transactions that were investigated by the Stock
Exchange. He says he gave a statement to the Stock Exchange at the time and
has nothing more to say.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Black Horse is favourite to win the profits
race - The first of the English clearing banks to disclose its 1991 results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JEREMY MORSE, the chairman of Lloyds Bank who is soon to retire, thinks
of himself as a banker faute de mieux.
He originally joined a bank - Glynn Mills, now part of Royal Bank of
Scotland - to acquire some professional skills in preparation for taking the
helm of his family's East Anglian brewery.
'However Watneys bought the brewery', he said yesterday, 'So things turned
out rather differently'.
At the age of 63, he is now planning to stand down. 'On April 1, I will have
been chairman for 15 years', he added. 'That is rather too long . . . I will
leave here at the end of the year or early next year'. However, his
successor is likely to be found rather sooner so that he or she can work
alongside Sir Jeremy for several months.
Sir Jeremy is leaving at the apex of the bank's fortunes relative to its
peers. Lloyds was yesterday the first of the English clearing banks to
disclose its 1991 results and analysts are convinced that it will emerge as
the most profitable of them - even though its balance sheet is half the size
of Barclays' and National Westminster's respectively.
Lloyds' 1991 pre-tax profits were Pounds 645m, 9 per cent higher than the
previous year, even though the bank suffered record losses on its UK loans
of Pounds 885m. Thanks to a drop in the tax rate, profits after tax rose 22
per cent to Pounds 357m.
There was a small increase - of 3 per cent  - in interest income to Pounds
2.35bn.
Mr Brian Pitman - Lloyds' chief executive who with Sir Jeremy is regarded by
analysts as an architect of the bank's success - said the bank had benefited
indirectly from the absence of demand for loans from UK companies and
consumers.
In the absence of such demand, Lloyds was able to reduce its reliance on the
money markets as a source of funds to lend. Such borrowing from the money
markets is far more expensive for a bank than taking deposits from personal
customers.
Other operating income - including revenue from Lloyds' highly successful
life insurance operations, Abbey Life and Black Horse Life - rose 5 per cent
to Pounds 1.63bn.
However, the bank succeeded in avoiding any increase in overheads. Indeed
staff costs fell 4 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 28.6p, but the full year dividend has
been increased by 9 per cent to 16.7p for the year. 'I did not want to pay
more, having made it clear last year that we wanted dividend cover (the
ratio of earnings to dividends) to rise from last year's level of 1.5
times', Sir Jeremy said.
Dividend cover is now 1.7. Nonetheless, analysts had been expecting a
smaller dividend increase.
They point out that other big banks cannot afford to increase their
dividends at all. Midland is likely to omit a payment for the second half of
1991. As Sir Jeremy and Mr Pitman, never tire of saying, their prime aim is
to reward the banks' shareholders. Their motives are not purely altruistic.
A recent report by the stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew pointed out that Mr
Pitman has a personal stake in Lloyds worth close to Pounds 1m whereas the
chief executives of Barclays, Midland and NatWest have personal
shareholdings with a combined value of only Pounds 100,000.
But despite the emphasis on dividend growth and an eschewing of rights
issues to finance expansion - Lloyds has not had a rights issue since Sir
Jeremy took the helm - the bank is also likely to emerge as the bank with
the strongest balance sheet, as measured in terms of the ratio of capital to
assets.
Its risk asset ratio, the new international standard for assessing balance
sheet strength, was 9.7 per cent at the end of the year, up from 8.5 per
cent.
The ratio would have been higher still, if Lloyds had chosen to write back
into its accounts some of the provisions it made three years ago to cover
the risk of losses on loans to less developed countries.
These provisions total Pounds 2.8bn, equivalent to 75 per cent of its LDC
exposure.
However prices of LDC loans in the international markets suggest that Lloyds
may be taking too pessimistic a view of the likely losses on this exposure.
Colin Wilks, Lloyds' chief financial officer, said that if the bank sets its
provisions at the level of market prices, around Pounds 900m of capital
would be released for the bank's use.
So even if loan losses do not diminish in 1992, as Sir Jeremy fears, the
balance sheet should remain robust.
Sir Jeremy himself may not be around to steer the bank through the eventual
recovery in the UK economy, but he confirmed yesterday that Mr Pitman - who
reached Lloyds' official retirement age of 60 last year - will stay on for
at least another couple of years.
Some analysts believe that Lloyds pre-tax profits will exceed Pounds 1bn by
the time Mr Pitman goes - which will give some satisfaction to the brewer
manque.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: NHL in last ditch talks as chairman goes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL HOME LOANS, the troubled mortgage lender, has started last ditch
talks with four syndicates of banks to reschedule its debts in a bid to
stave off administration.
At the same time, its subsidiary, National Mortgage Bank, is to run down its
business and then surrender its banking license. Mr Ian Hay Davison, a
veteran City trouble-shooter, will act as chairman of the bank during its
run-down.
The moves were announced late last night, along with news of the departure
of Mr Kevin Milner, NHL group chairman.
Mr Jonathan Perry, a director of NHL since last June and a former director
of Morgan Grenfell, becomes executive chairman, replacing both Mr Milner and
Mr John Darby, the NHL chairman who announced his resignation in November.
Mr Darby's resignation followed the announcement of a pre-tax loss of Pounds
47.9m by NHL in 1991 after bad debt provisions of Pounds 88.7m.
'We are talking in advance over the next few days with the banks about
situations which may arise for the group,' an NHL spokesman said. He
declined to comment on suggestions that the Bank of England was
co-ordinating the latest moves to resolve NHL's problems.
However, he revealed that 10 banks, headed by Barclays, which organised a
Pounds 200m cash lifeboat for National Mortgage Bank last July, may provide
further cash if necessary.
NHL's core mortgage business operations have now been split from the bank
and if negotiations with the four banking syndicates are successful, the
group could continue as a mortgage administration company with a view to
eventually returning to the market as a lender. At present it is doing only
tiny amounts of mortgage lending.
Mr Hay Davison's task at National Mortgage Bank will be to preside over the
orderly disposal of its assets, including leasing assets and commercial
mortgages. The process could take several years to complete if buyers cannot
be found at acceptable prices.
Mr Milner became NHL chairman in February 1990 after a spectacular boardroom
coup ousted Mr Richard Lacy, NHL's founding chief executive. He received a
salary of Pounds 350,000 in 1991. The company confirmed that he had been
given a package of resignation benefits, but declined to give details.
NHL has sold about Pounds 3.5bn of residential mortgages, but most of these
have been sold off through securitisation and it has currently about Pounds
700m of mortgages on its books. A group spokesman said last night that NHL's
70,000 mortgage customers would not be affected by the company's problems.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Berisford calls for Pounds 14m to fund
coffee-trading associate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD International, the commodities and property group, is raising
Pounds 14m net of expenses through a rights issue of loan stock, which will
have warrants to buy shares. Berisford shares fell 5 1/2 p to 20p yesterday.
The proceeds will enable Berisford to provide finance to Rayner Coffee
International, its loss-making, 45 per cent-owned coffee trading associate.
Berisford guarantees up to Dollars 115m (Pounds 65.6m) of RCI's bank
borrowings.
The coffee market has been volatile since the collapse of the international
coffee agreement in mid-1989. Mr Alan Bowkett, who joined Berisford as chief
executive on January 29, said that since his appointment the coffee price
had fallen from Pounds 570 to Pounds 470 a tonne. He said: 'In a deregulated
market you have to have a wall of money to protect against the ups and
downs.'
Mr Bowkett said tackling RCI had been his first priority and he had made a
detailed review of the business already.
A second consideration in making the issue, Mr Bowkett said, was Berisford's
desire to restructure its banking arrangements ahead of its plans to rebuild
the company.
Berisford had been near bankruptcy in 1990 with bank exposure totalling
Pounds 1.4bn but sold assets to repay borrowings. At September 30 1991, its
last year-end, it had net cash of Pounds 18.6m. It now plans to expand
through acquisition in areas new to the group.
Berisford said that during the first quarter of its current financial year
it was close to breaking even, before taking a further Pounds 4.5m provision
against its UK properties. These are revalued on a quarterly basis.
The Pritzker family of the US, which owns 10.8 per cent of Berisford and has
two non-executive seats on the board, is underwriting Pounds 10m of the
issue of Pounds 14.8m gross of loan stock. Mr Bowkett, who bought 6m shares
at 19p each when he joined Berisford, and the other directors are taking up
their rights.
Shareholders will be entitled to buy Pounds 1 of the loan stock for every
33.53 shares held. The stock, carrying a 10 per cent coupon, will be
redeemed in 1995.
Every Pounds 100 of the stock will carry 1,000 warrants, each giving the
right to buy one new Berisford share at 10p until 2002. Full exercise of the
warrants would result in the issue of 148m new shares, increasing the share
capital by 29.8 per cent.
The Pritzker family could end up with a holding of about 24 per cent, if it
were to take up its full underwriting commitment and exercise all the
warrants.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: CE Heath cuts Australian holding to raise
Pounds 46m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CE HEATH, the insurance group, is planning a sharp reduction in its stake in
its Australian underwriting subsidiary, CE Heath International Holdings
(HIH), through a public offering of new shares to raise about ADollars 105m
(Pounds 46m).
Following the flotation, CE Heath's stake in the company will be diluted
from 90 per cent to about 45 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
Cash raised from the offering will be used to repay HIH's borrowings and
provide the Australian company with capital for expansion.
The decision follows last year's disposal by CE Heath of its Bermuda-based
financial reinsurance arm, Pinnacle Reinsurance. CE Heath said at the time
it planned to concentrate on its core broking business rather than
underwriting.
Ord Minnett Securities has been appointed by HIH as manager and underwriter.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: From ecstatic wheeler-dealing to static
management - Philip Ling, Haden MacLellan chairman and self-confessed crisis
addict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a branch of hunting called drag hunting. It is fast, furious and
contrived, rather like the deal-making of the 1980s.
It suits those who love to gallop and jump, but who hate hanging around and
have little interest in watching hounds work. It follows an artificial trail
and it is over in perhaps half the time of the traditional version.
Drag hunting is a favourite sport of Mr Philip Ling, chairman of Haden
MacLellan Holdings, the industrial holding company he brought to the market
in the midst of the October 1987 crash, too late to capitalise on the bull
market.
That was a pity because he thrives on the excitement of the deal. He was at
home in the acquisitive 1980s. His audacity peaked in 1986 with an
innovative, and highly leveraged, management buy-in bid which valued Simon
Engineering at Pounds 201m. It was a spectacular flop. But now, as then, he
is unashamedly uninterested in the day-to-day running of a business.
Last week Mr Ling, who is only 45, stepped back into a non-executive role at
Haden MacLellan, where the 40-odd subsidiaries make or supply products like
paint-spraying plant, iron bridges and vandal-proof toilets.
Since the company's last significant transaction a year ago - a
comparatively small Pounds 4m purchase in California - the deal-based work
has thinned out. His longstanding operating-manager colleagues were de facto
in the ascendancy, just as the age of the Roundheads replaced that of the
Cavaliers.
The story of his four years as executive head of a quoted company is full of
swings and contradictions. One incongruity is the attention Mr Ling proudly
draws to the recent centenary of MacLellan, used as a partial shell in 1987
to receive the private companies Haden and Haleworth. Last century, the sort
of Ling-engineered buy-in and buy-out deals that lie behind the modern HMH
had not been dreamed of and the group's short track-record remains one of
its Achilles' heels from the market's point of view.
In terms of profitability, the company's growth peaked in 1990 at Pounds
23.6m pre-tax, but is estimated to have fallen nearly 40 per cent to about
Pounds 14.5m last year. Although the business is diversified, it has not
proved to have much of a cushion against recessions in the UK and the US.
As for the share price, the October 1987 crash happened during the
suspension period for the 'double reverse takeover'. When trading started,
the price fell rapidly to less than half the 150p launch level.
Then a near-tenfold increase in pre-tax profit between 1987 and 1989 and Mr
Ling's whizzy acquisitive image sent up the share price from 67p to 257p in
less than two years. Some disappointments and the malaise affecting
conglomerates and small companies have since sunk it to less than 110p.
Yesterday's close was 111.5p.
Mr Ling, with 2.5 per cent of the equity, must know how all the other
shareholders feel about this reversal of fortune.
So is he another of the 1980s whizz kids who have gone phut, or is he a
victim of the bear market?
He might accept the latter definition. 'If we had known there was going to
be a bear market followed by a recession, we would not have gone public.
'Other industrial holding companies got going earlier in the 1980s. But it
might be a blessing in disguise because some of those exploded.'
To be fair, there is an important difference between HMH and the casualties
of the 1980s. Far from over-borrowing, it has emerged with enough cash in
hand to pay an 8p maintained dividend for 1991 (costing just over Pounds
7m). Earnings per share are expected to be 11p.
As for the flash, wheeler-dealer tag, he is vexed by it. While he is not
interested in running operating companies, he says he is interested in
creating good management teams and in establishing a culture in which they
can thrive.
He talks about the creative, humanist side of management - using words like
communication and participation. 'It doesn't matter who gets it right, so
long as someone does.'
He does not like the word 'ruthless' and seems pleased that HMH has not shut
a plant in the recession. He does not even have the customary missionary
zeal of holding company chairmen for driving forward earnings per share.
Ask about financial control from the centre and one of the nitty-gritty
directors, such as Mr Clive Mayhead or Mr Mel Hawley, newly created chief
executive, will answer. Mr Ling says there is no formula; they will rattle
off something that sounds like one. The trouble with HMH from his point of
view is that it has no big problems.
So where now for the Downside, Oxford and London Business School-educated Mr
Ling, whose business roots go back to the Jessel empire, Johnson &amp; Firth
Brown and restructuring private steel in the 1970s? He already has an
assortment of business interests outside HMH, including non-executive
directorships of quoted companies and private investments about which he is
rather coy.
It seems he would like his future career to resemble his sporting one. Less
than three weeks after having his knee crushed in a fall from his horse, he
plans to be dropped from a helicopter in the Canadian Rocky Mountains so
that he can ski down.
He likes to be seen as a 'crisis addict'. 'I'm very interested in companies
with big problems.'
In the current climate, though, his energies might have to be funnelled into
a financial rescue rather than a new venture.
At HMH, the hope is that his more down-to-earth colleagues will strike the
appropriate note for what they describe as the 'austere' and
'back-to-basics' 1990s.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cazenove replaced by Warburg as Steetley's
adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEETLEY, the building materials group fighting a hostile Pounds 626m bid
from its rival Redland, was yesterday shocked by the withdrawal of Cazenove
as its lead broker.
Mr David Donne, Steetley's chairman, has written to Mr Anthony Forbes,
senior partner of Cazenove, saying: 'I and my colleagues find it wholly
unacceptable that Cazenove should have placed the company in this position
at a crucial stage during a hostile bid.'
The rift came the day after Steetley had launched its most robust line of
defence so far against Redland. Steetley has replaced Cazenove with SG
Warburg as lead broker to the bid.
The disagreement follows the abandonment yesterday of a joint venture plan
that Steetley had propagated with Tarmac, but which was referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission during the week.
Mr Donne said in the letter that when the Redland bid was announced,
Cazenove confirmed that it was 'pleased to be able to act for Steetley in
relation to the bid from Redland, rather than withdrawing from both
companies due to a conflict of interest'. Cazenove is also broker to
Redland, but is not acting for it in the bid.
Mr Forbes said: 'Regrettably we don't agree with the version of events set
out.'
It was Cazenove's policy to stand down from both sides when two companies
for which it acted were involved in a bid. The exception was when 'we are
already acting for one of our companies and a third party intervenes, then
we continue with the first party until that particular business is
completed'. In this case, the Steetley-Tarmac joint venture pre-dated the
Redland bid.
Mr Donne complained that if Cazenove had said in December that its
willingness to act was dependent on the joint venture continuing, 'Steetley
would have appointed a different lead broker'.
Mr Forbes refused to say whether or not the policy had been spelt out to
Steetley at the time of the bid, but added that 'companies which have been
with us know this and every company is interested in how their advisers will
act in the event of a bid'.
The relationship between Steetley and Cazenove goes back more than 20 years.
In 1982 it helped Steetley to repel a bid from Hepworth.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Holmes' alarms deal with Sears Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLMES Protection, the US security company, has won a contract to install
residential alarm systems under a licensing agreement with Sears Roebuck,
the US retailer.
The deal, worth Dollars 8m over three years, licenses Holmes to operate
through Sears in New York and Long Island, and allow it to move into the
mass security market for the first time.
Mr Eric Kohn, the vice chairman of Holmes who put together a new management
team last year at the debt-laden group, said it was still on course for a
new share issue by the end of April.
The issue would refinance Dollars 38m of debt left after a restructuring
that had written off about half the Dollars 69m debt.
Holmes supplies security systems to banks and businesses in and around New
York and has a franchising operation in 48 locations throughout the US.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Loss deepens at Eng &amp; Overseas Prop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than doubled exceptional provisions against the fall in property values
led to a sharp increase in losses at English &amp; Overseas Properties in 1991.
Pre-tax losses leapt to Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 134,000) after exceptional
costs of Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 1.1m). Turnover declined to Pounds 1.03m
(Pounds 1.72m).
Operating losses were, however, reduced to Pounds 92,000 (Pounds 417,000).
Some Pounds 31,000 of losses came from associated companies (profits Pounds
879,000) and interest receivable fell to Pounds 289,000 (Pounds 499,000).
The company is proposing to maintain the final dividend at 0.5p for a total
of 1p (2.5p). Losses per share worked through at 14.24p (5.51p).
The summer rights issue raised Pounds 4.95m on a 3-for-1 basis and ensured
the company had enough cash 'to meet its obligations'.

<TEXT>
The recession has continued to hit USM-quoted BBB Design Group, resulting in
pre-tax losses up from Pounds 56,000 to Pounds 189,000 for the half-year to
October 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 836,000.
For the first time, the company's design, publishing and marketing
activities failed to make a profits contribution, with turnover falling by
39 per cent.
After tax credits of Pounds 42,000 (Pounds 19,000), net losses were Pounds
147,000 (Pounds 37,000) or 1.77p (0.45p) per share. Again no interim
dividend is declared.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cranbrook loses Pounds 3m of orders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cranbrook Electronic Holdings was unable to make many inroads into its
losses in the year ended September 30. They amounted to Pounds 653,000,
after reorganisation costs of Pounds 197,000, against Pounds 696,000.
The group, a USM-traded distributor of high technology electronic components
and sub-systems, saw its turnover drop Pounds 3.08m to Pounds 7.41m as
principal customers cut production and reduced their stocks.
Some important suppliers were not prepared to respond to aggressive pricing.
That, said Mr Tony Diamond, chairman, resulted in a loss of at least Pounds
3m of orders, which he was sure the group would have continued to enjoy if
competitive pricing had been available to it.
Losses per share were again 6.61p. No dividend is recommended; the last
payment was an 0.5p interim in 1988-89.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: F Usher advances to Pounds 0.59m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANK USHER, the USM-quoted textile and clothing group, stemmed the downturn
in profitability in the six months to November 30 and is restoring its
interim dividend to 2p.
The improved profitability was partly the result of tighter control of
overheads and stocks. Turnover fell to Pounds 7.61m (Pounds 8.19m) but the
pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 585,000. That compared with Pounds 505,000
last time and with Pounds 270,000 in the preceding six months.
Based on orders for the spring/summer 1992 collections, Mr Christopher
Norland, chairman, said he looked forward to a return in the second half to
levels of profitability experienced prior to last year's downturn in profits
 -from Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 775,000.
That was seen as 'a considerable achievement against the background of the
clothing industry' and justified restoring the interim dividend to 2p, after
last year's cut to 1.5p. Earnings per share were 5.7p (4.7p).

FT  22 FEB 92 / Letter: Local politics needs paid professional councillors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANNE PAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your welcome editorial today in defence of local politics (February 20)
calls for councils to be 'more representative'. You suggest that the
government's antipathy has made local government unattractive (as a
political activity) to men and women of ability.
Indeed, it is in fact a miracle that so many able and talented councillors
still function, and in many cases highly effectively.
Not only have they to deal with an unceasing stream of new legislation,
multi-million pound budgets, vast personnel/employer responsibilities,
constituents' multiple needs and party political business; but they do it
all in their spare time and for no remuneration.
The work is intellectually and emotionally taxing. Research shows that the
country's 27,000 councillors average some 20 hours a week each on public
service, but very few can claim as much as Pounds 1,000 a year in expenses.
It is hardly surprising that they are unrepresentative. They tend to be
white and male, and older than the populations they represent. A broader
group of citizens refrains from standing for election - all political
parties express difficulty in finding sufficient candidates, let alone able
ones.
Proportional representation will not deal with this issue; and until we
recognise that consistently high quality local and regional government
requires radical political change involving paid professional councillors,
(as well as concerted consideration of finance, function and structure) we
must continue to depend on those public-spirited and generous enough to
offer themselves - even if you find them sometimes capricious and
dictatorial.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Fine line between risk and reward: The slowdown in the
global economy contrasts sharply with the performance of leading financial
markets. FT writers examine the opportunities and threats confronting
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, MARTIN DICKSON, PATRICK HARVERSON, STEFAN WAGSTYL,
QUENTIN PEEL and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world economy is steeped in gloom and yet investors on Wall Street, in
Frankfurt and in Paris are making hay.
Over the past few months, the world's leading economies have converged
towards low inflation and low or no growth. At the same time, financial
markets, most notably the globe's leading equity markets, are moving
increasingly out of synchronisation with economic developments and each
other.
In a world of free-flowing capital markets, investors have, therefore, to
decide whether this divergence between fundamental economic performance and
financial market trends is an opportunity or a threat. If, as seems likely,
the industrialised world is moving into a decade of slow growth after the
debt-financed excesses of the late 1980s, individuals and institutions alike
have to weigh carefully the choice among equities, bonds and cash.
As the panel of pundits below makes clear, recent stock market trends point
to a strong groundswell of optimism in centres as diverse as New York,
Frankfurt and Paris. Even in Tokyo, where the mood among investors has been
one of almost unrelieved gloom as the economy weakens, there is a widely
held view that share prices are due for recovery in the spring.
However, there are some warning voices, including that of Mr Roland
Leuschel, chief investment strategist of Banque Bruxelles Lambert in
Brussels. Mr Leuschel, who was one of the first to forecast recession in the
US and Britain and the current slowdown in Japan and Germany, says: 'We have
never been so near to a world economic crisis as now.' He believes that Mr
Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve chairman, is 'walking on a razor's
edge'. US share prices could come crashing down if the economy does not pick
up. Alternatively, the Fed's present low interest rate policy could fuel
inflation, weakening the bond market, and eventually undermining equities.
Certainly, there has been no shortage of grim economic news over the past
week. Britain's recession is officially recognised as the longest since the
Second World War. In Germany, gross national product has fallen for three
successive quarters. Japan's Economic Planning Agency now considers the
economy in recession although the bad news in Tokyo amounts to no more than
a hiccup in US or European terms. Although Mr Greenspan predicted this week
that there would be an early US recovery, the voters in Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary left Washington and the world in no doubt about their
disenchantment with the US recession.
And yet just as the citizens of the New England state were giving President
George Bush a bloody nose, the equity markets in New York, a few hours'
drive to the south, were gathering strength for another upwards move. On
Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped its previous historical
peak to close at a record 3,280.64, up more than 50 points on the day.
Other equity markets have also ignored bad news. German shares have gained
nearly 9 per cent in the past six weeks. Yesterday they registered their
highest closing level for 18 months when the 30-share DAX index reached
1,717.63 points. Shares in France have also surged ahead to levels last seen
before the Gulf crisis began in August 1990. The CAC 40 index closed at
1,962.37 yesterday, 12 per cent higher than its level at the start of this
year. In the Netherlands, too, shares have been rising to their highest
levels for two years.
Britain is something of a special case. In recent weeks, the FT-SE 100 index
has fluctuated between 2,500 and 2,560 points, well below last September's
high of 2,679.6. Analysts see little hope of a clear trend until after the
election, generally expected on April 9. Hopes of an eventual economic
recovery are having to do battle with pre-election uncertainty,
disappointment about continued high interest rates and declining earnings.
Of the main markets only Tokyo has signally failed to catch the party mood.
There the Nikkei index is trading close to its lowest levels since the
collapse of the bull market of the 1980s. There are few sellers at these
depressed prices, even fewer buyers.
A review of leading markets suggests that investors' fortunes over the rest
of this year will largely depend on whether Wall Street is properly valued
or heading for a fall, and on whether Tokyo can pull out of its slough of
despond.
The remarkable surge which took the Dow Jones Industrial Average from less
than 2,900 in mid-December to more than 3,250 by mid-January has plateaued
somewhat over the past month.
Pessimists reckon the market could suffer a substantial correction, but the
optimists, in the majority on Wall Street, believe prices are far more
likely to advance during the rest of 1992 - the only question being by how
much.
The key factor spurring the turn-of-year rally was the Federal Reserve's
action on December 20 in cutting the discount rate by a full point to 3.5
per cent, and pushing the Fed funds rate down from 4.5 per cent to 4 per
cent.
This convinced the equity markets that the Fed would pull whatever monetary
strings necessary to get the economy moving. It also prompted investors to
move funds out of fixed income securities, money market funds and bank CDs,
with their increasingly unattractive returns, and into equities, which held
out the possibility of greater capital accumulation, albeit with a greater
element of risk.
The latest batch of economic indicators is cautiously encouraging: sales of
US cars rose sharply in early February, housing starts jumped 5.5. per cent
in January, and the annual rate of consumer price inflation fell to 2.6 per
cent in January. But even the most optimistic economists acknowledge that
any recovery will be much less powerful than in the past, given the heavy
debt burden hanging over corporate America and consumers.
The big question is whether the US market has become disjointed from
economic reality. The answer is 'probably not', if you accept the consensus
view that:
the economy is now entering a slow, but probably sustainable, recovery;
the US can sustain this growth even if continental Europe and Japan falter
and;
the dollar is likely to strengthen, encouraging foreigners who anticipate
this to invest more aggressively in American assets.
Equities pessimists have made much of the fact that US equity prices for the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index now stand at around 24 times past earnings, high
by historic averages.
However, optimists point out that this is indeed history and the market
should be focusing much more on prospective corporate earnings for 1992,
which are expected to show solid growth and which should be adjusted to
eliminate one-time write-offs. On this basis many analysts expect the
price/earnings ratio to drop to about 16. According to strategists at
Goldman Sachs this is roughly in line with past levels at times of low
inflation. According to optimists, there could also be scope for a further
substantial rise in the Dow over the next nine months if profits keep
recovering into 1993.
If there is any fault-line in world financial markets, it is between Japan
and the other main equity centres.
The reasons for Tokyo's deep gloom are not hard to find. The economy is
getting weaker by the day, with bad economic news and some shocking
corporate announcements competing for space in newspapers.
Private sector economists expect the economy will slow from a growth rate of
about 3.5 per cent in the year to March 1992 to 2.5 to 3 per cent over the
next 12 months: not a recession, but enough to bite deep into profits.
Nomura Research Institute expects pre-tax profits of 400 top companies to
fall 12 per cent in the current year and a further 2 per cent next year -
the first declines since 1986.
Individual sectors will suffer more. Financial companies are being burdened
by the mountain of bad debt left behind by the plunge in stock and property
prices. Capital equipment makers are seeing sales and margins collapse in
the face of the first expected downturn in capital spending in 15 years.
Many investors recognise that the slowdown should eventually sow the seeds
of a recovery as the authorities cut interest rates further to stimulate
growth. But the timing of a stock market resurgence is uncertain.
Japanese individuals are unlikely to rush into the market. They are avoiding
stockbrokers like the plague, blaming them for both the bear market and for
their involvement in last year's securities industry scandals. Foreigners
are also not expected to commit big new money until Japanese investors start
buying. 'They're saying to the domestic fund managers, 'Now it's your turn,'
' says Mr Stephen Barber, president of Invesco MIM Investment Trust, a
subsidiary of the UK fund management group.
A widely held view is that prices will recover hesitantly in the spring,
perhaps taking the Nikkei index from its current level of 21,291 to 25,000
by mid-year. However, even some bulls acknowledge the Nikkei could fall
below the psychologically important level of 21,000.
Confidence in the markets could then evaporate, not least because leading
Japanese banks, which depend on their stock portfolios to bolster their
capital reserves, would no longer meet minimum standards of capital adequacy
which the Bank for International Settlements is to introduce next year.
Germany, the other former growth locomotive in the world economy, is also
running out of steam. But hopes of higher profits are underpinning the rise
in Frankfurt equities. Forecasts for the current year suggest the DAX index
could push up to between 1,800 and 2,000, reflecting expectations of a 1993
earnings recovery for the main German blue chip financial and industrial
shares, after a sluggish, if not stagnant, year in 1992.
The rise has also been boosted by expectations that the Bundesbank will cut
its present high interest rates later in the year, as inflation falls back
to 3 per cent, and the present tense wage round is past.
The Bundesbank's tough monetary policy may be seen as strict outside
Germany. But in Frankfurt markets, it is considered reassuringly firm: a
reminder that the central bank is absolutely committed to monetary
stability, low inflation, and a strong D-Mark.
In France, the economy has also slowed while the political outlook has
become increasingly uncertain as the popularity of the Socialist government
has slumped.
However, France's stock markets have benefited from the trickle of good news
from the US and from a string of reassuring announcements from French
companies that suggest 1992 is certain to be better than the lacklustre
market in 1991.
The Paris market has also been boosted by the recent surge of corporate
activity in France, notably the FFr13.42bn battle over the ownership of
Perrier mineral water between Nestle of Switzerland and the Agnellis of
Italy. This has helped to allay France's fears of Paris being marginalised
in the international arena.
But although equity markets outside Japan appear buoyant, there is plenty of
scope for upset in the global economy.
In the US, there is room for doubt about interest rate trends. Short-term
interest rates may now be near, or at, their cyclical low and any tightening
of monetary policy could cause financial markets to dip. Political fall-out
from this year's presidential election could also hit share prices. Wall
Street would not welcome the prospect of a Democratic president and would be
concerned at any pre-election economic package which boosted the budget
deficit.
In Germany, some correction in the upward move of share prices is likely.
First-quarter sales and earnings figures are expected to be bad. Tough wage
negotiations loom on all fronts. The government's budget deficit problems
look ever more intractable.
The broader international arena is also full of tensions and rivalries. The
US and Japan have already fallen out over trade. The erstwhile communist
states of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are caught in a
desperate struggle to survive in the capitalist world, and could yet be the
source of a major economic or political shock to industrialised west. The
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks are threatened with collapse.
That would undermine the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (Gatt), an
important guarantor of prosperity in the postwar world.
Although most equity investors have fared well so far this year, the Chinese
curse of 'May you live in interesting times' was never truer.

FT  22 FEB 92 / BCCI: Demise sealed by a deal of sense and sensitivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S not a cover-up or anything like that,' says Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche
Ross partner overseeing the worldwide winding-up of BCCI. 'This is meant to
make peace with the United Arab Emirates.'
Mr Smouha is sensitive to accusations of cover-up. He has just hammered out
a deal under which BCCI's majority shareholders in Abu Dhabi, part of the
UAE, will pay up to Dollars 2.2bn to the bank's creditors. But the structure
of the deal, and the lack of transparency as to how it has been negotiated,
are prompting criticism.
Both Mr Smouha and the Abu Dhabi camp claim that the deal is a generous one
for creditors - though from information published so far, it is impossible
to tell. It involves the bank's liquidators and majority shareholders giving
up claims and counter-claims against each other, in return for which Abu
Dhabi will pay Dollars 1.7bn to creditors (an amount that could rise or fall
by as much as Dollars 500m, depending on what eventual liabilities of the
bank are determined to be).
Weighing up the claims and counter-claims is not easy. The liquidators, led
by Mr Smouha, have agreed to give up their claims under Dollars 3.06bn of
promissory notes issued by Abu Dhabi. The notes were given at the time of a
proposed restructuring of the bank a year ago, so a legal question remains
as to whether Abu Dhabi remains liable given that the restructuring was not
completed. Also, the notes would have been payable over a seven-year period,
reducing their present value.
Abu Dhabi was also potentially liable for about Dollars 1bn of guarantees
given to the bank.
There are various unquantifiable further claims that could be made against
Abu Dhabi. One of its representatives was a BCCI board member and has been
identified by Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, as someone who was
aware of the frauds at the bank before they became known to regulators and
auditors. In return for accepting the deal, depositors will be asked to sign
away rights 'against the majority shareholders of BCCI and certain related
persons'.
Potential claims the other way - against the bank by the majority
shareholders - are equally difficult to establish with any certainty. Abu
Dhabi has agreed to take on the UAE branches of the banks, which are
estimated to have gross liabilities of about Dollars 1.5bn. Assets in these
branches, which will also be taken on by Abu Dhabi, are estimated to amount
to 10 per cent to 15 per cent of liabilities. This is about the same
proportion as in the rest of the group. The result: stripping out the UAE
branches has no overall effect on creditors.
However, once it assumes responsibility for the UAE, Abu Dhabi will actually
have a Dollars 700m claim against the rest of the bank, allowing it to claim
as a creditor and share in its own compensation fund.
Abu Dhabi has also said it will give up rights over about Dollars 2bn of
funds which were held under management by the bank and were misappropriated
by its directors. As one of these directors was an Abu Dhabi representative,
it could have been difficult to recover this money through legal means.
Even the Dollars 1.7bn or so is not being paid immediately, but over a
period up to June 1994: that reduces its present value.
If the deal is concluded, the Abu Dhabi payments are likely to account for
the bulk of the money creditors can hope to get back. Mr Smouha said he
expected to realise Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn from the bank's assets. Any
realisations over Dollars 2.5bn would be divided equally with Abu Dhabi. The
compensation deal with Abu Dhabi affects only creditors of the group's
Luxembourg-based holding company, BCCI Holdings, and its two main operating
arms, BCCI (Overseas) and BCCI SA. Creditors of other parts of the group,
owed about Dollars 5.5bn between them, will receive only what local
liquidators can recover.
In many cases this will be substantial: creditors in Hong Kong were told
this week they would get back 70 per cent to 75 per cent of their money.
These entities were separately incorporated and regulated and so largely
untouched by frauds in the core parts of the bank.

FT  22 FEB 92 / BCCI: Creditors may be paid up to Dollars 2.2bn - BCCI's
liquidators offer compensation designed to 'make peace' with the UAE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL for compensation has finally been agreed between the liquidators of
Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its Abu Dhabi majority
shareholders which could lead to the payment of as much as Dollars 2.2bn to
creditors.
The deal is dependent on agreement from creditors owed 70 per cent of the
bank's Dollars 10bn liabilities, and will need court approval in England,
Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Mr Brian Smouha, one of the bank's
liquidators, said yesterday that getting enough people to agree to such an
offer was likely to prove difficult. Also, many creditors are unlikely to
come forward given the large amount of 'black' money in the bank linked to
tax avoidance, drug smuggling and terrorism.
Majority shareholders from Abu Dhabi will pay a flat Dollars 1.7bn in
compensation. The figure could rise to as much as Dollars 2.2bn if claims
exceed Dollars 10bn, or fall to as little as Dollars 1.2bn if they are less
than Dollars 10bn.
In return, the majority shareholders and the liquidators have agreed to drop
claims and counter-claims. Creditors will have to sign over all legal rights
before they can benefit.
Mr Smouha said it was 'likely' that the liquidators and majority
shareholders would sue advisers to the bank, though he refused to name them.
'We will sue wherever we're most likely to recover money,' he said. The two
sides have agreed to co-operate on legal actions, and divide any money they
recover equally.
The BCCI depositors' association warned creditors yesterday not to accept
the offer until it had been studied in more detail.
'We are not very happy,' said Mr Mourad Fleming of Richards Butler, a lawyer
acting for the association. 'Creditors are being asked to give up very
considerable rights. But we can't possibly say yet (whether the terms are
attractive).'
Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East who has campaigned on behalf
of depositors, welcomed the 'generosity of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi'.
However, he added that a meeting of creditors should be called to allow them
to question the liquidators directly about the proposed deal.

FT  22 FEB 92 / BCCI: A 'market' rate of Pounds 127 an hour and Concorde
flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CALM face of Mr Brian Smouha tensed just slightly yesterday at the
mention of the fees Touche Ross has charged for its liquidation work on
BCCI.
When Touche revealed at a court hearing in January that the bills had
reached Pounds 75m, it provoked a storm of indignant criticism. Only after
the announcement of the settlement was the firm willing to say anything
more.
Yesterday it made up for the silence by releasing a great deal of detail,
including a three-page document showing Mr Smouha's daily itinerary from
July 5 last year to February 11 this year. He readily admitted that he had
flown by Concorde during the course of his work. His schedule shows journeys
in quick succession between London, the US, Luxembourg and the Gulf.
'It was a question of survival,' he said. 'I was trying to be in more than
one place at the same time, and in a state to do the work. It's not easy
trying to organise something with meetings in New York, the Caymans, Abu
Dhabi.'
He also agreed that his staff based in Abu Dhabi had flown to holiday
destinations periodically, and one man had flown back to the UK to visit his
pregnant wife.
'Most people in Abu Dhabi were working 12-hour days, six days a week,' he
said. 'You need to keep people performing at the highest level they can.'
Without holidays, he said, 'you start getting a very poor product very
quickly'.
At current exchange rates, bills for the liquidation until January 6 shown
to the Financial Times amount to Pounds 77.4m. That includes legal fees of
Pounds 12.8m, VAT of Pounds 4.8m and agents and security charges of Pounds
3.5m. Wages of BCCI employees, rent and other expenses came to Pounds 16.6m.
However, Pounds 39.7m or 51 per cent of the total is for work conducted by
Touche, which at the peak had 330 UK staff working on BCCI. It says it had
charged 281,062 hours in the UK on the worldwide liquidation by January 15
at an average rate of Pounds 127 per hour, which amounts to Pounds 35.7m.
The rest appears to be expenses or overseas fees.
'We used what I think are the market, commercial rates,' said Mr Smouha. 'We
used the best quality of people and not just anyone who was available.'
He said he was trying to reduce the hours charged on BCCI work as fast as
possible and hoped soon to cut the number of staff substantially. But he
said work to date had required a great deal of staff time dealing with
thousands of creditors and depositors and continuing to run the bank.
Mr Smouha said that the court had provisionally approved the fees charged.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Dobson warns generators on coal imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday warned electricity generators that investments in port
facilities to import cheap foreign coal would become 'white elephants' under
a Labour government.
Mr Frank Dobson, the party's energy spokesman, said he was confident that
the European Commission would allow a Labour government to block imports of
cheap foreign coal.
He said the party was determined that PowerGen and National Power, the
electricity generators, would follow such policies.
Mr Dobson was responding to a letter from Sir Graham Day, PowerGen chairman,
requesting further information on how Labour planned to make sure the
generators followed an energy policy.
He said earlier this week that Labour could use the state's 40 per cent
shareholding in National Power and PowerGen to appoint directors.
Sir Graham pointed out in the letter that the government had no special
powers to appoint directors, and that any directors it elected using its
shareholding would be legally bound to protect the interests of all
shareholders.
The clash, the first direct conflict between Labour and the management of
one of the privatised generators, could set the scene for a trial of
strength over energy policy if Labour wins the election.
However, party officials played down the significance of Mr Dobson's
remarks. The main thrust of the party's approach would be to strengthen the
role of independent regulators, they said.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, attacked Mr Dobson's remarks
about appointing directors and launched a campaign directed at Labour's
nationalisation plans. Mr Lilley charged that a Kinnock government would
extend public ownership of the recently privatised industries well beyond
the water companies and the national grid.
Arguing that the proposals would hit shareholders, taxpayers and the
consumer, he claimed Labour was 'the only major political party in the
world' advocating an extension of public ownership.
The charges were greeted with derision by Labour officials, who underlined
that the party's only commitments were confined to taking control of water
and the national grid only when resources allowed. 'They are making them to
distract attention from the problems of the recession and the grave worries
people have about public services,' Labour said.

FT  22 FEB 92 / A small band voices support for change: Constitutional views
in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK several Scottish businessmen did what the Conservative party has
been urging them to do for years - they stood up to be counted on the issue
of Scotland's constitutional future.
Unfortunately, what they said was not what the Tory party wanted to hear.
Nine men who run small and medium-sized businesses launched an organisation
called Scotland Says Yes and said they were 'sick and tired' of the
government implying that all Scottish business was totally opposed to the
setting up of a Scottish parliament.
They said they and many others were eagerly awaiting the creation of such an
institution.
In the past few weeks several of Scotland's leading businesspeople have
indeed declared their opposition both to a devolved Scottish parliament and
to independence.
This week the big institutions in the financial community expressed -
through a survey by Scottish Financial Enterprise, their trade association -
strong misgivings about devolution.
They feared higher taxes, and a drift towards independence which would
frighten their English customers.
But on Thursday the Scottish council of the Confederation of British
Industry met at Stirling Castle and produced little comfort for the Tories.
Mr Alasdair MacCallum, its chairman, said it strongly disliked aspects of a
devolved Scottish parliament, notably higher taxes, and detested
independence, but it had concluded that 'some change is inevitable and, many
people believe, desirable'.
Mr Nigel Smith, one of the founders of Business Says Yes, runs an
engineering company in Glasgow employing 35 people. He said he voted
Conservative in most general elections. He believed a Scottish parliament
would be very good for Scottish business.
'Britain is highly centralised. Even though we've got a lot of
administrative devolution to the Scottish Office in Edinburgh, policy is
decided in London. To influence it we've got to go through the London
lobbying structure, which is very difficult for a small business based in
Scotland.
'Now if we had a Scottish parliament, policy would be decided in Edinburgh.'
Furthermore, Mr Smith argues, the creation of a Scottish parliament would
end what he calls the 'disenfranchisement' of much of the Scottish business
community. 'If I say something in favour of free enterprise, I'm
automatically identified with the Conservative party and that means being
identified with England. I'm immediately struck out as a serious
contributor.'
In a Scottish parliament, elected by proportional representation, he said,
there would inevitably be a right-of-centre party with Scottish roots which
would present the business point of view.
Proportional representation would curb the excesses of left and right, Mr
Smith said, and far from imposing higher taxes, as the Tories claim, it
might lower them to stimulate business and generate extra revenue.
Large Scottish businesses, however, especially Scotland's quoted companies,
tend to favour the constitutional status quo - though few have declared
themselves. The people who run them often consider themselves part of the
British establishment and have lobbying channels through contacts in London
and in the City.
The contorted response of the Scottish CBI, which failed to say what
constitutional arrangements it actually wanted, might reflect divisions
between larger and smaller companies.
But it also highlighted the lack of communication between the business
community and the advocates of constitutional change.
Mr MacCallum, the chairman, admitted: 'We've come into the debate a little
late. That is regrettable.'
The Scottish Constitutional Convention, which has been working on a
blueprint for a Scottish parliament since 1989, is dominated by Labour and
the Liberal Democrats, having been boycotted by the Tory party and the
Scottish National party. The CBI chose not to participate, although the
Scottish Council Development and Industry, which also represents business,
attended as an observer.
Mr Smith said: 'Business was very wrong not to enter the convention.' One
result, he said, was that the convention's blueprint included 'baggage from
the 1970s', such as the possibility of nationalisation, which might
otherwise have been vetoed.
For their part the supporters of devolution do not appear to have made much
effort to persuade large companies and financial institutions of the
possible benefits of a Scottish parliament.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, has not been on a prawn cocktail
offensive around Charlotte Square, Edinburgh.
Indeed, when Scottish Financial Enterprise this week reported the fears of
the 25 financial institutions which account for 80 per cent of the employees
of the Scottish financial sector and 80 per cent of its funds under
management, Mr Dewar simply derided the response to the survey as 'tiny'. He
did not offer them any reassurance.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Tory MPs thwarted over EC poll move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS MARGARET Thatcher, the former prime minister, joined Conservative
Euro-sceptics in the Commons yesterday in an attempt to reopen issues raised
by the Maastricht Treaty.
They failed to force a vote on a bill to secure a referendum on the treaty's
provisions for European political union.
A procedural manoeuvre, encouraged by government whips, resulted in the
debate being adjourned, effectively killing the Referendum Bill.
Mrs Thatcher favours a referendum in the event of the main political parties
agreeing that sterling should be abandoned in favour of a single European
currency.
The efforts by the whips to prevent a widening of divisions in Conservative
ranks over the European Community were reflected in a speech last night by
Mr Jonathan Aitken, MP for South Thanet. Acknowledging his role as a
'leading Euro-sceptic', he told a constituency meeting that he supported the
'negotiating success' of Mr John Major at Maastricht.
Mr Aitken is chairman of the policy committee of a group of backbench
Euro-sceptics which yesterday issued a statement opposing Britain's
involvement in a single European currency. The group warned such a currency
could lead to the payment of 'massive subsidies' to most other member
states.
The statement also advocated Britain's withdrawal from the European Monetary
System - a step opposed by Mr Aitken in his speech. Mr Peter Lilley, trade
and industry secretary, said yesterday Europe was 80 per cent of the way to
a single market.
Of the 282 measures drawn up seven years ago, 235 had been agreed by the EC
and the rest were scheduled for completion by the beginning of next year,
when the single market began. Britain takes the EC presidency for six months
from July. Mr Lilley said the main task was to finish the process.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Marketing rules for accountants are eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES may have to prepare for a bombardment from accountants after
yesterday's easing of the rules governing their use of aggressive marketing
techniques.
Chartered accountants offering to sell any service except financial
reporting work to non-clients will now be able to make unsolicited visits or
telephone calls.
They will also be able to charge contingency fees based on a proportion of
the income generated for a client, in work such as corporate finance work or
tax advice. Audit and related services are excluded from the liberalisation,
but cold-calling will be acceptable for work including tax and management
consultancy.
The revelations come in the latest professional ethics guide issued by the
joint ethics committee of institutes of chartered accountants in England,
Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
The guidelines offer tightening of regulations in other areas. They frown on
the recruitment services offered by many accountancy firms to help audit
clients find senior financial and administrative staff. They warn that the
final decision on any selection must be made by the client.
No firm should allow the fees from a quoted company or group of companies to
exceed 10 per cent of its income. Once the figure rises above 5 per cent,
there should be an independent review to ensure there is no threat to the
firm's independence. Firms should also seriously consider resigning as
auditor if there is litigation with its clients.
No partner or individual closely connected with the partner should hold
shares or other beneficial interests in a client. That includes personal
equity plans.
The guide recommends that firms should consider rotating partners and other
senior staff involved with particular clients to provide safeguards against
a loss of independence.
Recommendations on three of the topics for which accountants have received
strongest criticism in recent months - insolvency work, discounting on fee
income and valuation of brands - are still being drafted and will not appear
at least until summer.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Lloyd's Names win freeze on cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Lloyd's Names yesterday won a partial victory in their attempts
to prevent the insurance market's authorities drawing on their deposits to
meet the terms of cash calls.
Lloyd's says the money is needed to pay insurance claims. But following
talks between solicitors representing the Names, agents and Lloyd's, a High
Court judge agreed to freeze the eight Names' funds until a full court
hearing takes place. This is expected in March or April.
The Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting on the market - claim
that the terms of their agreements with agents have been breached by the
cash calls, which they allege are technically flawed and legally improper.
They had issued motions seeking injunctions against Lloyd's to prevent the
insurance market drawing from the deposits that all Names must lodge with
their agents when they join Lloyd's.
Hearings on the injunctions had been expected next week but the case was
complicated by the decision of Lloyd's itself to apply to join the
litigation as a defendant. It is determined to resist the injunctions and
said yesterday that it would fight 'inch by inch and uphill if necessary'.
The eight are part of a group of more than 600 Names taking action.
According to Mr Michael Freeman, their solicitor, other Names who are now
simply providing financial backing for what were intended to be test cases
are likely to issue their own separate motions seeking injunctions.
The Names were members of loss-making catastrophe reinsurance syndicates
which suffered losses of more than Pounds 500m between 1988 and 1990.

FT  22 FEB 92 / CBI issues code for prompt bill payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CODE of prompt payment practice, seeking a commitment from all companies
to pay bills on time, was launched yesterday by the Confederation of British
Industry.
The code, Prompt Payers - in good Company, advises on steps a company should
take to ensure it pays its bills on time. It is being sent to all CBI
members with a letter from Sir Brian Corby, CBI president.
Introducing the code, Sir Brian said: 'Cashflow is the lifeblood of
business. Late payment can damage business relationships and endanger the
very survival of a company. While to some, paying bills after the due date
may appear a simple means of easing financial pressures,it is in fact a
clear breach of contract.
'It is also short-sighted and can be in no one's interest if an otherwise
sound and valued supplier goes to the wall because bills are not paid on
time.'
The code says a reasonable company should:
Have a clear, consistent policy to pay bills in accordance with contract.
Ensure that the finance and purchasing departments are aware of this policy
and adhere to it.
Agree payment terms at the outset of a deal and stick to them.
Promise not to extend or alter payment terms without prior agreement.
Ensure that there is a system for dealing quickly with complaints and
disputes, and advise suppliers without delay when invoices, or parts of
invoices, are con-tested.
The code has been published following a joint survey at the start of 1991
conducted by the CBI and Cork Gully, the insolvency division of Coopers
Lybrand Deloitte, which showed that late payment of bills was endangering
the survival of one in five small businesses.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Woolwich launches two rescue plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLWICH, the third largest building society, has launched two mortgage
rescue schemes at a cost of Pounds 60m to save from eviction borrowers who
are seriously behind with their payments.
The schemes are part of moves by lenders to help stem a flood of mortgage
repossessions - expected to reach 80,000 this year  - and follow talks
between lenders and the government just before Christmas, in which Pounds
800m was pledged for the schemes.
Woolwich's first rescue scheme is aimed at families whose incomes have
fallen since they bought their homes but who are not eligible for social
security income support and so cannot make normal payments on their
mortgages.
Three housing associations, London &amp; Quadrant, Circle 33 and Metropolitan
Housing, will buy the homes from their occupants at the current open market
valuation, allowing their former owners to remain as tenants.
Woolwich yesterday declined to comment on the interest rate which the
housing associations will pay it for the funding but it is understood to be
between 3.5 per cent and 5 per cent.
Under a second scheme the occupants will remain owners but will be charged
interest at rates below the market level in return for Woolwich becoming a
part owner of the house.
The society will own the stake in the house until it is sold or the equity
share is repaid.
Most of the families affected are in London and the south-east. The Pounds
60m will enable Woolwich to rescue between 600 and 800 households from
eviction.

THE High Court yesterday ordered the relabelling of Stone's Original Pale
Cream, a drink launched in Tesco stores late last year.
Spain's sherry producers complained that the drink's label, which described
it as 'a select blend of premium British sherry and fine fortified wines
from Spain' had been deliberately designed to confuse consumers.
They were granted a temporary injunction against the drink's producer,
Matthew Clark and Sons, of Leeds, which also makes Stone's Original Green
Ginger Wine. The company denied any attempt to cash in on the sherry name,
arguing that the label merely described its contents.

A BILL to create a new legislative framework for friendly societies was
published by the government yesterday. It would enable the societies to
provide a wider range of services and allow them to compete on more equal
terms with other financial institutions.
It would establish a new regulatory framework including a Friendly Societies
Commission. Societies would also be brought within the scope of the
Policyholders Protection Act 1975, the investor-protection scheme covering
insurance policyholders.

FT  22 FEB 92 / More aid sought for Welsh coal areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to seek further aid from the European Commission for the
depressed coal-mining areas of Wales. This is on top of the Pounds 17.8m
released by Brussels earlier this week, Anthony Moreton writes.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, met Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner for
regional policy, on Thursday in Brussels when it was indicated that an
application for a further Pounds 10m would be 'looked on favourably'. Mr
Hunt said qualifying projects had been drawn up by the Welsh Office. 'We
have a long list of schemes ready to be put into Brussels as soon as we get
the nod.'
The government backed down on Monday from its previous stance that European
regional aid should go to the Treasury to help finance schemes already
authorised in Britain.
Mr Millan had refused to release Pounds 120m to Britain for more than 50
projects unless he received an assurance that European finance would be used
in addition to anything the government might spend.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Jaguar to shed a further 650 workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, Ford's luxury cars subsidiary, is seeking to shed a further 650 jobs
this year, reducing its total UK workforce to about 7,400.
The move comes against the background of heavy financial losses at Jaguar
and a continuing slump in luxury car markets. It is on top of 4,000 job
losses at the company last year.
A Jaguar spokesman said last night the company hoped to achieve most if not
all of this year's reduction through an early retirement scheme, with the
age threshold for eligibility reduced from 60 to 55.
Negotiations on this scheme are being held with unions, which are not
expected to launch any large campaign against further cuts.
The latest cuts prompted Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU
engineering union, to warn that the motor industry 'can't take much more of
this depression and this government's mismanagement of the economy'.
Estimates from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show a total
of 70,000 motor-industry jobs lost, or likely to be lost, by the middle of
this year since the start of the recession.
Jaguar is believed to want to achieve the reductions as quickly as possible
and may impose redundancies if not enough volunteers come forward. Last year
fewer than 300 of the job cuts were imposed.
About 800 Jaguar workers would qualify for early retirement under the lower
age limit. The company's management is understood to be hoping that up to
500 workers will apply quickly.
Jaguar made a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 226m compared with a Pounds
66.2m loss in 1990. Two leading washing-machine manufacturers yesterday
announced plans to lay off 2,600 workers in Wales.
Hotpoint is to lay off 1,600 workers at plants at Llandudno Junction,
Gwynedd, and Bodelwyddan, Clwyd, for two weeks next month. Hoover will lay
off 1,000 workers at its Merthyr Tydfil plant, south Wales, for two weeks
from March 2.

ALMA Holdings, the confectionery maker that was placed in receivership last
week, is to make 286 of its 775 staff redundant. The job losses will be
split almost equally between two factories in Dundee, Tayside, and
Glenrothes, Fife.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the receiver, said that the company, which has sweet
brands including Barker &amp; Dobson, Keiller and Hacks, had recently been
losing about Pounds 1m a month. It added that the Dundee factory was on a
three-day week.
KPMG said it would prefer to sell the whole group but was ready to consider
offers for parts of it. Several leading companies in the food and
confectionery industries had made serious inquiries about the group.

FT  22 FEB 92 / BT will cut another 3,100 staff by 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT, the telecommunications group, plans to make a further 3,100 redundancies
among telephone operators in addition to 7,500 announced last year. The
company told staff yesterday the additional cuts would be made between
December next year and the end of 1994.
The two redundancy programmes will cut the number of directory and operator
staff from 16,000 to 6,000 by 1995. The number of operator centres will be
cut from 163 to 83.
The additional round of redundancies will be evenly split between
directory-service staff and operators, who provide assistance in response to
100 calls.
The first round of 7,500 job cuts, planned for this year and next, reflect
the way digital technology has improved the quality and reliability of the
telephone system, so reducing the need for operator-assisted calls. BT's
decision to charge for directory inquiries has also reduced the number of
calls to the service.
BT is in the midddle of a sweeping job-reduction programme to exploit
productivity gains in new-technology systems and to trim management to give
the company a more commercial outlook.
At a peak in the late 1980s, when BT had to hire staff to help arrest the
deterioration in its quality of service, it employed about 247,000 people.
With job cuts in the past two years its workforce is about 200,000.
Last October BT announced plans for 16,000 redundancies among clerical and
engineering staff by March next year in addition to the 40,000 jobs it said
it expected to shed in the next few years.
BT hopes the latest cuts could be voluntary. Staff affected could ask to be
redeployed elsewhere in the company. It is also offering an early-retirement
package.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday set January 1 next year as a deadline for sanctions to take
effect against the EC unless agreement is reached to bar discrimination in
procurement by government-owned telecommunications and electrical utilities.
Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, revealed the deadline while
announcing that South Korea has agreed to open key sectors of its
telecommunications market to foreign goods and services. Korea has agreed to
a number of liberalisation steps, including one for value-added
telecommunications services and elimination of investment restrictions.
Mrs Hills said some progress has been made in talks with the EC over
telecommunications, including the breaking of the monopoly on terminal
equipment and opening up the value-added services markets of the member
states. But 'barriers remain, particularly in the government equipment
market and in a possibly restrictive regulatory regime for services'.
Specifically, she cited the EC's 'utilities directive' effective on January
1, requiring EC utilities to favour EC goods and services.
'The directive would replace the informal barriers US firms now face in some
EC markets with official discrimination in all EC utilities markets,' Mrs
Hills said. She noted the proposed new Gatt Government Procurement Code
would mean waiving discriminatory provisions of the utilities directive. The
negotiations 'leave us hopeful that the EC will, in advance of January 1,
1993, waive the discriminatory provisions of its Utilities Directive'.

<TEXT>
The US said yesterday it was lifting sanctions on China imposed last summer
after evidence Beijing was supplying missiles to Syria and Pakistan,
agencies report from Washington.
The sanctions were announced last June and prevented US companies going
ahead with plans to provide China with Dollars 30m (Pounds 17.1m) worth of
high-speed computers and work stations. They also banned transfer of missile
technology between the two countries and the export of US satellites.
The State Department said the sanctions were being lifted because China had
promised to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, which aims to
restrict the spread of advanced missile technology and weaponry.
The White House action came just days before a scheduled Senate vote on
whether to impose conditions on renewal of most-favoured-nation trade status
for China when current certification expires in June. The vote is set for
Tuesday.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OPPOSITION is building to Israel's request for up to Dollars 10bn (Pounds
5.7bn) of loan guarantees, George Graham reports from Washington.
Several key members of Congress have warned they will oppose the loan
guarantees, which Israel has sought to help finance the cost of absorbing 1m
new immigrants from the former Soviet Union, unless Israel freezes its
settlements activity in the occupied West Bank and Gaza zones.
'It is essential Israel understands US taxpayers will be in no mood to
support these guarantees under any conditions,' said Congressman David Obey,
chairman of the House of Representatives appropriations sub-committee.
Mr James Baker, secretary of state, will not agree to the request unless
Israel accepts a freeze on new settlements.
Mr Baker discussed the loan guarantees with Israeli Ambassador Zalman Shoval
yesterday for the third time in a month. He also discussed the issue with
Senator Patrick Leahy, head of the Senate appropriations sub-committee on
foreign operations.
Senator Leahy has proposed granting the loan guarantees at a rate of Dollars
2bn a year, but clawing back the amounts Israel spends on settlements in the
occupied territories. Israel has conceded some curb will be needed on
settlement activity, but the two sides have so far not agreed on how many
homes are already being built.
Senator Robert Byrd, Senate appropriations committee chairman, has voiced
scepticism over the guarantees, warning that Israeli assurances that the US
money would not be spent on settlements were meaningless, since they would
free other money for that purpose. 'Receiving written assurances as to how
the money will be spent, without any accompanying change in Israeli
settlement policy, is an exercise in building a paper dam.' He based his
comments on a General Accounting Office report, which said Israel would
probably be able to repay the loans, even if it failed to fulfil promised
economic reforms.

Canada recorded a year-on-year inflation rate of just 1.6 per cent in

yesterday, Bernard Simon reports from Toronto.
The sharp drop from the 3.8 per cent rise in the consumer price index
registered last December and a peak of 6.8 per cent in January 1991 were
mainly due to elimination from year-on-year calculations of the one-off
impact of the 7 per cent goods and services tax, imposed in at the beginning
of last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Harry Schwartz, South Africa's ambassador to the US, yesterday said his
country had won US support for new monetary assistance from the
International Monetary Fund, but was not yet ready to apply for help 'at
this stage'.
'We are in a position that when it is appropriate we can apply,' he said,
welcoming a favourable US State Department pronouncement.
The statement had been long in preparation but was made 'more pointed' after
the by-election defeat of the National party at the hands of the right-wing
Conservative party on Wednesday. It acknowledged that economic conditions in
South Africa, with severe unemployment, will 'have a direct and decisive
impact on the success of the new democracy which emerges from the current
negotiations'.
The State Department, while vague on its IMF policy, said the US was
'prepared to consider a proposal' for an IMF facility.
A provision of law, the Gramm amendment, prohibits US support for an IMF
facility unless four conditions are met. A Department spokesman said three
had been, but it was not yet clear the fourth had. That requires South
Africa to seek balance of payments support from the private markets before
going to the IMF.
Mr Michael Christie, Washington director of the South Africa Foundation, a
private-sector South African group, said he had been privately assured the
US would now back an IMF facility. The timing was subject to debate because
inflation was now 15 per cent. But he said the country, which now
desperately needs to expand its economy through imports, had the option of
going to the IMF.
A formal finding by President Bush earlier this week that South Africa has
made 'significant progress toward the elimination of apartheid' has paved
the way for new Eximbank lending to the South African government.
'We are also encouraging US exports to non-governmental South African
importers who have endorsed and proceeded toward the implementation of fair
labour standards,' the state department added.
'If the Secretary of State certified that a South African firm meets these
standards, US exporters to such a firm would also be eligible for Eximbank
support.' Companies owned by non-whites are exempt from any requirements.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council last night unanimously approved plans to
send a peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia - but baulked at the cost.
Because of the unexpectedly high estimated cost of Dollars 633.5m, the
council did not recommend that all 14,000 troops be deployed at once.
Instead, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, was directed to
send an advance group that would develop plans for 'the earliest possible
full deployment of the force.' This would then be on the basis of a budget
that maximised the Yugoslav parties' own contributions to offset UN costs.
Before the vote, several members voiced concern at a number of budget items,
including Dollars 132.3m for 'premises' for the troops.
The US and UK delegates were among those who argued that Yugoslavia, with
many tourist hotels, could house the UN force - saving the UN the expense of
putting up prefabricated barracks.
Members also baulked at a Dollars 71.6m estimate for 'aircraft operations.'
Mr Boutros Ghali recommended that the force be deployed initially for 12
months so that no Yugoslav republic could remove it without formal UN
sanction.
This is the first UN peacekeeping force to go to continental Europe. It is
the biggest UN peace operation since the Congo in the 1960s, but is likely
to be surpassed by the proposed UN force for Cambodia, estimated to cost
nearly Dollars 2bn.

FT  22 FEB 92 / LA on track for a new rail era: The car is no longer
unchallenged in California
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE CITY of Los Angeles pouring billions of dollars into a hole in the
ground, or have its city planners finally seen the light?
Nearly 30 years after Los Angeles' last trams and commuter trains stopped
running, depriving the city of any semblance of a public transport system
apart from the occasional bus, it is building a metropolitan rail system
linked to two new commuter train networks.
When this ambitious 30-year, Dollars 150bn system is completed, Los Angeles'
mass transit rail network, covering 350 miles, will be the largest in the US
after New York's.
The very idea of mass transit may seem anathema to a city which, in the
modern American mind, is even more closely associated with the car than
Detroit.
But it is interesting to recall that, in the 1930s, Los Angeles boasted the
nation's longest metropolitan rail system, with more than 1,200 miles of
track. As recently as 1945, Pacific Electric's Big Red cars ferried 109m
passengers each year.
However, the construction of the Pasadena Freeway in 1940 spelled doom for
public transport, with the rise to supremacy of the car aided by General
Motors, which bought up the city's transit systems, removed its streetcar
rails and put in its own buses, which the company said were more profitable.
Los Angeles became a model for the futuristic city and a transport-planning
blueprint for much of the western US.
But, while it took decades for the experiment of a trainless city to sour,
the city's residents no longer relish choking on polluted air.
Moreover, Los Angeles County's streets and highways can no longer cope with
a population that has multiplied three times to today's 9m from 3m in 1940.
The freeway speed limit is 55 miles per hour, but the actual average speed
is only 36mph, falling fast and estimated to drop to only 17mph by 2000. It
is this congestion which the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is
hoping will lure large numbers of commuters to its trains.
More than 80 per cent of the funding is coming from local sources - mainly
taxes voted in specifically for the project. Most of the remainder is coming
from the federal government. The commission also plans to attract customers
in more sublime ways: about Dollars 100,000 per station has been set aside
for art works. The aim is to keep the stations in character with their
surroundings, which in Los Angeles leaves more than a little scope for the
imagination.
At the underground station at Hollywood and Vine, once the heart of old
Hollywood, a yellow brick road will lead riders to ticket booths.
Downstairs, passengers will wait for trains on star-studded floors under
columns decorated with palm fronds while watching old movies projected above
the tunnel entrances. The platform at El Segundo overground station near the
city's aerospace companies will have a giant hand holding a paper aeroplane.
Meanwhile, the project has been dogged by controversy, over construction
problems as well as cost. Underground construction has been plagued by fire,
accidents and leaks. The latest battle is over the Hollywood Boulevard
portion of the system. Local residents are worried that construction will
stall the area's recent revival. When the downtown segment was built, big
trenches in the streets disrupted the flow of traffic.
However, the paramount problem will remain whether Angelenos can be lured in
numbers away from the safe isolation of their cars.
Critics maintain that the new system is little more than a very expensive
public relations ploy on the part of local politicians.
Mr Peter Gordon, a professor of urban planning at the University of Southern
California, believes that the city would do better to pay a lot more
attention to highway management, charging drivers the full cost of parking,
pollution and congestion.
'Rail was a good idea when most people went downtown,' he said, 'but most
people go from suburb to suburb, not downtown.'

<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S stalled economic reforms were boosted yesterday when President
Leonid Kravchuk began talks with the opposition on forming a coalition
cabinet and parliament slashed Ukraine's crippling taxes.
Mr Kravchuk and opposition leaders signed a communique pledging to take part
in round table negotiations which could lead to the creation of a coalition
cabinet.
On Thursday Mr Kravchuk had a separate meeting with leaders of the
nationalist Rukh party, who pledged to support his policies.
These negotiations are the public confirmation of a perverse political
alliance between the ex-communist president and the forces he once helped to
imprison.
Opposition politicians hope that yesterday's discussions are a signal that
Mr Kravchuk, who has been arming himself with increased presidential powers,
is about to embark on a long-promised cabinet reshuffle. The current
cabinet, headed by Mr Vitold Fokin, formerly chief of Ukraine's state
planning committee, has dragged its feet on economic reform.
The parliament, meanwhile, overruled the cabinet's position on taxes. In an
effort to conform to strict International Monetary Fund advice about
producing a balanced budget, the Ukrainian ministry of finance had imposed
crippling taxes including a 61 per cent compulsory contribution from
salaries into a social welfare fund, a 19 per cent Chernobyl payroll tax and
a 6 per cent payroll tax earmarked for an unemployment fund.
Parliament yesterday reduced the social welfare contribution to 37 per cent,
the Chernobyl tax to 12 per cent and the unemployment tax to 3 per cent.
'Populism has ended and serious work has begun,' said Mr Boris Markov, a
member of the radical parliamentary commission on economic reform. 'This is
a sign that economic reform can begin in Ukraine.'

FIGHTING in Nagorno Karabakh, the Armenian-populated district in Azerbaijan,
intensified yesterday in spite of an agreement by the foreign ministers of
Armenia and Azerbaijan to recommend a ceasefire to their governments.
Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, the Azerbaijani president, called on his countrymen to
'unite in a single fist to defend the freedom and independence of our
Azerbaijan'.
The international ramifications of the conflict were raised when Turkey,
which borders Armenia, expressed concern over the creation of armies by both
warring states on the basis of divisions of the former Soviet Army's
Caucasian command.
Manoeuvres by 7,000 Turkish troops on the border were described by Marshal
Yevgenny Shaposhnikov, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States' armed
forces, as 'unusual'. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, urged
caution from Turkey.
Britain called on both Azerbaijan and Armenia to implement the ceasefire
agreed by the foreign ministers - and said that 'it is important to have
this translated into reality on the ground'.
Russian and Armenian politicians have called for a peacekeeping force from
the UN or the CIS - but Azerbaijan has so far refused.

MR Jacques Delors yesterday denied he was thinking of returning to French
politics, and hinted he might consider an extension of his term as president
of the European Commission.
With France's socialist government less popular, there has been speculation
President Mitterrand would call on Mr Delors to replace Mrs Edith Cresson as
prime minister, perhaps after next month's regional elections.
But after talks with Mr Mitterrand and Mrs Cresson, Mr Delors insisted he
would serve out his full Brussels term, until the end of this year. He said
he would not seek an extension of his appointment; but 'if they ask me, I
shall see, according to the usefulness of what I can do'.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Russians clear way for foreign energy investors: New law
encourages exploitation of Moscow's vast underdeveloped mineral resources
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Russian parliament yesterday approved a long-awaited law on mineral
rights, taking an important step towards encouraging foreign investment in
the country's rich but badly managed oil, gas and mining sectors.
Mr Yuri Sergeyev, head of parliament sub-committee on natural resources,
said the law would go into effect by March 1.
Although Russia has huge amounts of undeveloped or neglected mineral
resources, potential investors have been frustrated by a lack of rules on
ownership and taxation.
'This is a step in the right direction. We are beginning to define what the
parameters are for doing business in the Russian republic,' said Mr George
Reese, senior managing partner of consultants Ernst &amp; Young in Moscow. He
also urged the Russian government to cut export taxes in order to encourage
investment.
But Mr Peter Aven, Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, said
yesterday that while unspecified export duties on other products would be
reduced, the government had no intention of cutting taxes on oil exports.
The law's main points are:
It allows concessions and production sharing;
Licences for exploration and operating rights are to be awarded through
tenders and auctions. Permits are to be issued jointly by the relevant local
authority and the geology committee of the Russian ministry for natural
resources and ecology.
It fixes the sharing out of royalties among federal and local authorities,
although a different allocation of revenues from strategically important
wells and mines can be negotiated by federal and local authorities. Payments
are to be divided as follows in the case of hydrocarbons: 30 per cent to
city budgets, 30 per cent to regions and 40 per cent to the republic. For
other minerals the breakdown is 50 per cent for cities, 25 per cent for
regions, and 25 per cent to the Russian republic. For resources in the
Continental shelf, the division is 60 per cent to the region and 40 per cent
to Russia.
There is an upper ceiling of five years for exploration permits, and 20
years for exploitation rights.
The law was passed in spite of attacks from former hardline communists such
as Mr Nikolai Maltsev, who claimed the law would 'permit the plundering of
mineral resources by private enterprise'.

<TEXT>
THE attractions of the Shanghai Vacuum Electron Device Company may not be
readily apparent from its name, but the company opened a new chapter in
China's financial history yesterday when shares owned by foreigners began
trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
For the first time since the communists took power in 1949, foreigners have
been permitted to trade freely in a publicly quoted Chinese asset. The
company is also the first Chinese state-owned company to admit foreign
owners.
If Shanghai Vacuum's first day of trading is anything to go by, China's
fledgling experiment with elements of capitalism, known as 'socialism with
Chinese characteristics', got off to a good start. The company's share price
rose 26 per cent from its issue price of Dollars 70 to close at Dollars
88.50, on turnover of 3,430 shares.
Shanghai Vacuum makes TV tubes (both black and white, and colour) and
electron guns. It is the pride of Shanghai and, by virtue of city government
regulation, has a virtual monopoly for what it makes.
Three weeks ago, a group of foreign merchant banks, led by SBCI Asia
Finance, placed 1m 'B' shares in the company with international investors.
The placement, four times oversubscribed, raised Dollars 78m to fund higher
output of colour TV tubes.
The shares were due to start trading on Thursday but the Shanghai
authorities asked for a day's delay because February 20 was not deemed
auspicious.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Republics to meet on debt impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, are to meet in Moscow on
Monday to consider how to service a Dollars 60bn foreign debt. So far the
republics have been unable to agree to accept joint and several
responsibility for the debt, a precondition for fresh credits from the Group
of Seven leading industrial nations.
Russia said yesterday it was looking for partial deferral of interest
payments on the debt, following a postponement of Dollars 11.1bn of
principal payments already agreed with western creditors.
Mr Peter Aven, Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, said his
country had to pay Dollars 8.7bn this year. 'This is a big sum especially
when other republics are not paying anything,' he said.
Ukraine has refused to accept joint responsibility for the debt, preferring
instead to pay its share independently. One western official said the only
concession on offer to Ukraine when it meets the former Soviet Union's
creditors in Paris next month would be an opportunity for it to make
repayments through an institution other than the Moscow-based
Vnesheconombank.
Ukraine is due to present its case to creditors on March 15-16. Western
creditors meet next month to discuss extending until the end of the year
deferral of principal payments.

FT  22 FEB 92 / CBI report warns of continuing recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GRIM warning that poor prospects for UK manufacturers were likely to
prolong the recession still further came last night from the Confederation
of British Industry.
According to the CBI, manufacturers see little hope of raising output over
the next four months. This increases the probability that the recession -
the longest since the 1930s  - will enter a seventh quarter.
The CBI said weak demand was further squeezing company profits, and Britain
was 'unlikely to see the rise in investment needed to improve and sustain
competitiveness over the longer term'.
The bleak tone of the CBI's latest survey of industrial trends - which
provides a barometer of overall economic activity - increased pressure on
government ministers to stimulate the economy.
It came at the end of a week in which official figures showed that the
recession had so far lasted six quarters, and in which the cabinet agreed to
an expansionary pre-election Budget on March 10.
The picture of the factory sector stuck in recession is underlined by only a
small improvement in companies' order books, which have been depressed for
two years. Manufacturing accounts for just under a quarter of the economy
and influences other sectors such as services.
According to the survey of 1,425 businesses in 50 industries, 22 per cent of
companies believe output volumes will be lower over the next four months,
with 19 per cent expecting an increase.
Because of competition and weak demand, inflationary pressures at a
wholesale level are extremely low. The same number of manufacturers expect
to cut prices in the next four months as increase them.
This marks the lowest inflationary pressures recorded for manufacturing in a
February survey since 1967.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Many-sided chip wrangle sizzles in Belgian court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE STAKES are getting higher and the chips are down in Belgium's
long-sizzling legal wrangle over who invented the six-sided pomme frite.
While the rest of the world may be preoccupied with a different kind of chip
 -the semiconductor - Belgian attention is focused on a technologically
advanced way to produce pommes frites - crisp, golden spears of potato
accompanied by dollops of mayonnaise and almost everything else.
So it was almost inevitable that this dispute about the cutting edge of
frite technology should take place in Belgium.
Inevitable, too, for a country struggling with linguistic divisions, that it
should be a French-speaking Walloon and a Dutch-speaking Fleming who would
grill each other in court over the true origin of the hexagonal frite.
The only thing the two men agree on is the superiority of the six-sided
frite over the traditional rectangular shape. The new version absorbs up to
20 per cent less grease and cooks more evenly and quickly because its edges
are smoother.
Such advantages are to be weighed seriously in a country where 10,000
friteries serve 1,000 tonnes of chips a day.
Aviko, a subsidiary of Gebeco, the Dutch food co-operative, said yesterday
that sales of its Pommes Sixtettes brand were booming in Belgium, thanks in
part to the publicity of the court case brought by Mr Guiseppe Bonsignore, a
Walloon of Italian origin, against Mr Robert Stroobandt of Flanders for
frite patent infringement. Aviko bought its licence to make six-sided frites
from Mr Stroobandt.
Yesterday, Mr Bonsignore countered by saying that the more polygonal frites
Aviko sold in Belgium, the greater the damages he would be seeking.
When he started his lawsuit in 1990 he sued Mr Stroobandt and Aviko together
for BFr11m (Pounds 183,000). But the wheels of Belgian justice grind slowly
and the Liege commercial tribunal is not expected to reach a judgment for
some months.
Meanwhile, Mr Bonsignore has licensed his frite-cutting grille to two
Belgian companies, and touted it to McCain of Canada, the biggest supplier
of frozen chips in Europe.
But Mr Lucien Decraeye, head of Belgium's national union of frituriers, or
friers, has doubts about whether his customers will take to the novelty of a
six-sided frite. 'We Belgians are very traditional when it comes to our
frites'.
Gastronomically, everyone agrees, the ideal frite would be completely round.
Creating industrial machinery to cut potatoes into cylinders would be very
hard, according to experts.
However, even this last frite frontier is probably not safe from ingenious
Belgians - and their lawyers.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Hidden costs of life assurance policies revealed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of selling a life assurance policy in the UK can be up to 2 1/2
times the premiums paid by the policyholder in the first year, according to
industry data supplied to the DTI.
The data, never before publicly disclosed, also show that the cost of
selling a new policy varies widely among life companies.
According to the industry's own figures, nearly half of Britain's top
companies need at least a full year's premium merely to cover the cost of
making a sale.
This means that a company selling a conventional 25-year mortgage-related
endowment policy with premiums of Pounds 50 per month could need to retain
about Pounds 600 of initial premiums merely to cover costs.
The bulk of these charges is borne in the first years of the policy, so
those who cash in their policies early receive negligible returns.
Several companies with the highest cost ratios, including some of Britain's
biggest, say some sales costs are borne by shareholders or paid from
reserves. The detailed figures of 61 life companies are culled from the
insurers' own reports on their 'with profits' business in 1989 and 1990.
They were filed with the DTI.
In 1991 the life assurance industry sold policies totalling Pounds 14.12bn
in the UK. About half of those were with-profits policies.
Insurance companies do not dispute the figures, though they describe them as
'crude'. They say that the wide variation in reported costs reflects many
factors including the mix of business, the way costs are calculated by each
company and the method by which policyholders are charged.
However, Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, the industry's
self-regulatory body, said: 'On policies, the consumer eventually pays the
acquisition cost, sometimes indirectly.'
The 'price tag' of life assurance policies in the UK varies from 251 per
cent of the first year's premiums, which Provident Life reported as the
average cost of each new sale in 1990, to the 24 per cent recorded by
Equitable Life in the same year.
Current legislation does not require the life industry to make full
disclosure of costs, in cash terms, to potential customers.
The expense ratios revealed in DTI returns offer the first glimpse of the
full costs of selling new policies.
Ms Jean Eaglesham of the Consumers' Association was strongly critical of the
combination of high initial expenses and high early lapse rates on policies.
Consumers do not know the extent of their charges, she said.
'It allows companies to do what they like and hide behind an industry-wide
figure which is not in cash terms and which consumers do not understand
anyway.'
Mr Roman Cizdyn, insurance industry analyst at Smith New Court, said: 'The
lower the ratio, the better the value for the customers, the shareholders
and future generations of policy holders.'
The Association of British Insurers, a trade group, is fighting proposals by
regulators which would require each company to disclose more about its own
expenses to prospective customers.
'To allow company-specific expenses in illustrations could give a
potentially misleading advantage to companies with low current expenses,'
the ABI said in a paper submitted to the Securities and Investments Board.
The revelations follow a report by the SIB last year showing that a quarter
to a third of all policies are cancelled within the first two years. Mr
Jebens said the front-ended nature of sales expenses meant that it would
take seven to 10 years on average before the holder of a 20-year policy even
earned back premiums paid.
The data are bound to fuel the debate among regulators about how life
assurance sales agents should disclose costs to consumers.
The SIB and Lautro are engaged in a debate with the insurance industry over
the format of a new disclosure regime set to be proposed next month.
Actuaries caution that the data from the DTI reports are only a rough guide
to charges and should be treated with caution.
'There is a correlation between expenses and charges, but it is not a
perfect one,' said Mr Chris Hairs, actuary at Legal and General and chairman
of the disclosure working party of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
Mr Hairs said the data reflect costs across all categories of business.
Different types of policies may have different costs than implied by the
data, he said.
Some high expense ratios may reflect one-off investments in technology or
reorganisation that will reduce costs in later years.
Some companies are writing large volume group business with low overheads,
which lowers the average shown in the DTI data. Individual sales, however,
may carry higher costs.

FT  22 FEB 92 / City watchdog chief to head Lloyd's inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London, stung by a barrage of recent criticism, has asked Sir
David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, to direct
inquiries into alleged malpractices at the insurance market.
Sir David, a member of the Lloyd's Council since 1988, will oversee
investigations into allegations that working Names, who have jobs with
Lloyd's agents and brokers, have benefited at the expense of outside Names
who were allegedly placed on poorly performing syndicates. Names are
individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's.
He will also co-ordinate investigations by Lloyd's into so called 'spiral'
reinsurance business, in which Lloyd's syndicates reinsure each other's
exposure to catastrophe risks.
Spiral syndicates have registered devastating losses for their Names.
Critics have suggested that the main purpose of spiral business was to earn
commissions and fees for brokers and underwriters at the expense of
syndicate members.
Commenting on Sir David's appointment, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of
Lloyd's, said: 'I needed a man who was so white that snow-white looked
dirty. I realised that there had been a lot of fuss in Parliament and we
couldn't ignore the allegations.'
He said he hoped Sir David's appointment would 'at least stop outpourings of
venom without any facts'.
Action was also necessary to bolster confidence of Names and policyholders
as well as the agents and brokers who trade at Lloyd's.
'The market is very numb. They've never been treated like this before. They
find it utterly amazing that these allegations are being made,' Mr Coleridge
said.
Sir David's appointment, he said, was designed to 'raise the profile' and
'put into a higher gear' existing regulatory work, which has been under way
since the end of last year.
Sir David has chaired the SIB, Britain's chief investment watchdog, since
1988.
Scrutiny of the way agents place Names on to the 280 or so syndicates
currently trading had already been stepped up before the recent round of
publicity, Mr Coleridge said.
Lloyd's has already set up a number of independent review committees to
ascertain the factors which contributed to the losses of the several spiral
syndicates. The first of these reviews, into Feltrim syndicate 540/542, is
chaired by Sir Patrick Neill, and is scheduled to report in the spring.
Sir David, who could start on his task as early as next week, is expected to
take at least two months to complete inquiries and produce a report, which
Lloyd's expects to publish.
Mr Coleridge said the existing staff and other resources of the Lloyd's
Corporation, the body which provides regulatory and market services for
agents and syndicates at the market, may be insufficient. He added that Sir
David would be free to appoint external consultants or draw on any other
resources he might require.
Mr Coleridge said he told Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour spokeswoman for City
affairs, on Thursday that Lloyd's wanted either to 'demolish' the
accusations or, 'if there was anything in them, we would get hold of the
wrongdoers and string 'em up'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITY is one of the main selling points of with-profits life policies.
Bonuses credited cannot be withdrawn and policies are thus supposed to be
much less volatile than alternatives such as unit trusts.
Try telling that to Joshua Martin, who has a 10-year policy with Clerical
Medical, maturing soon. Late in 1990, Martin, who had been contributing a
gross Pounds 500 per year, asked for a quotation of his policy's maturity
value.
Clerical Medical wrote on November 11, 1990, giving an estimated maturity
value of Pounds 11,360. Since that date, share prices, as represented by the
FT-A All-Share index, has risen by more than 20 per cent. So, you might
think that Martin's policy has increased in value since the estimate was
made.
Wrong. The actual maturity value is set to be Pounds 9,799.
How did this occur? Clerical Medical says two factors explain the shift. The
first is that its quotation was based on previous terminal bonus payouts. At
the time the quotation was given to Martin, terminal bonuses were still
healthy, reflecting the strong performance of 1980s stock markets.
Since then, it has become clear to many life companies that the investment
returns that were available in the period 1975-87 will not persist. Terminal
bonuses have been cut, particularly on shorter-term policies such as
Martin's.
The second factor is a shift in Clerical Medical policies that were started
after 1981. The final value of policies started after that date contained a
much lower proportion as terminal bonus.
The combined effect is that the terminal bonus, quoted at Pounds 4,260 in
November 1990, will actually be less than Pounds 2,700.
What is puzzling is that the Gulf crisis-related fall in stock markets
occurred before the quotation was given. The change in the relative
importance of the terminal bonus would also have been known at that time.
Admittedly, Clerical Medical's quotation did say: 'The benefits actually
payable may be higher or lower than illustrated.' And the company now has
shifted its policy so that it bases its quotations on likely future terminal
bonuses rather than what it paid in the past.
But Martin's case has two lessons. The value of a life policy can depend
greatly on a terminal bonus that might be affected by short-term investment
factors. And forecasts of maturity values must be treated with extreme
caution.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in January. To
use it, multiply the original cost of the assets by the figure shown for the
month in which you bought them. If you subtract the result from the proceeds
of your sale, the difference will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in August 1986 and sold them
in January 1992 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
August 1986 figure of 1.386 gives a total of Pounds 8,316.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 13,000 gives a gain for tax
purposes of Pounds 4,684 - below the annual Pounds 5,500 CGT allowance. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profit should be tax-free.
If you are selling shares bought before April 6, 1982, use the March 1982
figure.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Loss adjusters pursue jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ACCIDENT is sending loss adjusters to those receiving payouts from
unemployment insurance policies, following a doubling in claims. And the
company is stopping payments if policyholders do not immediately agree to a
visit.
The Association of British Insurers said the use of outside loss adjusters
on umemployment claims was very unusual.
The Bradford branch of GA, which mainly handles policies sold through
building societies, is believed to have sent loss adjusters out to nearly
300 redundancy claimants in the last month.
Among those approached was a computer systems analyst made redundant in
November 1990. At the beginning of 1990, he took out a GA accident, sickness
and redundancy policy through Abbey National. The policy covered up to 24
monthly payments of Pounds 1,500 to meet mortgage instalments, plus the
maximum 50 per cent margin allowed for other bills.
Payments under the policy began five months after he was made redundant.
Last week, a representative of the loss-adjusting company, Thomas Howell,
telephoned the analyst saying it had been appointed by General Accident and
asking to interview him at home.
'He mentioned a questionnaire but would not say what was in it, so I said I
was not prepared to talk to him and would contact GA.'
He wrote to GA, asking if there had been a mistake, and pointing out that he
had stuck to the policy terms by sending in a DSS certificate of
unemployment each month and did not recall having agreed to visits by loss
adjusters.
On Tuesday a letter from GA acknowledged the latest unemployment certificate
but noted that the analyst had declined a visit from Thomas Howell.
'We would advise you that until we receive a report from the Thomas Howell
Group we are unable to release any further payments under this scheme,'
wrote Sue Bramley of GA. 'This is a relatively new scheme that has been
adopted by the GA with regard to accident, sickness and unemployment to give
us a better overall view of the various claims.'
At General Accident's Perth head office, creditor insurance manager Jim
Hunter said: 'We are certainly within our rights,' citing a clause in the
policy 'the insurer shall be entitled to make inquiry of the insured
borrower's immediate past employer or otherwise as deemed necessary.'
He said that these last five words alone, authorised the company to send in
loss adjusters at any time.
GA claims manager John Fleming said the questionnaire's purpose was to
ensure that people were seeking work but not working and claiming at the
same time.
He defended immediate stoppage of payments if loss adjusters were not
admitted: 'Why should we continue to pay if someone is clearly not prepared
to provide information? It is the right of every insurance company to
conduct whatever inquiries they need.'

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The pick of single company Peps - The
risks and rewards of holding a personal equity plan in one company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGLE company personal equity plans have been highly popular since their
launch on January 1. CC&amp;P Trustees, a division of Bacon &amp; Woodrow, is plan
manager for 55 company schemes and reports Pounds 60m-65m invested this year
in both single company and old-style corporate Peps.
Investors can place up to Pounds 3,000 of one company's shares in a single
company plan, in addition to the Pounds 6,000 Pep which they may have taken
out already in the tax year.
Returns are free of capital gains and income tax, as with other Peps.
Many employees will find a single company Pep a useful means of holding
shares acquired through an Inland Revenue approved all-employee scheme.
By transferring shares into a single company Pep within 90 days of
acquisition, the employee can avoid capital gains tax.
For non-employee investors, though, the drawback of the new Pep is the fact
that an equity-based investment is being limited to the shares of one
company. But the golden rule is that risk is minimised by a wide spread of
holdings.
This makes single company PEPs most suitable for those investors who have a
diversified portfolio already. But which single company should they choose?
We asked a number of stockbrokers for their tips, with two types of investor
in mind. The first is someone who is taking out the Pep primarily as a means
of reducing his capital gains tax bill.
The other is one who does not normally pay CGT and is, therefore, looking
primarily to benefit from the Pep's exemption from income tax. In essence,
the division is between growth and income.
GROWTH
Mark Powell, of Laurence Keen, chose Marks &amp; Spencer as a suitable stock for
someone interested in growth. The company showed 4 per cent growth in
earnings last year and Powell expects profit to rise from Pounds 620m to
Pounds 640m in the year to March, with another 15 per cent increase to
Pounds 730m next year.
'The shares are never statistically very cheap but, on a prospective
price/earnings ratio for the year to March 1993 of just over 17.5, they seem
to me to be an excellent three-year holding,' he said.
Paul Killik, of Killik &amp; Co., decided to play safe by choosing 'sound
companies with some diversification of interests.'
He picked Unilever as his growth stock but does not expect more than a small
improvement in profits and earnings from the annual results due next week.
'However, the attraction lies in the medium to longer term opportunities of
the Single European Market,' said Killik. 'Among the larger companies, none
is better placed to take advantage of the removal of trade barriers in
Europe.'
Unilever was also the choice of stockbroker Greig Middleton as 'a quality
stock which is relatively recession-proof.' But the firm's Brian Tora
selected BOC as a company likely 'to offer sound value and operating in
industries which, while not recession-proof, should hold up well under
current difficult trading conditions.'
Tora added: 'The long-term basis of many of its gas supply contracts will
help and the management is well regarded.'
Andrew Norman-Butler, of Gerrard Vivian Gray, recommended Smithkline Beecham
'A' shares, at 937p for capital growth. 'Despite the outperformance of the
health and household sector, we feel the shares still have the potential for
a major re-rating once the outlook for their new-product launches is
recognised,' he said.
INCOME
Higher-income seekers should think of buying into Redland, the building
materials group, according to Laurence Keen's Powell. He predicts that last
year's profit will have fallen from Pounds 245m to Pounds 185m but adds:
'Redland is financially very strong, and the depressed state of many of the
markets in which it operates seems likely to provide acquisition
opportunities.'
Redland is in the process of bidding for Steetley, a large British brick and
clay tile manufacturer. Redland shares are now around 475p and the yield is
7 per cent.
Killik's choice for income is BAT industries at 660p. He expects the final
dividend to be around 22p net of tax (29.3p gross in a Pep), a yield of 4.4
per cent on its own.
'For the 1992 year, expectations are for about 36p in total, a gross yield
of 7.2 per cent,' said Killik.
Although the price of its shares have been depressed by heavy losses at its
insurance subsidiary, Eagle Star, Killik believes the worst is over.
'The company is a fine cash generator in these uncertain times, which gives
confidence that it will be able to continue its progressive dividend
policy.'
The tip from Greig Middleton's Tora is P&amp;O. 'I am not certain that my
colleagues would agree that it is suitable for a Pep but, with its
double-digit yield, this could be a rewarding share to hold - although it is
high risk, given that things could go wrong.'
Gerrard Vivian Gray's Norman-Butler picks Prudential which, at 232p, is
yielding 5.9 per cent. 'Prudential has a record of dividend growth which we
expect to continue at around 10 per cent per annum. Rationalisation and
general cost-cutting should help recovery prospects,' he said.
Investors should think long and hard before deciding to open a single
company Pep.
Like all equity-based investments, it should be regarded as a long-term
commitment. If the shares of the single company hit the floor, losses cannot
be offset against gains elsewhere for CGT purposes.
Both Killik and Tora advise investors not to go for the single company Pep
unless they already have a general Pep.
Now that the Labour party has stated that it will not be abolishing Peps,
investors need not be rushed into choosing.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The W word
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS HAS been a tough old week for those of us on work duty in Beverly
Hills. There is a belief in dull quarters that life in Los Angeles -
especially in Beverly Hills - is one long round of parties, polo matches,
lunch dates, shopping, private screenings and daily conferences with one's
hairdresser, florist, decorator, astrologer, menu supervisor, hypnotist,
analyst, celebrity fitness trainer, tennis coach, garden masonry consultant,
personal organiser, tax attorney and PR office.
And so it is, of course. But there are odd chinks in the day which still
have to be filled - work opportunities, I think we should call them - when
the resident of Beverly Hills, or even the regular visitor, must turn his
attention to this frivolous thing called work.
Take Monday. On Monday I was convinced I had spotted a work opportunity. I
read in the paper that at 5.30 am on Wednesday the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences right here in Beverly Hills was holding a press conference
at which this year's Oscar contenders, five in each category, would be
named.
The 5.30 am kick-off was designed to attract TV coverage from network news
shows on the East coast, and from CNN in Europe. So I rang the Academy. But
Monday was a holiday. The Academy was shut. So I rang again on Tuesday.
By then, I was told, 'credentialling' for the press conference had closed.
'If you are not credentialled at this time,' a PR hussy told me, 'then you
will not be able to attend, though you are welcome to pick up a press pack
from the Academy between 7.30 am and noon.'
I have never found much nourishment in press packs. These days, journalism
is so competitive, editors so shrill, that you have to delve way beyond the
press pack if you want to make your mark. You simply cannot ring the News
Editor and instruct him: 'Hold the back page, I am picking up a press pack.'
Which left me confronting a singular lack of work opportunities with which
to make a good fist of Wednesday, to flesh out my schedule and justify the
not insignificant cost of maintaining me on the ground in Beverly Hills for
another 24 hours.
But fortune favours the bold. Not at all flustered by my failure to
gatecrash the Oscars press conference, I repaired, at 10 am, to poolside at
the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. The morning was beautiful. The swimming
pool quivered and glittered just like a David Hockney.
And then my eye fell upon a magazine ad placed by Negative Population Growth
Inc. which claimed that, driven by explosive population growth, the US was
hurtling towards environmental disaster.
At once my journalistic instincts tempered these many years by the white
heat of ferocious competition, pinged into action. Talk about a story.
According to Negative Population Growth Inc: 'If present immigration and
fertility rates continue, our population, now over 252m, will pass 400m by
the year 2050 and still be growing rapidly]
'We believe that all efforts to save our environment will ultimately prove
to be futile unless we not only halt US population growth, but reverse it,
so that our population can eventually be stabilised at a sustainable level -
far lower than it is today."
What was the ideal size of the US population? Answer: in the range of 125m
to 150m, about what it was in the 1940s.
How would this be achieved? Answer: by reducing annual immigration to about
200,000 so that it roughly balanced emigration; and by lowering the
fertility rate from 2.1 children per woman to around 1.5 and keeping it
there for several decades.
'We believe,' said the ad, 'that non coercive financial incentives will be
necessary in order to reach that goal.' These would include eliminating the
present Federal income tax exemption for dependent children.
At once, numerous lines of inquiry suggested themselves to my active mind.
Who was master-minding NPG Inc? What did they stand to gain? Was there any
plan to eliminate or reduce whole categories of persons - people who work in
advertising agencies springing felicitously to mind? Or to eliminate whole
cities? What about New York? It has always seemed to me that New York is
peopled exclusively by nerds and jerks.
Unfortunately, the only way to get in touch with NPG Inc was to send off a
cheque for annual membership. So I wrote out a cheque for Dollars 30 and
asked the pool attendant to mail it to Teaneck, New Jersey.
Then I rang my hairdresser.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Heaven and Hell: To joke - perchance to laugh? - A deeply
philosophical question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK ARCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE THERE jokes in Heaven? Difficult to imagine, isn't it? Ancient
philosophers envisaged the gods happily contemplating the perfection of the
universe. But show a comedian the perfect world and he will burst out
laughing or, more typically, tell a joke.
Jokes are incorrigibly dissident. At the lightest level, they deflate our
vanity (interviewed by Dame Edna Everage on TV, best-selling novelist
Jeffrey Archer once said how important it was to laugh at oneself. 'If you
can't do that, Jeffrey, you've missed the biggest joke of all]' came the
reply).
At a deeper level, they enable us to live with highly-unpleasant truths
about ourselves which often are directly contrary to our orthodox beliefs.
All those jokes about mothers-in-law, sex and religion: don't they serve as
safety valves for some of our most ambivalent thoughts and desires?
Some of the funniest jokes about Heaven are told by churchmen; not
surprising when the strongest believers are often tortured by doubt. Heaven
is one thing about which we cannot be certain. As the 17th-century
philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, put it: 'What kind of Felicity God hath ordained
to them that devoutly honour Him, a man shall no sooner know than enjoy.'
But, through jokes, people at least can accommodate completely inconsistent
ideas in one release of mirth rather than suffer mental anguish.
Once in Heaven, though, jokes would be ruled out of court. Everyone there
would have a starred First in Perfection cum laude. If you went around
intimating that anyone was a little less than perfect, you would be
considered, well, a bit naff.
How would some of most dissident comic writers entertain themselves? Henry
Fielding for instance (he would be out of a job as a magistrate, in any
case)? Or Jane Austen, whose irony - as expressed by Elizabeth in Pride and
Prejudice - is directed at the 'follies and inconsistencies' of the world?
Queen Victoria would be there (she who never was amused); but we would seek
in vain for Dr Johnson and his drinking companions, Goldsmith, Garrick and
Gibbon. Heaven would not just be beyond a joke. Would it not also be, er,
just a little boring?
The problem is not to do with Heaven or whether we would be happy there. The
hard thing is imagining happiness without jokes or fun: do these not depend
on recognising human 'follies and inconsistencies.' TE Lawrence once said
that 'failure was God's freedom to mankind.' He could have been describing
jokes.
In an important respect, man's follies are his freedoms. Jokes thrive on the
quirky and unpredictable in human nature. Only in this way can they surprise
us with their knowledge of ourselves.
How could jokes survive in Heaven, where everything is predictable? So much
human happiness depends on chance - the old English word 'hap,' meaning
chance or luck, is part of the word - and jokes are no exception. Like
life's best adventures, their success is in proportion to the uncertainty of
their outcome.
Jokes are chancy things. You need to carry them off, and you also need to
carry your audience with you. Indeed, one reason jokes are risky is because
they depend on other people, to hear as well to share in them. 'A jest's
prosperity lies in the ear/ Of him that hears it,' as Rosaline says at the
end of Love's Labour's Lost.
But because Heaven admits of no chance, it cannot admit of happiness, at
least not as it is understood humanly. Everyone miraculously would hear the
punch-line in his head before you said it. How could you get your timing
right in an environment which was timeless, changeless and co-eternal with
God? Every joke would be divinely stale.
Human unpredictability is not always a source of happiness. Jokes fail. They
also wound, as Emma Woodhouse learns when she attempts a joke at the expense
of Miss Bates in Jane Austen's Emma. But during wars, when unpredictable
human folly can make it seem as if the world has gone mad, jokes can be our
last line of defence. They can turn the tables on adversity.
Someone who thought the follies and uncertainties of this life were heaven
enough was Rupert Brooke who, in a poem, celebrated 'voices in laughter,'
'the pain, the calm, and the astonishment/Desire illimitable, and still
content.'
"All these,' he says, 'have been my loves,' despite the fact that 'these
shall pass.' What he loves is the unpredictability of life, the
unforeseen-ness of its all-too-human epiphanies, even - we could say - its
capacity for jokes.
The Greek poets understood this better than the philosophers. While
philosophers were propounding a po-faced image of celestial happiness, their
literary brethren were saying something very different about happiness.
Why do so many gods of ancient legend descend to earth merely to get up to
mischief? They play pranks and they love to joke; they love, also, to fall
in love although they rarely hold on to the mortals they pursue.
Perhaps the gods were on to something: that happiness, like a good joke, is
something you need to be human to appreciate.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Private View: A mother in waiting to be a priest - Church
leaders debated ordination for women this week. Dilly Baker, a London
curate, talks about her vocation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DILLY BAKER is expecting to become a mother in two weeks' time and an
Anglican priest within two years.
The birth of her first child may be in God's hands. Her ordination is in the
hands of the general synod of the Church of England which debated the
divisive subject of women priests again this week and could give final
approval in November.
Barring parliamentary accident, the crop-headed young curate of St. John the
Evangelist in Goose Green, south London, will then be able to celebrate the
Eucharist and to give absolution - she, and about 1,000 other women, already
ordained deacons, who are priests in waiting.
The church will gain another male priest, too: Dilly's husband, Chris,
curate of the neighbouring parish of St Barnabas, who has delayed his own
ordination in sympathy with his wife.
Dilly Baker's tomboy haircut and progressive views could suggest a militant
feminist, a woman subconsciously trying to be a man. But there is nothing
mannish about her big eyes, wide mouth and giggly laugh - she is younger
than her 30 years - and nothing strident about the way she talks.
I asked her to describe her vocation.
'My sense of vocation has never been the kind of blinding light from
heaven,' she said. 'It's always been something I have a little bit of a
love-hate relationship with. I mean, I'm here because I believe that I am
called to be a priest, but the Church of England does give me severe jitters
at times.'
She wonders what her father would have said. He was a C of E traditionalist
who died when she was only 12. 'I often think about that. I have a hunch he
would have said: 'You go for it]''.
Have you a vocation or do you really mean you want a career?
'It depends how you want to define vocation. I feel that I have. I can
pinpoint the time when I felt very, very strongly that this was something I
had to do: it was during a pilgrimage week at Iona.'
How do you know your vocation is for the priesthood?
'I feel my ministry is incomplete without the priestly part. When you've
been involved in people's lives, birth and death and everything in between,
and then the shutter comes down on Sunday morning that feels very, very
wrong.'
And if ordination were denied you?
'I would find it very difficult to continue in the church in my present
position.'
Do you see it as a woman's right to be ordained priest?
'It's a very loaded term, that.'
Yes, I said; it was deliberate.
The curate sighed. 'I don't think I want to talk in terms of rights because
that just turns people off. I might want to talk in terms of justice. Men
and women are created together in the image of God and to deny women the
ability to represent Christ is, I think, a fundamental break with justice.
But I'm not the sort of person to go around talking about women's rights too
earnestly.'
Is what you're doing part of the feminist movement?
'I'm reluctant to say Yes because feminism is such a dirty word for a lot of
people. But feminism has helped us to see more clearly what has been going
on in the church, the way women have been treated and understood.'
The church was taking its cue from secular society, but would lose all
credibility if it did not press ahead. And there was a precedent - its
renunciation of slavery after centuries.
Just under a third of the laity but slightly more than a third of the clergy
oppose the ordination of women, according to diocesan poll results discussed
this week. Many regard it as the feminist component of a general slide into
trendy theology and secularism.
Dilly Baker (her real name is Hilary) acknowledged a theological connection.
'It's not simply a matter of who says the Eucharistic prayer. We're dealing
with something very important: how we understand God, how we understand
sexuality and relations between women and men. So long as the church says
that women cannot adequately represent Christ at the altar then our theology
is open to question.'
Is the gender of God a separate question from whether women should be
priests or not?
She hesitated. 'I personally don't think it's separate. But let's be honest.
There's no sex to God. It's a convenient metaphor. We're talking metaphors
all the time here and I think we need to enlarge our vision of God all the
time. But 'women priests equals female God' is not what I want to say at
all.'
Devout Anglicans see women's ordination as the last nail in the coffin of
traditional Christianity. (A few have gone further, claiming that in New
Zealand it has caused an outbreak of 'religious witchcraft'.) 'There are as
many, or more,' said the curate, 'who feel it's not fair to dump it all at
the feet of women priests. To have women as priests redresses the balance a
little bit but no way does it alter the fundamentals of the faith.'
Some objectors quote Biblical authority for their views, others are just
shocked by the thought that such a long tradition is to be broken. Yet
Methodists, Baptists, and other English non-conformists have already broken
it, and there are 1,500 women priests in Anglican churches overseas - and
two women bishops.
For Dilly Baker, the fact that Jesus chose male disciples is not persuasive.
They were not chosen as priests, and church hierarchies developed much later
in accordance with social custom. The fact that Christ was a man did not
prevent him conferring important roles on Mary and Martha.
'Jesus came to take on our flesh to understand us as human beings,' she
said. 'It's that taking on of our humanity that is of essential importance,
not the maleness . . . or else the gospel has really nothing to say to
women.'
She also rejected the argument that women priests would damage prospects of
unity with the Church of Rome. 'To suggest that it's just these few pushy
women who are stopping unity is not very accurate. Anyway I would want to
say 'Unity at what cost?''
What about the unity of the Church of England itself? I asked. What will the
cost be if the ordination of women goes ahead?
'Well, I think the Church is going to be greatly enriched by it.' She
laughed. 'I can say no other, can I?'
Don't you take seriously the threat that a lot of people will leave?
'I don't think a lot of people will leave. Some will, just as some people
will leave if it doesn't go through. That's very sad and I'm sorry about
that. I feel it's unnecessary since as the legislation stands there will
still be a place for people who are opposed to women priests. But there are
also people we don't hear about who have left, who don't come to church
because of the way the church treats women.'
What about the church splitting?
'I don't know how seriously to take that. Whether it's scaremongering
tactics I don't know.
'But I do know - and I'm in a High Church here where you expect to find most
opposition - that as people have got used to me as a minister, they have
become comfortable with the idea of women priests. Because I'm standing
behind the altar and the symbol has gradually changed for them, they have
got used to it.'
Some clergymen cannot get used to it. One, after a recent conversation with
a woman deacon, suddenly stopped and said: 'Why do you insist on wearing
that bitch collar?'
The incident prompted me to ask why so many homosexual clergy (they form a
large minority in the London diocese) were hostile. The mother-to-be, so far
serene, looked uncomfortable. Eventually she said:
'I would want to affirm gay people in their sexuality. I don't want to be
seen as opposed to gay people. I feel upset that they can't see the
connection between the way the church has treated gay people and the way it
has treated women. It's all part and parcel of the church's inability to
come to terms with sexuality.'
She agreed that the Church of England could be seen as the last male
bastion. 'Men have been heading this show for so long. Women will bring a
breath of fresh air, a little more imagination and creativity, and will open
the whole thing up. Maybe that is why some men are so very threatened by the
whole issue.'
I asked her how women priests would differ from men.
Once more, she was reluctant to employ 'stereotypes'. She finally agreed
that women might find it easier to extend sympathy, especially to other
women. The family of a parishioner whose funeral she recently conducted had
said as much.
Finally, I asked her: do you think it's God's will that women should be
priests?
'Yes,' she said, very quietly. 'I certainly do.'
Do you kneel down and pray to be told this is the right thing for you?
'Yes. That would be quite an apt way of putting it. I have thought about it
and prayed about it and struggled with the issue for some time and I'm
absolutely certain this is the way forward - not just for me as an
individual but for the church in general.'
So you have God on your side?
'Oh, you wicked . . .] I never talk in terms of God on my side. I do think
it's God's will but I'm not so naive as to say the opposition wouldn't say
the same thing.'

FT  22 FEB 92 / The certainties of ignorance: The hazards of relying upon
the modern expert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WRITER of my acquaintance, Neil Lyndon, is a man with a peculiar mission.
He wants to know how many people there are in the world. Or, more
particularly, how we know how many people there are in the world. Or, still
more particularly, how those who say they know how many people there are in
the world, can justify their claim. So he rang up the office of population
and censuses at the United Nations, and asked an information officer there
if he was right in thinking that the population of the earth now exceeded
6bn. 'Er . . . that can't be right,' said the population counter. 'It's more
like 5 1/2 bn, Isn't it?'
China, one imagines, is the source of much of the confusion. My friend asked
the man at the UN how they knew the population of China. For example, when
was the last census held in China, and how was it carried out? 'Oh dear,'
said the man from the UN. 'I very much doubt you could find anyone who could
answer that question.' So my friend rang up the Chinese Embassy in London.
No one answered. They must have been one short.
It is, one must concede to Lyndon, a big, and perhaps even an important
question. Since we tend to be given so many statistics expressed as a
percentage of the population of the world - what percentage have AIDS, for
example - it is a little unsettling to discover that they are all based on
ignorance. Unsettling perhaps, but not surprising. Stock markets for
example, seem based entirely on the principle of general ignorance about
everything of importance. If the true facts about corporate performance were
universally available and understood there would be very little difference
of opinion, and hence very little room for trading. This sort of ignorance
is acceptable, because it is somehow abstract and intangible. But general
ignorance is expanding to cover the most practical and down to earth
problems.
Take, for example, something as seemingly simple as the workings of the
internal combustion engine. It used to be the case that almost anyone who
drove a car would have a basic idea of how the engine worked. They could
imagine, armed with the necessary diagram, how the thing might be put right,
if it stuttered, stalled, or conked out. Few owners of a modern car would
have any idea what to do in a similar situation. Indeed, the electronics
have become so complex and computerised, that I much doubt if the average
garage owner has a clear idea of how to solve a breakdown in a modern
engine. Many parts have to be sent back to the manufacturers, the only
people who understand the sophisticated electronic management systems. I
suppose the retort of the car manufacturers would be that their customers
have ceased to have the same need to know how engines work, because the
things are now so much more reliable than they were. But still, as one
drives one of these gently humming beauties, it is difficult not to feel
uneasy, that one is somehow a cog in a machine beyond one's comprehension.
This is a particular example of a universal problem. Increasingly, one is
told to 'trust the expert.' The very word 'expert' has become something of a
commonplace in newspaper accounts of otherwise inexplicable events, the
readers being reassured that such and such an 'expert' or in the tabloid
press, 'boffin' has come up with such and such a theory, which explains
everything. The 'experts' sometimes work under other names such as 'doctor'
or 'garage mechanic' or 'psephoplogist' or 'environmental health officer'.
It would be pleasant always to believe that these experts are trading in
more than the blend of half understood facts, ignorance, and prejudice which
inform the beliefs of the rest of us. But that would amount to an act of
faith, just as big as that required to believe that the average garage
mechanic can mend our car engine, to believe that the United Nations office
of populations and censuses really knows how many people there are in the
world, and that there will always be someone to answer the telephone in the
Chinese Embassy.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: Brave hang at the Tate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE third time, the rehanging of the entire sequence of galleries that
hold the permanent collections at the Tate is complete. There will now be a
brief pause of a month or two before the whole process begins again. British
Petroleum, which has sponsored this rolling rehang from the outset, has
recommitted itself for a further two years, to make six in all. Change,
renewal, permanent revolution: clearly there is to be no respite. At more or
less mid-term, of both the programme and the initial period of office of the
Tate's director, Nicholas Serota, with whom it is so closely identified, it
is no bad moment to take stock.
Any criticism or debate centres not upon any particular decision or
peculiarity in the new hang, but upon general principle and the nature and
limitations of the Tate itself as our national museum both of British art,
historic and modern, and of international modern and contemporary art.
I would make clear at once that so far as appearance is concerned, each
gallery is beautifully hung, intriguing in the particular choice of works
and, as often as not, offering real surprises. Overall the sense is of a
spare and elegant arrangement, light and open. In particular, the early
decision to open up the long central axis of the gallery's sculpture halls
is again entirely vindicated. The Tate itself looks terrific.
But here we must pause to ask the fundamental question: just how long can
the fun continue? For fun it is and, which is usually the point with fun,
self-indulgent. The Tate has far more works in its collections than it can
ever show together. There is no scandal in this, for it is its statutory
duty to monitor current change, development and innovation as well as to
celebrate remarkable individual works and achievement. It must buy, buy, all
the time; and while we might sometimes question what it does buy, we must
concede that it could not be what it is meant to be without the buying.
Space, therefore, is ever at a premium, and how wonderful it is to have
these high and spacious galleries in which to show off the current selection
to such advantage. But for how much longer may we justify so spare and brave
a hang, so narrow a choice, so few works on the wall?
To the knowledgeable and regular visitor, most of all perhaps the
professional scholar, critic or artist, the Tate will remain, under its
present policies, a real and ever-renewable treat. It is always a thrill to
see a familiar work in a fresh and challenging context, to confront a major
work by a forgotten artist never seen before, to respond to work too long
critically neglected or discounted.
This is all very well, but what is the interested but general visitor to
make of it, with no special knowledge to sustain him? Where is the broader,
encompassing survey to be found, to order and inform the sequence of
displays, but in a book? For any museum to send the visitor back to his
books for further stimulation is a kind of triumph: to require it of him in
advance is perhaps to fail him. We, the professionals, know that what we now
see at the Tate is but one possible view or sequence among many, equal but
different from the last as from the next. But life is short and even we may
despair of seeing them all.
No Stanley Spencer, no Sickert, no Sutherland on current display, no Freud,
no Albert Moore, no Giacometti, a mere four galleries given to work of the
past 20 years, two of them to Joseph Beuys alone. And the treats? Room 3
full of Gainsborough at his most fresh and yet magisterial, and surely now
the greatest British painter before Turner; Room 9 full of the Victorian
academy, not just the pre-Raphaelites but Waterhouse and late Millais, who
grows ever more interesting; Room 11 for narrative Victorian realism,
Walker, Farquarson, Orchardson, Mason, Fildes; Room 23 for the British 1950s
Kitchen Sink, with Peter Coker outstanding.
There is indeed, so much to see and thoroughly enjoy. And may we look
forward to something more settled, more regular and comprehensive as the
hang rolls on: something, shall we say, a shade more permanent of the
permanent collection?

FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: French salerooms woo foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S 440 auctioneers, the most protected and privileged of Europe, are
to introduce a flat rate buyer's premium of 9 per cent as compared with the
10 per cent in force in Britain and the US as an incentive to foreign
companies. Replacing a complex four bracket system, the new system will also
entail a reduction of the seller's commission from a maximum of 7.5 per cent
to as little as 2 per cent.
Drouot salerooms in Paris say the measures have been approved by Finance
Minister Pierre Beregovoy and should be completely rubber-stamped in time
for their important auctions in May.
Christie's and Sotheby's, who may prospect but not hold sales in France,
welcome the 9 per cent but say more concessions are required before they
set-up in Paris - something they now seem unlikely to do for at least
another five years.
Other reforms of French auctioning for 1993, due to become law over coming
weeks, will make access for European auctioneers legally possible, but
technically difficult and commercially unattractive. They anger France's
biggest auctioneers who want Christie's and Sotheby's to work in Paris, but
will serve the interests of the smallest French companies who would be
driven to the wall by such competition.
Non-French auctioneers will have to sit a qualifying examination and 'abide
by French customs'. They will be able to practice anywhere in the country
instead of only in their place of residence as previously, but only under
certain restrictive conditions. The biggest obstacle for British auction
houses, however, will be the requirement, unchanged by the new laws, to buy
a licensed auctioneer's office at anything from Fr500,000 to Fr20m, which
only an individual and not a firm may legally do.
VAT rates of 5.5 per cent and 18.6 per cent on imported works of art,
meanwhile, peculiar to France, are still dissuasive for Sotheby's and
Christie's, as is the French droit de suite tax of 3 per cent which may one
day be extended to the whole of Europe.
'France is the only big market still closed to us and news of the 9 per cent
buyer's premium obviously delighted me because it is a big step in the right
direction. But major obstacles remain. We will come to Paris only when the
whole of the French auctioning profession and not just some of its most
important members is ready to welcome us,' said Francois Curiel, director of
Christie's Europe.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: Eat, drink and be merry . . . - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAITHFUL LISTENERS to the Bible readings on Radio 4, LW, had a treat this
week with Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon. The notional Preacher
'commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to
eat, and to drink, and to be merry', but then decided that 'all is vanity'.
His conclusions are unhappy, but the Authorised Version's expression of them
superb. Robert Stephens read it appropriately.
He also read in the Song of Solomon, but this anthology of allegorical
intimacy is partly a woman's song, and the rose of Sharon was ably
personified by Cathy Tyson. The near-theatrical style, directed by Ned
Chaillet, sounded well, as the lovely familiar phrases poured forth. This
was not vanity.
More familiar phrases on Sunday in Radio 3's Macbeth. It is good to hear
fresh voices in well-known lines; Tim McInnerny was a convincing Macbeth and
Harriet Walter a musically menacing Lady. I liked Kim Wall as Malcolm, a
young voice with energy that increased as events demanded. David Robb
rightly gave Banquo more dignity than Macbeth. I found the Weird Sisters
tame; perhaps they were as scared of Richard Avery's Hecate as I was. We had
much soldierly singing, and a lot of Latin that would have stung the Scots
to some equally untextual condemnation of the Pope. But in general Nigel
Bryant gave a good, straightforward, only modestly-cut production.
Also on Radio 3, A Hard Heart, a new play commissioned from Howard Barker.
This opens at the Almeida Theatre in a fortnight's time, and is broadcast
again on April 21 - an unusual tribute to the relative values of live and
broadcast theatre. The story is simple: Riddler, a brilliant, arrogant
woman, persuades the Queen that she can save their besieged city if her
spoiled son Attila is excused military service. But while she works at her
tactics, she is distracted by a vagrant improbably in love with her. She
sends him to the enemy lines with details of the defence layout, thinking
that they won't believe such an obvious trick. But Attila has signalled it
all from the roof of his chamber, so that he will be spared when the assault
comes. Riddler maintains that she has never failed, yet she must see the
Queen cutting her wrists at the defeat. The vagrant holds that the scheme
worked - but only in that it proved Riddler's love for him.
The emotional pattern is bold, if hard to sympathise with; Anna Massey's
Riddler may indeed have thought herself a god. Douglas Hodge depicted a
nasty young Attila, and Kenneth Cranham a rather sane vagrant. Only Deborah
Findlay's Queen was granted any dignity. Tactics, for what they are worth,
are weak; director Richard Wortley has asked for constant artillery, but
there is little other evidence of battle.
Radio 4's Classic Serial (first of six parts last Saturday) is Thomas Mann's
Buddenbrooks, adapted by John Peacock and directed by Jane Morgan. Though
time passes swiftly, the first instalment is mostly involved with deploying
the characters; and unless we know the novel we don't yet know how much
they'll matter. The scene is in Lubeck in the last century, the background
is high-level business, the Generaldirektor, Johann Buddenbrook, is Jack
May. Take it from here
The motion at the Radio 4 Debate on Sunday, at the Royal Geographical
Society, was that the only way to save the planet is for the West to accept
a lower material standard of living. I won't recount the arguments made,
many of them the matter of common discussion among sensible people, apart
from that brought out by Tom Burke, adviser to the Environment Secretary
(opposing). It is a dangerous delusion to suppose that a moral revolution
can possibly save the planet, he said, and in audible capital letters, THEY
ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. He is probably right, but the motion was carried by
112 votes to 43.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: No truck with inheritance trade-offs - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE to keep Holbein's 'Portrait of a lady with a pet squirrel and a
starling' in the UK is far from lost. Indeed the very haste with which the
owner, Lord Cholmondeley, advised by Christie's, has rushed the painting to
auction on April 15, with no attempt at a private treaty sale, has aroused
the fury of the heritage lobby. The pressure is on the Minister for the
Arts, Tim Renton, to use his powers to steer this poignant picture towards
its natural home in the National Gallery.
Renton has some powerful cards. Lord Cholmondeley expects a bonanza price
from the open market, an optimistic Pounds 15m plus. But whatever sum the
picture makes at Christie's he will have to pay inheritance tax of a reputed
60 per cent on the sale, which could reduce his actual cash in hand to
nearer Pounds 7m. Of course he is reluctant to pass over so many millions to
the Inland Revenue.
To avoid doing so he proposes to offer the 18th century William Kent
furnishings at Houghton, his Suffolk seat, to the nation under a unique
Acceptance-In-Lieu of tax package. But there are good reasons why Renton,
who has the final say, should oppose such a deal. It makes nonsense of the
AIL provisions to use them to secure one heritage item, the Houghton
furnishings, at the expense of another, the Holbein portrait. And for Lord
Cholmondeley the actual cost is minimal - the furniture would still grace
his home.
When Lord Rothschild tried to introduce an element of flexibility into AIL
last year, offering to buy Canova's 'The Three Graces' for the nation if the
cost could be set against his inheritance tax bill, the Minister gave him a
dusty answer.
A timely word from Renton, making clear that he will have no truck with
trade-offs, could put a private treaty deal, which would include a tax
sweetener, back on the table. The National Gallery was able to acquire an
important landscape by Aelbert Cuyp from Lord Bute by persuading him to
accept the Pounds 8m price over three years. If the after-tax value of the
Holbein is also around Pounds 8m and Lord Cholmondeley is prepared to take
the money in annual payments, the National Gallery, aided by the National
Heritage Fund, becomes a serious buyer.
Another incentive for Lord Cholmondeley is the absence of obvious bidders on
the open market. The inevitable candidate, the Getty Museum in Malibu, has
kept so far to its policy of not bidding for art works which are considered
to be part of a nation's heritage. The recession in Germany must deter the
German buyers that Christie's is lining up. A guaranteed sum from the NG,
and the thanks of a grateful nation, could seem to the young marquess an
attractive alternative to the vagaries of the market.
What has happened to Tim Renton, the normally benign Arts Minister? While
handing out his weekly alms for the needy - in this case Pounds 2m for a
Theatre Restoration Fund to patch up the likes of the Hackney Empire and the
City Varieties, Leeds - he suddenly announced the abolition of the Arts
Council as we know and love it.
Well, almost. He said he had been converted to direct Government funding of
the national flagship companies - the National Theatre and the RSC, Covent
Garden and the ENO, and other big recipients of state subsidy. This would
take away the Council's raison d'etre. Under chairman Lord Palumbo the
Council is trying to off-load the funding of smaller arts organisations to
the new regional arts boards. To retain any influence at all it must sign
the cheques for the major clients.
The views of the Big Four tend to change with the wind, championing the Arts
Council as their paymaster when they are getting large grants, preferring
direct Government funding when they think it might be more generous. At the
moment only Covent Garden, which is cross because its grant was only
marginally increased this year, supports a change. The others are reluctant
to become the pawns to what would inevitably be political decisions. The
arms length principle gives them that bit more artistic freedom.
Why has Renton rallied to what is basically Labour Party policy? It would
not be the first time the Government has done so: the switch to local arts
funding is another conversion. But setting loose this hare was totally
unexpected. It could be that Renton believes he is unlikely to keep his job
even if the Conservatives win the Election. He might as well go out with a
few fireworks.
It could also be that he feels hard done by. He travels the country with his
small initiatives - a National Music Day here; a Museum and Galleries
Improvement Fund there - but the big decisions are taken behind his back.
The Prime Minister grabbed the kudos for the European Arts Festival; the
previous Arts Minister, David Mellor, in his current job at the Treasury, is
credited with getting the arts their substantial funding rise last autumn.
Renton might be demob happy, stirring things up for his successor.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: Fair trade in Madrid - A healthy British contingent at
ARCO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR Madrid has unobtrusively taken over the baton from Dublin and is
the 1992 European City of Culture. It is a fair choice given the willingness
of Madrid, and Spain, to spend big money on the arts, both to raise national
prestige and to encourage a creative eye among the people. That is why the
public gallery to house Baron Thyssen's picture collection, probably the
last great private collection, is nearing completion opposite the Prado
rather than the National Gallery in London, and why the International
Contemporary Art Fair, ARCO, has established itself, against considerable
competition, as one of the world's great contemporary art fairs.
ARCO, which has just ended, hides its charms well. The fair has moved to a
brand new industrial exhibition centre in the dustlands north of the city
and occupies a succession of hangars which would shield a small airforce.
Once inside your prejudices disappear. There is undoubted over-kill, with
almost 200 galleries showing off art, but the plain white walls and
feet-friendly carpet make viewing manageable.
The recession, and lobbying by local dealers, cut down the room available
for overseas dealers, and almost half the space is consumed by the Spanish
trade, but the British contingent seemed happy enough with business.
Waddingtons was particularly pleased. It sold works by Flanagan and Sean
Scully, as well as by Spanish artists like Tapies (whose work was
everywhere) and Barcelo. It even disposed of a sculpture by the Catalan
artist Leiro which had lingered in its stock for years.
Annely Juda met good demand for Christo and Hamish Fulton, among others, and
Flowers East was glad to have finally made the fair, which has a long
waiting list of exhibitors. Its abrasive work by Peter Howson was too tough
for local taste this year but Angela Flowers expects to do well at ARCO in
future. In the meantime she took Pounds 500 on Saturday just selling badges,
postcards and catalogues.
Jill George was another London dealer finally allowed in. She also was happy
with the reaction to her mainly figurative work which she took to stir up
the locals with their fondness for minimalist art. A vast wall, 10 feet
square, by Ricardo Cinalli, composed of twelve giant faces, certainly
stopped the crowds in their tracks. George was hoping for one buyer at
around Pounds 25,000 but on the last day she was persuaded to divide it up
into four separate pieces, one of which has already sold.
Judging by the paucity of red spots ARCO is not so much a fair for selling
but for celebrating art. By far the most encouraging feature is the size of
the crowds. Over 150,000 made the difficult journey out to the fair during
the week and on Saturday it was like a carnival, with the place thronged by
young Spaniards taking a serious interest in everything. They are not buyers
now but they will be in a decade's time.
The quality of art on show was variable, but most of it, unlike at London
fairs, was begging to be bought. It had a 'look at me' appeal, especially
the displays on the Spanish stands which often had a flashy, bright, heat of
the sun directness - and little depth. There was little sculpture, and also
a welcome absence of the installations which make London art school shows
look like an engineering workshop. With the profusion of conceptualist art
on view ARCO held on to its reputation of being the most avant-garde of the
contemporary fairs.
ARCO finds room for video nuts; for photographers, with the highlight a
display of the work of Philip Jones Griffith including harrowing shots from
Vietnam; for holography; for philosophers keen to discuss 'the new aesthetic
paradigm'; even for lawyers, with a seminar on legal issues.
But the biggest crowds were around the stands, especially that occupied by
ACA Galleries, which flaunted ARCO's 'contemporary only' rules by displaying
paintings by Picasso and Ernst, even a Pissarro landscape. The crush was for
the work of John de Andrea, who produces life size polyvinyl models, one of
a nude, warts and all, and another of an ethereal dancer. Almost as popular
were the technology based creations at Carl Solway, personified by 'Rocket
to Virtual Venus' by Nam June Paik in which 36 TV screens spiral upwards
within an aluminium framework with a serene small head of Buddha nestling
among the hardware.
Big names - Miro, Twombley, Ben Nicholson  - jostle with the unknown and the
bizarre. There were throngs around everything, although Botero's portrait of
Franco, showing the general as just another puffed up tinpot Latin American
dictator, attracted few glances. There was greater interest on Marlborough's
stand in a large Bacon, the antithesis of Spanish taste, but an object of
keen comment.
ARCO is certainly bigger than the sum of its parts. This is mainly due to
financial priming from the Spanish Government. Not only does it transport
over journalists, but it also pays for major collectors to come across.
Watching the really rich exploiting their unexpected freebie to the limit
was performance art of the highest order.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: Wit, wisdom and musings on mortality - Screen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ALL feared that attending the Berlin Film Festival after the Wall came
down would be like watching a tennis match without a net. No more clearly
structured ideological cut and thrust in this most political of movie
events.
But festival director Moritz de Hadeln is a master at replacing one cold war
with another. When the Soviet Bloc drops out as a public enemy, he finds a
substitute in the international Press. This year we film critics - what have
we done wrong?  - have had to bus or taxi daily to the remote snowbound
'Kongresshalle': a large ugly building shaped like a hat where we spend all
day watching films far from the other guests who watch theirs in the
comfortable, centrally located Zoo-Palast.
The good news - we needed some  - is that the films have distracted us from
the venue. They are better than at any filmfestspiele I can remember. De
Hadeln has a prodigious record of luring Hollywood to Berlin, maintained
this year with Woody Allen, Paul Schrader, Lawrence Kasdan and Martin
Scorsese among the US directors represented. Meanwhile Eric Rohmer, Istvan
Szabo and Gillian Armstrong fly their films in from other climes, and around
the main competition cluster quality sideshows like the Panorama and Young
Film-Makers Forum.
Show-stealers to date are Woody Allen's Shadows And Fog, Rohmer's A Winter's
Tale and two films from Finland's Kaurismaki brothers. Allen's
black-and-white comedy is 85 minutes of spoof German Expressionism set in a
Europe where nothing has changed since Fritz Lang's M. A murderer is at
large in a fog-shrouded town; Woody Allen plays 'Herr Kleinmann', a small
worried member of the citizens' posse; and Mia Farrow is the girl he falls
for after she has escaped from her circus lover (John Malkovich) and spent a
night in an all-star brothel (Jodie Foster, Lili Tomlin, Kathy Bates).
Allen's brain is one of the great if unpredictable organs of the 20th
century. We are glad to report that Alice doesn't live there any more, that
last winsome aberration is succeeded by this gloriously witty tale of love
and death. Shadows And Fog benefits not just from Allen's own presence, here
at full comic throttle, but from strength-in-depth acting and an exquisitely
patterned plot. More on its imminent UK opening.
In A Winter's Tale French winemaster Eric Rohmer removes the corks from
three garrulous souls - pretty Felicie (Charlotte Very) and the two lovers
she must choose between - and watches as they chatter away sans cesse.
Rohmer's characters are human champagne bottles. They scintillate long after
being opened as we onlookers wonder: Will Felicie choose middle-aged Max or
pale intellectual Loic? Or will she wait for her long-lost holiday lover
Charles to whom, five years ago, she foolishly gave the wrong home address?
Plato, Pascal and other pensive matters are woven into the sun-fresh
naturalism of style.
Rohmer and Allen were in the main event. Mika Kaurismaki's Zombie And The
Ghost Train arrived at a remote platform called the Young Film-Makers Forum.
But Finland is now becoming the world export capital for downbeat movie
humour. Mika, hitherto the producer brother of Aki (The Match Factory Girl),
calls his portrait of an alcoholic young rock guitarist semi-attached to the
group 'Harry and the Mulefukkers' (sic) a tragicomedy. Never has that
schizophrenic definition seemed apter. Even at its funniest - the hero's
adventures in the army, his ill-starred love life - the film has a sense of
melancholy paralysis. Even at its gloomiest it presses a tongue slyly into
its cheek.
Mika's brother Aki brought his own two-tone movie to Berlin. His new film La
Vie De Boheme is a deadpan comedy with musings on mortality. Shot in French
in black-and-white, the film turns Henri Murger's Parisian stories (source
for Puccini's opera) into a modern-dress spoof on artistic attitudinising.
For 90 minutes we could be watching Tony Hancock's The Rebel re-envisioned
by Samuel Beckett. Then the fine-tuned dialogue and deadpan-festive cameos
(Samuel Fuller, Jean-Pierre Leaud, Louis Malle) give way to something more
sombre: a dying Mimi and a tragic pay-off not quite so persuasive as brother
Mika's.
When we wander into well-known cities in modern cinema, we no longer have
any idea whom we will meet. After finding Woody Allen in Expressionist
Europe and Sam Fuller in modern Paris, in the British competition entry Utz
we find Dutch director George Sluizer (The Vanishing) directing an
Anglo-Irish-German cast (Armin Mueller-Stahl, Brenda Fricker, Paul Scofield)
in an adaptation of Bruce Chatwin's novella.
Exhilaratingly it works. Exhilaratingly too in a festival obsessed with
mortality (it must be the fin de siecle factor), the tale of a Czech
porcelain collector (Mueller-Stahl) hoping to take his treasures beyond the
grave has a comical-tragical richness and a feeling for the crepuscular
beauties of Prague.
Sadly the BBC, who co-funded the film, threaten to deny it a UK theatrical
release. They should be protested to immediately. Britain makes few enough
good films without our throwing them away on the small screen with no
large-screen exposure first.
Not all has been magic and mastery at Berlin. An ill-informed festivalgoer
could have sat through 48 hours of rubbish in the first week if not pointed
in better directions by kindly colleagues. He could have endured Kei Kumai's
turgid Luminous Moss, a Japanese film about man eating man that gives
cannibalism a bad name; or Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes, a do-it-by-numbers
rape thriller; or Jan Troell's Il Capitano, about two Swedish youngsters who
go on a murder spree but not before boring us first with their life stories.
Then there were the high-hopes entries that crashed on take-off. In Gillian
Armstrong's The Last Days Of Chez Nous a group of ageing, charmless
Australian hippies play musical beds. In Hungary's Sweet Emma, Dear Bobe
film-maker Istvan Szabo takes a serious subject - his country's fears and
disillusionments after liberation - and sketches it in coarse, caricatural
strokes. And in David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch the Canadian director of The
Fly and Dead Ringers converts the famed William Burroughs opus into - well,
into what? A sort of droned reverie, filmed in a studio-built North Africa
prowled by monotone voice-overs and the odd engaging monster.
There is always, in extremis, Hollywood. What better subject for Berlin's
annual retrospective than Hal Roach, the 100-year-old silent comedy producer
who introduced Stan Laurel to Oliver Hardy? Mr Roach was in Berlin himself,
a sprightly, smiling centenarian.
And in the competition Schrader's Light Sleeper, Scorsese's Cape Fear and
Barry Levinson's Oscar-nominated Bugsy promise to enliven the final days. So
does Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon, of which I have had a sneak preview.
This is the best film in years from the maker of Body Heat and The Big
Chill: a giant flirtatious soap opera about interconnecting lives in Los
Angeles. The varied cast - led by Steve Martin, Kevin Kline, and Danny
Glover - show us what happens when Lotusland is attacked by human pest life.
Muggings, gang warfare, sexual assault. You thought they were obtainable
mainly in New York; you can now find them wholesale in LA Kasdan's film is
serious, funny, painful, cautionary and enlightening: much like the 45th
Berlin Film Festival.

EVER AFTER by Graham Swift Picador Pounds 14.99, 261 pages
HOWEVER much he may wish it otherwise, Graham Swift is still branded as the
author of Waterland, one of the most impressive and resonant British novels
of the 1980s. Yet that book's dynastic breadth and pungent sense of place do
set it apart from the rest of his output. The books that have followed over
the last ten years have burrowed ever inwards, worrying at the ways in which
we muddle through our lives, painfully map out our worlds, make emotional
deals and compromises.
So the tone and poise of Ever After are instantly recognisable. Although the
first-person narration is rather querulous this time, the interlocking of
narratives and their historical backdrop is distinctive. After the death of
his wife Bill Unwin, third-rate academic and recently failed suicide, has
washed up at an Oxbridge college courtesy of a fellowship set up by his
step-father's fortune. As he surveys his own past and strives for academic
credibility Unwin disinters the life of a distant ancestor - one Matthew
Pearce, Cornish surveyor, whose notebooks and letters chart his intellectual
struggles to come to terms with the rising tide of Darwinism in the 1850s,
and reveal how eventually his marriage is torn apart by his loss of faith.
Pearce sacrifices his wife and family to his unquenchable ideas, his total
loss of religious certainty. The certainty that Unwin has just lost is his
wife Ruth, a glamorous, successful actress; he shares the world's wonder at
the perfection of their marriage, takes it perhaps as redemption for a life
torn between the love for his mother and the knowledge of her part in his
own father's suicide.
Swift's subject matter and some aspects of its treatment seem oddly
familiar. It's difficult not to compare his meshing of 19th-century ideas
and mores with present-day academic life against that in A. S. Byatt's
Possession (and even its pairing of a contemporary love story with a tragic
Victorian one), while the reverberations of an intellectual world turned
upside-down by the Darwinian revolution carry their own echoes of Carey's
Oscar and Lucinda. But Swift's achievement does not attempt to compete with
either of those Booker prizewinners; his scope and ambition are more
narrowly focused than theirs, and his success more intermittent.
Ever After moves in fits and starts. At one moment it seems too irritatingly
knowing, keen to tease its readers and lead them on; at others it is limpid,
unadorned and affecting. Along the way there are the hard little nuggets of
carefully packaged historical fact - discursions on Brunel and the Great
Western Railway, bee-keeping, the raising of the William pear. But it is the
most intimate sections that burn fiercest, the fond remembrances of Unwin's
marriage that move most.
Pearce finally sets sail for America, seeking a new life to match the new
world of ideas he has acquired at so great a cost; anticlimactically he is
reported lost at sea. Unwin has survived, despite himself, to tell these
parallel tales. 'You see what this new me is like', he self-consciously
confides in the opening pages: the trouble is that we don't like what we
see, and doubt whether we would have cared much for the 'old me' either. He
botches his suicide, after rejecting the advances of an academic rival's
wife, as if to confirm his earlier observation that 'No one dies from love'.
And he lives on to celebrate the power of that love, even if he never seems
to have done anything to deserve so much past happiness.

<TEXT>
'LITERATURE is about reconciling life and death,' said Graham Swift. 'If it
can transcend the individual life of the artist then it has achieved that
purpose.'
Death is a subject which must have been much on his mind over the last few
years because mortality lies at the heart of his new book. Ever After is his
fifth novel and, Swift says, his best. The story of an undistinguished
academic who has loved and lost his wife, Ever After combines Bill Unwin's
struggle with grief and his 'obsession' with an ancestor, a Victorian who
has lost his own wife and family through his disbelief in God and a belief
in Darwinism.
'When people say about this book that it's a love story, that's fine by me.
If people say it's a story about death and mortality, that's fine by me.
That heartens me because everyone has to face their own deaths and
everybody, hopefully, will in the course of their life love and be loved.
These are very basic things.'
Ever After is Graham Swift's first novel since Out of This World was
published four years ago. Now in his early forties, he first began writing
in his early twenties when he should have been studying for a PhD. The
doctorate in Dickens was never finished but in the 1980s Swift's training
paid off and four novels and a book of short stories were finished and
published. It was Waterland, Swift's story of mystery and history in a
'fairy-tale' Fenland, which sealed his reputation and earned him a place on
the Booker Prize shortlist in 1983.
Described by one critic as 'profoundly and unmistakeably English', a
description he disagrees with, Swift has also found many readers abroad. But
Swift graciously declines to place himself within any contemporary literary
movement. 'l feel that I'm an individual writer. I think the process of
writing is one of finding yourself and finding your own voice. l suppose I
think I have my own voice and I'm certainly not looking now to other writers
to give me moral support in my own work.'
Swift's new novel, like so much of his work, is very much concerned with how
the past shapes the present and how the individual relates to history. 'I
think everyone has to accept that they are shaped by the past and I explore
that fact and I think other writers do it too. As a storyteller you are
dealing with what has happened, you are intimately involved with the process
of trying to understand the past. History is very closely bound up with the
business of narrative.'
Narrative and the process of creation is, for Swift, something magical and
mysterious. 'I begin with some seemingly fragmentary, incidental, little
thing, whether it's some scene that comes into my head, whether it's some
phrase or sentence, some little image which resonates.
'l want to lay myself open, I want my subconscious to help me. I think
novels are in a way dreamt up, that's the best way I can put it. Suddenly
there are these strange things going on in your head. In the case of the
formation of a book it's like having a very powerful far-reaching dream.'
Until Ever After, which perhaps might change things, Graham Swift's best
hope of immortality through remembrance rested with the success of
Waterland, a novel which has overshadowed his other work. It's a problem
which Swift admits might be made worse by the release later this year of a
film version of Waterland.
'It's pinned on me this label, author of Waterland, which I am very proud to
wear. But I suppose mixed with my pride about the success of that book is a
little bit of weariness. Whether or not the new book is going to eclipse
that I don't know. It's perhaps time that people said, 'well he's not just
the author of Waterland', but given that the film is coming there will be a
lot of attention on the past work as well and there's nothing I can really
do about that. It's good to have something around to say well hang on, I
didn't just write that book, there's this other one around and it's quite a
lot better.'
Swift although he has become more and more involved in the filming of
Waterland, was not interested in writing the screenplay and his loyalty
remains, above all, to the novel.
'I'm a novelist and a short story writer,' says Swift. 'I think it's very
important to remember that what fiction is all about is this invisible
mental act when the reader sits down with a book silently, unseen, and you
hope this marvellous, magical, chemistry occurs.
'That's what I write for. It's a wonderful thing.'

LUCY'S NOSE by Cecily Mackworth Carcanet Pounds 12.95, 180 pages
'LUCY R' was the Scottish governess who consulted Freud because she could
smell only burnt pudding and the whiff of cigar smoke. Freud tested his
'talking cure' on her, dredging up memories and emotions associated with the
smells while the governess lay primly on his couch, and then told her 'I
believe you are in love with your employer'. Soon afterwards, Lucy was
'cured', slipped out of Freud's life and is remembered only as a brief case
history in his early work, Five Studies in Hysteria. Who was Lucy, and what
happened to her?
Lucy's Nose began as Cecily Mackworth's attempt to find out. She searched
the Vienna archives, but discovered that while more famous Freud patients -
the Rat Man, the Wolf Man, Little Hans  - had been easily identified and
traced, nothing is known of Lucy, not even her name, beyond the fact of her
visits to Freud's surgery at 19, Bergasse, over several months in 1892-93.
So Lucy's Nose became her fictionalised story of Lucy, interwoven with
details of Freud's life at the time of the case and an account of her own
researches.
Mackworth's Lucy is a tightly-laced, naive woman of 30 who has suddenly
found herself dancing to the foreign tune of fin de siecle Vienna. The palmy
days of partying and kaffee und kuchen are worlds away from her native
Glasgow; her temperamental, guilt-ridden employer might have stepped out of
the love-circle of Schnitzler's La Ronde. No wonder the rococo extravagance
sends poor Lucy's fantasies of love and fulfilment out of control, and
olfactory hallucinations take over; nevertheless her Scottish sobriety can't
help conflict with the wild ideas of Vienna's trendy young doctor. 'But I am
not asleep', she insists, when Freud tries to hypnotise her. And - her
parting shot  - 'after all, I can have thoughts and feelings to myself'.
Like every exchange between Freud and Lucy in Mackworth's story, this comes
straight out of Freud's own account. One reason why Freud continues to be so
widely read today is the fluency and absolute conviction of his writing; his
case histories read like compressed novels. Lucy's Nose is one of these
novels uncompressed, a classic tale of fear and repression unfolding into
shaky self-knowledge.
The 'factual' encounters between doctor and patient are the pillars of this
version; Ms Mackworth's sensitively tuned embellishments extend not only to
Lucy's mid-session hopes and dreams but to those of the struggling doctor
too. No famous post-1900 Freud here, his couch filled by a succession of
glamorous women, but an over-eager doctor, crushed when a patient responds
badly, desperate to cling on to a promising case, fighting intellectual
isolation and Viennese anti-Semitism. 'The poets and philosophers before me
discovered the unconscious. What I discovered was the scientific method by
which the unconscious can be studied', said Freud. In recent years, doubt
has been cast on the complete authenticity of some of his examples; that a
compelling and convincing fiction like this one can be woven out of a case
history suggests that the fine line between fact and fantasy in Freud's
writing is not of the first importance, that Freudian psychology took on a
momentum depending less on the rigour of Freud's scientific method than on
insights developed by the man himself.
Ms Mackworth's book, unravelling Lucy's story through images and
undercurrents of thought, well-paced, scholarly in its refusal to take any
assumption for granted, honest in its account of her own dead-ends of
research, is in a sense a tribute. At times her enthusiasm for Freud's
Vienna carries her away ('off they stride into the bitter central European
winter'), but mostly the subjectivism is liberating, allowing her to follow
hunches and intuitions which a stricter approach would prevent. The result
is a happy hybrid, a work in the small and excellent tradition of recent
studies - Richard Holmes' Footsteps, Denis Donoghue's Warrenpoint - which
combine biography and criticism with autobiography and personal anecdote:
for anyone who likes his reading offbeat, a quietly fascinating and
perceptive tale.

GRANDCHILDREN OF ALBION edited by Michael Horovitz New Departures (Piedmont,
Bisley, Stroud, Glos.) Pounds 9.99, 416 pages
CHILDREN OF Albion was an anthology of underground poetry in Britain 'edited
and extradicted' by Michael Horovitz, published as a Penguin paperback in
1969. With its title and cover design from William Blake and long,
dithyrambic Afterword by the extradicter, it was and remains a flavoursome
product of its period, an authentic document of a 'counter-culture' vital
enough in its poetic energies to win praise from such an 'overground' figure
as Ted Hughes.
Horovitz's canon of alternative writings comprised political protest poetry
such as Adrian Mitchell's famous 'To Whom It May Concern', dialect poems
like Tom Pickard's Geordie 'Shag', and poems influenced in general by the
experience of public reading. Horovitz was an instigator of the first
International Poetry Incarnation at the Albert Hall in 1965, an event which
did much to set the fashion for poetry as performance.
If it seemed paradoxical to establish a 'canon' of works whose thrust was
precisely to de-academise the writing and appreciation of poetry, both of
which had reached heights of hermetic irony in the preceding years of the
'Movement', the anthology read in retrospect has a satisfying and
qualitative feel, and I find it rather more interesting now than when I
first encountered it in the 1970s.
But Horovitz regards the 'underground' impulse as having continued unabated,
its radicalism having become a part of our everyday lives and at the same
time been retained as a necessary protest against new ills. He himself has
kept the flame alive by organising 'Poetry Olympics' for the performance of
verse and by editing his irregular journal New Departures. These allied
ventures are reflected in this new anthology to which he has given the
logical but somewhat self-dismissive title Grandchildren of Albion.
The book is strikingly inferior to its parent. Horovitz's generosity of
spirit has led him to embrace just about any work that kicks against a
poetry Establishment defined in terms of Craig Raine's 'Martian school' and
the Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry. 'All-white's alright' is
the motto imputed to the latter, whereas Horovitz's anthology bends over
ideologically backwards to accommodate 'a quorum of the most energetic
diversity of black, Asian, female and feminist, regional, urban and rural,
communal, ecological and heterodox extremes based in Britain', as he phrases
it in a much briefer though more militant Afterword than 1969's.
His ethical stance seems to have impaired his aesthetic judgment, for many
of the poems included here would be embarrassing in a school magazine, while
the visual appearance of the book - with its eclectic graphics, roughly
assorted illustrations, stretches of musical notation, and mysteriously
dropped first 16 page numbers - bespeaks no great fastidousness. It is one
of the messiest publications I've seen.
The book's deeper problem is that the counter-culture has not survived as a
significant force in the way that Horovitz would like to think. In the 1960s
it was apprehended, even by its opponents, as a positive, central force, not
to be confined to the margins of society, always threatening the whole.
Adrian Mitchell's proud rhetoric ('Tell me lies about Vietnam') has an
authority deriving from a profound political consensus; his bitterness is
decidedly supra-personal. But the Thatcher years have reduced many of
Albion's grandchildren to a smouldering personal rancour. They do not bear a
global weight of responsibility so much as a chip on the shoulder.
The over-generous selection from Carol Ann Duffy's work has an unappealing
hardness of tone that is typical. Nor has the tradition of
poetry-in-performance helped matters: virtually all these pieces have an eye
on audience effect and poetry is all too often trivialised into anecdote.
The strength of the anthology is probably its large quota of Caribbean
dialect poems, though their consequence is not always easy to distinguish
from their quaintness (but that's a problem with Chaucer too). Pieces like
John Agard's 'Palm Tree King' and 'Listen Mr Oxford Don' and Valerie Bloom's
children's ballad 'Don' Go Ova Dere' are funny, fetching and hard to forget.
After Fiona Pitt-Kethley's scurfy anecdotes, the lower-case feminist
doodlings of Michele Roberts, and Attila the Stockbroker's weak suburban
satires, they come as a considerable relief.

CYBERSPACE: FIRST STEPS edited by Michael Benedikt MIT Press Pounds 19.95,
436 pages
LOST IN Cyberspace? Then blame Descartes: 'I have, on the one hand, a clear
and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and, on the
other hand, a distinct idea of my body as an extended, non-thinking thing;
it is therefore certain that I am truly distinct from my body, and can exist
without it' (Meditations, 1642). Three hundred and fifty years on,
technology has proved this almost instinct almost true. Leibniz arrived in
1666 with his idea of 'electric language' for logical reasoning outside
language, and the coordinates for Cyberspace were set.
Cyberspace: First Steps, is a difficult, technical and interdisciplinary
collection of 15 essays from architects, philosophers, Sci-Fi writers and
intellectual historians. It gives the history of a technology that will
alter our lives next century, although no one knows exactly how. The essays'
limitations - obscurity, obtuseness and jargon - are entirely consistent
with confusions surrounding VR technology. No one knows what kind of world
the technology is driving us towards.
The history, however, is plain enough. After written texts (around 1600)
came the electronic revolution (after 1900) and the age of information
technology (after 1960). In 1984, the Sci-Fi writer William Gibson coined
the term 'Cyberspace' in Neuromancer, a bewildering journey through a matrix
of 'collective hallucination.' Instead of sitting at the computer keyboard
controlling information, Gibson's characters were inside the matrix. They
were information.
The current pop-example of Cyberspace is the new 'Virtual Reality' (VR)
technology. This lets a computer's users represent themselves in three
dimensions and wander around with other bits of electronic information in
the computer's memory; this technology has become useful for architects,
designers and fire fighters as well as games-players. But Cyberspace is more
than that; it is the place where all information, visualised spatially,
moves along electronic networks between users; the place where data is
collected and robots controlled remotely; the place where the mind floats
free of the body.
So, what does living in Cyberspace mean? Many people are already there. With
portable PCs and modems, we are turned into nomads who are always in touch.
Within the permanently ephemeral world created by digital television, PCs
and high bandwidth cable or radio-frequency networks, we build structures of
information like data visualisation, user networks or graphic user
interfaces. These structures exist in the country called Cyberspace: bank
accounts, credit ratings, company files.
The rules of evolution for Cyberspace have yet to be defined. That
uncertainty makes these essays an adventure in honest perplexity. The
Cyberspace revolution has spawned a new commentator, the Cyber-architect,
who unites (as traditional architects do) the disciplines of design,
technology and sociology. The language which explains Cyberspace is
overwhelmingly architectural: dimensions, structures, habitations. But there
is no obvious 'natural space' equivalent for motion or physical interaction
in Cyberspace. Those who write about it in this collection are mining in
unknown seams with an occasional pit-prop and no illumination from the
outside world.
Now, Cyberspace research is beginning to call into question our very notions
of 'space', 'intelligence' and 'perception'; so these essays are a taxing
excursion in philosophical and semantic thinking. The contributors require a
highly eclectic knowledge from their reader, who is expected to be familiar
with such disparates as Baudrillard, Habermas, Lacan, CS Lewis, le
Corbusier, McLuhan, Merleau-Ponty and Gerard de Nerval. Michael Benedikt's
editing is rather too light for the non-specialist, but then Cyberspace
involves enough disciplines to make a nonsense of specialism.
Since no process of logical reasoning can add to the information which its
founding axioms contain, nor to the observations from which it proceeds
(information encoded in a molecule of DNA or an architect's blueprint), and
since Cyberspace has yet to decide on its logical processes and its axioms,
this is a fascinating area which allows every intellectual discipline a fair
shout. Few academic subjects are confident enough not to exclude others
these days.
Perhaps because Cyberspace is a country of the mind, the laws of the
imagination will turn out to be the processes which govern the new
electronic frontiers. As Dr Johnson said, 'Were it not for imagination, sir,
a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Duchess.'

DREADNOUGHT: BRITAIN, GERMANY AND THE COMING OF THE GREAT WAR by Robert K
Massie Jonathan Cape, Pounds 20,
THIS IS a book you are bound to enjoy. It is a chronicle of the Anglo-German
naval rivalry placed against the broader background of the personal and
national clashes that led to the Great War. The set pieces  - the naval
review of June 1897, the Jameson Raid, the Kaiser's visits to Windsor,
Winston Churchill visiting the fleet, 'the spring of the panther' - are
dramatically re-created.
The pen portraits of the political and naval establishments of Wilhelmine
Germany and Victorian and Edwardian Britain are brilliantly evoked with a
sharp eye for the memorable detail (Bismark's knowledge of Walter Scott's
novels is a case in point). Massie keeps his complex story under tight
control, covering large areas of domestic history and international
manoeuvring without losing his reader's attention. Monographers like myself
can only envy the sheer sweep of Dreadnought and the author's rich palette
of colours so deftly applied. Like Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August, this is
narrative history at its very best.
There are but a few instances where the author's appeal to a general
audience dictates his selection of high points. There is an extended
treatment of the Eulenburg affair, an intimate of the Kaiser brought to
trial for homosexuality. We are presented again with the now seemingly
obligatory account of Winston Churchill's unhappy childhood, the school
beatings, nanny and all, as well as his early adventures in the Sudan.
Occasionally, a major figure escapes even Massie's skilful brush. He can do
little with Sir Edward Grey, the all-important yet ultimately elusive
British foreign secretary, who was left permanently shocked by his failure
to preserve peace in 1914. For Grey, more than any other British politician,
played the decisive role in determining Britain's course in July.
Multi-dimensional in approach and amply filled with larger-than-life
politicians and seamen, this book is necessarily short on analysis but also
curiously inconclusive. As Massie knows, the dreadnought race did not lead
to an Anglo-German war. That issue was really settled by 1912 and relations
between Berlin and London were far better in 1914 than they had been
earlier. The naval race, as Massie's central them, leaves little room for
any real examination of the roots of the Great War and the German and
British decisions to engage in it.
The British decision, taken out of weakness rather than strength, haunted
the imaginations of the inter-war generation and remains the subject of
sharp historical debate. Belgium was but a fig-leaf to cover radical doubts;
more deep-seated fears of the consequences of neutrality convinced the
Cabinet waverers to cast their vote for Mars. We are not told why they
should have thought that this war could be fought on the high seas and so
believed its course to be limited. Nor why all the statesmen of Europe
believed that the conflict would be a short one, an illusion that critically
influenced their actions.
Robert Massie's final chapters, already too crowded to give full play to the
drama of that final crisis, omit much that is critical to any understanding
of the origins of the Great War. For this, one must consult a different kind
of book. If only it could be as engrossing and readable as this one.

'I DON'T like the family Stein', rhymed a pre-war wag. 'There's Gert and

revolutionary fervour and changed it utterly. But the long-term influence of
Gert - on English prose  - is the most dubious of their achievements.
Gertrude's innovative speciality, the circular sentence - 'Rose is a rose is
a rose' - has, it is true, become one of the trademarks of post-modernist
literature; but today's exponents put much more intellectual muscle behind
it than is found in her verbal marking-time. A phrase such as Beckett's
'Imagination dead imagine', repeated several times in the work of which it
is the title, is not merely an incantation, it precisely reconstructs a
state of mind.
In this double-biography, Diana Souhami is concerned with the life of
Gertrude Stein and that of her inseparable companion Alice Toklas, rather
than any fresh appraisal of Stein's work. Most of it is nowadays little read
even by students. The loyal Virago did their best with two Stein re-prints
in the 1980s but not to much avail. What remains fascinating is the
personality of a woman whose literary effrontery caused her for a while to
be compared with Joyce.
Souhami describes the only occasion the two writers met. It was in Paris in
the 1930s and it was very brief. On being introduced Gertrude said: 'After
all these years.' Joyce replied, 'Yes and our names are always linked
together.' Gertrude followed this with, 'We live in the same
arrondissement'. And at that point the conversation petered out.
Ezra Pound was rather more forthcoming. He went to dinner with Gertrude and
Alice in their flat at 27 rue de Fleurus, and enjoyed Alice's superb
cooking. Unfortunately when discussing TS Eliot, or maybe it was Japanese
prints, he became over-excited and broke the back of a chair. 'Ez is fine,'
said Gertude later, 'but I can't afford to have him in the house'. For his
part Pound did not think all that much of her work. As he wrote to Wyndham
Lewis in 1935, '. . . feel all this flow of conSquishousness Gertie/Jimmie
stuff has about FLOWED long enuff'.
Gertie was a great rejecter of people. She quarrelled and eventually broke
completely with most of her relations including her brother Leo. Like his
more famous sister, Leo was an eccentric, an expatriate and an early patron
of Picasso. Her rejects among her former-proteges included many of 'the lost
generation' - that label was borrowed by Gertrude from a French friend. It
was Alice's job to tell affronted callers that Miss Stein regrets she is not
at home today nor will she be in future. Happily Gertrude's friendship with
Man Ray lasted long enough for him to do several portraits of her and one of
her white poodle, Basket. Cecil Beaton then took over.
She was strangely, massively photogenic. Hemingway, a protege until he began
to make good, remembered Gertrude, in A Moveable Feast, as being 'very big
but not tall and . . . heavily built like a peasant woman. She had beautiful
eyes and a strong German-Jewish face . . . her lovely thick, alive,
immigrant hair which she wore put up in the same way she had probably worn
it at college.' And he describes Alice as having 'a very pleasant voice . .
. small, very dark, with her hair cut like Joan of Arc . . . a very hooked
nose. She was working on a piece of needlepoint when we first met them and
she worked on this and saw to the food and drink and talked to my wife'.
Picasso just about lasted the course as a close friend, as did that much
inferior painter Gertrude later patronised heavily, the English artist
Francis Rose. Another gifted chum was Virgil Thomson. He composed the music
for Gertrude's opera Four Saints in Three Acts. The work contains a sentence
'Pigeons on the grass alas' which has since found its way into the Oxford
Dictionary of Quotations. With an all-black cast, and choreographed by
Frederick Ashton, this curious opera was seen by many of the famous when
performed in New York in 1934.
Both Gertrude and her lover Alice came from Jewish-American families settled
in the West. The attraction between them was instant, the bond life-long.
Gertrude had had a previous love-affair with a woman called May Bookstaver,
a fact she concealed from Alice. The pattern of slave (Alice) and mistress
(Gertrude) was soon firmly established but we watch the balance of
dependence gradually swing in Alice's favour; she had no easy task
ministering to Gertrude's imperious needs and whims.
Yet you cannot but admire Gertrude's brute courage as much as Alice's power
of endurance. They operated a private ambulance, distributing medical
supplies to hospitals throughout France, in the latter part of the first
war, and in the second they lived right through the Occupation in their
country house at Bilignin in Haute-Savoie. Gertrude somehow succeeded at
long-range in preserving the Picassos in the flat in Paris from being
plundered by the Gestapo.
Most of Gertrude's literary works, including her ecstatic accounts of her
love-making, were so inaccessible to the ordinary reader that no commercial
publisher would risk bringing them out. She had to sell a painting or two to
finance publication. It was only when Gertrude wrote more comprehensibly in
her book on Picasso and above all in the The Autobiography of Alice B.
Toklas (Gertrude identifying publicly with Alice) and its sequel Everybody's
Autobiography that she became a best-seller. That led to the two ladies
making a triumphal tour of America before the second war.
Gertrude died suddenly in 1946 aged 72. Alice became overnight the
classically protective author's widow. More paintings were sold so that all
Gertrude's unpublished work could be printed, a project heroically
undertaken by Yale University and the writer Carl Van Vetchen. He had been a
close friend and as 'Papa Woojums' had learnt to speak the baby-language
Gertrude used with Alice at times of endearment.
Alice had problems implementing this publishing project; she in her turn
quarrelled with the Steins, her co-beneficiaries. But she was by no means
finished. She struggled on bravely with Basket the Second for companionship.
She made some new friends and in her old age converted to Catholicism. Then
she wrote a highly successful cook-book, and eventually in 1967, just short
of her 90th birthday, was reunited with Gertrude in Pere Lachaise where they
both now lie in a joint tomb. The strange story of this long lesbian
love-affair has been thoroughly well told in this book - one that is much
easier to read than any by Gertrude Stein.

AFTER APARTHEID by Sebastian Mallaby Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 224 pages
IT IS a brave journalist who, in his own book about South Africa, draws
attention to a classic text by a member of the same profession. Sebastian
Mallaby of the Economist, based in southern Africa from 1989-90,
acknowledges Move Your Shadow by Joe Lelyveld of the New York Times as one
of his 'models of good writing'. After Apartheid has much to recommend it.
There are some sharp observations and insights, and revealing anecdotes. It
combines detachment with sensitivity. But it does not stand the comparison
that has been invited.
It may be that it is simply too soon to write a book about South Africa's
transition to democracy. Explaining why apartheid failed is one thing. It is
very much more difficult to say what will replace it. 'With its communists
and neo-Nazis, its Christians, Jews and Muslims, its Afrikaners and English,
its Indians and Coloureds, Xhosas and Zulus, Sothos and Vendas - with all
its bubbling variety, how could South Africa build the basic consensus that
democracy requires?'
Quite so. 'South Africa's new constitution would have to cater to diversity
of both race and tribe . . . the question was how to do it.' The irritating
use of tense implies an historical perspective from which the author can
provide the answer.
He cannot, though his guess may well turn out to be correct. Neither the
African National Congress nor the National Party has an alternative to
negotiations, writes Mallaby. The ANC will be an important partner, if not
the senior partner, in any future coalition - although it is not clear just
where Mangosuthu Buthelezi fits in; and at least one or two white
politicians will remain in the cabinet.
But too little of the negotiating process has unfolded to allow Mallaby to
show us just how South Africa will get from its current state to consensus
and coalition; or what lessons other African countries can draw from South
Africa's exercise in constitution making when it comes to resolving their
own ethnic tensions, and reconciling majority rule with minority rights.
Around this unsatisfactory core of the book are excursions into South
Africa's familiar past, further predictions, and tenuously linked accounts
of the author's experiences in Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
No new ground is broken in sections dealing with the effect of sanctions on
the South African economy, the bloody rivalry between black political
parties, or the well known story of Winnie Mandela and her gang of thugs.
Fears of a violent backlash from the extreme white right are seen as
exaggerated, although several South African cabinet ministers are not so
confident. Perhaps Mallaby has fallen between two stools. In presenting
South Africa's search for post-apartheid democracy against the wider
backdrop of Africa's post-independence disaster, he has been able to do
justice to neither.
Of course he is right to stress the critical importance of land
redistribution in post-apartheid South Africa, and it forms one of the most
interesting chapters in the book. But a whistle stop examination of land
policies in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Kenya, with a few paragraphs on
Asia and South America thrown in, is not very helpful.
Mallaby is at his best when reporting, rather than speculating or providing
potted history. His account of an excursion aboard a South African company
jet doing the rounds of its commercial outposts is as revealing as it is
entertaining.
The run takes in Malawi, which does not hide its trade with Pretoria;
Mozambique, where the company managed the state-owned chicken farms; Zambia,
where sanctions obliged the company to pose as British and route faxes from
Johannesburg via London; and Zaire, where hens and hen-coops were flown in
from South Africa in response to President Mobutu sese Seko's demand for a
chicken farm.
There was one problem. The hens were not laying, and the president was
expecting distinguished guests. They would want to see results. So another
plane was despatched, loaded with eggs, one to be tucked under each chicken.
'A European company would never have done that', said the shrewd South
African chairman.

FT  22 FEB 92 / As They Say in Europe: This troubled sporting life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL sport arouses xenophobia among the British, paranoia among the
French and, inevitably, Angst among the Germans.
Ladies first: the world's fastest female, Katrin Krabbe, cheated on a dope
test in South Africa and was banned for four years as a result. So there is
a new word in the German language - Urinmanipulation. The neologism covers
the action of Ms Krabbe and a compatriot who thought they might save time
and trouble by presenting a sample delivered by a third lady as
representative of them all.
Our heroine is known as Die goldene Brandburgerin. There must be a Schubert
song cycle of that title which is somehow relevant to this sad tale. Ms
Krabbe is, inevitably, a privileged product of the old German Democratic
Republic. The Sachsische Zeitung from Dresden in the east lamented that the
story was going to provide 'yet another variation on the theme of 'trouble
with the east Germans.'' The reference here is to the disdain which
'Wessies' have developed for 'Ossies' since unification.
But in fact the western press fell over itself to be fair. As the
Saarbrucker Zeitung put it: 'When the fastest woman in the world has bought
her sprint prowess at a pharmacy, she can expect no pity. But the
urine-exchange game is not a specifically Ossie problem. In the west the
test-water frequently changed ownership but only minor sinners were caught
in the old federal states.'
Neue Presse of Hanover concurred. 'The Krabbe ban must not result in a
political campaign against the Ossies, not every Saxon won thanks to the
syringe.' Another paper noted that the German Olympic medals at Albertville
were largely the product of the old GDR which has given rise to a new
saying: 'Thuringia beats the USA.'
But nobody, as far as I could see, had actually said the affair proved just
how awful the Ossies were. What all this shows is that right-minded people
in Germany are so afraid that any exposure of sin and error might become an
occasion for persecution, that they leap to the defence of the potential
persecutee even before a fist has been raised.
Unlike the French. To be fair they did not exactly rush to the defence of
Messrs Moscato and Lascube who got expelled from the France-England rugby
match last Saturday, and then were banned for several months.
But the rugby brawl did lead to much questioning of Anglo-French relations.
So this is not a tale of rugby but of life itself.
Numerous papers reproduced the work of a news agency piece which could have
been entitled, 'As they say in England.' It summarised the comments about
the French of British rugby reporters: 'Animals, savages, wild, shameful.'
French rugby writers believe their players will be seen as a bunch of thugs
whatever they do. As a result, the theory runs, the (northern) Irish
referee, Steve Hilditch, went on the field prepared to find the French
guilty of everything. In an editorial in Le Figaro, Jean-Pierre Lacour wrote
that international consultations were necessary; 'In the future Mr Hilditch
must not find himself in a context where, quite naturally, a Frenchman is
more suspect than an Englishman.'
Gerard Baudouin wrote in France-Soir: 'There is no doubt that Mr Hilditch
started the match with pre-conceived ideas.' The nub of French case was not
that each decision taken in isolation was necessarily wrong (although some
were) but that it was taken in a context that ignored other relevant events.
In fact the French 'defence' reflects exactly the difference in the ways the
English and the French approach everything. Thus the French argue that last
Saturday's shambles was only partly the product of French thuggery; it was
also the reflection of a specific historical situation.
The violence needed a trigger which turned out to be two highly
controversial decisions which led to England being handed six points by the
referee at a time when they were one point behind.
This may seem boring to those who have no interest in Rugby Union but it
explains why the English and the French will always squabble. What the
latter see as central events in this affair might occupy the court for a
whole day if it came to a trial in France but would be inadmissible as
evidence in England. And that matters when the English put the French in the
dock.
A novel solution to the impasse was proposed. M Lacour in Le Figaro
suggested that the French Rugby Union should study infractions and their
punishment in British games. And, he said, English players had to be told
that the Five Nations Tournament was not the Hundred Years War.
Fact: The malefactor Lascube plays for Agen, a town that the dauphin agreed
to cede to Edward III in 1360. The French broke that agreement.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Motoring: Safety first as VW goes for airbags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOK back over the past 50 years and you find that what started out as
unique features of cars then became commonplace and finally turned into
essential equipment no buyer would dream of doing without.
Take heaters. The first volume-produced British car to have one was the
Austin 16 of the late 1940s. It took the chill off the inside but, as mature
drivers will recall and young owners of collectable motors have discovered,
if you wanted fresh air you had to open a window. Within 10 years, though,
drivers of all but the cheapest vehicles had proper through-flow heating and
ventilating systems which de-misted and de-frosted as well as keeping them
warm.
Other features first seen as revolutionary, but which soon became
conventional, were independent suspension, five-speed transmissions with
synchromesh on all gears, heated rear windows, radial-ply tyres and ABS
(anti-lock) brakes. Most of today's motorists can have little idea what it
is like to drive cars without screen-washers, radio/tape players, outside
mirrors and double dipping headlamps, and with safety belts - if you wore
them  - that pinned you immovably in your seat.
Not all innovations have caught on. Two that came post-Second World War from
the US and soon died in Europe were bench-type front seats and steering
column gear-shifts (although both are still alive and well in the
medium-size Toyotas and Nissans used as taxis in Japan). But two other
US-inspired items, the catalytic converter and airbag, will fare better in
Europe.
The converter, invented to solve the smog problem in a few Pacific-coast
cities, will be compulsory for all new petrol-engined European cars from
next year. (Never mind that it has failed to clean-up California's air and
diverted attention from the real, long-term answer - the development of
lean-burn engines that reduce pollution by using far less fuel).
So far, the airbag has played an insignificant part in reducing injuries and
deaths to car occupants in Europe. There are two reasons: it has been very
costly and seat belts must by law be worn in all European countries. In the
US, there is no such requirement and only a minority wear them - an odd
situation for a country that is, otherwise, hag-ridden by consumer
protectionists.
By itself, an airbag is much less effective at preventing injuries than a
lap and diagonal seat belt. But, used in conjunction with belts - especially
the kind that tighten automatically at the moment of impact - it offers a
very high degree of protection.
Mercedes-Benz invented the airbag and first fitted them to cars sold in the
US in 1980. About 700,000 Mercedes cars with bags are in use round the
world, although not many of them in Europe. Airbags have been an optional
extra for Mercedes' buyers in Britain since 1984 but, at Pounds 1,433 each
for driver and front passenger, there were not many takers. Last October,
driver-side airbags were made standard equipment on the new S-class, the SLs
and the 500E. And the option price for lesser models was almost halved, to
Pounds 750 apiece.
Now, Volkswagen has said that, for just Pounds 500 a pair, buyers of the new
Vento (a booted Golf that arrives in Britain late this year) will be offered
airbags for drivers and front passengers. These 'Euro-bags' are cheaper
because they are smaller than those fitted by Mercedes. They are meant
strictly to supplement seat belts, not to be used instead of them (as do
many US drivers of cars with airbags). Their main job is to lessen the risk
of facial injuries.
Volkswgen's offer of cheap Euro-bags to Vento-buyers is courageous, It seems
likely to be as trend-setting as was Ford's decision eight years ago to make
ABS brakes standard on every Granada.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Golf: The decade of the oldies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN GOLF the 1980s was an age of excess. The 1990s are different. They will
have an excess of age. This is no bad thing.
Last week there were two separate signs that to be old is not necessarily to
be forgotten. First came the launching of The Oldie, a magazine edited by
Richard Ingrams for those in middle age. Hardly had that hit the streets
than the PGA European Tour announced the start of a tournament circuit for
senior professional golfers, ie those over 50.
A minimum of eight tournaments with a total prize money fund of more than
Pounds 500,000 will be staged in England, Wales, Ireland and France between
April and October this year. At some of these venues you will be able to see
men who will take you back to the '70s, '60s, even the '50s, men like Neil
Coles, Gary Player and Christy O'Connor. 'I am tempted to get my clubs out,'
Peter Alliss said last week on hearing about the proposed new tour. Then he
added: 'There's no fool like an old fool.'
In launching this tour golf is following a trend to longer participation in
sport, a trend that has become more apparent recently. Both swimming and
skiing have their Masters' championships with age-group categories as high
as 75 and over. If you are a rugby supporter you will be familiar with the
Golden Oldies rugby events for men over 35.
Why are we playing sport longer? Because as a race we humans are generally
healthier than ever with more leisure time and money on our hands. And in
Britain, at least, we are living longer. In 1961 the average life expectancy
of a man was 57.9 years. In 1988 it was 72.4. A consequence of this is that
the numbers of those over 60 are increasing. There were 7.8m men and women
in this age category in 1961. By 1990 that had risen to 10.5m and by the
year 2030 it is projected to be 14.1m.
Golf is an ideal game to be played later in life, more suitable than
violent, body-damaging games such as rugby and soccer. It is also one of the
best, if not the best, at which to combine business and pleasure. The
courses may need to be shortened and perhaps flags should be placed in less
terrifying positions on the greens but in many other respects the game is
the same for a 45- or 55-year-old as a 25-year-old.
Lee Trevino slogged wearily through the last few years on the US men's tour
until he could become eligible for the senior tour. 'I'm tired of playing
against the flat bellies,' sighed Trevino as he approached his 50th
birthday. 'I want to play against the round bellies.' And when he did he
thought he had died and gone to heaven. The man who was born into extreme
poverty and never knew his father won seven events and more than Dollars 1m
in his first year. That memorable year he was the leading money-winner in
all golf, not just seniors' golf.
The inaugural season of the seniors' tour reminds me a little of the early
years of the mens' tour. Prize money is small - Pounds 60,000 or less at
seven of the scheduled eight events, which is chicken feed compared with the
average purse on the men's tour of nearly Pounds 400,000. Whereas the men's
events invariably start with a pro-am on Wednesday followed by one round
each day, concluding on Sundays, the seniors will more often than not be
three-day events including the pro-am.
To my mind, seniors' golf is to be championed as much as three-hour rounds
and golfers who carry their clubs. It bears far more relation to the
standard of golf that most of us play than does the sort of golf
demonstrated by Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam and the like.
My idea of a nightmare would be to partner Seve Ballesteros in a pro-am
because I would be so nervous I would be shaking in my shoes. A heavenly
pro-am partner, on the other hand, would be Peter Alliss, if only I could
stop him talking. With him there would be no shortage of gossip and with a
bit of luck he would correct my hook.
Men of 50-plus are more interesting to talk to because they have knocked
around a bit. They have learned to show a genuine interest in their pro-am
partners and are no longer as self-centred as they were when they were
younger. They are more aware of their duties in a pro-am, less likely to
intimidate and might even fluff the odd downhill chip. And they can still
play golf a bit.
I am in favour of this tour. Deep in the most severe recession many of us
have ever known is hardly the most auspicious time in which to launch a
project such as this. Yet it is 21 years since the start of the European
Tour itself and look how that has grown. Perhaps one day soon we shall be
talking about a seniors' Ryder Cup?

FT  22 FEB 92 / Tennis: Now Courier is the target - The rise and rise of the
Dude from Dade City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF HE had not been involved in an almighty row in a Rome car park last May,
Jim Courier, the personable American from Dade City, Florida, might not now
be the world's No. 1 tennis player.
After being confronted by his two coaches, Jose Higueras and Brad Stine, who
accused him of not having the guts to be a great player, Courier came to
terms with his own fears of success and immediately won the French
championship. His upward progress since then has been remarkable.
For the past two weeks, though, the Dude from Dade (I suppose it was
inevitable]) has discovered the truth of that old saying about life being
tough at the top. On Saturday, February 8, the dynamic 21-year-old beat
California's Derrick Rostagno in the semi-finals of a tournament in San
Francisco and overtook Sweden's Stefan Edberg at the top of the ATP Tour
computer rankings. From that moment, he was there to be shot-at.
The first shots were fired the very next day by Michael Chang - and very
accurate they were, too. The diminutive American, ranked 16 at the time,
beat Courier 6-3 6-3 - perhaps to remind him that he owed Chang a debt. For
it was Chang who, in 1989, became the first American winner in Paris since
Tony Trabert in 1955.
Last Sunday, in the Brussels final, Courier found himself facing another man
with something to prove.
Boris Becker, like Edberg, had asked the organisers of the Donnay Indoor for
a wild card. Becker's mission was simple. A year ago, he had at last become
the world's No. 1 by beating the holder, Ivan Lendl, in the final of the
Australian Open. 'It was the greatest moment of my life,' Becker said at the
time, 'the culmination of a dream.'
Edberg ended that dream by taking the No. 1 ranking away from Becker twice
in 1991 and, finally, keeping it. So, in Brussels, Becker wanted to beat
Edberg to begin the repair of his ranking, which had slipped to No. 5.
Then, too, he had a score to settle with Courier. He wanted to show the
American upstart - who, three weeks ago in Melbourne, usurped his Australian
crown - that his own surprising loss there to John McEnroe was a mere
accident. (Actually, McEnroe had quite a lot to do with it, I can assure
you).
When Becker beat Edberg convincingly in their Brussels semi-final last
Saturday, Courier said he expected a difficult final against a man he had
never beaten in three previous meetings. How right he was. Although the
American played well, wielding those ungainly but effective ground strokes
with great energy and skill to win the first two sets and create three match
points in the third set tie-break, Becker played even better.
The powerful German, all determination, saved all three match points with
positive, attacking play and went on to win a marvellous encounter 6-7 2-6
7-6 7-5 7-5. It lasted four hours and 56 minutes, the longest final in the
two-year history of the ATP Tour, and Becker played as well as I have seen
him for years. At last, he was serving and volleying again instead of trying
to prove he is a great base-liner - which he isn't and never will be.
It has been a particulary tough baptism for Courier, and this week in
Stuttgart he has had the pack snapping at his heels again. Joining Edberg
and Becker were Lendl, Guy Forget, Goran Ivanisevic, and a young man of whom
you have heard me speak before: Richard Krajicek, of Holland.
Courier's victory against this young giant on Thursday was particularly
significant because it was the match that never was - the semi-final of the
Australian Open that could not be played because of Krajicek's shoulder
injury. Courier did well to keep the Dutchman at bay because he is the
most-improved player in the world over the past six months and really
believes he is destined for greatness.
For Courier, though, it will continue, week after week, with the pressure
building all the time. That is how it has been ever since the rankings began
in August 1973 when the mercurial Rumanian Ilie Nastase was judged by the
cold, calculating eye of the computer to be the greatest.
Courier is the 10th man to be ranked No. 1, the latest of a distinguished
line that includes Jimmy Connors whose continuous 160-week reign from July
1974 to August 1977 is the longest yet. Lendl was only three weeks short of
that total when, in May 1983, Connors displaced him to enjoy the eighth of
his nine spells at the top.
The full list, showing the total number of weeks each man reigned and the
number of times he returned to the summit, makes interesting reading because
it is a sort of unofficial ranking list across the generations. In its
fashion, it goes a long way towards answering the perennial question - who
WAS the greatest? So here it is: 1. Lendl (270 weeks in eight spells as No.
1); 2. Connors (268, nine); 3. McEnroe (170, 14); 4. Borg (108, six); 5.
Edberg (66, three); 6. Nastase (40, one); 7. Wilander (20, one); 8. Becker
(12, two); 9. Newcombe (eight, one); 10 Courier (two, the reigning No. 1).

HAITI IS A hairy place. When Alec Waugh told his friends that he was going
there for a holiday, they raised their eyebrows. 'Haiti,' they said. 'But
that's where they kill their presidents and eat their babies. You'd better
buy yourself a large-sized gun'.
But I could not afford a gun. I was about to fly from Miami into a state of
perilous upheaval and felt nervous. 'Man, you gonna lay your life on the
line out there in Hay-di,' the taxi-driver informed me on the way to the
airport. 'They're killin' people like flies'. I clung to the passenger-strap
and closed my eyes.
'Best of British,' grinned the cabbie.
The flight passed without incident. As the aircraft rolled smoothly along
the tarmac at Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, a group of beggars in
tattered straw hats were shaking maracas at the entrance to Immigration.
'Bienvenu blanc]' they grinned.
Then a boy approached selling trumpery wooden carvings. 'Give me one
dollar]' It was a relief to find that Customs were quite perfunctory.
'Purpose of visit?' I was asked. Tourism, I said, to which the official
replied: 'Very good, m'sieur. Tomorrow belongs to Haiti, because Haiti means
business'.
The evening sky over Port-au-Prince was stained with a reddish light,
shimmering slightly. It was hot and muggy.
I went straight to the Hotel Oloffson. This is a colonial clapboard mansion
made famous by Graham Greene in his Haitian novel, The Comedians. There are
wobbly overhead fans but very few tourists. A complimentary cocktail of
Barbencourt rum awaited me on the wicker table in my room.
I drank a stiff measure and fell asleep.
Port-au-Prince by day is a study in bedlam. The main roads are choc-a-bloc
with public buses known colloquially as tap-taps from the noise of their
vintage engines which emit a tapping sound as they labour over hills. Most
of these are Peugeot 404s converted into tuppeny jitneys, and they list
perilously to starboard under the weight of human cargo, belching plumes of
diesel smoke.
Painted in crude colours like the horse-drawn carts of Sicily, tap-taps
evidently reflect the temperament and tastes of the people. There is the
Haitian flair for pageantry: masonic pentacles, fantastic flamingoes, palm
trees. The more flamboyant these decorations, the greater the driver's
status, rather like the number of tattoos on a man's forearm.
There is also history: lurid representations of the national heroes
Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Toussaint L'Ouverture, their playing-card sabres
encrusted with precious stones. Above all, there is religion. Many buses are
decorated with quotations from the Old Testament, particularly from the Book
of Numbers: 'The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; the other lamb
thou shalt offer at even . . .' A tap-tap is Haiti in miniature, surreal as
a Dali canvas.
The market at Port-au-Prince - a block square of bawling and bargaining - is
a great arched iron structure painted red and green. It is not unlike an
oriental bazaar, with minaret-domes that might have come from Agra or
Fetehpur Sikri in India.
One is constantly pestered by money-changers - 'Pssst] Pssst]'  - and by
hucksters bent double under prodigious loads of contraband. The swarming,
clanging, shouting hell of the market may overwhelm, but it is the best
place in which to buy Haitian paintings, raffia bags, globular straw baskets
or Ali Baba jars of unusual design.
Things are very different outside the capital, where the air is fresh and
vital and tropical plains lie under a vault of blue sky. I took a tap-tap to
Jacmel, a provincial town on the southern coast of Haiti.
Jacmel was once a thriving colonial port. Steamships would sail there every
month from Southampton, bringing British tweeds in exchange for coffee. The
place is now in decline, but the gingerbread mansions have considerable
charm.
The Hotel Alexandra is a magnificent clapboard affair cluttered with French
antiques, many conserved under sheets behind a locked door. The proprietor,
a diminutive mulatto of fearsome aspect, will arrange a journey by horse to
the bassin bleu in the hills nearby. It is a rough and unfrequented trail
that winds along a steep chasm, fording streams made almost impassable by
rain. But it is well worth the discomfort, as the bassin is a series of
natural aquifers, the waters of which are an amazing blue-green from
dissolved limestone.
Jacmel is a good place in which to witness a gaguere, cockfight. This is not
for faint-hearts, but it is the national sport of Haiti: what the bull-fight
is to Spain. Tourists are shown to the best ringside positions. Wads of cash
are circulated among the crowd by touts and tipsters as the antagonists are
carried squawking into the cockpit.
Feathers have been clipped, combs cropped and made flush with meticulous
care. There is a very complicated toilet as the seconds each take a mouthful
of water from a calabash and, pressing the birds to their lips, suck and
spray their plumage so that it adheres flat to their bodies and affords the
opponent little hold. More bets are placed as the men bend down to make the
sign of the cross in the dust. Finally, the man who has been collecting the
wagers blows a tin whistle and the fight begins.
At first the gamecocks circle each other cautiously, like boxers seeking an
opening; then they shoot up in the air with talons interlocked, feathers
taunted into ruffs. The spectators crane forward from their benches to
encourage or jeer at the contest, screaming and waving their arms. A hurrah
 -'Woaah]'  - or cry of dismay  - 'Haii]' - goes up whenever one of the
birds is pecked in the eyes.
The contenders close with each other again. A whirr of wings and a savage
peck - 'Haii]'  - sends feathers floating about the cockpit like down from a
pillow fight. Then a bird spins round and collapses - 'Woaah]' - like an
alcoholic, one wing hanging open, its breast torn of plumage. With a whoop
of jubilation from the crowd, it keels over into the dust.
Straw hats fly into the air as the victor spreads its wings and shrills a
triumphant cockadoodledoo. I remember glancing with a qualm of repulsion at
my shirt-front; it was speckled with blood.
Religion is the mainstay of Haitian society: voodoo and Catholicism. It is
said that Haitains are 80 per cent Roman Catholic and 100 per cent
voodooist. Religion is perhaps all that remains for the voiceless poor of
Haiti: the spirits of distant Africa, the cross of Christianity.
The twin-spired pink-and-white cathedral of Port-au-Prince resembles the
Sacre Coeur in Paris. A massive shrine to the Virgin, swathed in wreaths of
pink tulle, stands in the parquet transept. Tasselled standards embroidered
with numerous injunctions from the Bible line the aisles. There is a scent
of dying flowers and burial candlewicks.
Often I saw a crowd of wailing women round the Madonna. Many would prostrate
themselves in supplication, lying prone with faces pressed against the
floor, clutching in one hand a lighted candle, a rosary in the other. Some
curious votive offerings had been placed at the Madonna's plaster feet: a
small mirror, a white silk handkerchief, empty bottles of Cinzano and
Madeira. These were objects left in honour of Erzulie Freda, an African
divinity of Dahomean origin who is mirrored in Catholicism by the Virgin
Mary.
The celebrants wailing before me in the cathedral were respectful of both
Erzulie and the Madonna; Christianity has never triumphed over voodoo for
the simple reason that voodoo itself has always been receptive to elements
from catholicism.
It is not easy to attend a voodoo ceremony. Friday nights at the Hotel
Oloffson feature voodoo extravaganzas, but these are carefully choreographed
for tourists with show-girls cavorting to a rhythmic hula-hula.
One has to venture deep into the countryside to find the real thing. This I
did, and found myself awoken by a rumble of drums on a tiny island near the
tip of the southern peninsula. Louder and louder came the drums, accompanied
by a rattling of pots and pans for rough music. The chanting of a monotonous
litany rose as I approached the ceremony: little oases of familiarity -
'libera nos a malo . . . exurge morti' - were mingled with abracadabresque
shrieks and howls.
I followed the drumming to the tonelle, a great awning-like canopy of woven
palm-thatch which serves as the roof for an improvised temple. There I
insinuated myself among a crowd of spectators who had gathered on the outer
edges. It was dark, although a little light was shed over the dried mud
floor from an oil lamp nailed to the canopy.
A few children stared at me wide-eyed and frightened behind the skirts of
women. Otherwise, no one gave me a glance: most people seemed to be in a
sort of trance, oblivious of intruders.
Peering over a pair of shoulders, I was confronted by a scene which caused
me some alarm. Twenty or so white-clad men and women staggered and reeled to
the drumming as if drunk. The voodoo priest - houngan  - was wearing a red
cassock with a large frilly white collar, his fingers and thumbs loaded with
glittering rings and bangles. Growling like a hound, he sat astride a
prostrate woman, flailing his arms and yelling 'Out] Out] Out]' It was some
kind of exorcism. One woman stood still as foam collected on her lips, then
threw back her head and began to gyrate her arms with rapid, scythe-like
revolutions.
A man slithered along the ground, muttering incomprehensible words
apparently mingled with French and a little Spanish: 'Bete mechante . . .
roungou . . . vougnou . . . muerte. Oh] Seigneur]' Then he leapt to his feet
and began to writhe as though under the blows of an invisible whip.
The drummers also looked possessed, bashing furiously at four tapering
barrels with raw-hide membranes. They moved their hands with such rapidity
that the noise raised the mood to fever pitch. Clothes were torn away
unconsciously and two or three hot bodies collided with me, whirling away
like dervishes.
Soon the houngan came out of his trance, sweating and jiggering his
shoulder-blades like an epileptic. When he raised a chicken to his mouth,
preparatory to crunching through its neck, I moved silently out of the
temple, unable to withstand the dust, the cigar smoke, the smell of crowded
swaying bodies, and now this blood.
Of course, Haiti is not all voodoo and cock-fight. Near the northern city of
Cap-Haitien stands a fortress more massive than the Tower of London and
called the Eighth Wonder of the World. The citadel was built by King Henri
Christophe, who ruled the north of Haiti for 14 years until he committed
suicide (with a silver bullet) in October 1820. The citadel towers above the
timber-line on the crest of a mountain, and the hike uphill takes three
hours.
The citadel looms suddenly in a bend of the trail. A mass of titanic stone
apparently welded to the landscape itself, the sheer vastness of the thing
bewilders. Inside, you are shown a baffling maze of corridors and
passageways, rooms honeycombed with oubliettes, tunnels and tiers of
galleries.
A block of stone in the topmost battlements marks the king's tomb, adorned
with a tablet that states: 'Je renais de mes cendres' - I shall arise from
my ashes. Henri Christophe was buried there in quicklime to preserve his
corpse from the mobs.
Memories of Haiti are likely to be good and bad, the intensity of experience
in this country as exhilarating as it is exhausting. It has echoes of the
East, undercurrents of West Africa, a little French chic and a bracing
Caribbean climate. The begging is dreadful. Political violence may erupt at
any moment. AIDS is everywhere. The Tonton Macoutes (secret police) are
still in the woodwork. Yet there is a devil-may-care gaiety among the
people, a courage and humour in the face of desperate odds which the visitor
is unlikely to forget.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Food: Magnifique] The crepe - Street Food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASKED TO nominate one dish as the best example of French culinary ingenuity,
it would be difficult to find anything from that enormous repertoire more
versatile than the crepe.
They are easy to make. All you need for the basic batter is eggs, flour,
salt and milk and the patience to let it stand for two hours. The only limit
on quantity is the size of your mixing bowl. They can be served both sweet
and savoury; filled with ham, mushrooms or onions at the beginning of the
meal, or lemon juice and sugar at the end; or as a main course stuffed with
crab meat and served with a salad.
Crepes have also managed to jump social strata with the greatest of ease.
They can taste wonderful when bought hot from a French street corner stand
where they cost between FFr12 and Ffr18, depending on the filling. You can
pay five times that much for the privilege of eating crepes suzettes. These,
according to Escoffier's recipe, contain tangerine juice and Curacao and are
mixed - and cooked  - in the dining room.
Crepes highlight the peasant, religious and regional aspects of so much of
the best of French cooking. Originally, they were confined to being served
on Roman Catholic holidays and were seen as symbols of happiness and good
fortune. As the pancake was turned in the skillet, the family would gather
round and touch the handle of the pan, coin in hand.
Practically every French region has its own crepe: they are known as
tantimolles in Champagne, landimolles in Picardy or sanciaux in Limousin.
But the French region for crepes remains western France, particularly
Brittany and the city of Quimper with its crepes dentelles (lace pancakes).
It was in Brittany 26 years ago that I fell under their spell. Reluctantly,
I had been sent to stay with a local family in the hope that I might pass my
French O-level. As we walked the streets of Rennes, my senses were assailed
and language ceased to a problem.
I can still remember that first crepe. Many others followed. What surprised
me was not only how good they tasted but also how readily they were
available. In England, crepes/pancakes were still an annual treat, eaten on
Shrove Tuesday. There was never really enough batter for us all and there
was only one combination of flavours on offer - lemon juice and sugar. In
France, though, any combination was possible: filled with chocolate spread,
apricot or strawberry jam, cherries or almond cream. And there was even the
possibility of combining one forbidden fruit with another and sprinkling
Grand Marnier over the lot.
No breakfast menu in America is complete without a pancake section. They are
offered in all shapes, sizes and flavours - filled with blueberries,
cranberries or maple syrup or with bacon, ham and sausages on the side.
In London, after a walk on Hampstead Heath, you can join the queue at the
stand run by La Creperie de Hampstead.
But the taste of that very first crepe still lingers. Whenever I arrive in
France, I look out for a stall, partly because it is such an evocative
symbol of the country and partly because I would love to eat another crepe
that tasted quite as good as that very first one.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Perspectives: The secret university - A secret university
for POWs in a Japanese camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KITCHING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MARCH 1942, Frank Bell, a newly-commissioned army officer with a First in
languages from Cambridge, was captured by the Japanese. But this is not
another tale of misery and deprivation; it is the remarkable story of how a
determined man set up an unofficial university in Kuching prison camp,
Borneo, right under the eyes of his captors.
Regulations forbade prisoners to teach, learn, compile or possess notes on
any subject. The penalty for disobedience was solitary confinement or death.
Yet, Bell was able to set up secret classes in - among others - seven modern
languages, history, navigation and pig-farming. Diplomas were awarded to
successful students, ranking them from British university honours standard
down to School Certificate pass level.
Bell died three years ago, before he could complete his record of life in a
secret university. His extraordinary tale is now published privately by his
widow, Elisabeth.*
From his notes and diaries, a clear picture emerges of conditions at
Kuching. There was little food, no furniture, little paper and few books.
There was cruelty, to which he alludes only briefly. There were terrible
illnesses: Bell himself almost died from diphtheria, many others from
beri-beri. Yet, Bell still managed to found his 'undercover university,'
gave it the motto 'Artes in Arduis' and brought together those who wanted to
study and those who could teach.
'It was entirely Frank's brainchild,' says Donald Yates, a fellow prisoner.
'No senior officer appointed him to organise study . . . and certainly no
Japanese directive encouraged study. Frank supplied the idea, the
administration and the motivation to keep it going.'
In his early months at Kuching, Bell learned from copies of the
English-language Nippon Times that Allied prisoners in Germany were allowed
to hold classes and lectures. That knowledge fuelled his determination to
establish a secret learning centre.
'Paper is a small and common word, but still a magic one to me,' Bell wrote
later. 'What extremities of contrast lie between the luxurious abandon with
which I write these very words, taking sheet after sheet of smooth, clean,
white paper from the well-filled drawer of my desk . . . and the saving and
prizing of every scrap in Kuching days.'
The prisoner-students used every possible piece of paper: fly-leaves from
books, cigarette papers, government forms, backs of letters, envelopes, soap
wrappers, old newspapers. A letter from home was doubly exciting: good news
and more writing space. Bell began to make language textbooks and grammars,
writing them out laboriously by hand on tobaco paper, sewing them together,
covering them in sarong or pyjama fabric and binding them with raw latex
from the local rubber estate.
Smokers often were reluctant to give up their tobacco paper. 'To smokers,
paper was as precious as it was to me and my pupils. Paper fought for pride
of place with bread and butter and beefsteaks in the visions of the night,'
wrote Bell. 'In my dreams, I was forever buying notebooks and pens and inks;
and even now, though I can walk past a cake-shop without my mouth watering,
I cannot pass a stationer's without longing.'
The Japanese compromised in one area - albeit slightly. They allowed a small
number of books - foreign grammars and belle lettres  - into Kuching on the
understanding that they would be read for pleasure and not used for
teaching. Together with his handwritten grammars and exercises, Bell now had
the tools for his university.
He canvassed camp members with a double question: What did they wish to
learn? What were they willling to teach? 'This personal approach proved very
successful. I was encouraged that almost every member showed interest. I
received a promise of active participation from all but four, who said they
were too old to learn or too far gone in mental decay to pull themselves
together. One senior officer was not interested in anything but Portuguese;
and though I tried everything I could to get hold of a Portuguese grammar, I
was not successful, so he did not join us.'
Bell drew up dates of terms, tests and examinations and the university was
launched with a flourish. Its story falls into two distinct periods of a
year each. 'The greater part of the useful work was done in the first year,'
writes Bell. 'Although we complained then of hunger, happily for us we had
no conception of the degree of hunger, ill-health and frustration we should
experience in the second year.
'As far as the university went, the second year was a sad story of decline,
though not of fall. Most of the courses other than modern languages had come
to an end through exhaustion of material. Many of the linguists had also
succumbed but a few, about half a dozen in each language, persevered to the
very end, in spite of everything.'
Bell's French classes were among the most animated. 'Sometimes we would tell
a story, each taking it in turn to add a sentence or two. Highly exciting
and improbable adventures were told around our circles in the dark.' Always,
though, there was the risk of intervention by a Japanese guard. 'When our
classes were interupted by the Japs, or when they were being held in the
part of the hut visible to the sentries as they patrolled outside the wire,
our main method of subterfuge was to produce a pack of cards always left
handy. I, who had never played a game of bridge in my life, could then be
heard making nonsensical bids of 12 no-trumps . . . '
The Japanese ban on classes was particularly tiresome for Bell and other
officers who helped with teaching. 'If the Japanese had not totally
disregarded the Geneva Convention, we could at least have had some quiet and
comfort. The professional teachers among us longed in vain for the
orderliness of the classroom,' wrote Bell.' To be at a desk with a
blackboard beside me, pupils in their places, each with his own book, pen,
paper - that was the stuff of dreams]'
Spanish was the most successful language class. Bell taught an advanced
group of three pupils ('two of whom knew nearly as much Spanish as I did by
the time we finished'). There was also an intermediate group and one for
beginners. All groups amalgamated for conversation in the evenings. After
the war, Bell had lunch with two members of the advanced class at a Spanish
restaurant in Soho, London. It gave him great pleasure to hear them order in
Spanish - and get what they asked for.
Essay-writing in the top group was of a high standard, too. Topics included
an imaginary dialogue between King George VI and the ghost of Henry VIII,
and an appreciation of Cervantes. Pupils were expected to write 1,000 words.
But amid the learning and the fun were the constants of debilitation and
death. The officer conducting the chess class died of dysentery; a leading
member of the Russian group became desperately ill. Malnutrition affected
virtually all members of the university.
At the end of the war, Bell awarded three 'degrees' in French and three in
Spanish. Many others attained School Certificate level in Dutch, Italian and
German. In all, Bell handed out 22 diplomas in what he called a 'silent
testimony' to the efforts of his colleagues. All bore handwritten
assessments of the officer's work and were signed FE Bell, MA (Cantab).
Later, the diplomas were printed. All were again signed by Bell.
Writing of his own award (for Dutch), he observed: 'My own diploma, though
it can only speak of my Dutch studies at the good hands of an Australian
colleague, has earned a place in my affections as high as my Cambridge MA.'
Ten years after the war, Bell realised the dreams of Kuching and founded in
Cambridge a school for teaching English to foreign students. Donald Yates,
his fellow prisoner-student, helped him to build up the business. Further
schools were opened in other English towns and cities and Bell's zest for
teaching remained undimmed at his death in 1989.
He re-visited Kuching in 1984 and was delighted to find the Batu Lintang
Teachers' College flourishing on the site of the former POW camp where he
had established his own secret university. *Undercover University, by Frank

FT  22 FEB 92 / Perspectives: Wasted lives in the UK's packed jails - A City
group on a moving morning in prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOES society jail criminals to punish them, or to get them back on the
straight and narrow? Penal experts have debated these questions for years;
some think they are just two sides of the same coin. But on the slim
evidence of a recent morning's visit to a jail - Pentonville, in north
London - the answer seemed clear to me and other members of a City group I
was with. It should be the second of the two.
Our strongest impression was that of waste in the arrangements there - of
time, human spirit and, ultimately, public money. Most of the prisoners
spend 18 hours a day - sometimes 23  - locked in their cells. They are
allowed radios and books, and the more privileged have a common room with
snooker and TV. But days are empty and long. You can almost hear morale
ebbing and resentment growing. It eats at the self-esteem of those who hope
to regain their position in society - or it feeds their lust for revenge.
Pentonville is nearly 150 years old but preserves a kind of grim beauty, at
least inside. Its half-star shape has four wings radiating from a central
point from which every cell door is visible. The galleries have a classical
orderliness, spruced-up with fresh white paint. Outside, it is bleak, bricky
and enclosed, with the sound of dogs barking.
The atmosphere feels surprisingly relaxed. Gates clang, warders joke among
themselves, prisoners on tasks outside their cells stand in clusters. The
heating is efficient; it has to be because of the idleness to which most
inmates are condemned. The cells are cramped, blank and barred. The
furniture - a bed, a table and a chair  - is made of cardboard to prevent
misuse.
Cells that until recently used to have slop buckets are being given their
own lavatories. But this has created problems. Prisoners smashed the china
pans, so it was necessary to replace them with stainless steel. However,
slopping-out gave inmates something to do - a chance to get out and mingle
with others. Now, they spend even more time in idleness. At least
overcrowding provides companionship.
Meal-times are also a break. The prisoners get three hot meals a day and we
saw the kitchen preparing a spaghetti concoction, semolina and chocolate
tart. It was not the most appetising food I have seen but the food budget is
Pounds 12-Pounds 14 a prisoner per week. Even meal-times, though, seem
designed to reinforce the emptiness of the prisoner's day; supper is at 4
pm, which leaves an aching 16-hour gap until breakfast.
One spark of hope is the Job Club, a little initiative run by charity to
help inmates find work when released. In their last two weeks inside, they
attend classes to learn interview techniques, play-act interviews and study
the results on video. It is a gallant operation run by three people. One is
Carole Parker, a diminutive lady who incarcerates herself with a dozen
inmates at a time. But although she has a panic button, she has only twice
had trouble. 'I'd rather be locked in here with 15 inmates than walk along
the Holloway Road,' she says.
Bill Abbot, Pentonville's governor, says Job Club is the only one of many
well-intentioned schemes that he has seen which has 'got under the skin' of
the prison. It has seen 325 inmates since last March. Of those, 50 are in
paid employment, 80 in further training, 10 are self-employed and two are
doing voluntary work. All who attend Parker's class complain that no one
will want to employ them, so there is jubilation every time one finds a job.
Implicit in these figures, though, is the fact that 142 of those who passed
through the Job Club are probably roaming the streets with nothing to do -
perhaps, they are back in jail  - to say nothing of the many who never
attended at all. The officers told us they see the same faces again and
again. The magic age seems to be 26; if a prisoner manages to mend his ways
by then, he will probably make it. If not, a lifetime of crime beckons.
The charity behind Job Club was Apex which, by an unhappy chance, announced
that it was about to fold only two days after our visit. We were so moved by
Parker and her team that a number of our group set about trying to keep them
in business. This will either require a slug of private sector money or, as
seems possible, intervention from the Department of Employment.
There is a deeper question. Why are 900 prisoners (and thousands of others
in the UK) kept in enforced idleness when their time could be put to good
use, in training, in education, in rebuilding morale? I do not underestimate
the difficulties or the efforts of those who have been asking this question
for years. But if we are serious about reducing the prison population, we
should be doing more to get ex-inmates back into society, permanently.
It will take money. But I fear that, otherwise, much of the cash we are
spending on our prison service will continue to be money down the drain.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Food: A homespun new colony - Long Island's traditional crop
 -potatoes - is making way for the vine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK City stretches into the Atlantic along the Forks of Long Island,
effectively the extremes of Manhattan. Here, you can find a deli called the
Barefoot Contessa selling cooked brussels sprouts and five blends of coffee,
go', four of them decaffeinated, to take away. In cafes nearby, roundabout
you can order an all-white omelette or cholesterol-free French fries.
Long Island now has a wine industry which, in its way, is also extreme. It
is, for a start, extremely young. Wine labels may boast that the relevant
vines were planted way back in 1980. (Long Island's first vinifera (ital?)
vineyard for more than a century was planted in 1973 by Alex and Louisa
Hargrave, in 1973 who had to wait six years for the next grape-grower to
come along and prove their sanity).
It is also, like many a fine wine region, at a climatological extreme.
Further north, in New York state, winters are too hard for vinifera. Only
the moderating influence of the surrounding ocean allows the vine species
responsible for all the great wines of the world to be grown this far north.
Almost all of the vines planted around the lakes in upstate New York belong
to coarser, hardier vine species .
Vines are now encroaching on Long Island's traditionally dominant crop,
potatoes - oddly prosaic for a region famous for providing the famous with
somewhere (the Hamptons) to spend their weekends with the equally famous.
Today, there are well over more than 1,200 acres of vineyard have been
planted, mainly on the North Fork, by about 45 growers and vinified at 15
different wineries.
As in so many other areas of commercial endeavour, the early 1980s eighties
were the boom time. An acre of land was then just Dollars 2,000 (Pounds
1,105); now, it but is today closer to Dollars 20,000.
The odd Manhattanite, associating the South Fork of Long Island with luxury
vacations and wine with the ultimate good time, invested in what turned out
to be a dream.
They have now been shaken out, according to Dan Kleck, who has worked as a
Long Island wine-maker since 1979 and is now introducing malolactic
fermentation at the Palmer winery. 'They've sold to more committed people
who spend two or three days a week out here and might even drive a tractor
once in a while. It is a lot better. Fewer egos.'
Now that undesirable outsiders have been seen off, Long Island wine
producers are concentrating on the remaining major pests: birds (they are
're on the main migration route and have to spend about Dollars 1,000 an
acre on special netting); hurricanes (these are 're meant to happen every 40
years, not every other year) - and California.
Any California-trained wine-maker comes a terrible cropper in this cool,
late-budding climate. 'You have to un-learn that California thing,' says
Kleck.
'Our reds need much longer maceration. Our fruit acids are much higher and
our alcohols lower.' (A Long Island wine more than 12 per cent alcohol is
rare indeed, and chaptalisation - adding sugar to raise the final alcohol
level - can be the norm for some vintages).
All of this sounds very European, and Long Islanders have been keen to
stretch welcoming hands over the Atlantic. They have invited inviting
Bordeaux's top brass to a couple of instructive 'wine-ins' over the past few
years, along with Australian viticulturalist Richard Smart who has shown how
to use every ray of sunlight to maximise ripening.
The wines taste French in structure, if New World in technology: never
heavyweight with crisp, bordering on lean, fruit flavours. At last year's
the recent New York Wine Experience - a weekend's wine extravaganza
organised by The Wine Spectator magazine - 1,000 experienced tasters were
asked to identify the 1989 Chardonnay from Long Island's exciting new
Gristina winery. Well under two 2 per cent guessed it came from Long Island;
I thought it was a well-made Chassagne-Montrachet.
Chardonnay seems to be particularly successful on Long Island here but,
unusually, there is potential for dry Gewurztraminers with none of the oily
bitterness that dogs California examples. Among red grape varieties, Merlot
has shown most form so far (like Washington State 3,000 miles west),
although Cabernet Franc has its devotees among those not wedded to the clout
of California wine.
Cabernet Sauvignon can be difficult to ripen fully except in a few very
well-chosen sites, but Long Islanders claim that part of the problem lies in
the American consumer's California-shaped perception of how Cabernet
Sauvignon should taste. Blending different varieties is a novel sport that
will surely become more popular.
Most of the wines retail in the Dollars 12 to Dollars 15 bracket, putting
them on a par with California's mid-priced varietals; but, like their
counterparts who make English wine, Long Island wine producers sometimes
have to labour against local prejudice. Bridgehampton Winery, one of only
two on the South Fork, sets its cap deliberately at the major big urban
market 70 miles west by using with the least bucolic image possible - that
of Manhattan by night  - on several labels.
The typically-spare but Vivaldi-haunted winery building overlooks the sad
remains of a vineyard too prone to frost. Undaunted, the jingle-merchant who
owns Bridgehampton has acquired land elsewhere. It was there that I was told
how that Bridgehampton reds would be lightening in style. As he put it: 'Our
winemaker had a child recently, so his search for immortality no longer has
to be diverted into his wines.'
Most impressive of a wide range of current releases (sic) I tasted on Long
Island recently were Lenz Gewurztraminer 1989; 1989 Chardonnays from
Gristina and Bidwell, as well as Gristina's 1988 Cabernet Sauvignon (made at
Bridgehampton before its own their understatedly elegant winery was built);
Bridgehampton's light 1989 Merlot; Bedell Cellar's confident and plump 1988
Merlot Reserve; and unfinished samples of Palmer 1990 Merlot and 1991
Gewurztraminer.
And Rainy 1989 has been Long Island's only real problem vintage since 1987.
As far as the vine is concerned this is clearly a viable, if slightly
homespun, new colony.
Pindar and Bridgehampton wines are imported into the UK by the Great
American Wine Company, 137 Lavender Hill, London, SW11 5QJ. Tel:

FT  22 FEB 92 / Food: Designer ladles can be costly - Philippa Davenport and
Giles MacDonogh and their tasters try commercial stocks and supermarket
soups - with surprising results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEFT TO my own devices I should be quite happy with a bowl or two of soup at
lunchtime. Unfortunately, my life does not always allow for such simple
solutions; but there are generally three or four days a week when I get away
with it, writes Giles MacDonogh.
Over the years a good deal of agony has gone into finding the right solution
to the problem of lunchtime soup. These days I tend to keep over some cooked
vegetables from the night before and ally them to something fresh that I can
mince up fine.
Some stock (if nothing else the pots from Sainsbury will do) activates the
mix. The process has taken ten minutes so far, and in ten minutes I will
have wholesome soup. I use no thickeners apart from a tot of cream if that
is to hand. These soups can be simple or eccentric, occasionally even
baroque; but I like them and only I have to eat them.
It was not always so: in the old days I used to peruse the supermarket
shelves for commercial offerings. Tinned soups do not tempt me. Occasionally
I have bought jars of French fish soup but these work out expensive and half
has to be put back into the fridge to be eaten the next day at the latest.
It was for this reason that I was originally excited by the chilled soups
produced in cartons by the New Covent Garden Soup Company: the soups filled
two bowls; monthly specials added to a range which grew ever broader; the
packaging looked nice. In short, the producers led you to believe that this
was soup as mother made it.
But it was not. Since the soups were launched I have tasted virtually all of
them with the exception of high-octane blends such as brussels sprouts and
chestnuts. The soups are sticky with flour and lacking in flavour. An
obsession with vegetarians has meant that meat stocks are often shunned.
When they are used (in the chicken and coriander, for example) they tend to
be greasy and unappetising. More recently, I have tried a couple of fish
soups and found neither of these exceptional. Covent Garden drove me back to
the chopping board; for this reason alone I offer thanks.
The New Covent Garden Soup Company has been a runaway success. Rare is the
sandwich shop that cannot offer its soups for the office kitchen.
Naturally, the supermarkets would also like to cash in on the chilled soup
business but something has prevented them from making a go of it. For a
while Sainsbury joined Waitrose in putting out an own-label soup bought in
from Covent Garden but they have since abandoned the practice. Will
Sainsbury's and other supermarkets make a come-back with soups of their own?
Watch this space.
For the time being there are just Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, with the
latter buying in soups from other suppliers. Last week, I obtained samples
of the ranges offered by both supermarkets and, assembling a team to taste
them with me, I gave myself over to chilled soup.
Both Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer produced a tomato soup. The Waitrose came
with (dried) basil. Neither had a fresh tomato taste. M &amp; S was billed as a
cream and advertised some fancy ingredients such as Mascarpone cheese.
People were chiefly put off by the 'day-glow orange' colour of the soup. The
M &amp; S nonetheless won by a head.
Waitrose's French-style fish soup was similar to Covent Garden's offering in
this line. My jury found it watery and I found one of them poking at a sad,
rubbery piece of crab she had found at the bottom. A professional chef
described it as 'weak court bouillon.'
The M &amp; S bisque was the colour of plaster. The floury texture found few
takers but it was a mite more popular than the Waitrose soup.
The Waitrose scotch broth with its peas, carrots and barley seemed
indistinguishable from a canned soup; while an oxtail soup from M &amp; S
reminded everyone of gravy. More positive criticism was meted out for the
Waitrose winter vegetable although there were grumbles about 'dried garlic'
and stock-cube stock.
Genuine enthusiasm greeted the M &amp; S minestrone. It looked impressive in the
pan and neither pasta nor vegetables were overcooked. No one detected the
parmesan announced on the pot but the garlic found favour.
The M &amp; S mushroom was also well received. One of the jury went so far as to
say that: 'It's like mushroom soup you make yourself.'
M &amp; S leek and potato also scored over half marks with the caveat that it
could be 'leekier.'
'Might be better cold,' wrote one.
All the soups produced two scant servings. This made them suitable for lunch
or as a preamble to a meal for two. Prices started at Pounds 1.30 so it
would make no financial sense buying two pots for four; especially given how
cheap and easy to make soup is.
The only soup in the range which could not have been quickly produced was
the oxtail, but nobody liked this anyway.

FT  22 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: Penny-pinching chic for the recession -
Lucia van der Post goes bargain-hunting and finds that even in these
straitened times it can be fun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THERE IS something about February that seems to induce in me a fit of
parsimony. This is not normally something that comes naturally, as my
husband is the first to rue, but I am taking a perverse kind of pleasure in
seeking out ways of spending less without having any less fun.
There are, of course, cycles in patterns of expenditure and few of us remain
unaffected by the moods that sweep our worlds.
What is interesting about the current cycle is while some are forced to cut
back for the saddest of reasons (unemployment, redundancy, rising costs)
others, whose incomes have not been affected one jot by the current economic
woes, also feel unaccountably constrained when it comes to consuming.
It is not quite done to go on spending in the old audacious ways. Cutting
back is seriously a la mode. Conspicuous Thrift is back in vogue.
Designer clothes are being tracked down at less than full retail price,
houses are being repainted and given a new lease of life with bargains from
markets and salerooms, upholstery and stencilling classes are there for the
taking, secondhand books are being sought, casseroles and pastas are turning
up on tables instead of foie gras and magret de canard. All it needs is
ingenuity, thought and style.
Here for those who feel hard-up and inclined to join the challenge are a few
suggestions for ways and means of cutting down without feeling deprived:
The ardent bookworm will have noticed that hardback books, once bought
lightheartedly, without thought for purse or pocket, have now become a
serious luxury.
Every town has its secondhand bookshop but in London the best, for serious
readers, is generally agreed to be Skoob, 15 Sicilian Avenue, Southampton
Row, London WC1. Mostly rather academically-inclined books but lots of
general interest, too.
Joining The London Library, 14 St. James's Square, London SW1 could also be
a good move - it would not take many books to recoup the Pounds 100 a year
fee. You can join almost instantly - just fill in the form and pay up.
Secondhand clothes are, of course, the cheapest, if not always the most
fashionable, way of dressing.
For chaps Bertie Wooster of 284 Fulham Road, London SW10, is a newcomer.
Here the would-be gentleman can kit himself out in authentic gear at a
fraction of the full retail price.
Everything is secondhand, all in what its owner calls 'really good nick.'
Dinner jackets can be bought for Pounds 75, morning coats and trousers from
Pounds 75 to Pounds 130 and bespoke, tailor-made suits for between Pounds 45
and Pounds 85. A pair of cords would be Pounds 25, tweed suits from Pounds
65 to Pounds 100.
There is many a chic woman who waits for the periodic peripatetic Designers'
Sale to bring her wardrobe up to date.
The next are not until June 5 - 7. Tel: 071-223-8004 for tickets when you
could put your summer wardrobe in order.
Do not forget the charity shops which seem to have become rather demode
recently.
I bought a ravishing silky ruffled blouse (ex-Saks 5th Avenue) at my local
branch for Pounds 3.60 which, though I say it myself, acquitted itself well
last week at a chic Parisian party.
For those who can dressmake or upholster or make their own curtains The
Cloth Shop, 290 Portobello road, Ladbroke Grove, London W10 (tel:
081-968-6001) is well worth knowing about.
Most fabrics are sold at half-price. There are wool suitings at Pounds 10 a
metre, old velvets from Pounds 1 to Pounds 12 a metre, as well as wonderful
collection of old English tie fabrics from the late 1950s.
Then there are designer fabrics from people such as John Galliano and
Arabella Pollen and at the moment a collection of Ralph Lauren blankets for
Pounds 80 (normally Pounds 300.)
When it comes to furnishing the home do not forget the markets - getting up
early on a Friday morning to go to Bermondsey, south London, trawling the
auction rooms and rooting around in the secondhand shops still provides the
best bargains and gives homes an interesting and eclectic air.
Eric Geen's Town &amp; Country Auctions in Britain, The Bargain Hunter's
handbook (published by the AA, Pounds 5.99) is still in print and is still
the best guide to salerooms all over the country.
The Java Cotton Company, 52 Lonsdale Road, London W11 5BY (some of its wares
are photographed top right) sells ravishing hand-drawn and hand-block batik,
all made by traditional Javanese methods.
Anyone who has already come across batik will know what truly lovely effects
it produces, anyone who does not should hurry along to take a look. Besides
selling the handblocked cottons by the metre (Pounds 14.75), it also has a
range of accessories made from the fabric - table napkins (Pounds 2.25),
cushions (Pounds 18.75) and tablecloths (from Pounds 38).
Ian Mankin, of 109 Regent's Park Road, London, MW1 8UT, has long been a
source of sturdy inexpensive fabrics - all those lovely old-fashioned things
such as mattress ticking (Pounds 4.75 a metre), striped muslin (Pounds 4.50
a metre), calico (Pounds 2.00) cricket stripes (Pounds 5.80) and cotton net
(Pounds 1.25).
Now he has opened another branch south of the Park at 271, Wandsworth Bridge
Road, London SW6 2TX. Look out also for double width linen by the metre,
wide enough for a 5 ft 6 ins bed, at Pounds 29.80 which means you could make
a pair for Pounds 165 instead of paying the Pounds 235 that currently the
lowest priced ready-made version costs.
Anthony Thompson currently has some marvellous rugs, carpets, shawls,
needlepoint and textiles on sale at very special prices. The market has been
seriously depressed all year and if you go along to his shop at 5, Hillgate
Street, London W8 7 SP you will find early 20th century needlework chair
covers from Pounds 20, rugs from Pounds 50 and lots of other bargains
besides.
Then there is our old friend the Next Directory - I cannot recommend highly
enough the new spring version. It is beautifully photographed and filled
with highly desirable clothes and household goods, from simple shorts and
trousers, sweaters, the best T-shirts I have yet seen  - generous sleeves
with dropped shoulders, good necklines in marled blue, grey or cream for
Pounds 12.99 - to an excellent range of household basics.
Look for 100 per cent cotton percale bedding at Pounds 19.99 for a single
sheet, chambray bed linen at Pounds 29.99 for a single duvet cover and plain
ridged glass bowls (photographed below) at Pounds 16.99 for four. Well worth
sending for. For the catalogue (Pounds 1) tel: 0345-100-500.
And now, having saved all that money, what about a treat?
Hartley Safaris have, at the request of four Weekend FT readers who came
with us to the Kalahari and the Okavango delta two years ago, put together a
very special trip to the remote Kalahari Gemsbok Park, the Etosha pan, the
Skeleton coast and the Namib desert.
It will be a privileged group of just ten readers and some smashing guides -
eight places are booked, only two places, which will go to the first takers,
are left.
It runs from April 24 - May 8 and costs Pounds 4,579 each. Full itineraries
available from Hartley's Safaris, 12 Queensberry Mews West, London SW7 2DXU.
Tel: 071-584-5005.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Food: A lunch-hour slurp - A few short-cuts to home-made
soups / Philippa Davenport and Giles MacDonogh and their tasters try
commercial stocks and supermarket soups - with surprising results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT

<TEXT>
LORD Curzon, the former flamboyant viceroy of India and stickler for form,
would have disapproved. So will those who perpetuate the old etiquette of
serving egg dishes at lunchtime but never at dinner, and soup precisely the
other way round, writes Philippa Davenport.
I breach this code of conduct frequently in summer and almost daily in
winter. Good soup is solace and comfort, food and drink conveniently rolled
into one, and I rate a bowl of the piping hot stuff as an essential reviver
after a morning at my desk.
The soups that I eat are home-made. This is not because of some purist
cookery writer snobbism. It stems from the simple observation that home-made
soups taste much better than the commercial sorts I have tried and, whereas
the superiority of home-cooking over shop-bought sometimes depends on
mastering special culinary skills, possessing a batterie de cuisine or
spending long hours at the stove (or even all three), soup-making is a
doddle.
The recipes that follow, although fast and easy to do, are not quite as
speedily achieved as unzipping the cartons of commercial soups that Giles
MacDonogh has been dipping into. They can, however, easily be cooked, eaten
and washed up within a lunch hour. They could of course be served at dinner
 -and so gain Lord Curzon's approval.
For the sake of speed I have incorporated a few short cuts. One soup is made
with frozen spinach, rather than fresh, which is not worth eating as a
vegetable but acceptable for soup-making. The other uses leftover mashed
potatoes, a commodity to be found in this house only if I deliberately cook
more potatoes than needed for dinner the night before.
Normally I use home-made chicken stock as the liquid base for my soups but
to tie in with the 'almost instant' theme of this week's column I have used
shop-bought versions here. To my surprise and that of my co-tasters, we
found, in blind samplings, that we preferred stock cubes to the much more
expensive and supposedly superior liquid stocks now on sale at some
supermarkets and delicatessens.
Jurgen Langen's poultry stock (sold in a glass jar at approximately Pounds
1.59 for 500 ml) got a thumbs down rating: low on poultry taste, and
possessing the gluey quality of canned consomme, not entirely unpalatable
but not really stock-like.
Sainsbury's fresh chicken stock (available from 100 branches at 95p per 284
ml carton) met nose-wrinkling dislike all round and got bottom marks. It was
condemned as unchickeny, the onions, celery, leeks, carrot, garlic, thyme
and other flavourings seeming to outweigh heavily the taste of the bird. A
very disagreeable after-taste also caused comment.
Waitrose own-label chicken stock cubes (12 cubes for 65p) were marginally
preferred to Knorr (eight cubes for approximately 73p) by most tasters,
though we all agreed that both brands need to be diluted with more water
than the label instructions suggest.
The best of the commercial bunch by a long chalk, but still a very poor
second to the home-made chicken stock, included in the blind tasting, was a
relatively new brand, Just Bouillon cubes by Kallo (six cubes cost 65-75p).
Jointly and severally we rated this as pleasant and unaggressive, with a
mild chickeny flavour that bears some resemblance to the real thing. The
fact that it contains no monosodium glutamate, no E320 (butylated
hydoxyanisole) and no yeast extract will please those with special dietary
problems.
There are seven stocks other than chicken in the Just Bouillon range. For
further details and stockists contact Kallo direct. Tel: 081-890-8324.
LEEK, POTATO AND CORIANDER SOUP
Fresh potatoes can of course be used instead of leftover mash. Dice them
small to cook them quickly when speed is of the essence. The soup cost me an
eminently modest Pounds 1.77 to make and it will serve six.
1 lb mashed potatoes; 1 lb leeks (trimmed weight); a bunch of coriander; 3
tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 2 1/2 pt light chicken stock or salted
water.
Slice the leeks and simmer them in the liquid in a covered pan until tender
but do not cook them so long that they are robbed of freshness.
Strain off the cooking liquor and work most of it in to the potatoes,
pouring it on slowly and beating the potatoes with a wooden spoon to make a
creamy smooth mixture.
Whizz the leeks in a food processor with the olive oil and a handful of
coriander. Stir the fragrant green puree into the potato. Wash out the
processor bowl with the rest of the cooking liquor and add it to the soup.
Reheat gently, stirring occasionally, and season with salt and pepper.
SPINACH SOUP WITH ANCHOVY CREAM
Inspired by a favourite dish of spinach souffle with anchovy sauce from
Langan's Brasserie, the Mayfair restaurant, this soup will serve five and
costs about Pounds 2.30 to make.
1 lb frozen whole leaf spinach; 1 pt chicken stock and 1 pt water; the juice
of half a lemon; freshly ground nutmeg; 1 x 2 oz can of anchovy fillets;
1/4 pt thick cream mixed with 3 or 4 tablespoons milk.
Cook the frozen spinach in the stock with the lemon juice, some salt, pepper
and a very generous grating of nutmeg. Whizz the mixture to an emerald green
puree in a food processor and return it to the pan. 'Wash out' the processor
bowl with the water, add the green freckled water to the soup and reheat.
While the spinach is cooking, tip the anchovies and their oil into a small
pan. Place over low heat and mash and stir with a wooden spoon until the
anchovies disintegrate. Then pour on most of the milk and cream mixture.
Stir to blend and heat through well.
Stir the remaining milk and cream mixture into the basic soup to enrich it a
little, and check seasoning. Finally, drizzle the hot anchovy cream over and
through the soup in marbled swirls, and serve.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Gardening: If it's begonias you want . . . - A glasshouse
which has few rivals in Britain for size and none for beauty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE rebound from Edinburgh's Botanical Gardens, I have been cooling-off
in Glasgow's. This year, their Kelvinside site will be celebrating its 150th
anniversary. Several of the main glasshouses are being rebuilt but there is
plenty to enjoy meanwhile, although they do not have the heavenly quality of
their bigger neighbour.
The best site of all began as an instructive white elephant. When the
gardens opened in 1842, people were sure of entry only if they belonged to
the right social class. Suitable subscribers paid a guinea for family
membership but the plebs were let in only on Saturdays, and if they could
pay a shilling each. On a very few days the labouring classes were allowed
in, too, paying one penny each for the privilege. Everybody knew their place
until the directors over-reached themselves in the notorious affair of The
Glasshouse.
The offending extravagance still stands there: a magnificent, double-dome
Victorian glass-work which covers more than 23,000 sq ft if you add in its
various corridors. It has few rivals in Britain for size and, to my eye, it
has none for beauty; this masterful building is bold, simple and elegant.
It began life privately in the gardens of a well-known entrepreneur and
engineer, John Kibble, at Loch Long. He agreed a long lease with the Glasgow
Botanicals under which he would continue to use his glasshouse for private
functions and the directors would pay him rent. But they found the lease
hard to fulfil (I cannot help wondering if matters might have been easier if
the lower classes had been given more opportunities to tender their pennies,
and if tradesmen and the like had been included freely as subscribers).
Anyway, the city corporation soon had to bail them out. But once you enlist
friendly partners, you know what happens. Six years later, the loans and the
expenses sank the directors altogether. The city bought them out in a deal
which it cannot have regretted.
The Kibble palace might have sunk its first lessees but it remains in
excellent shape and repays a careful walk. Inside, the flora from various
continents is arranged in an ingenious progression while sculpted figures of
Victorian marble greet you as you stroll round. In the forecourt you can
find Eve, Cain and such companions as an Oriental slave. Among the shrubs, a
modest Miss New Zealand raises a strategically-placed knee and looks out
beside the camellias to a circular bed of huge tree ferns under the main
dome.
Individually, the geographical plantings have some fine old specimens,
especially some tree-like jasmine mesnyi and its butter-yellow flowers.
However, I did feel that more could be made of flora from regions such as
Australia and the Canaries. It would be fun to re-plant the Kibble palace
during this anniversary year.
Outdoors, February is not the season for Glasgow's particular features, a
huge double herbaceous border and a Chronological Bed where plants are
arranged by the years of their discovery. On the way to the Gents is a fine
show of white-flowered osmaronia but, early in spring, the main thrust of
the gardens lies under yet more glass up the hill.
When all the houses here are open again, we will see the full involvement of
Glasgow's botanists in anything from Papuan wildflowers to spice plants and
tropical trees. I visited with a sharp eye for ideas for a modern
conservatory. Here, two particular sections stood out. One was a cheerful
mass of poinsettias, azaleas, the scented hyacinths which greenhouses
segregate too often in pots, unusual salvias, and the sweet-scented, early
white rhododendron fragrantissimum.
On the outer sides, there were flowers all over two easy types of abutilon -
the dark-flowered Master Hugh and yellow Golden Fleece. In a nearby room,
the Powder Puff tree from Brazil would be more of a challenge for amateur
gardeners. At Glasgow this tall tree is covered in buds, like tight little
pin-cushions, and brilliant scarlet puffs of flower. Calliandra
inaequilatera is not an easy plant for the rest of us.
Begonias are another matter, though. If you want to see what the family
includes, Glasgow is the place to go and February a good moment in which to
strike. Glasgow holds the National Collection and has obtained plants from
the best hybridists and collectors, making this section the botanical high
spot of the greenhouses.
If you know only the huge double begonias which parks plant in circular
beds, the Glasgow display will open your eyes. One house brings together a
huge mass of multi-coloured leaves and pink and pinkish-white small flowers
which characterise the begonia in its natural habitats from Columbia to the
Himalayas, Brazil to the Red Sea. I was lost happily in a jungle of
potential house-plants, none of which would be difficult in damp, moderate
heat.
Hybrids like Universe have masses of fine white flowers above big mottled
leaves, like the ears of an elephant. I liked the idea of one called Tiger
Paws in a small drawing-room. Its green leaves are mottled with tiger
footprints in brown and white.
Nowadays, this good garden welcomes all comers, even those on the rebound
from Edinburgh. The labouring classes are guaranteed entry, and not just
because there are fewer jobs than ever for people in the city. There is only
one class of absentee. As in Edinburgh, so in Glasgow you would be
hard-pressed to find a serious patch of weeds. It might be cold in Scotland
but there are camellias already this year - and none of the signs of couch
grass which are bothering me even now in one of my borders.

HALF-hardy annuals are those kinds which must be sown under cover to become
advanced enough to flower outdoors in the same year. The usual practice is
to sow in a moderately-heated greenhouse or propagator, with temperatures
between 16-20`C (61-68`F), in February or March and to grow-on the seedlings
in a slightly lower temperature until May, when they are accustomed
gradually to outdoor temperatures. Then, late in May or early June, they can
be planted in the garden.
There are, however, all manner of variations on this treatment, just as
there are all manner of differences in the characters and the actual degrees
of tenderness of the plants we call half-hardy annuals. Some of them are not
even annuals but perennials - for example, antirrhinums, lobelias and also
Salvia splendens, the plant we used to call Scarlet Salvia until it started
to blossom in other colours.
There are also some half-hardy annuals that need not be sown until early
May, such as zinnias and single-flowered annual asters; by then, they can be
sown out of doors in many places. They will, of course, flower later and
will not make such big plants as those that were sown a couple of months
earlier, but they will avoid the checks to growth that can be caused by
clumsy pricking-out or violent changes in temperature.
What is certain about this rather ill-defined group of plants is that if you
plan to grow some of them from seed, you should be making preparations now.
If you prefer to buy plants ready to go direct into the garden, you should
curb your impatience and not do anything until you are sure there is no
further risk of frost - most particularly, the short-duration radiation
frosts that can occur very severely around dawn in some places during April
and much of May. People living near the sea or in towns often are
best-placed to avoid these.
Because antirrhinums are perennials, they tend to grow at a fairly leisurely
rate and need to be sown rather early. I would certainly get them in by the
end of February. But they are hardy compared with petunias, nicotianas or
most marigolds which, if you are short of space in which to grow-on plants,
might well be left for March sowing.
The rate at which some of these true annuals can develop is astonishing. In
February or March, you might be faced with perhaps a dozen seed pans
occupying quite a small propagator. By April, there can be hundreds of
little pots, each with its rapidly-growing seedling, and the greenhouse
stagings are filled along with emergency shelves.
Some seeds and seedlings are very small and difficult to handle. The
dust-like seeds of begonias of all kinds need to be sown on the surface of
smooth compost; then, they should be covered with a sheet of glass or a
piece of tightly-stretched cling-film or polythene kept out of contact with
the seeds and the soil. This should stay in place until the seeds germinate;
then, it should be removed and the sprouted seeds covered with the merest
sprinkling of fine peat or sand.
It is possible to buy some seedlings in cartons in which the seeds have been
germinated and are just at the right stage for pricking-out an inch or so
apart in seed trays or whatever else you fancy. This method saves a lot of
trouble, but I find there are usually so many seedlings in the cartons that
you really need to share them with one or two other garden-owners.
The biggest threat to all half-hardy seedlings in the early stages is
damping-off disease (this is not really a single disease, but it is not
necessary to distinguish between different forms).
The thing is to avoid them all. That means using either naturally-sterile or
sterilised seed and pricking-off composts, and also being extremely careful
about drainage and avoiding over-watering.
Low temperatures can also bring on a bad attack of damping-off which can
wipe out whole cans of seedlings in a day or so. It is said that the disease
can be checked by watering affected seedlings with a fungicide called
Cheshunt Compound but, once the troubles have started, this is not really
very successful. This does not mean it is not worthwhile to water compost in
the seed pans before or immediately after the seed is sown, as a
preventative rather than a cure.
Most seeds will germinate equally well in the light or dark but some have
preferences. Impatiens, the Busy Lizzie, must have light so it should not be
shaded in any way, not even with compost. The method of covering the seed
pan with glass, polythene film or cling-film can be followed and will have
the added advantage of maintaining a moist compost and a humid atmosphere.
Mark well, however that they need light - not scorching sunshine. The seed
pans should be in a shady place where conditions will be equable all the
time rather than fluctuating rapidly, and the temperature at least 21`C
(70```F). After germination, this can drop to 18`C (65`F).
Geraniums are half-hardy perennials but vast numbers are treated now as if
they were half-hardy annuals and grown from seed sown each year. They are
not the easiest of seeds to germinate, although most seed companies help the
gardener by preparing them with clarification carried out by hand or with
acid. Whether treated or not, a temperature of 21-24`C (70-75`F) is
necessary for germination and the seeds should be sown quite deeply - about
a quarter-inch (6mm).
As all geranium seed is expensive, it seems wise to leave it until you have
gained experience with easier things such as marigolds. The seeds of these
are large and easy to handle, they have no special fads, and they can be
spaced widely enough in the seed pans to dispense with the need for
pricking-off. Instead, the seedlings can go direct into small pots when they
have made two or three true leaves; then, since they grow rapidly, they can
be moved into larger pots when the little ones get full of roots.
There are plenty of half-hardy annuals and plants treated as such which
should give little trouble. These include antirrhinums, ageratum,
brachycome, Chabaud carnations and annual pinks, cosmos dimophocheca,
lavatera, lobelia, nemesia, nicotiana, petunia, Rudbeckia Marmalade and
Rustic Dwarfs, venidium, verbena and zinnia.

This can be one of the most beautiful of the Asiatic birches but it is a
very variable tree and it is necessary to get a good form of it. This will
make a straight trunk 230 ft or more high, covered in white bark which peels
in papery strips to reveal a pinkish layer of bark beneath. The side
branches are not very long and are fairly upright so that the tree makes a
rather narrow head very suitable for cultivation in gardens. It is hardy and
grows well in all reasonably fertile soils provided they are well drained.
Leaves are similar to those of our native silver birch tree. It is widely
available from tree nurseries and sometimes from garden centres and should
be selected for the good colour of its bark. There is a reliable variety
named Grayswood Form.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Property: Good faith can sometimes wobble - How estate
agents may run into trouble over payment of agency fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS of less-expensive houses pay up and owners in the north of England
tend not to quibble about the costs of a sale. But in the rarified world of
million-pound houses, flats and even country homes in the south-east, the
practice of 'skipping' fees is becoming a potentially-crippling feature of
the market for estate agents.
A random sample of sales agencies, from Carlisle to Nottingham, suggests
that fee loss is not a significant problem outside the south-east. Sale
values tend to be lower and agency clients hold by their deals. But the
picture is different in London.
In the late summer and autumn last year, Antoine Lurot, of mews property
specialist Lurot Brand, highlighted an evident change of attitude by vendors
to agency fees. He revealed that he had been forced to seek asset-freezing
injunctions to stop former clients leaving the country without paying their
bills.
At the time, his public comment inspired only a limited response from other
agents. But the sales market was so quiet at the time that examples of
non-payment were few and far between.
Since the New Year, as asking prices subside steadily to reflect real
recessional values, sales volume has started to pick up. And with more
completions being achieved, the 'sell for free' problems are growing.
Take Winkworth's franchised offices around London. Spokeswoman Hilary Wade
says there now are 'lots of problems collecting fees. You get people who are
refusing to pay and others who just cannot pay.'
She adds: 'If they genuinely cannot pay, the office may try to come to an
arrangement.' But she notes: 'It is the more expensive homes - the top end,
not the bottom - that try to get away with it.'
Among high-value properties in central London, for example, the amounts some
vendors try to avoid paying are substantial. When you take into account a
2-2 1/2 per cent sale fee for a Pounds 1m property, plus perhaps a further 1
per cent of the value for advertising costs, you are looking at a
respectable-sized cheque, even for a wealthy owner.
A classic example of the problem comes from agent John D. Wood and
Aylesford, which had reason to break out the champagne after the successful
sale of a London town house a few weeks ago. At Pounds 2.2m, the agency had
achieved full value for the property after months of trying. The vendor
should be delighted.
Within 24 hours of completion, however, the agent was told there was no
money for its fees. The bank mortgage on the property, plus legal costs, had
absorbed all the sale proceeds.
George Pope, of John D. Wood, says that incorporating a clear contract for
eventual payment of fees, at the time an agent is instructed on a property,
is not worth the paper on which it is written if the vendor does not have
any cash left over after the sale. Calling on the client's solicitor to
ensure that agreed sale fees are held out of the completion money tends to
be an equally futile exercise.
In provincial towns and cities, the local sales agents and solicitors have
to get along together and tend to co-operate. In London, though, agents find
solicitors deeply reluctant to respond to requests to put aside some part of
their client's funds for someone else's fees.
In the heavily-international central London residential market, client
identity can be a problem in itself. Savills' Noel De Keyzer says: 'You do
have to be incredibly careful these days to make sure you know who your
client really is. Is it the person you see the house with and arrange the
instructions? Is it the wife? Is it a company?'
Having identified the client, Andrew Langton of Aylesford makes the point
that 'there is a certain element of good faith' in the relationship between
agent and client which does assume that fees will be paid. Recently,
however: 'We have had to start looking out for people who are hiding behind
companies and individuals who might be even mildly 'wobbly'.'
Langton recalls when it was normal for estate agents, rather than
solicitors, to hold the deposits on property sales, and when fees could be
deducted from that cash. Now, he accepts that any attempt to wrest back that
deposit-holding role from the lawyers looks like a lost cause.
A more worrying development for agents is the rise of the would-be
discretionary fee-payer. Simon de Boinville deals with country-house sales
for John D. Wood from its Winchester office. He tells of clients sending in
cheques for a proportion of the agreed sale fees which are marked as if 'in
full settlement' of costs.
De Boinville, and a number of his counterparts in other agencies dealing
with town sales, also report the arrival of a breed of client who expects to
be able to re-negotiate fees downwards after the completion of a sale.
The partial payers, the re-negotiators, and those who simply refuse to pay
and tell their agent: 'Sue me,' know full well that estate agents' rely more
than most service businesses on the good faith of their clients. Up among
high value properties it is evident that this good faith is in increasingly
short supply.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Hidden costs that can make life
policies so expensive - Figures of crucial importance for policyholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE IS an expensive business. The figures below show, in detail never
before exposed, the expenses with-profits life offices incur for each new
policy that is started, calculated as a proportion of the first year's
premiums.
The statistics are derived from returns filed with the Department of Trade
and Industry by the life companies themselves. As ever with the labyrinthine
world of life insurance, the figures are not as simple as they seem. Not all
of these costs are passed directly to the policyholder.
But these figures give consumers crucial information on their policies. They
cannot know what the investment return will be - but costs can, and should,
be grounds for judging an investment.
At the moment, sales of endowments, which often are tied to mortgages, seem
to be driven by commissions. These commissions might damage the sales of
life products, if they were known, publicised and understood.
What do these figures mean?
The Initial Expense Ratio expresses, as a proportion of the first year's
premiums, the amount an office spends on starting-up a policy. One actuary
described this as the 'price tag' of an endowment policy.
In general, commission payments to intermediaries take the biggest chunk.
This might explain why the one company listed in the DTI returns which pays
no commission whatever - Equitable Life  - also has easily the lowest
expenses.
The cost of administration is the other factor in play. Some selling
operations are more costly than others. TSB Life, which attempts to sell
only to customers of the TSB bank and restricts itself to a narrow product
range, is unlikely to incur the same costs as a larger company with a hungry
sales force roaming the country in search of clients.
The renewal ratio is a measure of the running costs of the policy compared
with the annual premiums.
How are these charges passed on to you?
This varies according to the ownership of the life company. Some are
'proprietorial,' which means they have a single proprietor, usually a
publicly-quoted company. Costs can be borne by the shareholders as well as
by both new and exisitng policyholders.
'Mutual' offices are owned by the with-profits policyholders. So,
theoretically, policyholders share in all the profits made and all the costs
incurred by the office. If expenses are particularly high in one year, they
can be absorbed by the life fund's reserves. They might not eat directly
into the initial expenses of that year's policyholders.
But they drag on overall returns and the practice, cannot continue
indefinitely. Roman Cizdyn, analyst at Smith New Court, points out the
bottom line: 'The lower the ratio, the better the value for the customers,
the shareholders, and future generations of policyholders.'
Which policies are covered by these figures?
Only with-profits offices are included. Companies offering only unit-linked
contracts, are not included.
The impact of costs differs between unit-linked and with-profits policies.
As Icki Iqbal, chief actuary at Royal Life, says: 'On the unit-linked side,
we price charges assuming a certain level of sales.'
'On the with-profits side, the policyholders are co-owners of the business.
They get 90 per cent of the profits or 90 per cent of the loss.'
What do the companies say?
Iqbal explained the sharp increase in Royal's expense ratio by saying that
the company had made hefty new investment to cope with the Financial
Services Act. Because sales had not come up to predictions, the company had
embarked on swingeing cuts of Pounds 25m in expenses. These were already
two-thirds complete, he said.
John Turton, a spokesman for Provident Life, which emerged with one of the
highest expense ratios, accepted the figures but said that the company's
high costs would not be borne by policyholders.
Costs were high because the company was in the process of an expensive
reorganisation, he said. Its parent, Winterthur, is funding expansion, which
has involved buying new offices and investing around Pounds 8m in computers.
The figures are ironic as around half of Provident Life's business comes
from a non-commission paying arm, which aims to distribute via fee-charging
advisers. The company has lobbied hard for stricter disclosure rules which,
in Turton's opinion, should be in cash terms or 'as close to cash terms as
possible.'
Shaun Kinnis, Equitable Life's marketing director, said that the office's
expenses were reduced further last year, probably against the trend. He
added: 'One reason is we do not pay commissions. It's also a question of
productivity.'
Equitable's 300 salesmen last year brought in Pounds 1.1bn in new premium
business - an average of Pounds 3.3m per representative. The equivalent
figure for the Prudential, which uses a direct sales force, is Pounds
123,000.
What are the dangers of cashing in a policy early?
These figures are the more alarming because it is plain that many
policyholders surrender their endowments early, so bearing the full brunt of
the charges but gaining no benefit from any long-term growth.
A study by the Securities and Investments Board - released in December  -
showed that, overall, a quarter to a third of policies were cancelled within
two years. This injected extra fuel to the debate over disclosure which SIB
had initiated already with its retail review of regulation. While several
life offices claimed the figures were flawed (although they were defended by
SIB), nobody has come forward with a comprehensive alternative.
Early lapse rates put high initial charges in a worse light. Jean Eaglesham,
of the Consumers' Association, attacked the combination of high initial
expenses and early-lapse rates because consumers do not know what their
charges will be. 'It allows companies to do what they like and hide behind
an industry-wide figure which is not in cash terms and which consumers do
not understand, anyway,' she said.
'It is shocking that they are so secretive. I think the high expenses and
the secretiveness are absolutely interlinked.'
Many people would make a further link between high commissions, central to
high charges, and high levels of bad advice. In its annual report for the
year to the end-June 1991, Lautro, the life assurance regulator, recorded a
77 per cent increase in the number of complaints, the majority of which
relate to over-selling and the sale of unsuitable products.
What should we be told?
The Consumers' Association wants company-specific disclosure of costs in
cash terms at the point of sale. This is one of the stronger points of view
in the debate, but Eaglesham admitted that consumer research is necessary to
find out exactly which method of disclosure is understood best.
The present method, Reduction In Yield (RIY), shows how many percentage
points office expenses would deduct from a projected investment yield of 7
per cent. Thus 4 per cent, a seemingly small figure, means that expenses
would eat away more than half of your return. Companies make a performance
projection using an RIY based on industry averages, rather than their own
costs.
An actuary on a Lautro committee admits: 'At the moment, I shouldn't think
the consumer has a clue what he's buying.' Others point out that
illustrations in cash terms, or projecting deductions from premiums, could
in themselves be misleading.
Many in the industry are nervous about broader disclosure, because this
could deter customers. Others believe that greater openness is vital.
A few points are definite. The early penal surrender values are not
understood (the SIB data and Lautro complaints admit of no other
interpretation) and must be made clearer. The proposal to show early
surrender values next to the total premiums which would have been paid is
sensible and must go ahead.
Recent articles in the Weekend FT have shown that other forms of savings,
such as unit trust savings schemes and personal equity plans, have
outperformed endowments in the long term. These figures do not prove that
your life company gives you poor value for your policy. But they should give
you ammunition to ask some pertinent questions.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Property: It's been worth the wait in NW8 - John Brennan
looks closely at one of London's best residential areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE residential arc across the north and north-west of central London - from
Highgate to Hampstead and down to St John's Wood, at the top end of Regent's
Park - includes some of the most frequently-traded houses in the capital.
The locals cannot sit still - and the area attracts more than its share of
short-term owners from abroad.
In the mid-1980s St John's Wood, in particular, was made nearly impassable
because of builders' skips parked outside houses and flat blocks, filling up
with previous owners' interior decorations. The turnover record probably is
held by a family house in Little Venice, by the Regent's Canal; it had three
new kitchens, to match its changing owners, in just four years. But in the
deal-crazed pace of that period, even the decorators lost track of who was
having what done
There has been constant sales movement in this northern arc ever since, even
though sales agencies in west-central London have been struggling to find
signs of life in their market. Why the difference?
Divorce always helps to make available a steady supply of houses and flats.
The area has its full share of repossessions and cash-strapped sales, too.
The fact that more owners live there year-round than in, say, Mayfair,
Knightsbridge or Belgravia also goes some way to explain this greater
activity.
British buyers within this northern arc tend to have clear ideas about where
they want to live. As a generality, Hampstead Garden Suburbanites may seek
to trade up within their area but rarely beyond. Hampstead home-seekers
often turn to the similar-sized and less expensive family homes on the
Highgate side of the heath, while those who prefer St John's Wood are
willing to set the probability of having to buy a leasehold against
time-savings on travel into work.
Overseas buyers, as Noel De Keyzer of Savills confirms, have a
less-localised view of these markets. Often, they will start their search on
the northern border of Regent's Park and end up two miles north in Hampstead
or Highgate because they do not want to spend money on a leasehold. This
applies particularly to Americans, who commonly start their search at the
park's north-west corner because their ambassador's residence and the
American school are there. But many end up buying freeholds to the north.
The same thinking applied when the Sultan of Brunei's home-buyers were
active in London a few years ago. They looked at the leaseholds, but then
followed elements of the Saudi royal family north, buying several houses in
Highgate. His last big purchase was a Pounds 5.6m mansion in The Bishop's
Avenue, Highgate's 'millionaires' row.'
But that was then. Sales agents now are attuned more acutely to the calls of
Far Eastern cash. Their patience is beginning to be rewarded.
'Hong Kong buyers are active in the area now,' says De Keyzer. 'They are
looking for properties that they can buy and rent out for three to four
years. A lot of them are medical people who can practice over here after the
hand-over to China in 1997 and, yes, they do have plenty of cash.'
These buyers have been on the sidelines for the past few months, some
viewing and others taking a long view on areas such as Docklands and
acquiring bargain flats. But most have been dissuaded from action by the
argument that London prices have further to fall.
In London's northern housing arc, price cuts have been sharp enough to
persuade even sceptical Hong Kong investors that they are seeing good value.
These buyers are expecting, and getting, minimum returns on their
investments of eight to 10 per cent from open market rents on the modern,
two-bedroom flats or modernised freehold family houses that head most
property shoppers' lists. They can achieve these returns (occasionally,
substantially higher) at a time of stable rather than rising rents, and
because of property price cuts of between a quarter to a third since 1988.
The odd cautionary tale of a price collapse helps realism among vendors, and
most sales agents' conversations are full of such disasters. Savills'
records include one property on the Mortgage Corporation's books which sold
in 1987-88 for Pounds 3.5m, and re-sold recently for Pounds 1.25m after
repossession.
At much the same time, Middleheath, one of the largest of the red-brick
Victorian mansions built along West Heath Road to face Hampstead Heath, was
on the market because of the BCCI bank crash. Promoted initially at an
asking price of Pounds 3.5m, it has now been sold to Far Eastern buyers for
nearer Pounds 2m.
Andrew Wadsworth's is asking prices on some of his Dockland developments by
Tower Bridge once overshadowed all comparable ones. Subsequent price-cutting
on those schemes recognises the changed market  - as does the 'just under
Pounds 2m' asking figure (actually Pounds 1.975m, via Savills in Hampstead.
Tel: 071-431-4844 - his own house in Carlton Hill, St John's Wood.
This is a classic 1840s Italianate villa in an area that can claim to be
London's first estate development with semi-detached and detached, rather
than terraced, housing. Wadsworth has done an enormous amount of renovation
tothis nine-bedroom property.
The Grove and The Towers are at the geographical top and bottom of the
northern arc - and the two most expensive homes on sale in London.
The newly-built Towers in Highgate, with 31,000 square feet of residential
space, has a Pounds 25m price tag that leans heavily on the hope that
someone will wish to buy, and have finished to taste, one of the biggest
houses in town.
The Grove is on the extreme southern edge of the arc,on the bank of the
Regent's Canal. Although Pounds 17.5m for a 96-year Crown lease does put it
in the same super-cost range as the Dallas-style Towers, there the
similarities end. Better-known for many years as Nuffield Lodge (because of
its post-war lessee) the Grade I-listed Regent's Park villa that the late
Robert Holmes a Court and his family restored and improved it to a standard
that would have shamed Decimus Burton's builders in 1822. Mrs Janet Homes a
Court is selling it because she spends less time in London since her
husband's death 18 months ago.
Progressive additions have given the house 12,300 square feet of space on
three floors, with a separate studio and small office building. Set in more
than four acres of garden stretching half a mile along the canal, sales
agent Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) is unlikely to have any problems
attracting viewers. Buyers should be close behind.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Taking care of trouble at t'mill
 -A traditional craftsman who rose above the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE beginning of 1991, David Nicholls' order book was so thin that after
21 years as a millwright he wondered if it was worth carrying on.
Local authority cuts, a general lack of cash around and - in common with
many other hands-on small businessmen - failing to go out and market his
company meant that, for Nicholls, the recession started early.
However, even if he had not won an important restoration contract for the
Warwick Castle watermill, he still would have been able to keep his team
together.
Nicholls is at a loss to explain why 1991 - a year most small businesses
prefer to forget - turned out to be a year of upturn for him: one of the
handful of experienced, full-time professional millwrights in the UK, with
profitable work in half-a-dozen counties and an expected turnover of 220,000
(in a business of which he is the sole employee.)
Wind, water and to a certain extent gas all play their part in his varied
workload. Nicholls, a specialist in historic buildings, was called in to
assess Warwick Castle watermill, on the site of a medieval mill, rebuilt as
a flour mill in the 18th century. It was adapted in the last century,
becoming a comprehensive generating station supplying the castle with
electric power generated from water and town gas.
Nicholls has worked on 26 windmills and 17 watermills, besides survey work
and feasibility studies on another 35 mills. His job at Warwick Castle was
to restore and recommission the waterwheel and its supporting mechanism;
restore the control mechanisms, the transmission gear, the sluicegate and
the massive trash screens; remove the debris that accumulates in the
millrace, and be responsible for constructing a huge wrought-iron
eel-catching framework which, he believes, will be the only one of its type
in the UK
This meant liaising with experts: architects, gas and electrical engineers
and steel fabricators, as well as elusive wrought- and cast-iron suppliers.
He also had to supervise his own team of 14, whose talents include precision
engineering as well as traditional millwrighting skills such as joinery,
carpentry, timber engineering; blacksmithing, forging and leather work.
Such a complex task underlines a modern problem faced by the 'traditional'
millwright: how to keep together a large team of experts whose skills -
individually vital  - almost certainly will not be needed all the time.
One answer is to undertake a diversity of tasks simultaneously - much as a
builder does with his workforce. Another is - again like the builder - to
employ most workers as sub-contractors and remain able to guarantee
sufficient work to ensure that you can call on their skills when needed.
Nicholls says: 'In millwrighting, some of those skills are so esoteric that
you come under pressure to provide employment for most of the year.'
This was the problem when his order book took a dip in 1990. There were jobs
that would have provided an existence, but insufficient to provide the
Pounds 25,000 a year that Nicholls aims to be able to pay himself, plus a
reasonable return for his team.
'The other key to in this business is to know what is going on in the market
place. There are so few full-time professional millwrights that this is not
a difficult task.'
He is trying to hedge against the future, accepting a partnership with a
friend and business associate, Alan Smith of Impel Engineering, a four-man
precision engineering company based at Woodcote. He also plans to develop
the team's conservation work on historic buildings.
'Looking to the future in traditional millwrighting, I don't believe there
are any wind- or water-powered flour mills left that one could renovate and
turn into economic businesses," Nicholls says. 'But I think there is a
future for water mills if they are used for other functions - for example,
as small individual paper mills or power sources using renewable energy for
other applications, preferably with visitor interest.
'There are any number of conservation bodies and enthusiastic individuals
who may require millwrighting work. But so often I get a call from someone
who then realises that the job would be hopelessly expensive. I have to
explain that in order to retain my team I have to run the operation as a
business. Too many millwrighting enterprises fail because they have been run
by devotees who have put their enthusiasms before business acumen.
'Sadly, this means that there are still many worthy old buildings that are
going to fall down. But there are many amateur groups who successfully
restore mills and other historic buildings over many years in their own
time, using people like myself to provide professional expertise or
components.'

FT  22 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exercising a warrant
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME warrants which I hold will shortly reach the date when I shall have the
right to subscribe for shares in the company which issues them.
The subscription price of the shares is presently considerably below the
market price of the shares and I am concerned about the capital gains
aspect.
Am I right in believing that a capital gain will arise, and that this gain
will be the difference between the value of the shares for which I will
subscribe at the date of subscription, and the cost of the warrants.
No, the exercise of warrants-to-subscribe is not a disposal for CGT
purposes.
The cost of the warrants should be indexed from the month in which they were
purchased up to the month in which they are exercised.
That indexed figure is then added to the subscription price to form the base
cost of the shares; and that combined base cost then ranks for indexation
from the subscription month.
If the warrants were purchased before April 6 1982, then indexation starts
from March 1982, and their quarter-up value at March 31 1982 will be
relevant - it is a pity that you did not say when you acquired them.
The rules are to be found in paragraph 15 of schedule 19 to the Finance Act
1985. Although that paragraph does not in fact cover options-to-subscribe
(it only covers options-to-purchase, in contrast to the Corresponding rule
in paragraph 7 of schedule 13 to the Finance Act 1982), there is an
unpublished extrastatutory concession on the point.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital Gains Tax: an
introduction). You may also wish to write to the Inland Revenue Public
Enquiry Office, Somerset House, Strand, London, asking for formal
confirmation of the continued operation of the unpublished concession
extending the scope of paragraph 15 of schedule 19 to the 1985 Act to
options-to-subscribe.
At the same time, you could ask them why they have steadfastly declined to
publish this 6 1/2 -year-old concession in the official booklet of Revenue
concessions, IRI (with supplements).

FT  22 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Compensating family trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH reference to compensation limits for building societies accounts, what
is the position when family trusts make such investments?
Specially, I am concerned (as settlor) with (1) an interest-in-position
trust and (2) an accumulation to maintenance settlement, each with two
primary beneficiaries, and four trustees. The accounts are normally opened
in the name of the trust by two of the trustees.
The trustees are together as a single body of persons, and so will have
protection up to Pounds 20,000 only, however great the sum held by them: see
paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Building Societies Act 1986.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT exemption on BES schemes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I FIRST invested in Business Expansion Scheme companies in 1984/85 and have
made further investments every year since. The earlier schemes were not
exempt from taxes on dividends or capital gains.
Can you tell me:
(1) With effect from which tax year were these exemptions introduced;
(2) With regard to those BES investments which are exempt from Capital Gains
Tax, will it be possible to claim CGT relief again the loss suffered in the
event of a company failing and being wound up, or in the event of the shares
eventually being sold at a loss?
(1) The exemption applies to shares issued after March 18 1986.
(2) No.
Section 149C of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, as amended, (which is now
being re-enacted as clause 150 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Bill)
says: '(2) A gain or loss which accrues to an individual on the disposal of
any shares issues after 18 March 1986 in respect of which relief has been
given to him and not withdrawn shall not be a chargeable gain or allowable
loss for the purpose of Capital Gains Tax.'

FT  22 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Helicopter group rides out a
storm - A 'Thatcherite' enterprise that is making headway in spite of hard
times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT WERE the bellwethers of the middle and twilight years of Margaret
Thatcher's Britain? Soaring, then sliding, house prices? The spawning of new
businesses at record rates then, also at record rates, company bankruptcies?
Industrialists applauding the enterprise revolution, then wondering whether
it was just a bag of hot air? Well, all these - and helicopters, too.
In the six years after 1980, the number of craft on the UK's civil
helicopter register hovered between 500 and 600. A mini-boom then took place
over the next five years as numbers leapt by more than a half to well over
900. Companies from manufacturing to accountancy, as well as a few
individuals with bulging wallets, decided that travel by their own rotary
wing aircraft was a necessity. Either that or a toy talisman of success, the
Bollinger flowing all the way to Brands Hatch or the British Open.
But the balloon burst. Few new helicopters are being bought. Growth of the
civil register first stalled, then went into gentle reverse. Second-hand
prices have nose-dived. A twin-engined machine in good condition that would
have sold for Pounds 180,000 can now be acquired, with a bit of searching,
for half that.
Flying into this economic headwind, Aeromega, a helicopter company in Essex,
has still managed to make headway, raising its turnover steadily to Pounds
1.4m in the last financial year and Pounds 1.1m in the first seven months of
this. A lot of military personnel need to rebuild lives outside the armed
forces as a result of national defence cuts; Kit Pemberton and Mark
Barry-Jackson, former Fleet Air Arm pilots and joint owners of Aeromega
successfully made that transition, first working as pilots for private
industry and then for themselves.
Aeromega became airborne in the early 1980s, starting off in the
unprepossessing location of an office above a kebab house in the seedy
district of London's Soho. The company began with a brokering service,
hiring planes and helicopters to do specific jobs, such as taking Revlon
customers to France or organising powerboating junkets for cigarette
companies. 'It was a bit like a travel agency,' says Barry-Jackson. 'We
didn't mind what we organised as long as we got our 7 1/2 per cent.' It was
seat-of-the-pants flying. 'We were living in penury and our wives were doing
the supporting,' Pemberton says.
Since moving to Stapleford airfield near Epping Forest, north of London, in
1984, Aeromega has grown into a company with 21 employees. Its expansion
sheds light not only on the small world of operating and using helicopters
but on running a business where information is the key to exploiting a
market.
Aeromega looks after 14 helicopters, only one of which it owns itself.
Contracts for a dozen of these machines allow them to be chartered out by
Aeromega to other clients when not in use by their owners. Of the hourly
fees of Pounds 750 per flying hour for the twin-engined Aerospatiales and
Pounds 450 for the single-engined Bells, owners take more than half. 'We
tell them this could just about cover the cost of running their machine,'
Pemberton says. 'In effect, we lease from the owners, feed the machines,
water them and put them out to work.'
Several wings make up the business. These include the managing and provision
of engineering for helicopters, passenger charter, buying machines for
clients, working for utilities like electricity and water, aerial filming
and police support. It has a contract with Essex police and recently secured
a three-year contract with Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.
This has helped cushion the loss of 'soft' corporate business. 'Jollies are
now very rare,' says Barry-Jackson. 'Companies taking clients to blow a wad
of Pounds 50 notes at Doncaster races that doesn't happen very often now.
The froth has blown off the top of the market.'
The recession flipped some helicopter companies into a crash dive. But
Aeromega continued to increase turnover, raise hiring charges and rack up
pre-tax profits of a little under Pounds 50,000 a year.
Aeromega's biggest expenses are its wage bill of Pounds 420,000 (pilots earn
Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000 a year), and renting two hangars at more than
Pounds 40,000 a year. The company has never had to borrow. 'We could have
expanded much faster by borrowing but in the present climate, I'm glad we
didn't,' says Pemberton.
The company uses a publicity brochure but navigates the market mainly by
word of mouth. 'Keeping your ear to the ground is crucial in finding
contracts,' Pemberton says. 'Our pilots are vital in this process.' It
claims never to poach work from other helicopter outfits, nor to
deliberately undercut on contract price. 'Clients will say: 'well, if they
are undercutting on price, what else are they undercutting on?'.' The
recession, though, has meant far more tendering for contracts.
It has not all been easy. A flying school set up by Aeromega belly-flopped
because of minimal margins, fiddly administration and a tendency to produce
new helicopter pilots who immediately went off and set up businesses in
competition.
Passengers can also get a bumpy ride. 'A few people get sick,' says
Pemberton. 'We normally make them clean it up themselves.'
