FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gilts exert a fresh attraction - How
to . . . invest in government bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATE investor is being lured back into gilts. The attraction of these
bonds, issued by the UK government, is their absolute security. Not only can
the investor be certain that gilts will be repaid, he knows when and at what
price.
The returns available at the moment are between 9 and 9.7 per cent, higher
than that available from some building society accounts and well above the
rate of inflation. Some believe that the 1990s will be a period of low
inflation and interest rates, in which case the present returns on gilts
may, in retrospect, seem highly attractive.
Of course, there are risks. It might seem foolish to buy gilts ahead of a
general election which could result in a Labour victory and consequent falls
in gilt prices. Even if the Conservatives win, the government's budget
deficit is growing and it will have to issue many more gilts to finance that
deficit.
In addition, anyone buying gilts should be committed to holding them
long-term. Those who are forced to sell their holdings in the short term may
not get their capital back.
Having considered the risks, though, how does the investor who still wants
to buy gilts actually build a portfolio? These are the factors you have to
consider.
Interest rate
All gilts have a 'coupon,' an interest rate which they will pay based on a
percentage of the face (par) value. But, in practical terms, this coupon is
unimportant to the investor since gilts rarely trade at exactly their face
value. What actually matters is the yield, which is expressed in two ways.
The running yield is the interest return which the investor will receive
each year, expressed as a percentage of the price paid. So, an investor who
buys a gilt with a coupon of 12 per cent at a price of 120 will get a
running yield of 10 per cent.
But since gilts have a par value of 100, someone who buys a gilt at 120 will
face a capital loss. The expression for this is the gross redemption yield.
If the gilt is trading above par value, the running yield will be higher
than the gross redemption yield and vice versa.
The Exchequer 12 1/4 per cent 1999, for example, was trading on Tuesday at
113 15/16 , on a running yield of 10.75 per cent and a gross redemption
yield of 9.5 per cent. The 8 per cent 2009, priced at 90 15/32 , offered a
running yield of 8.84 per cent and a gross redemption yield of 9.1 per cent.
Price
The par value of gilts is 100. Thus, an investor who buys a gilt priced
below 100 can lock-in to a tax-free capital gain if he holds the stock until
maturity. The snag is that very few gilts are trading below par value at the
moment. Most of those which are have maturity dates of over 15 years.
Buying a gilt which is trading above par value brings the investor a higher
running yield, but at the expense of a capital loss. Take the 15 1/2 per
cent 1998 gilt which, at Tuesday's close, was trading at 128 9/32 . The
running yield was a very healthy 12.08 per cent, but the investor who held
it to maturity would lose more than a fifth of his capital. By contrast, the
8 3/4 per cent 1997 gilt was trading at 97 21/32 , offering the prospect of
a modest capital yield. But the running yield was a much lower 8.96 per
cent.
Maturity date
Nearly all gilts have a set date on which they will be repaid. These
so-called maturity dates range, on conventional gilts, from later this year
to 2017. Selecting a gilt with a long maturity date means that the investor
has locked-in his chosen interest rate for a longer period.
The snag, however, is that the possible impact of inflation is much greater.
If inflation averages 5 per cent a year, then the real value of a gilt which
matures in 2007 will have halved by the time it is repaid.
A gilt with a short maturity date is much less prone to inflation. However,
when it is repaid, the investor is exposed to 're-investment risk.' He
cannot know what rate he will receive when he re-invests the proceeds of the
matured gilt. The consensus wisdom, therefore, is that it is best for
investors to select a range of maturity dates.
Tax
Gilts are likely to be most suitable for those in the basic-rate tax bracket
who want a secure income. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, and do not need
income, then National Savings certificates are likely to offer better value;
the equivalent gross return for a top-rate taxpayer on the 36th issue is
14.17 per cent.
An alternative investment for a top-rate taxpayer is index-linked gilts,
where much of the return comes in the form of tax-free capital gain.
Peter Jones, of stockbroker Greenwell Montagu, has suggested a portfolio of
gilts for those who want a monthly income (see table). Since they pay
dividends twice a year, a minimum of six gilts is needed to achieve this
aim. Jones has aimed for gilts which are trading at around par (based on
prices prevailing earlier this week) and has concentrated on large
marketable issues.

COUNTY NatWest WoodMac has published its investment trust review of 1991
which takes a fairly upbeat view of the prospects for the sector.
The authors are bullish about UK equities while yields are at 5 per cent. A
long period of low inflation would, while being good for gilts, be even
better for equities.
CNWM feels that Labour is more likely to win the election. If this happens,
it recommends overseas trusts, capital growth trusts, large trusts heavy in
blue chips, high-income specialists and the more risk-oriented securities of
split capital trusts.
If the Conservatives win, CNWM particularly recommends high-income trusts,
income-growth trusts and zero-dividend preference shares.
Another sector which CNWM thinks is worthy of attention is venture capital.
This sector has been hit by bad news at particular trusts, such as Ensign
and Gresham House. Discounts have widened and this may offer scope for
bargain-hunting.
However, the authors stress that 'in seeking to capitalise on a recovery in
these stocks, selectivity must be the key.' They add: 'There may be diamonds
among the dross but there is also dross among the diamonds.'

UNILEVER, the consumer products group, reports on Tuesday its figures for
the fourth quarter and full year. With the US poised uncertainly between
recession and recovery, the British economy in the doldrums and growth
petering out in continental Europe, the results will depend heavily on the
success of Unilever's continuing efforts to improve margins through
cost-cutting.
Analysts' forecasts for full year pre-tax profits range from Pounds 1.8bn to
Pounds 1.84bn, a modest increase on the Pounds 1.78bn earned in 1990. Much
of the difference between the forecasts is due to assumptions about how
Unilever will allocate extraordinary charges incurred during the year.
British Gas will report results for the 12 months to December 31 on
Thursday. Because the company is this year changing its accounting year end
from March 31 to December 31, it will also supply a figure for the nine
months to December 31.
Most analysts expect profit before tax for the year to December to be
between Pounds 1.24bn and Pounds 1.28bn. British Gas has already indicated
it will announce a dividend for the full year of 6p.
UK insurers are bracing themselves to report some of the worst results in
the history of the industry next week. Two composites (general and life
companies) - Commercial Union and Royal Insurance  - report next week. Both
will post losses for 1991.
CU, which reports on Wednesday, will do best with a loss restricted to
between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds
1.4m last year. Royal Insurance, which reports on Thursday, has been
devastated by losses from mortgage indemnity claims and could see its losses
rise from Pounds 270m to Pounds 310m, up from Pounds 187m in 1990.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, reports its full-year results on Tuesday. Analysts expect the company
will for the first time make a Pounds 1bn profit compared with Pounds 860m
last year.
Analysts will be looking carefully at the growth rate of SmithKline's
pharmaceuticals sales, which have been slower than some of its rivals. In
particular, they will be looking carefully at revenues from Kytril,
SmithKline's treatment for nausea in cancer patients. It competes directly
with Glaxo's Zofran.
ICI, the chemicals giant, reports its full-year results on Thursday. The
company is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 835m. The
figures are unlikely to demonstrate any sign of an upturn in demand for
commodity chemical. Attention will be focused on the success at the
pharmaceuticals division (about 70 per cent of the group's profit) and the
progress of the company's rationalisation programme. The final dividend is
expected to be maintained at 34p.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Recovery? When?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRY HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the traps that lie in the path of the new investor the 'recovery
share' must surely by the most insidious. The pit is so perfectly
camouflaged. This is not 'speculation'; it is 'investment': backing some
solid famous company which has run into a bit of bad luck.
Consider, for instance, Sears, with a world-famous emporium in Oxford
Street, half the shoe shops in England, not to mention shoe factories, men's
wear, women's fashions, sports goods and buttressed by property. A veritable
treasure chest. Surely the only direction now must be up.
Or look at that classic 'recovery share', Chloride. Investors might not
agree, but then they have been sitting at the convalescent's bedside for
five yeas, watching the share price fall lower and lower. As for Sears'
'recovery', the city editors of two leading Sunday newspapers in December
1985 placed it high among their selections for the coming year. It was then
104p and it is now around 105p - a recovery share on the way to becoming as
permanent a feature of the scene as the Lutine bell at Lloyds.
The invisible factor in the recovery share trap is time, which almost always
seems to be longer than expected.
It is true that these long lingering convalescences may often be broken by
moments when the patient suddenly sits up in bed - before falling back
exhausted on the pillow.
Ever buoyed by bid rumours, Sears did at one point reach 180p, and Chloride
100p (in 1987) before the relapse. Clearly, the successful investor needs to
buy at precisely the moment recovery is imminent, prudently selling before
the relapse. Not an easy trick.
It is important to inquire closely why the bargain basement share acquired
the recovery tag in the first place. For the recovery share proper is not
merely a cyclical share, but a share marked by misfortune. Some companies,
like some human beings, become accident-prone.
A single World in Action TV programme, casting doubt on the durability of
timber-frame houses wreaked enormous damage - with little real justification
 -on Barratt Developments in 1983/84. The shares dropped from 250p to 150p
within two years. The curious, opulent convalescence of Sears owes much to
the extraordinary and abundant diversity of the shipbuilding-to-shops to
factories-to-property empire hurriedly amassed in the 1950s by the financier
Charles Clore.
Chloride's perennial recovery status is rooted in the pioneering of the
Chloride Electrical Storage Syndicate Ltd of 1891, and its failure to invest
soon enough for changing times.
So, for these convalescents, the essential question for the recovery share
addict must be: How long?
For recovery share addicts, reading the back issues of the financial press
can be a salutary exercise. In the summer of 1990 an analyst of Salomon
Brothers was recommending the purchase of the Dares Estates at 14p a share,
because of its exceptionally high discount to asset values  - a fact to
gladden the recovery share addict's heart.
Alas, from confident talk of sums to come from rent reviews, the emphasis
now changed to emergency sales, bank guarantees and, to quote Dares chairman
 -survival. The shares were 3p this month.
Hope, said Schopenhauer, the gloomy philosopher, is the 'hook through the
nose by which humanity is led'.
Nevertheless, as the persistence of these things called 'recovery shares'
shows, the hook holds. Last November the brokers Wise Speke issued a buy
note on Sears Holdings. There are now clear signs, it said, the share should
now be viewed as a quality recovery stock, but the shares do not as yet
carry a recovery rating. It could be right. Who knows?

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A new code of conduct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU regularly become exasperated with your bank or building society
because of poor service, you will soon be able to quote from their code of
customer conduct to support your case.
Good Banking, the draft voluntary code for personal customers, prepared by
banks and building societies working with consumers groups, appeared last
December and comes into effect on March 16. Some banks will apply it
directly. Others say they will issue their own codes or charters which go
beyond it.
Lloyds Bank was the first institution to issue its code. It has now been
followed by Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, and TSB. Barclays, the
largest UK bank, says it will be producing a leaflet on customer relations
in the next fortnight. Midland says it will be producing a document fairly
soon for its customers.
Not all the codes are entirely new. Bradford &amp; Bingley has been issuing a
booklet to its customers for several years, telling them of their rights.
Here are some key points to watch for when your bank or building society
presents its code:
Charges: how transparent are they? Can you see in advance how much you will
have to pay for using a bank's services? Better still, will it notify you in
advance of what it is charging you? So far only TSB has promised to
introduce pre-notification for customers.
Complaints: whom do you make them to? How swiftly will they be acted on? How
many contact names and numbers are you given? Bradford &amp; Bingley refers
customers either to its branch manager or to the Controller of Secretarial
Services in head office. Lloyds has a head office customer service unit
which can be called at the local rate, and has installed telephone answering
machines at all its branches.
Customer confidentiality: This was one of the main issues when the code was
being discussed. The banks now all have the technology to build up a
centralised data-base on their customers and use it to cross-sell financial
services: for example, to target current account customers with insurance
marketing.
The snag is that not only do many customers dislike being bombarded with
sales material - it is questionable whether it is even legal for a bank to
hold details of customers in this way unless they give their express
consent. This should be clearly given at intervals, not just quietly
extracted once through inertia selling techniques and then used for ever.
Lloyds is taking express consent very seriously. All its customers are being
asked to return a signed form agreeing to allow the bank to give their
details to other companies in the Lloyds group. A sweetener is on offer:
Pounds 1,500 worth of free accidental death cover for three years, provided
the customer stays with Lloyds.
However, it is disappointing to see that Abbey National, the retail banking
group, is sending some customers a letter offering no-cost cover of Pounds
1,000 with a clause in the small print on the application which allows Abbey
National to disclose information to other companies in the group and use it
for marketing.
Abbey National says it will change this wording after the code comes into
force in March, and that information about customers is held with a central
registry and not circulated to subsidiaries.
Lost and stolen cards: does the code make clear that unless you knowingly
let someone else use your card and PIN number, your liability is limited to
a maximum of Pounds 50?
Will the code change very much? Consumers' groups have already made some
criticisms, but there are reasons for cautious optimism. One is that there
is clear competition emerging, at least among some banks such as Bank of
Scotland, TSB and Lloyds, to produce the best code. The other is that bank
and building society customers are likely to be much more forceful in
defending their rights now that they have clear definitions of them.
Personal customer banking services should improve in the next few years as a
result.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER week, another acronym in the tax shelter market.
This week brought us HEDGE (Higher Education with Determined Growth &amp; Exit),
sponsored by Capital Ventures, and RAY (Residences At York), sponsored by
Hodgson Martin.
Both are covenanted 'buy-back' companies, which attempt to assure a return
after five years by buying property for universities and then selling it
back to them for a fixed price. HEDGE has buy-back agreements with the
University College of North Wales, Bangor, and the University of Salford -
at Pounds 1.38 for every Pounds 1 spent now. The rate on offer from RAY is
only Pounds 1.28, but this is being funded out of fixed interest deposits
bought by the University.
Two other companies, Sun Life BesRes VIII Phoenix and SERAH III make no
attempt at a guarantee but will go 'bargain-hunting' in search of high
capital growth.
The most interesting launch is the Friendly Stop Inns series of 14
companies. This extends the 'buy-back' principle to trading companies. It
will buy small hotels for Friendly Hotels, and sell them back to Friendly
after five years. Investors have a put option to sell the inns to Friendly
at a price of Pounds 1.36 for every Pounds 1 spent now, after costs have
been taken into account. There is no third party guarantor; the deal is
dependent on Friendly, which has net assets of Pounds 73.5m and market
capitalisation of Pounds 45m.
The Enterprise Zone market remains in the shadow of Canary Wharf, in
London's Docklands. The Cabot Square Trust does not have the greatest yield,
but does have strong financial security and populist marketing - you receive
an invitation to go to the top of the Canary Wharf tower with every
prospectus.
Laser Richmount this week fought back with a series of less glamorous but
possibly higher-yielding EZ trusts. Its Chatham Trust will raise Pounds 16m
for five office buildings, aiming for an 11 per cent initial post-tax yield.
The Inverclyde Trust is raising Pounds 9.5m (yield 11.76 per cent after top
rate tax), while the Dudley Trust is looking for Pounds 9.5m, offering a 13
per cent initial post tax yield.

<TEXT>
THE run-up to the UK general election, there has been continued selling by
directors and a diminished amount of buying activity.
Two of the largest sales of the week in fact signal strong performances. The
Airtours share price has increased sevenfold over the past year and so the
sale of a relatively small proportion of four directors' stock at 250p is
seen as a measure to improve marketability and in order to realise profits.
Seton Healthcare's share price has more than doubled over the past year and
the sale by four directors at 302p is intended to release stock.
Danka Business Systems, suppliers of office equipment in the US, has been
performing strongly in an uncertain market. Directors' confidence is evident
from their recent purchase of 410,000 shares at 161.5p
Directors at Harland Simon, the electronics company, have sold significant
quantities of stock over the course of last year at prices as high at 700p.
Last week the company issued a profits warning, since when the shares have
fallen sharply. Soon after the statement two directors purchased stock at
260p, but these purchases still only account for a small proportion of the
sales made during 1991. The share price currently stands at 173p.

A BROWN envelope from the Inland Revenue demanding tax payable by April 5
may have already crossed your threshold. The tax planning season is on us
and it makes sense to think about settling your affairs now, writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
The big uncertainty is the Budget on March 10. Casson &amp; Beckman, chartered
accountants, advise people to 'take advantage of the current law as it
stands before the Budget, to pre-empt any adverse changes, and then consider
any further action in the light of announcements.'
There are always routine measures which can be taken now. These include
making full use of your annual tax exemptions, personal allowance and, if
you are married, those of your spouse.
But be warned: you should not act with the sole aim of lessening your tax
bill. For example, fears of a Labour government coming to power and altering
inheritance tax should not prompt you to accelerate gifts, unless you really
wanted to. Capital Gains Tax: Try to use up the full allowance of Pounds
5,500 for the current tax year. This may involve 'bed-and-breakfasting'
shares that have made a gain by selling them on the market and repurchasing
them to bring gains up to the tax-free allowance. Your taxable gain next
time you sell will be lessened, since you will be starting off from a higher
base.
If you bought your shares between April 6 1982 and the present, you are
given an allowance for the effects of inflation on the value of your
holdings. This indexation allowance varies, depending on the month in which
you bought your shares. (See page VI for table and explanation).
'Bed-and-breakfasting' shares can also be done to establish a loss, if that
is more convenient, and indexation will increase the loss.
If you have reached your CGT threshold but your spouse has not, consider
transferring assets. These transfers can usually be made free of CGT.
Remember that the sale of assets such as paintings, silverware and jewellery
worth Pounds 6,000 individually are CGT-exempt.
Pensions: If you can afford it, try to pay the maximum pensionable
contribution to your scheme in order to take advantage of higher rate
relief. Also top up additional voluntary contributions to the maximum limit
for the year (15 per cent of your salary).
If you have a personal pension plan, the maximum payable varies with your
age, from 17.5 per cent of your earnings until the age of 35, up to 40 per
cent if you are between 61-74.
Binder Hamlyn reminds those paying retirement annuity premiums in 1991-92
who intend to set these against income for 1990-91, to do so as soon as
possible.
Banks and building societies: Under new Inland Revenue rules, you no longer
have to wait until the end of the tax year to claim repayment of tax
deducted from interest on savings or share dividends. There are about 8m
people eligible for repayment of tax. Home loan interest: Husband and wife
can choose which should receive tax relief on home loan interest, regardless
of who pays the mortgage. Casson &amp; Beckman says the election has to be made
within 12 months after the tax year in question, so if you have not already
lodged an election for 1990 - 91, do so before April 5.
Company cars: You need to have driven 2,500 business miles by the end of the
tax year to avoid paying 50 per cent more tax on the perk. Parental gifts:
You can give a gift totalling Pounds 3,000 as a lump sum or split between
your children in any tax year free of inheritance tax. Unused gift
allowances from last year can be carried forward only if you have used up
this year's Pounds 3,000 first. Only one year's exemption can be carried
forward - after that it is lost. Charities: Use the Gift Aid scheme to give
Pounds 600 or more to charity by the end of the tax year. If you are a 40
per cent taxpayer, you can claim relief of Pounds 120 on Pounds 600. So, it
will only cost you Pounds 480 net to give Pounds 800 because the charity can
claim a further Pounds 200 of tax.
Choices for
the Chancellor
FEBRUARY is the month for pre-Budget speculation. The Chancellor retreats
into purdah, and everyone tries to guess what he will announce, writes
Philip Coggan.
This year, if conventional wisdom is correct, a March 10 Budget will be
followed by an April 9 general election. In theory, that ought to mean a
simple Budget since there will be hardly any time to pass complex
legislation before Parliament is dissolved.
In practice, however, the Budget is likely to be a glorified manifesto for
the Conservatives' economic policies. And with the economy mired in the
longest recession since the Second World War, and the Conservatives behind
in some opinion polls, the pressure on the Chancellor is to make the Budget
package as attractive as possible.
A Cabinet meeting this week is believed to have given the go-ahead to an
expansionary Budget, involving a significant increase in public borrowing.
Some analysts are now looking for a Pounds 4bn boost to the economy, instead
of the Pounds 2bn earlier expected.
Much of the pre-Budget speculation has centred around two options. The
belief is that either Norman Lamont will raise personal allowances by more
than the rate of inflation, or cut basic rate income tax by 1p in the pound.
Often, however, Chancellors spring a surprise on the public. This grabs the
headlines and has the effect of making the Budget seem better than expected.
The game is to guess what the surprise might be.
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy group, suggests that the Chancellor might
introduce a new, lower band of income tax at 20 per cent. This seems an
astute suggestion: it would be of direct benefit to low earners, making it
difficult for the Labour party to oppose; and it would also meet (albeit, at
a pinch) one of the Conservatives' long term commitments. It would make
great headlines in the tabloid press.
The main snag is that it would clash with another Conservative long term
aim, that of simplifying the tax system. We would have three bands  - 20, 25
and 40 per cent - instead of two.
Another reform which Price Waterhouse thinks is likely, and which has been
hinted at by Tory politicians, is an increase in the inheritance tax
threshold, from Pounds 140,000 to perhaps Pounds 500,000. While this hardly
fits in with John Major's vision of a 'classless society', it would appeal
to some middle class voters. The housing boom of the 1980s has carried many
into the inheritance tax bracket.
On the other hand, it would not be difficult for Labour to paint such a
reform as an example of the government handing out tax privileges to the
better-off.
Other suggestions from PW are that stamp duty on residential property
purchases of up to Pounds 250,000 might be permanently abolished, and that
personal tax allowances are transferable between husband and wife.
Among Ernst &amp; Young's tips for the Budget are the possibility that stamp
duty on share deals will be immediately abolished and that the holding
period for TESSAs will be reduced.
However, the current pre-election limbo makes it doubly pointless for the
investor to take action to anticipate these changes. Not only might these
guesses prove inaccurate, but even if they were all correct, defeat for the
Tories at the polls would mean Lamont's plans would never come to fruition.
Peps, BES, and market hype
THERE IS always a marketing blitz at the end of the tax year. This year the
hype is more frantic, since financial services companies can raise the
spectre of a tax-increasing Labour government, writes Scheherazade
Daneshkhu.
Personal equity plans (Peps), which offer freedom from income and capital
gains tax, are the product of the moment. The Labour party's statement that
it has no plans to abolish them has been shrugged-off by the industry with
the implicit comment: 'You can't trust what these socialists say.'
The best argument for tax planning is that Labour proposes to raise the top
income tax rate to 50 per cent, and to impose a 9 per cent surcharge on
investment income of more than Pounds 3,000 earned by non-pensioners.
It cannot be emphasised too often that the tax benefits of Peps are fragile.
They can be wiped out easily by charges, especially if you are a basic-rate
taxpayer (and less likely to pay more tax under Labour). They can be wiped
out even more easily by a fall in the stock market - and a loss in a Pep
cannot be offset against gain elsewhere. Buy a Pep in haste and you can
repent at leisure.
That is not to say that Peps are not useful tools for those who are
long-term (ie, at least five years) investors or have substantial
portfolios. Something might be said for starting a Pep and holding the funds
in cash, which you are allowed to do if you intend eventually to invest the
funds in shares. You can move into shares once the election result is known.
But whichever Pep you choose, you should make sure that you know the
charges, have decided whether you are investing for income or capital
growth, and feel confident that you will sleep at night if your plan falls
in value suddenly.
The Pep rules are over-complicated. You can place Pounds 3,000 in a unit or
investment trust Pep, with two exceptions. If the trust has less than 50 per
cent of its assets in the European Community, the limit is Pounds 1,500; if
it is an investment trust new issue, the limit is Pounds 6,000.
Managed and self-select Peps, on offer from stockbrokers, also have a Pounds
6,000 limit. In the former, the broker selects the shares; in the latter,
the investor does. In addition to any of these Peps, you can put a further
Pounds 3,000 in a single company plan (see Page VI). All these limits apply
to a tax year.
Another tax shelter is the Business Expansion Scheme, a form of venture
capital. This, too, has been marketed hard as Labour has made clear it plans
BES reforms.
The great advantage of a BES is that the total value of your investment is
deducted from your total taxable income. If you are a 40 per cent taxpayer,
you will receive a rebate of 40 per cent of the amount you invested. So, you
part with only Pounds 24,000 to invest Pounds 40,000.
The maximum you can invest in BES companies during any tax year is Pounds
40,000, and you have to maintain that investment for five years to gain the
tax benefits.
When the scheme started, it was seen as a means of promoting investments in
young 'entrepreneurial' industries, but the emphasis of the scheme was
shifted in 1988 to residential property.
The least risky form of BES is the 'buy back' scheme where a BES company
buys accommodation on behalf of a third party - usually a college or a
housing association - and receives a covenant to buy back the property at a
fixed price after five years.
Provided the third party does not go bankrupt and can raise the money, risk
is minimised. However, it is thought that the government could abolish this
in the Budget because it is considered too generous a tax break for the
benefit it delivers.
If you are happy with risks involved in this form of investment, and have
not used up your full Pounds 40,000, you need to do so before the end of the
tax year and preferably before the Budget. There are a spate of new schemes
available (see Page IV) and many close by March 10. To invest, you must
submit a BES3 form (sent to you by the company) to the Inland Revenue.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Oiling the skids for a bout of
pessimism - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN REAL terms, the oil price peaked exactly ten years ago. Since then, it
has halved. You might think, to judge from the movement of oil price shares
over the past week, that this basic fact of life has only just sunk in:
Shell ended the week at 448p, down 19p; BP at 258 1/2 p, down 9 1/2 p. Since
January 1, the oil and gas sector of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index has
underperformed the market by 13 per cent.
The Opec meeting last weekend - which ended without a commitment to
sustained production cuts - was the key factor in the sector's slide. As the
chart shows, this is only the latest phase in a period of sustained
underperformance: the Gulf War spike aside, oil prices in nominal terms have
remained roughly constant for the past two years or so, but the oil sector
has drifted steadily downwards against the market as a whole.
As always happens when a clutch of stocks get a bad name, every piece of
news seemed bearish: the after-effects of BP's dividend decision the
previous week; some speculation about poor progress in the company's
Colombian exploration; the departure of James Ross, BP's US boss, for Cable
and Wireless; Shell's 4 per cent dividend rise when the market had been
hoping for more.
The sense that the worldwide economic slowdown might be longer and more
pronounced than hitherto expected has also affected the shares. The week's
international economic news has been predominantly gloomy: Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the US Federal Reserve, told Congress that America's credit
crunch had not yet eased, for example; and Hans Tietmayer, deputy president
of the German Bundesbank, indicated no early easing in interest rates. Oil
demand is extremely sensitive to economic activity, and the oil companies'
huge fixed costs make their 'downstream' profits very vulnerable when
business is weak.
The other force at work has been the normal cycle of opinion among the
analysts who cover the sector. 'In August 1990,' said one battle-hardened
fund manager this week, 'almost all the analysts were very bullish on oil
stocks just when the oil price peaked out a month after the invasion of
Kuwait.' As the oil price has fallen, so the analysts have started to become
more cautious. 'Now the balance is 75 per cent pessimistic and only 25 per
cent bullish. I don't think there's much further to go.'
The oil industry was not the only example of fashionable pessimism. The tone
of much stock market comment is profoundly gloomy: no big downward move on
European interest rates, very slow or negative UK growth this year, huge
jobs cuts in the City inevitable, to choose just three examples from this
week. The consensus expectation, however, is still for a healthy move
upwards in share prices later in the year.
The argument goes like this: in the short run, the results due from big
companies in the next couple of weeks will contain enough unpleasant
surprises, especially on dividends, to unsettle the market. Ahead of an
election, no sustained buying will emerge. The economy will not show clear
signs of renewed growth till the second half of the year, if then.
Yet once economic recovery is confirmed, and political uncertainty is
removed (if only by the discovery, which the City makes with astonishment a
year into every Labour term of office, that things are not so bad after all)
there is the prospect of a further move upwards in share prices.
Contributory factors would be a consolidation of low inflation and the
inevitable downwards move in German interest rates.
Of course, there is nothing remarkable in such a prediction: the
conventional wisdom, on which Old Moore's Almanac has based a healthy
business for centuries, is usually that things will continue very much as
they are for the time being, and then get quite a lot better (or quite a lot
worse, according to taste) at some indeterminate point in the future.
Pessimism about the economy, about profits, and about dividends is now so
marked that it is worth considering the possibility of a sudden reversal of
sentiment. County NatWest's prediction that of the 33 companies reporting in
the next fortnight, 20 can be expected to hold or cut dividends, catches the
general air of pessimism perfectly.
Against such a background, unexpected benevolence in dividends or hopeful
reports on trading might transform the market's mood.
This week's indications of a giveaway, pre-election Budget offer a sober
long-term perspective, however. The UK's public finances are in the early
stages of a structural shift towards deficit, away from the rough balance
achieved in the 1980s. Such shifts are hard to arrest while in progress: the
odds are that government borrowing will be high for the next few years,
keeping long-term interest rates high in real terms, depressing share price
valuations in consequence and casting a lingering air of uncertainty over
whether the UK will qualify for membership of EC monetary union.
In the meantime, there is one practical short-term result of the market's
certainty that the election will come on April 9. There will be no bids or
rights issues before then, says one equity strategist, since the risks of
disruption by some campaign surprise are simply too great.
If this view is correct, it rules out the market's lingering thoughts that
the banking sector's results season might be accompanied by the announcement
of some large-scale merger or restructuring. The Midland Bank, usually
mentioned as a central participant in these elaborate hypotheses, is due to
announce its results on February 27. The results - and the accompanying
management comments - will give some indication of whether a banking
realignment is likely in the medium term.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: We need educating on equities -
Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREAT and the good backed the formation this week of ProShare, an
organisation devoted to the creation of a 'nation of shareholders'. But the
average saver could be forgiven for being confused.
The government's privatisation campaigns may have widened the shareholding
public, with the number of private investors growing from 3m to 11m during
the years of Tory rule. But 54 per cent of those investors own shares in
just one company. Only about 330,000 people own shares in 11 or more
companies - in other words only 3 per cent have built up a diversified
portfolio.
Here is the confusion. Many experts would argue that the most sensible way
for the private investor to hold equities is via a spread of holdings.
Take the Consumers' Association's excellent guide, Which Way to Save and
Invest? It says: 'Because of buying and selling costs, it doesn't make sense
to invest small amounts in shares - less than about Pounds 1,500, say. So to
get a good spread - of say five to ten shares  - you'd need about Pounds
7,500 to Pounds 15,000.'
Plenty of Weekend FT readers will fall into this category, which is why we
write so much about share investment. But large numbers will not. So does it
make sense to aim for a 'nation of shareholders'?
It is one thing to encourage employees to hold shares in the companies they
work for, as a means both of fostering esprit de corps and of encouraging
key staff to remain. The incentives for this are all in place; to date,
however, companies have tended to concentrate on executive schemes.
Even employee schemes, however, have dangers. An employee who holds large
numbers of shares in a company that goes bust loses both his job and his
savings.
How about shares in other people's companies? Privatisations, where the
government strains every nerve and sinew to ensure the issue is a success,
are a special case. Indeed, one could argue that the small saver is wily
enough to realise this, which is why he has stuck to privatised stocks.
One must also wonder whether many people are either just too cautious or
just too impatient to invest in equities. ProShare's presentation this week
included a graph showing how a portfolio of shares easily outperformed a
building society over the 1980s. Indeed, it is perfectly fair to point out
that, over the vast majority of ten-year periods, equities have pipped other
assets.
If ProShare were a unit trust, of course, it would be obliged to show a
five-year performance record. Readers may recall how we showed how an
investment in a building society easily pipped the FT-A All share and the
FT-SE 100 Indices over the five years to January 1992.
I suspect that most people view five years as quite a long term to hold an
investment. Certainly, the FT has received many letters from those
disillusioned with the performance of their PEPs after two or three years.
What can also disillusion people is that the neat figures for equity
performance shown by share enthusiasts are based on the indices. Few
investors match the indices' performance. Some do better; but a lot do
worse, because of the heavy costs (commissions, buy-sell spreads, tax) of
dealing, and the difficulties of stock selection.
Indded, there is another potential Catch 22 in this area. Part of the drive
to encourage wider share ownership has centred on the need to bring down
brokers' commissions, which seems a laudable enough aim. The snag is that
the easiest way to offer cheap commissions is to run a dealing-only service
with no advice. But surely advice is exactly what the small investor most
needs?
For all these reasons, we have tended to urge small investors who want to be
involved in equities to opt for unit and investment trusts. Not only do
these bring instant diversification, but they are very accessible for those
who want to invest, say, Pounds 25 a month. Most private client stockbrokers
will place a client with Pounds 20,000 or so into unit and investment
trusts, rather than opt for a full-blown equity portfolio.
Few could claim they are perfect. Over the past five years, the charges
levied by the unit trusts, in particular, have got higher while their
performance, relative to the indices, has been poor. It would be wonderful
if we could import the American family of 'no load' (in other words, no
initial charge) funds, which aim to meet the index.
But the enthusiasts for wider share ownership are rather sniffy about unit
and investment trusts. They are not the 'real thing', since they only give
the investor a diluted taste of capitalism.
It is perfectly fair for ProShare to seek to lobby on behalf of the small
investor and to educate more people about the risks and rewards of share
ownership. The spin-off Private Investor Association, which will be launched
in May, will be worth a look.
No doubt there are many Weekend FT readers who would reap long-term rewards
if they shifted just some of their portfolios out of the building society
and into equities.
But I have the sneaking suspicion that if savers were properly educated
about the nature of equities, some existing shareholders might be alarmed by
the risks they have assumed. The net effect of ProShare's activities might
paradoxically be to reduce the total number of shareholders.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Markets: Dow surges to a record - but why? - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WAS a difficult week for stock market analysts and reporters. It
included a lot of external 'noise'; an important OPEC decision; a change in
bank reserve requirements by the Federal Reserve; the New Hampshire
presidential primaries; and the latest update on the economy from the
chairman of the Fed.
Normally, this would be a good thing. The more happening, the easier it is
for analysts and reporters to explain away events in the stock market. This
week, however, investors behaved in a most contrarian fashion.
On Tuesday, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a
smaller than expected cut in production, which led to an immediate decline
in oil prices, and the Fed eased credit conditions by reducing the amount
banks have to hold in reserve. Yet, share prices fell sharply, to their
lowest since January.
On Wednesday, news of President Bush's dreadful performance in New Hampshire
did not, as had been expected, provoke a big sell-off in the market.
Conversely, buying interest on Wall Street was not sparked to any extent by
either an upbeat economic forecast from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, and
more good inflation figures.
Then, on Thursday, the one day when nothing remotely interesting happened,
the Dow Jones average jumped 50 points to a record, powered by a surge in
demand for a whole range of stocks from investors showing sudden enthusiasm.
So difficult was it to pinpoint a reason for this surge that analysts and
reporters reverted to emergency measures. 'Why did the market rise so
sharply?' people asked. 'Simple, really,' came the experts' chorus. 'More
buyers than sellers.' It is never that simple, of course, but it was as
close as anyone could get to an honest answer.
The market's recent performance suggests investors remain positive, if not
exactly ecstatic, about the outlook for the economy and for equities.
The initial rush into stocks from lower-yielding money market funds, bank
certificates of deposit and Treasury securities has slowed. The chance of
further interest rate cuts also has diminished, mainly because recent
economic figures - in the form of improved car, home and retail sales, and
strong money supply growth - suggest the country could be entering the first
stage of an economic rebound.
Another reason for rate cuts receding is because the Fed appears convinced
that monetary policy is now sufficiently accommodating to allow room for a
recovery.
Although Tuesday's reduction in bank reserve requirements has been
interpreted by some observers as a final tweak on the monetary strings, the
action probably had more to do with the Fed's concern about the state of
banks' balance sheets.
What is more, there is no guarantee that the banks will pass-on the lower
cost of credit to customers. Nor is there any guarantee that customers will
want to borrow any more from banks. The interest-rate play, therefore, looks
as though it has been taken out of the equities game. This means that the
outlook for corporate earnings must brighten if investors' faith in the
market is to be rewarded.
The evidence so far is mostly positive. Although the earnings of major
companies in the final quarter of 1991 were down 34 per cent on a year
earlier, they were marginally better than expected. As for future earnings,
Zacks Investment Research, which compiles analysts' estimates, says they are
forecasting that first-quarter 1992 earnings will be 6.5 per cent higher
than a year ago.
Over the longer term, if you subscribe to the theory that the recovery is
now under way, earnings should improve in every quarter as the year
progresses. This happy scenario could, however, be disrupted if one
dangerously unpredictable external force comes into play: politics.
The market got its first real taste of election-year politics in New
Hampshire, and did not like what it saw. The fact that a far-right
television commentator and former Reagan speech-writer ran the president so
close (Pat Buchanan won more than 40 per cent of the Republican vote on
Tuesday) shocked the markets. George Bush, seemingly impregnable a few
months ago, now looks beatable.
This frightens financial markets for two reasons. Buchanan's appeal to the
conservative wing of the Republican party could force Bush into an
aggressive tax-cutting package that, if passed by Congress, would bust the
Budget agreement and push interest rates higher. Second, if the Democrats
choose an electable candidate, and support for Bush continues to
deteriorate, then the markets' biggest nightmare - a high-spending Democrat
Congress and White House - could become reality.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Sweet Scottish dream that turned sour
 -The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BITTER-SWEET tale unfolded this week which highlighted the problems of
British companies - and the investors who back them  - in the recession,
writes Guy de Jonquieres and Philip Coggan.
The food industry is renowned as a defensive investment, and sugar
confectionery as one of its safest havens. Last year the UK sweets market
grew 2 per cent in volume - faster than during the economic boom of the
mid-1980s - as cash-strapped consumers indulged in inexpensive treats.
However, shareholders in Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust must be
questioning this conventional wisdom following the failure on Wednesday of
Alma Holdings, an unquoted Scottish confectionery company with a stable of
venerable brands, including Barker &amp; Dobson, Keiller, Bensons and Hacks.
A Kirkcaldy-based family concern formed in 1975, Alma led a quiet existence
until 1984, when its fortunes were transformed by the return of Mario
Maciocia, son of the company's founder, from several years in England in the
import-export trade.
A flamboyant third-generation Scot, the young Maciocia was convinced that
Alma's future lay in rapid international expansion. He shook up the
company's management, launched new products and set up sales divisions in
the US and continental Europe. In five years, Alma's sales rose from Pounds
1.2m to more than Pounds 70m.
Maciocia's early success owed much to his undoubted, if eccentric, marketing
flair. Seeking to invigorate Alma's basic line of children's sweets, he hit
on the idea of Skullcrushers, a ghoulish fondant confection which oozed red
jelly when bitten. The product proved a worldwide best-seller. It was
rapidly followed by a range of successful sweets based on film and
television characters, including Batman and Ghostbusters.
In 1988, Maciocia bought out the other family shareholders and
simultaneously acquired Barker &amp; Dobson's sweets interests for Pounds 9.75m.
The deal, which involved Pounds 24m in new borrowings, took Alma into the
mainstream confectionery business. It also presaged Maciocia's nemesis.
B&amp;D - bought from the Budgens supermarket group  - turned out to have
unexpectedly large losses. While still struggling to turn the business
round, Alma suffered a series of arson attacks at a factory in Stockport.
These inflicted heavy production losses, against which the company turned
out to be under-insured. Meanwhile, plans to transfer production from a B&amp;D
plant in Bury to a site in Dundee were beset by delays.
The results were a precipitous drop in sales, which last year amounted to
barely Pounds 40m, and deepening losses, compounded by high interest rates.
Under pressure from institutional investors, Maciocia resigned as chairman
early last year, since when the entire top management of Alma has been
replaced.
However, it was too late. After the company suffered unexpectedly weak
demand in the final quarter of last year, the shareholders decided to sell
it. But hopes of concluding a deal were dashed by the withdrawal of an
unnamed prospective bidder, making receivership inevitable.
Bad luck obviously contributed to Alma's downfall. But there are also doubts
about the soundness of its underlying business plan. Maciocia admitted later
that the B&amp;D purchase was conceived while he was 'intoxicated by deal heat.'
Furthermore, apart from its disappointing financial performance, the
acquisition presented a bigger management challenge than seems to have been
appreciated at the time.
Not only do B&amp;D's adult confectionery lines call for different marketing
skills than the children's sweets in which Alma specialised; B&amp;D's business
also requires a mastery of large-scale production techniques which lay
outside Alma's previous experience.
The collapse of Alma is just the latest price of bad news for Drayton
Consolidated. The trust, managed by Invesco MIM, saw its share price plunge
last year as investors developed doubts about the value of its unquoted
portfolio.
The trust took a Pounds 37m provision against its unquoted holdings last
year, and wrote down part of the value of its Alma holding. Nevertheless,
the final exposure was still Pounds 19.7m, the trust's second biggest
investment, and the effect of Alma's failure was to knock 57.8 p per share
off the net asset value per share. The news caused Drayton's share price to
fall 43p to 147p on Wednesday, a long way down from the peak of 587p in
1989.
A number of trusts specialising in this area have had problems as the
recession has hit smaller businesses. Unease about the sector has meant that
even trusts with good records stand on a substantial discount to their asset
values. Investors in such companies currently have a sour taste in their
mouths.

FT  22 FEB 92 / The Long View: All over the place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I'VE HAD a bellyfull of German bankers,' grumbled my old friend Steve the
strategist, hotfoot from Frankfurt this week on a leg of one of his regular
world tours. 'I never want to hear the phrase 'monetary discipline' again.
They say they hate inflation, but they just love the power it gives them.'
London, I murmured, could be the right place to escape from such people.
With the General Election coming up he was unlikely to hear anything about
discipline.
Instead there would be soaring deficits, tax cuts and a political
competition to promise ever-higher spending. True, he could find much the
same sort of thing in the US too, with a few extra bimbos to add some
glamour.
Steve admitted that he had almost forgotten about the British election. Most
people outside the UK thought the election was 15 months ago, and Margaret
Thatcher inexplicably lost.
The election might seem a big deal to the natives, but if both the leading
British political parties were committed to remaining part of the DM
currency bloc the international markets would probably stay relaxed about
it, although no doubt the forex traders would want to test out any new
regime thoroughly.
Steve has bigger fish to fry. In fact, he told me, these are the kind of
circumstances in which strategists ought to be able to earn several times
over their first-class air fares and sojourns at 'conferences' at the
Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok.
There were all the signs of a major bust-up in the leading markets, with
indices going in all different directions. 'When Hong Kong is the global
stock market leader you have to watch out,' said Steve. 'It's not so bad as
when Australia is heading the league table, but not far off.'
The big stock markets had a nice little surge over Christmas but only Wall
Street had managed to hit new high ground in February.
For the rest, Toyko was threatening to break decisively down through the
21,000 level on the Nikkei - a fall of 45 per cent over the past two years,
while Wall Street was up 20 per cent over the same period. As for Europe, it
was going nowhere very much at all, kept under lock and key by the
Bundesbank's high interest rates.
Steve said: 'We have a rip-roaring bull market in the US with historic p/e's
on the industrial blue chips hitting 25 and all the small punters piling
into the over-the-counter garbage stocks touting Aids cures.
'Net sales of equity mutual funds had trebled year-on-year by the fourth
quarter as the suburban punters piled in, fleeing from microscopic deposit
rates on savings accounts. It frightens the foreign investors out of their
wits, but they dare not stay out of the game.
'Over in Tokyo we have the mirror image. Tokyo housewives have said goodbye
to investment trusts, which are the Japanese mutual funds, and so long as
the financial scandals keep breaking in the newspapers one after another
they are going to stay right out. The corporate tokkin funds are also
heading fast for the exit.
He added: 'All right, we hear that the Big Four securities houses and the
Ministry of Finance are going to fix the market, but that sounds more like
the old problem than a new solution.
'This leaves the foreigners as the only buyers in town, and suddenly they
can actually see real value in the industrial sectors, but they are feeling
awfully lonely out there, and worrying what will happen when the Japanese
banks have a rare meeting with reality.'
At least, I commented, the yen and the dollar were not locked together.
There was a certain amount of give in the system. In Europe, on the other
hand, we had divergencies that were being suppressed by exchange rate
rigidities.
Suddenly there was a lot of talk about a German recession, but as a
recession it seemed to be about as technical as our own 'technical recovery'
in the UK in the third quarter of last year.
In Frankfurt, said Steve, the German bankers were uncompromising. If the
rest of Europe didn't like it they could always devalue. The ERM was not EMU
 -not yet, anyway. German short-term rates seemed unlikely to drop
significantly before the end of the year.
Of course, realigning within the ERM would not solve the interest rate
problem. But the pressures within France, Italy and the UK seemed to be
boiling up to some sort of climax.
'I'm formulating my survival strategy, only as a contingency plan, of
course,' confided Steve. 'Suppose Tokyo takes another dive as the financials
melt down. That would bust the fragile boom on Wall Street, kind of 1987
only heading east to west.
'Those punters in condos in Florida would head back into bond funds, or take
3 per cent in the First Tampa Bay S &amp; L, gritting their teeth and even
talking about voting Democrat. Meanwhile the Europeans would be realigning
in panic.
'So my reading is, short the dollar, go long of DM cash, and then get ready
to move when the dust has settled into UK and French bonds, where the yields
will be high, and Japanese industrial equities, where it will even soon be
worthwhile cashing the dividend cheques.
'The first thing, though, is to get the hell out of Hong Kong.'
I raised an eyebrow. This did not seem to be what his latest client
circulars had been saying. If my memory was not failing me the advice was to
stay with Japanese blue chips and US second line growth stocks.
'Sure,' said Steve. 'The 60 per cent probability is still that US economic
growth will jerk up by the second quarter, and the Japanese will be able to
shuffle their way out of trouble as usual.
'Besides, our corporate finance department has a couple of big international
M and A deals in the pipeline which could abort if the markets get nervous.
I had never heard Steve talk quite like this before. He has absolutely no
sense of humour, so he could not have been pulling my leg. Perhaps the
jetlag had finally caught him up. Or maybe he had been talking to too many
bankers in Frankfurt, and he'll soon get over it.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Out of the red and into the Black: How an ailing British
institution has been turned into a gold mine by the Canadian tycoon who
rescued it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG remarkable success stories, the one about the British institution sold
six years ago for Pounds 30m, and which next week will announce a pre-tax
profit for last year of Pounds 40.5m - some 35 per cent more than the
purchase price, in spite of the worst recession since the Second World War -
takes some beating. But the profit is only part of it; for the story also is
one of an investment that has, incredibly, multiplied 1,500 per cent.
The institution is the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which had been controlled
by the aristocratic Berry family since 1928 but was on the verge of
bankruptcy in December 1985. In the six months to September that year, the
paper had lost Pounds 16m. In February 1986, control was bought by a
Canadian tycoon named Conrad Black, who was almost unknown outside his
native country but is now, aged 47, in the process of assembling a newspaper
empire that recently swallowed Australia's influential Fairfax group.
For more than 30 years until its sale, the Telegraph had been run by two men
 -Lord Hartwell, now 80, who became chairman and editor-in-chief in 1954;
and his brother, Viscount Camrose, now 82, who had been deputy chairman
since 1939. They remain on the board as non-executive directors representing
what used to be the all-powerful Berry family trust. But both must have very
mixed feelings as they contemplate the turnround in their old company's
fortunes. Indeed, they must wonder if they made a very serious mistake in
selling for what, in hindsight, seems almost a giveaway sum - especially
since their former fiefdom is now valued at a minimum of Pounds 500m and,
possibly, as much as Pounds 1bn.
Hartwell and Camrose used to work in splendid isolation on the fifth floor
of their old headquarters at 135 Fleet Street, in the one-time heart of the
UK newspaper industry. Hartwell had a suite to one side of the wood-panelled
boardroom, Camrose had one on the other. In the space between, executives
would tell them what they wanted to hear as the Telegraph slid towards the
abyss - ironically, because a belated attempt at modernisation was bungled.
Vast spending on new printing plant in the Docklands of east London had been
committed - without adequate financing or an effective plan to reduce the
exorbitant wage costs of the print workers - at a time when both advertising
and circulation were dropping. It proved a fatal combination.
Effectively, the Berry family lost control of the Telegraph in the Kennedy
Hilton hotel at New York's JFK airport on May 28 1985, when Hartwell
persuaded Black to invest Pounds 10m in the hard-pressed newspaper group in
exchange for a 14 per cent shareholding. The ambitious Canadian had been
alerted to the investment opportunity by a British friend, Andrew Knight,
then editor of The Economist news-magazine and later Black's chief executive
at the Telegraph. But, in one far-sighted move at the meeting, Black laid
the foundation of his media empire by demanding pre-emptive rights on any
further issue of shares.
'I don't think we can resist that,' said Hartwell, convinced that no further
money would be needed. 'In that moment, without realising it, he gave his
birthright away,' comments Duff Hart-Davis in his book, The House the Berrys
Built.
Black is fond of describing the deal as 'not the sort you expect to get two
of in a lifetime.' But how could the Toronto-based owner of a string of
small-town North American newspapers, with little knowledge of Fleet Street
and its then all-powerful printing unions, save the near-moribund Telegraph,
restricted as it was by tradition, debt, and corrupt labour practices?
Although the Telegraph, founded in June 1855 during the Crimean War, never
occupied such a central role at the heart of the establishment as The Times,
it was for generations the authentic voice of upper middle class England.
For a long time, it outsold the rest of the daily 'quality' press put
together. Even now, it sells more than 2.5 times as many copies as The
Guardian, which leads the rest of the pack. But, despite these strengths,
when Black took over it was on its knees commercially.
Black foresaw in May 1985 that Hartwell would be unable to meet his budget
plans. By December, it was clear that a new injection of cash would soon be
needed; this, under the rights agreement, would enable Black to gain a
majority shareholding. But an awkward period ensued while Black, who had a
seat on the Telegraph board, put together a team ready to take over. He told
Knight, who was still editor of The Economist, to lay his plans for becoming
chief executive.
Knight arranged a dinner with Frank Rogers, one of the wisest heads in Fleet
Street. Rogers was a former Fleet Street sports reporter who had also
managed papers in Africa, been managing director of the huge IPC Magazines
group, and chairman of another publishing group, EMAP. Black, a somewhat
forbidding figure, hit it off with the benignly mischievous Rogers, who was
then approaching normal retiring age.
Black then persuaded Hartwell to give Rogers a seat on the board and
promised that Rogers would become deputy chairman - a position he still
holds. He also brought in Joe Cooke, a soft-spoken Irish management
consultant with a background in engineering, as an adviser. Cooke knew
little about national newspapers - but plenty about manning and cost-cutting
in large-scale industry. Once, when he reorganised one of Britain's biggest
double-glazing operations, working hours were increased and labour costs cut
to one-third. He was to become the new Telegraph's managing director.
Only three months after this 'management in waiting' had been assembled,
Knight, Rogers and Cooke were implementing a similar plan to reduce
overmanning and excess wages in the printing operation. But, as 'highly
confidential' documents of the time show, the battle was not just with the
unions. The first salvoes of opposition were fired by the paper's old-guard
management which wanted to tip-toe to reform in the traditional way. Its own
plan for cutting manpower at the new Docklands plant had been extremely
modest.
On Friday December 20, Hartwell summoned Knight to his office and told him
to stop giving orders to his executives. But the management-in-waiting
already knew what it wanted. Early in January, Cooke drafted a revolutionary
plan for survival that involved challenging the print unions head-on. This
came at much the same time as Australian-born media tycoon Rupert Murdoch
also was planning a similar confrontation. His Fleet Street operations, like
those at the Telegraph and everywhere else in national newspapers, were
still subject to a labyrinth of demarcation agreements, ghost shifts, double
manning and other restrictive practices.
The old Telegraph management did not have stomach for the fight, though. At
a meeting on Sunday, December 22, a majority of the board decided that 10
per cent savings was all that could be obtained in Manchester, and that
setting maximum wage costs - as the Black team wanted - was not appropriate
for a newspaper printing plant. Cooke recalls: 'They said that when I had
been in newspapers long enough, I would find out that all the money was made
from advertising. You didn't make money from printing plants and I was very
foolish to think you did.'
The new guard went underground to plan for the day it would take power
although it did manage, in December, to insist that negotiations with the
unions should be suspended. By then, Cooke had picked-up rumours of
Murdoch's intention to switch all his titles - including The Times, The
Sunday Times, The Sun and the News of the World - to a new, ultra-modern
plant in Docklands. The plan was to wait until Murdoch had moved; this
actually happened later in January 1985.
Unlike Murdoch, who shifted his entire operation more or less overnight and
ignored the unions, the Telegraph's aim was to present each of them with a
fait accompli, delivered at carefully-timed meetings, with no group of
employees having access to the big picture. 'What we were concerned to avoid
was an instant trigger response with somebody going on strike. Once they're
out, its a hell of a job to get them back. If you got over the first day,
you'd effectively won,' says Cooke. In the end, the day for action was set
as March 26 1986, and the plan was named Operation Blackbird.
Union chapels (local branches) were told, at half-hourly intervals, that the
Fleet Street headquarters was being closed and operations were being
transferred to a new one in Docklands. Anyone who wanted to work there would
have to accept new terms: five days a week working instead of four, and
Pounds 80 a shift rather than Pounds 125. Redundancy payments of up to
Pounds 45,000 were offered. The printers did not go on strike; indeed, union
representatives, having by now heard of the master plan, started to enter
meetings singing Bye Bye Blackbird.
For Black, the outcome was remarkable. At 135 Fleet Street, there had been
1,637 printing jobs costing Pounds 40m a year. The old guard's presentation
to banks in the autumn of 1985 had envisaged 1,292 jobs costing Pounds 39m
in Docklands. The deal agreed finally was for 679 jobs costing Pounds 16m.
The managers then turned to the more subtle and problematical task of
modernising the appearance and content of the Telegraph, and the even more
demanding challenge of trying to halt an apparently inevitable slide in
circulation. Max Hastings, then a columnist on the London Evening Standard,
was brought in as editor to shake out the cobwebs.
The most serious problem was an ageing readership. 'The undertakers have
dispatched 300,000 subscribers since I took over,' says Black, mournfully.
If none of those readers had been replaced, the paper would long since have
slipped below the symbolic 1m circulation mark. Instead, the pace of
circulation loss has declined, despite price increases from 23p in 1985 to
the present 45p, and the recession.
In 1980, the average circulation was 1.44m. Five years later, it was 1.21m.
Last year, it dropped to 1.067m. The recent decline has, however, been much
less than that of its two main broadsheet rivals, The Times and The
Independent.
The change in the paper's appearance has been even more dramatic. Cover up
the date and the tight, grey, poorly-illustrated columns of only six years
ago could have passed for any issue in the previous 40 years. The new
Telegraph has clean layout, a sharper approach and a growing confidence with
pictures - what Hastings calls 'progressive change by stealth.'
Less obviously, the political tone and image of the paper has been
manipulated gently. The Telegraph always can be relied-on to argue
vigorously for the return of another Conservative government. Yet, the paper
now is less rampantly right-wing and the days are past when no one under 40
would want to be seen with a copy.
In turn, critics say that its long-standing 'Torygraph' nickname has merely
given way to a new one: the 'Hellograph,' a reference to the successful but
bland and uncritical celebrity magazine called Hello. On balance, Black
prefers the new caricature to that of the old Colonel Blimp.
Perhaps the most telling symbol of the new Daily Telegraph is the recently
poaching of Alex, a popular Yuppie cartoon character, from The Independent -
the daily founded by former Telegraph staff several years ago and which was
supposed to sink their former employer. Black says that poaching Alex is a
warning that the Telegraph is flexing its muscles again.

FT  22 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris rally survives
profit-taking after bullish week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FASHION for cyclicals and the trend on Wall Street continued to support
most senior bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS closed a bullish week with some light profit-taking in some of the
cyclical stocks which have led the rally, but strategists said the market
was still heading higher.
The CAC 40 index rose 11.15 to 1,962.37, its best close since July 27, 1990,
and up 5.2 per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at FFr4.3bn, very
high for a Friday, but dealers said that it also reflected position-squaring
at the end of the February trading account yesterday.
Among the larger stocks, Saint-Gobain fell FFr5 to FFr533 on profit-taking,
while Euro Disney soared FFr4.10 or 2.8 per cent to FFr153 with a heavy 2.1m
shares traded on news that it would replace Perrier in the CAC 40 index from
March 19. Perrier and Exor were both suspended yesterday amid speculation
that BSN might launch a counter bid for Exor.
One of the day's losers was Total which fell FFr7 to FFr253 on reports of
heavy US selling.
FRANKFURT hit an 18-month closing high ahead of the expiry of DTB options
contracts. The DAX index closed 14.45 higher at 1,717.63 its highest since
August 16, 1990, and up 2.5 per cent on the week.
Volume rose from DM7.4bn to DM8.6bn but some traders put this down to
options-associated business. The more broadly-based FAZ index, less subject
to DTB influences, closed just 1.5 per cent higher on the week after a 2.61
rise to 696.66 yesterday, and some of the big blue chips were easing back in
London afternoon trading.
BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen rose DM4.50 to DM556, DM6 to DM752 and DM4.50 to
DM451.30 on the session, but they were all quoted around DM2 lower in London
after hours. In the morning, German January car production was reported down
7 per cent compared with a year earlier.
The argument remained for export profits, and the strength of the dollar.
This also applied to engineers and steel/engineering combines, where MAN put
on DM5.50 to DM370.50, Mannesmann DM5.60 to DM284.50.
AMSTERDAM closed mostly firmer but off its highs in lively trading dominated
by yesterday's expiry of February options and futures series. The CBS
Tendency index closed up 0.7 at 126.1, up 3.5 per cent on the week, in
extremely heavy turnover of Fl 1.07bn.
ZURICH featured cyclicals again as the SPI index rose 3.1 to 1,133.7, 1.4
per cent up on the week. Brown Boveri and Holderbank bearers rose SFr50 to
SFr3,610, and SFr100 to SFr4,820 respectively.
MADRID faltered on the Telefonica pension fund furore. The
telecommunications stock, which makes up nearly 10 per cent of the general
index, fell Pta85 to PTa1,095 and the index itself by 2.09 to 258.95, hardly
changed on the week.
BRUSSELS ended higher in moderate trading. The Bel-20 index rose 8.55 to
1,182.54, up 2.1 per cent on the week. SGB rose BFr35 or 1.6 per cent to
BFr2,215 on higher-than-average volume of 20,100 shares.
STOCKHOLM combined the fashion for cyclicals with a 4 per cent drop in
insurers, and the Affarsvarlden General index emerged only 2.2 higher at
931.6 for a fall of 0.8 per cent on the week.
Dealers said the insurers' decline was tied to sharply higher loan losses at
the Gota banking group, in which the insurer, Trygg Hansa, holds a 40 per
cent stake. Trygg Hansa B fell SKr3 to SKr88.
COPENHAGEN rose on strength in banks and insurers, writes Hilary Barnes.
Danske Bank closed DKr5 higher at DKr335, up DKr18 since Monday, after
reversing recent Nordic banking trends with a DKr1.33bn net profit for 1991
against a DKr1.17bn loss in 1990.
The Unidanmark banking group, after a loss earlier in the week, recovered to
close DKr8 higher at DKr218. Turnover was a moderate DKr231m, and the CSE
index rose 1.44 to 352.53, almost unchanged on the week, with the bank index
up by 3.38 to 227.39 and insurance by 6.48 to 723.43.
OSLO closed mostly lower, with Norsk Hydro losing NKr3.5 to NKr136.5 after
reporting a record net loss for 1991 on Thursday. The all-share index fell
1.83 to 414.39 in low turnover of NKr145.6m.
ISTANBUL dropped in quiet trading to its second consecutive 1992 low. The
75-share index closed at 3,985.51, down 8.05, for a loss of 9.9 per cent on
the week.
VIENNA's ATX index rose 14.11 to 1,093.69, barely missing a new all-year
high, for a rise of 2.5 per cent on the week.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Appointments: 'Making things happen' at Harry's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harry Ramsden, the Yorkshire-based fish and chip shop that claims to be the
world's largest, has lured 31-year-old Russell Scott from Whitbread into the
newly-created board post of operations director.
Scott, who has one A-level in computer studies, has risen speedily through
the retail trade since depressed economic conditions in the late 1970s put
him off his initial career choice of engineering.
His training began at McDonald's, where he was soon running the Marble Arch
outlet. This stood him in good stead with John Barnes, Harry Ramsden's
chairman, who reckons that the American hamburger company's grooming teaches
young managers as much as the average class-ically-trained manager in a
British company knows only by the time he is in his 50s.
Other jobs included establishing Beefeater in Germany; acting as new concept
director of Pizza Hut; and latterly, integrating Berni Inns into the
Whitbread group.
Barnes, a Londoner, who mostly steers away from opening new shops in the
south east, with the exception of Heathrow airport, because 'customers are
too fickle', explains that the recent growth of Harry's outlets
domestically, coupled with ambitious international plans, dictate the need
for an operations director.
Contrasting the layers of bureaucracy in most large brewers with the style
at Harry's - where the chairman seems happy to send his own faxes - Barnes
says he can offer an individual the scope 'really to make things happen'.
Scott joins a well-travelled group whose ambitions have not been dented by
difficult trading conditions at home; the USM-listed company intends to go
to Hong Kong with a joint venture franchise this summer where it will be
relying heavily on the experience of its Yorkshire finance director - who
just happens to speak fluent Mandarin.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble to new
lows - Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COFFEE markets in both London and New York have been tumbling this week
in the face of overwhelming supplies and no prospect of a renewed
international coffee agreement.
Robusta prices on the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) began the
decline on Monday when the New York arabica market was closed for the
Presidents' Day holiday. The retreat rapidly accelerated on Tuesday
afternoon in London, when New York re-opened only to fall to the lowest
levels for 17 years.
On Tuesday the London May contract closed at Dollars 851 a tonne, down
Dollars 23, while New York's March contract lost more than 2 cents to close
at 66.7 cents a lb.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London broker, pointed out that
most market watchers were revising their crop forecasts upwards for this
year. 'The only thing that can push prices up now is a crop disaster or an
International Coffee Organisation accord.'
The Colombians, who were reported recently as saying their crop would be
16.7m bags (60 kilos each), on Thursday restated that they expected a crop
of 16.2m bags, giving the market something of a lift. They have also
re-emphasised at a US coffee convention in Florida that they are keen to
make progress towards a renewed coffee pact. According to Reuters, the
Colombian president will put pressure on President Bush for more support on
the coffee pact when the two meet later this month in Texas for a summit
meeting on drugs.
Earlier this month an ICO working party failed to come up with any fresh
ideas on a future pact. The coffee market has been in free fall since the
ICO export quota system collapsed in July 1989.
The Brazilians - seen as the main stumbling block to progress  - have yet to
make up their minds whether they want an agreement with economic clauses.
Brazil, the world's biggest producer, is heading for a coffee harvest this
year of nearly 28m to 30m bags.
As New York prices were tumbling on Tuesday towards 'a bottomless pit,' one
New York trader commented: 'Eventually it will reach such a level that
producers will be forced into action.' The London May contract closed
yesterday at a new low of Dollars 838, down Dollars 25 on the day and
Dollars 50 on the week.
On the London Metal Exchange confusion over the situation in the CIS
continued to dominate trading. On Monday some analysts suggested that
traders were using this as cover to squeeze the aluminium and nickel
markets. The three-month nickel price was Dollars 165 up at the close at
Dollars 8,195 a tonne after touching a six-month high of Dollars 8,245 a
tonne, while three-month aluminium traded up to a seven-month high of
Dollars 1,340 a tonne.
Analysts agree that Russian metal exports to the west will fall this year
but remain high enough to continue causing headaches for western producers.
They disagree, however, on the severity of the fall.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, believes Russian exports might fall
by a third this year, mainly because of problems caused by new taxes and an
eight-week backlog for licences, which has more or less brought exports to a
halt. However, Mr Neil Buxton, of Metal Bulletin Research, believes that
while exports will not match last year's levels, they will remain 'very high
by historic standards. There will be a lot of metal for the relatively
sluggish western European economies to absorb.'
Adding further to the confusion were remarks made in London by Mr Anatoly
Filatov, chairman of Norilsk, Russia's main nickel producer. He insisted
that delays in nickel shipments have not been caused by bureaucratic delays
and export tariffs, but because prices were too low.
Mr Robin Bhar, of Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken, pointed out that LME nickel stocks
rose by 540 tonnes on Tuesday and by a further 450 tonnes yesterday to total
19,734 tonnes, giving the lie to concern over CIS exports. The market was
also talking of a further 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes of unregistered Russian
nickel already in Europe.
He suggested that investment funds know that the market has been
characterised by thin dealing. 'It's very easy to get the market moving,'
said Mr Bhar yesterday, 'but in order to sustain it you need the consumers.'
Yesterday cash nickel closed at Dollars 7,970 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 60
on the week, while three-month was Dollars 8,030. Cash aluminium closed at
Dollars 1,295 a tonne, up Dollars 7.50, while three-month was Dollars
1,319.50.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directionless trading in stock index futures, with few significant features,
saw the March contract drift away after a promising start, writes
Christopher Price.
Following a 50-point overnight gain on Wall Street, March opened brightly,
reaching 2,570 within minutes. This proved to be its high point however,
with a poor poll for the Conservative party setting the negative tone for
the rest of the session. The futures index fell back and by the mid-morning
was trading at a discount to fair value.
A poor Wall Street provided little inspiration, the appearance of a number
of sellers in the late afternoon completed a dispiriting day. London's lack
of direction prompted some traders to move into the livelier Paris and
Frankfurt futures markets.
March closed at 2,555, 9 down on the previous session and some 3 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Volume was a
poor 4,437.
The LTOM also saw low volume of 16,337 contracts in what one trader
described as 'dull and lifeless' trading. There were no trades above 500
lots, Glaxo being the leading stock with 817, followed by Dixons (754) and
Amstrad (720).

FT  22 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates inch ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES edged up across the board, as the UK money markets digested the
effects of a weaker sterling and an opinion poll favouring the Labour Party
in a forthcoming election.
Players interpreted these two factors as implying that the window of
opportunity for an imminent base rate cut in the UK had narrowed.
The key three-month interbank rate, which closely shadows base rates, closed
 1/16 of a point higher than at the opening at 10 5/16 - 3/16 per cent.
On the futures exchange, the March short sterling contract tumbled 10 points
to its lowest close of the week at 89.80. However, this still implies that
the market is expecting a rate cut before the contract falls due on March
18.
The favourite date for a cut in UK rates appears to be within two days after
the budget on March 10. 'People have given up on the chance of an immediate
cut in rates,' said a senior dealer. This would mean more paper being
offered in the next few weeks, he added.
The overnight rate stayed within a narrow range, neither expensive nor
surprisingly cheap. The rate, which hit 10 per cent at its highest, closed
at 10 3/4 - per cent.
The forecast shortage was larger than in recent days at Pounds 1.05bn, with
most of the shortfall arising from bills falling due for repurchase by the
market. Treasury bills and maturing assistance also put a squeeze on
liquidity, although this was more than offset by injections from exchequer
transactions.
The Bank of England made its presence known early in the morning with a
Pounds 347m purchase of band two treasury and bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent,
and paper for resale to the market on March 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent.
Further operations saw the Bank offering another repurchase agreement,
falling due on the same dates, totalling Pounds 50m at 10 7/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank offered to buy band one and two bank bills
totalling Pounds 442m at 10 3/8 per cent, and provided late assistance of
Pounds 160m. This left the market Pounds 51m short.
In Germany, sufficient reserve levels helped call rates ease from 9.50/60
per cent to 9.45/55 per cent. Traders said they did not expect call money to
ease much further.
In the US, the Federal Reserve stayed out of the market as funds were
trading below the perceived 4 per cent target at 3 15/16 per cent.

<TEXT>
SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, yesterday reported
a slide in 1991 net profit to NKr777m (Dollars 120m) before extraordinary
items. Despite record sales of North Sea oil, the group was hit by lower
crude prices and a write-down of its shares in Elkem, the metals group.
The previous year Saga recorded profits of NKr1.11bn.
The decline was due to lower average crude oil prices - which fell by NKr10
a barrel to NKr133 - and a NKr335m charge for an unrealised loss on the
value of its 12.4 per cent stake in Elkem, the troubled Norwegian light
metals producer. Saga had previously valued its Elkem stake at NKr469m. It
has written down Elkem's share price to NKr75.
'The financial result was negative by NKr588m after being weighed down by an
unrealised loss on the value of the shareholding in Elkem,' Saga explained.
In the previous year financial costs were just NKr154m.
Elkem closed NKr0.50 down at NKr60 on the Oslo bourse on Friday, while Saga
finished NKr0.50 higher at NKr74.
Saga's operating profit last year improved by NKr103m to NKr1.37bn.
Group revenue rose by NKr722m in 1991 to NKr4.59bn, while operating costs
increased by NKr619m to NKr3.22bn.
Sales of petroleum products rose by NKr495m to NKr3.41bn, which included the
sale of 20.5m barrels of oil, up from 17m in 1990. Gas sales rose by 116m
cubic metres to 350m cubic metres.
Saga said crude oil production rose to a record 23.3m barrels, of which 2.9m
barrels was royalty paid in kind to the state.
The company expects to boost crude oil production by 10 per cent in 1992,
helped by the Snorre oil field coming on stream in September and reaching a
peak output capacity of 160,000 barrels a day.
Investments in oil and gas developments rose by NKr71m to NKr1.59bn in 1991.
Saga said it had restructured its debt to improve liquidity and meet
long-term needs. It also made a NKr826m unrealised foreign exchange gain.

FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: Air Canada blames weak demand
for record loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR CANADA, the country's biggest airline, yesterday blamed record losses of
CDollars 218m (USDollars 183.1m) for 1991 - against losses of CDollars 74m a
year earlier - on the long North American recession and weak demand on key
Atlantic routes.
The loss - which works out at Dollars 2.94 a share compared with Dollars
1.01 - was more than analysts had expected.
Looking ahead, however, Mr Claude Taylor, chairman, said: 'Competitive
pricing in an economy moving into a gradual recovery will bring more growth
in demand in the second half.' The airline forecasts a poor 1992 first half.
Air Canada cut its operations and staff last year in response to the
post-Gulf war recession. This, however, was not enough to stem rising
losses. The number of employees was reduced by 11 per cent to 20,600 at the
end of the year.
Operating revenues for 1991 were CDollars 3.56bn, down 9 per cent, while
operating expenses dipped by 4 per cent. The final operating loss, before
special charges for staff reductions, was CDollars 164m against an operating
profit of CDollars 50m in 1990.
The number of passengers carried fell 16 per cent to 9.9m, and the average
load factor came to 68.5 per cent against 71.4 per cent.
The airline's debt rose sharply in the year, to CDollars 2.1bn, after it
added 12 Airbus A320s and three Boeing 747-400s to its fleet. Recent
Canadian tax changes broadened the financing options for the country's
airlines, but Air Canada says the gap between Canadian and US financing
costs remained significant.
Air Canada is to add the three 747-400s to its Atlantic routes in March. It
will also modify two 747-200 combination passenger-cargo aircraft to
all-passenger. This will increase available seat miles by 10 per cent in
1992.
Mr Taylor said the priority was restoring profitability. The airline also
aims to restore lost market share and achieve greater penetration on all its
routes.
This week the airline named Mr Hollis Harris, former head of Delta Air
Lines, as president and chief executive. The post had been open for two
years following the resignation of Mr Pierre Jeanniot, who had led the
privatisation of Air Canada. Mr Taylor, 66, continues as chairman.

<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German airline, said yesterday it expected its financial woes
to continue this year after a poor start in January. It told employees to
brace themselves for a round of cost-cutting, job reductions, and
intensified efforts to sell more seats and cargo space.
'Economic weakness, competitive pressures, and overcapacity amid aggressive
worldwide competition will make life hard - even more so than in 1991,' the
management board said in the house magazine.
The airline, which is 52 per cent state-owned, has already said its losses
for last year would total around DM400m (Dollars 250m). It never managed
fully to offset the high losses of the first quarter, which was badly
affected by the effect of the Gulf war.
The board said demand in January 1992 was still well below expectations, and
that the month produced a similar loss to that of December. It had therefore
decided on a package of measures to reduce costs and improve performance.
This will involve pulling more aircraft out of service and not taking
delivery of some for which orders were in prospect for 1993 and putting a
block on most hiring and consideration of early retirements. Other measures
would require all departmentsto cut budgeted 1992 costs by a further 3 per
cent.
Passenger and freight business would also be improved so that seat-load and
cargo-use factors return to 70 per cent from between 60 and 65 per cent last
year.

SKr2.1bn

<TEXT>
GOTA Group, Sweden's fourth largest bank, has unveiled a deficit of SKr2.1bn
(Dollars 351.8m) for last year, following a sharp rise in bad debt
provisions. The loss compares with a profit of SKr1.18bn in 1990.
In 1991 the provisions jumped to SKr3.77bn, which amounted to 4.6 per cent
of loan volume. This contrasts with SKr982m of bad debts for the previous
year, equal to 1.1 per cent of loans volume.
'It is a very weak result,' admitted Mr Gabriel Urwitz, chief executive. He
refused to make any forecast for this year, saying 'that depends too much on
how the Swedish economy grows and it is too early to say anything about
that'.
However, he was able to draw comfort from the assistance being provided for
the group from its largest shareholder, Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurance
company.
Last December it provided a SKr1.5bn emergency loan when Gota revealed it
expected a Skr1.4bn operating loss. This boosted Gota's capital ratio to
11.2 per cent.
The worsening bad debts stem partly from loans to the ailing finance
company, Gamlestaden, last autumn.
Gota's net interest income fell to SKr3.33bn last year from Skr3.81bn in
1990.

RICOH, the office equipment and camera company, and Omron, the electronic
control equipment maker, have sharply lowered profits forecasts for the
fiscal year ending next month.
The two companies are joining a growing list of Japanese electronics-makers
facing a sudden decline in demand for electronic goods at home and abroad.
Although most companies are reporting higher sales than a year ago, margins
are collapsing rapidly as sales on a scale originally planned for have
failed to materialise.
As a result, electronics companies are having to slash prices to move
inventories, while making efforts to cut factory output.
Ricoh, a leading maker of small copiers and facsimile machines, said it
expected consolidated pre-tax profits to plunge 90 per cent to Y3.7bn
(Dollars 28.8m). Four months ago, it said profits would reach Y27bn. Ricoh
expects to slip into the red by Y1.6bn after paying taxes.
Sales are still expected to rise compared to last year, by 1.6 per cent to
Y1,020bn.
Omron said its consolidated pre-tax profits would decline by 54.1 per cent
to Y20bn, while net profits would be off 62.7 per cent to Y8bn. Sales would
rise by 3.4 per cent to Y480bn. Omron blamed the decline in profits on a
decrease in investment in plant and equipment, as well as a drop in demand
for durable consumer goods.
Other leading Japanese companies also lowered their forecast profits
yesterday:
Nippondenso, Japan's biggest producer of automotive electrical goods and a
leading supplier to Toyota Motor, reported a 24.6 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits to Y83.05bn in 1991.
The decline mirrors the weak results of automotive companies, which have
been reporting slow car sales at home and abroad.
Nippondenso's sales fell by 2.4 per cent during the year, to Y1,345.8bn.
Sales of air-conditioning equipment were off by 3.9 per cent to Y472.2bn,
while radiator sales rose by 5.4 per cent to Y88bn.
The company forecast that sales would rise to Y1,400bn in the current year,
but that net profits would recover only marginally to Y46.5bn.
After-tax profits declined by 11.2 per cent to Y45.5bn. The full-year
dividend was unchanged at Y14 a share.
Victor Company of Japan (JVC), the audio equipment maker, expects group
pre-tax losses of Y4.4bn and parent pre-tax losses of Y2.8bn for the year to
March, Reuter reports.
As recently as last October the company forecast group pre-tax profits of
Y27.5bn and parent pre-tax profits of Y17bn. JVC blamed the lower
projections on poor sales of audio-visual equipment and a rise in sales
costs as well as a stronger yen.
Kyocera, the big electronic components maker, lowered its forecast of parent
pre-tax profits to Y40.70bn for the year to March, down 27 per cent from the
Y56.09bn earned a year ago, Reuter reports. This compares with a November
forecast of Y44.10bn.
The downward revision is based on poor domestic sales of its products,
including semiconductor components, and a foreign exchange loss.
Komatsu, a leading maker of construction machinery, forecast group pre-tax
profit for the year to March of Y40bn, down 37 per cent from its estimate of
Y64bn made in November, AP-DJ reports.
It forecast group net profits at Y11bn, down 52 per cent on its earlier
forecast, and consolidated sales of Y930bn, down 5.1 per cent on its initial
estimate.
Komatsu blamed poor market conditions, notably in the US, with a rapid
fall-off in worldwide demand for construction machinery. It said it would be
hit by carmakers' moves to hold off investment in plant and equipment.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Loss deepens at Eng &amp; Overseas Prop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than doubled exceptional provisions against the fall in property values
led to a sharp increase in losses at English &amp; Overseas Properties in 1991.
Pre-tax losses leapt to Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 134,000) after exceptional
costs of Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 1.1m). Turnover declined to Pounds 1.03m
(Pounds 1.72m).
Operating losses were, however, reduced to Pounds 92,000 (Pounds 417,000).
Some Pounds 31,000 of losses came from associated companies (profits Pounds
879,000) and interest receivable fell to Pounds 289,000 (Pounds 499,000).
The company is proposing to maintain the final dividend at 0.5p for a total
of 1p (2.5p). Losses per share worked through at 14.24p (5.51p).
The summer rights issue raised Pounds 4.95m on a 3-for-1 basis and ensured
the company had enough cash 'to meet its obligations'. Cash balances rose
during the year to Pounds 5.3m and borrowings amounted to Pounds 5.4m.

<TEXT>
The recession has continued to hit USM-quoted BBB Design Group, resulting in
pre-tax losses up from Pounds 56,000 to Pounds 189,000 for the half-year to
October 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 836,000.
For the first time, the company's design, publishing and marketing
activities failed to make a profits contribution, with turnover falling by
39 per cent. The company has, however, continued to cut costs and
concentrate efforts and resources on new business development.
After tax credits of Pounds 42,000 (Pounds 19,000), net losses were Pounds
147,000 (Pounds 37,000) or 1.77p (0.45p) per share. Again no interim
dividend is declared.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Cranbrook loses Pounds 3m of orders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cranbrook Electronic Holdings was unable to make many inroads into its
losses in the year ended September 30. They amounted to Pounds 653,000,
after reorganisation costs of Pounds 197,000, against Pounds 696,000.
The group, a USM-traded distributor of high technology electronic components
and sub-systems, saw its turnover drop Pounds 3.08m to Pounds 7.41m as
principal customers cut production and reduced their stocks.
Some important suppliers were not prepared to respond to aggressive pricing.
That, said Mr Tony Diamond, chairman, resulted in a loss of at least Pounds
3m of orders, which he was sure the group would have continued to enjoy if
competitive pricing had been available to it. More recently a greater degree
of flexibility had been displayed by some suppliers.
In the current year turnover showed little sign of improvement. Operating
expenses had been reduced still further following a 22 per cent cut made in
1990-91.
Losses per share were again 6.61p. No dividend is recommended; the last
payment was an 0.5p interim in 1988-89.

FT  22 FEB 92 / F Usher advances to Pounds 0.59m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANK USHER, the USM-quoted textile and clothing group, stemmed the downturn
in profitability in the six months to November 30 and is restoring its
interim dividend to 2p.
The improved profitability was partly the result of tighter control of
overheads and stocks. Turnover fell to Pounds 7.61m (Pounds 8.19m) but the
pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 585,000. That compared with Pounds 505,000
last time and with Pounds 270,000 in the preceding six months.
Mr Christopher Norland, chairman, said the main effect of recession in the
UK was felt in trading with boutiques, whereas sales to stores groups and
exports were satisfactory.
Based on orders for the spring/summer 1992 collections, he looked forward to
a return in the second half to levels of profitability experienced prior to
last year's downturn in profits - from Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 775,000.
That was seen as 'a considerable achievement against the background of the
clothing industry' and justified restoring the interim dividend to 2p, after
last year's cut to 1.5p. Earnings per share were 5.7p (4.7p).

<TEXT>
TEMPLETON Emerging Mark-ets Investment Trust is attempting to raise Pounds
35m via a combination of a placing, open offer and an offer via
intermediaries.
It joined the stock market in 1990, with shareholders funds of almost Pounds
29m and raised a further Pounds 18m via a rights issue in 1990. Its shares
have traded close to, or above, asset value.
The directors said that the share issue would expand the shareholder base
and enable the trust to build a diversified portfolio. At October 31 its net
asset value was up 53 per cent on a year before.
Up to 22.5m new C shares are available via a placing at 100p. In addition,
7.5m shares are available to intermediaries and 5m to existing holders.

FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Decision on Maxwell insurance claim likely
next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS to the Maxwell empire will have to wait until next Thursday
before hearing whether insurers are likely to pay out under the late Mr
Robert Maxwell's Pounds 20m accident policy.
A report from the loss adjuster, Mr Roger Rich, into the publisher's death
last November says that Mr Maxwell probably committed suicide. 'On the
evidence I have got, the suicide theory is the more compelling one,' Mr Rich
said yesterday.
The report casts the clearest light yet on the last troubled hours Mr
Maxwell spent on board his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, before his death, that
led to the full exposure of the massive fraud in his business empire.
But it has done little to calm the legal battle that is developing over the
'key man' accidental death insurance policy.
Mr Charles Wilson, editor-in-chief of Mirror Group Newspapers, one of the
Maxwell companies that paid premiums for the policy, said: 'we retain and
are pursuing our interest in the insurance policy on Robert Maxwell's life.'
The insurance companies that have underwritten just over half the risk are
due to meet on Wednesday to decide how to respond to the loss adjuster's
report. Lloyd's and the companies were then expected to approach Maxwell's
brokers.
Mr Rich said should Lloyd's want to use suicide as a reason not to pay out
on the policy, there would have to be proof that Mr Maxwell did indeed
commit suicide.
On the other hand, Mr Pat Slade, underwriter on the leading syndicate,
Sturge, said that if there was no evidence suggesting Mr Maxwell's death was
an accident, he would not expect there to be a claim under the policy.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Decision on Chelsea ground likely next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMING week looks like being a crucial one for Cabra Estates, the
property company which owns Stamford Bridge, home of Chelsea football club.
On Tuesday, SB Property, which is 83.5 per cent owned by Cabra, will seek a
High Court injunction to force Chelsea to pay Pounds 22.85m for the ground.
The price was set by an independent valuer last November and it relates to
Chelsea's 1988 exercising of an option to buy.
A case involving a counter-claim for damages from Chelsea, which Cabra has
applied to the court to strike out, may also be heard.
Chelsea, which is chaired by Mr Ken Bates, is taking other legal action. It
wants to buy Stamford Bridge, but Mr Bates has yet to give any details about
finance.
Mr John Duggan, Cabra's chairman, said the aim was to get Chelsea to
complete the contract. If it did not, action would be taken against it.
Eviction of the first division club is one possibility.
Cabra, which last year lost Pounds 11.3m pre-tax and had year-end debt of
Pounds 52m, has delayed the publication of its interim results for more than
two months because of the uncertainty over Stamford Bridge.
The figures for the six months to September 30 are due to come out on
Thursday. In the first half of 1990-91, the company lost Pounds 5.24m. Its
share price has fallen to 7p from nearly 120p in mid-1989, when Mr Duggan
became chairman after the takeover of Marler Estates which brought in both
Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, Fulham football club's ground.
This month has seen further buying of Cabra shares by Mr Ashraf Marwan, an
Egyptian financier, who now owns about 27 per cent.

   By HITOSHI ISHIHARA, Yamaicha Securities in Tokyo
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE good reasons for putting money into the Japanese market now,
believes Mr Hitoshi Ishihara, vice-president of Yamaichi Securities, one of
the Big Four Japanese stockbrokers. But he acknowledges that its mood is so
bad that few people are convinced.
About 100 investors recently attended a Yamaichi seminar: 'We asked them
whether they thought it was a good time to invest in Japanese shares and
almost 100 people said 'yes'. We then asked them whether they would actually
invest and most said 'no'.'
Mr Ishihara expects a modest recovery in Japanese equities later this year.
'The change in sentiment will come gradually.' He thinks the Nikkei index of
leading stocks, now at 21,291, could fall below the psychologically
important level of 20,000 but this is 'unlikely'.
Mr Ishihara believes the economy is fundamentally strong, and that investors
will try to anticipate recovery. But this is unlikely before the end of
March, when many financial institutions close their accounts for the year.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Letter: Draft EC legislation may lead to payment of
performance bond calls being prevented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D W RIDGWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Featherstone's review (Business Law, February 13) of the risks
of performance bonds following the Gulf war omitted an important point.
There was no reference to current developments which are significant for
companies having funds held by UK banks by way of security for possible
calls under performance or similar bonds issued to Iraq.
The fact - confirmed this week by the Department of Trade and Industry  - is
that draft EC legislation will have the effect of preventing payment of bond
calls where the UK supplier's failure to perform was solely attributable to
United Nations sanctions.
The legislation is likely to be adopted during the first half of this year.
Although the interests of UK banks which have issued bonds on behalf of UK
suppliers differ from the interests of the suppliers themselves, it is
understood that the position of the UK government is to expect UK banks to
defend the line.
In these circumstances, UK suppliers face the prospect of not only having
bond calls blocked after the lifting of UN sanctions, but also having funds
held by UK banks by way of security eventually released.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Letter: PM's view of reasons for recession 'will not wash'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GILES RADICE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As you reported (Parliament and politics, February 19 and 20), the
prime minister and other government ministers continue to try to blame the
recession on world conditions.
This will not wash. In March 1991, both the governor of the Bank of England
and the chancellor of the exchequer admitted to the House of Commons
Treasury and Civil Service Committee that the British recession was 'home
grown'. In answer to a question from me, the governor said: 'The recession
here is in response to what was undeniably an excessive growth in previous
years and what might be called unilateral correction by us.'
Next day, the chancellor told the committee: 'I do not think there is a
worldwide recession as there was in the early 1980s. I think it is
absolutely true that the main cause and origin of the recession is a
response to the very fast growth - which exceeded the underlying growth of
capacity.'
It may be true there is now a slow down in some countries, especially
Germany, which could affect British exports. Corrective fiscal action by the
British government is therefore all the more necessary. As the Treasury
select committee said in its report on the Autumn Statement, 'discretionary
increases in public expenditure are justified at this stage in the cycle'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'The rewards of failure' (February 19), is timely. We have
long sought better disclosure of remuneration information, as a way of
'concentrating management's mind'. A more performance-related approach to
remuneration, based on targets linked to corporate objectives, is a
prerequisite at management levels. Yet far too few companies have a rigorous
appraisal system at senior levels.
Often their idea of performance-related pay is the use of a discretionary
share option scheme. As you rightly say, this entails no risk. Incentive
without risk is like heaven without hell. It is an upside-down logic that
encourages greater risk for employees through company-wide Save-As-You-Earn
option schemes than for senior management with discretionary schemes.
Are you likely to be in a position to write a leader in two years' time
entitled 'Justified rewards of success'? Sadly, I doubt it.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW IS a good time to invest in German bonds, according to Mr Ulrich Ramm,
executive vice-president in charge of analysis and corporate communications
at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. Equities will depend more on a satisfactory
outcome to this year's difficult wage round.
'Last year most investment was in long-term deposits. Now we, and
foreigners, are optimistic for the medium term.' He expects inflation to
peak in April at 4.5 per cent, and decline to 'three point something' in the
second half. 'That means a good time for investors on fixed interest rates.'
'The equity market is a bit problematic with the current wage negotiations.
The wage settlement in the steel industry was too high, but there is a
chance the banks will get a deal not above 6 per cent. That would be a
signal for the public sector and boost shares.'
Mr Ramm expects interest-
sensitive sectors, such as financials, construction and consumer
demand-related stocks, to react first, with engineering and exporters
advancing later.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'STOCKS ARE clearly the best place to be,' says Ms Abby Joseph Cohen,
co-chair of the investment policy committee at Goldman Sachs in New York.
'We'll see a recovering economy and a recovery in corporate profits,' she
says.
However, Ms Cohen warns that there are still risks associated with what she
calls 'deep cyclicals' - companies very dependent on economic recovery in
the US and around the world, and especially commodity price-sensitive
companies. 'We are concerned that their profits won't recover as much as
expected in 1992,' she says.
She likes 'growth cyclicals', such as technology, transportation and
electronics stocks. But she is wary of small-capitalisation stocks, 1991's
best performers, and companies that diversified abroad in the 1980s. 'As we
look into 1992, US markets may recover before overseas markets, so companies
that depend upon economic vigour in Europe and Asia may face some earnings
disappointments.'
Ms Cohen favours specialty US retailers with strong domestic exposure and
pharmaceuticals.

   By DAVID HARRINGTON, James Capel in Paris
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE HAVE been very positive about the French market for some time, but even
we were surprised by the way it has taken off in the past week,' says Mr
David Harrington, French general market analyst for James Capel in Paris.
Good US news has helped, he says. 'The dollar has strengthened so much that,
this time, we really do seem to have reached the bottom. That has weakened
the D-Mark and taken pressure off the franc. It has been good news for any
French company with a US earnings stream.'
Mr Harrington says the market is 'probably now in the first phase' of its
1992 rally. 'The second phase will come when official interest rates fall
and that won't happen until after the Germans move in the third quarter.'
The prospect of lower interest rates and French government plans for pension
reform make equities look a good investment, while bonds should perform
reasonably well, he says. 'But investors won't see such good returns on cash
which has been the investment in France for the past few years.'

'THE GLOBAL economic environment to the end of 1992 is, on balance, likely
to favour bonds over equities, but with special situations in equity markets
 -the UK market being one,' says Mr George Magnus, a director of economic
research at Warburg Securities in London.
He expects European bond markets to fare best. 'After mid-year, German
interest rates could begin a protracted decline into 1993, allowing interest
rates everywhere to fall into line with demand and inflation conditions.
Gilt yields are forecast to fall to 8.5 to 8.75 per cent. French and Ecu
bonds should also perform well while Spain and Italy will remain
interesting.'
Mr Magnus believes equity markets should be supported by lower bond yields
and inflation. 'But we single out the UK and Pacific Rim markets for value
and earnings potential, respectively.' He says the FT-SE is cheap and may
not have adjusted yet to the prospect of permanently low inflation. In
Europe, French equities look most interesting.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Realism in retreat: The shaky prospects for a Middle East
peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talking of peace while watching the seeds of conflict grow is a Middle East
trait that seems to survive even the worst conflicts.
A year ago next week, when small, rich Kuwait was liberated, the Middle East
looked less militarily threatening than it had for decades and Mr George
Bush seemed guaranteed a second presidential term. Twelve months on, there
are still peace talks on the agenda. But with the latest round scheduled to
start on Monday, the guns are firing again and the achievements of the Gulf
war have become much less obvious for the Middle East in general and Mr Bush
in particular.
The defeat of Iraqi forces in Kuwait had offered the region much more than
just the chance to rid itself of a tyrant, while Mr Bush had the opportunity
to capitalise on the triumph of becoming the US leader who presided over the
joint burial of communism and the bitter memory of Vietnam. Logic alone
suggested that after such a huge international effort, the Middle East would
not to be allowed to fester and erupt in the same way again.
There were positive changes. For the first time in its post-colonial
history, the Middle East was demonstrably free from superpower rivalry,
Israel had been persuaded to exercise wholly uncharacteristic military
restraint and there was talk in western capitals of moving towards a
resolution of some of the Middle East's worst political injustices and
economic disparities. If there was to be a new Middle East order, Mr Bush
and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, were uniquely placed to be both
architects and guarantors.
Those hopes have dissipated with alarming speed. After the events of the
past week, not least in New Hampshire, the defeated President Saddam Hussein
is crowing about being more secure in Baghdad than the victorious Mr Bush is
in Washington. Israel's assassination of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Shia
leader in southern Lebanon, and his family has inflamed not just his local
community but sent a message to Moslem communities throughout the Middle
East. Israeli tanks have subsequently brushed aside UN peacekeeping forces
and punched deeper into southern Lebanon in what is certain to be another
doomed attempt to impose political compliance through military punishment.
The US is meanwhile still trumpeting its pursuit of Saddam Hussein, is
threatening tougher action against Libya and has supported the cancellation
of elections in Algeria.
Taken individually, each event has its particular motivation. Taken
severally, it is small wonder that the region's radicals think they are
poised to claw back much of the ground conceded to the US and the more
moderate Arab regimes at the time of the Gulf war. They argued then that the
US viewed the Gulf conflict primarily as an opportunity to crush Iraq and to
ensure that a pliant Saudi Arabia would ensure cheap long-term oil supplies.
They insisted that beyond the borders of Israel, Mr Bush cared little for
the people of the region, would make scant efforts to assist domestic
victims of Saddam Hussein's aggression and never intended to offer more than
a token effort to resolve the Palestinian issue. The extremist propaganda
image of Israel and the US jointly beating their Arab opponents into
submission retains more potency among some populations than anything which
can be advanced by America's friends in support of their relationship.
Against this background, Palestinians, Syrians, Jordanians, Lebanese and
Israelis gather in Washington on Monday for a third round of bilateral
negotiations which, as the participants are all too well aware, look
increasingly at odds with the political mood of the Middle East.
The peace process, launched in Madrid at the end of last October, reflected
primarily the changed strategic circumstances of the participating nations.
The collapse of the Soviet Union had left the Palestinians and Israel's Arab
opponents without a sponsor or protector. President Hafez al-Assad of Syria,
hitherto Israel's most durable enemy, saw a compensating degree of
protection by acceding to US requests and agreed to negotiate, pulling
Lebanon with him.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, came with even greater
reluctance, stressing that Israel would not concede an inch more of the land
it had occupied since 1967 and could offer nothing other than peace in
return for peace. To reinforce that assertion, Israel accelerated its house
building programme in the occupied territories and saw nothing contradictory
in simultaneously asking the US to guarantee loans of Dollars 10bn needed to
settle immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
After all this, Israel still suffers a credibility gap. Its problem is that
the US and other western governments prefer to interpret Mr Shamir's most
hardline statements as negotiating positions rather than simple statements
of conviction. When Mr Shamir says that Jews must forever have the right to
settle in the biblical lands of Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) it should
be supposed he believes that as fervently as he does in a united Jerusalem
under Israeli sovereignty. There is nothing contradictory for Mr Shamir in
sending tanks into southern Lebanon while protesting a determination to
secure peace. Mr Menahem Begin, the former Likud prime minister, ordered a
far larger invasion of Lebanon in 1978, only a few months after President
Anwar Sadat of Egypt opened prospects for peace by becoming the first Arab
leader to visit Israel.
These attitudes do, however, pose problems for the Bush Administration. Mr
Shamir was on Thursday night re-elected as leader of his Likud party and
will go into the June general election as the favourite to win. If he is
successful there is no justification for Arab governments to expect anything
more than the most modest flexibility in Likud policy. A victory for Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, newly returned to lead the opposition Labour party, would, on
the other hand, open the way to the offer of some form of autonomy for the
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, although Mr Rabin's chances of
winning depend on him appearing to the electorate to be almost as tough as
Mr Shamir. If the election result is indecisive, as it often has been in the
past, the two men would probably work together in a national unity
government.
A politically astute Mr Shamir does, however, have the opportunity this week
to rob Mr Rabin of some of his electoral appeal. He can put on the table in
Washington the framework of an autonomy agreement for the Palestinians along
the lines of the Camp David accords reached during the negotiations with
President Sadat in 1978. This will simultaneously improve relations with the
US. It will not answer Palestinian aspirations for self-determination, but
it would assist the negotiating teams by indicating there was some
longer-term purpose to the peace process.
But if Mr Shamir wishes to contribute additionally to the pressures which
will eventually provoke the collapse of the peace process, then he will
instruct the Israeli team in Washington next week to avoid any proposals on
substantive issues. He knows the Arab delegations must be getting near the
brink. Syria and Lebanon boycotted the multilateral phase of the process in
Moscow earlier this month in protest at Israel's refusal to concede the
principle of exchanging territory for peace. With the alarm bells ringing
again in Damascus over Israel's latest incursion into Lebanon, President
Assad must be finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile participating
in the peace talks. There are similar tensions in the Palestinian camp.
They would, of course, rather stay within the process. To pull out serves
not just Israel's hawks but extremists throughout the Arab world. But there
comes a point when the domestic dangers may be judged to be greater than the
international blame that would attach to withdrawal.
Mr Assad, King Hussein of Jordan, Yassir Arafat of the PLO and those other
Arab leaders and regimes that came to power in the late 1960s and early
1970s have not clung to the tops of their greasy poles for so long without
accurately sensing political movements in the region. Historically, it has
been easier in the Arab world to whip up and sustain popular support through
anti-Israeli and anti-American rhetoric than through any other form of
political agitation.
The Gulf war added to the personal, political and economic misery of tens of
millions of people in the region. That misery continues and is growing. At
grass roots, the political ground is being more surely prepared for
extremism than it is for the more pragmatic realism that seemed possible a
year ago.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Man in the News: Political gambler raises the stakes - F W
de Klerk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr F W de Klerk, the South African president, is asking his white countrymen
to do what voters everywhere hate doing: face reality. He is counting on
them to show - through a referendum held within the next three weeks - that
they reject the apartheid fantasies of the past and accept the inevitability
of black rule.
But for a people fed with deluded notions of racial superiority for hundreds
of years, the prospect of a multi-racial future is terrifying. Mr de Klerk
is gambling that reason will triumph over fear in white hearts. If he is
right, South Africa will have taken another huge leap towards a democratic
and peaceful future. If he is wrong, the consequences could not be more
dire; the white supremacist Conservative party would take power, the African
National Congress (ANC) would do its best to launch a revolution, and South
Africa would descend again into chaos.
It is a gamble to take one's breath away, and just the sort of bold move
which so delights the president. He could easily have avoided such a
showdown. With a huge majority in parliament, Mr de Klerk's National party
could have dismissed its loss in this week's Potchefstroom by-election as no
more than an embarrassment. Mr de Klerk could have blamed the result on the
dismal state of the economy. But that is not his style.
He argued in Cabinet for immediate action to staunch the flow of white
voters to the Conservatives, who have won a steady series of by-elections
since the 1989 general election. Some ministers argued against a referendum
now. With constitutional negotiations only just under way, there is no
outline yet of a power-sharing deal to calm white fears. With the economy in
a three-year recession, crime and violence occupying every white mind, and
the added misfortune of drought, this is hardly the time to ask for a vote
of confidence in Nationalist rule.
But Mr de Klerk believes he has the nation's confidence. He trusts his
abilities as a leader, his vision of a future where blacks rule but do not
dominate, his commitment to the Afrikaner nation from which he springs. He
vowed to demonstrate it through a referendum, rather than tolerate the daily
jeers of Conservative members of parliament, who claim he no longer
represents most whites.
It was a political decision to call the Conservatives' bluff on the issue of
white support. Without firm white backing, he cannot negotiate from strength
on a new constitution. And if he can trounce the Conservatives in a
referendum, he will cut the political ground from beneath their feet, and
help defuse the threat of right-wing terrorism.
But it was also, as Mr de Klerk said, 'a question of honour'. For this is a
broedertwis, or family feud among Afrikaners. Right-wing Afrikaners often
taunt Mr de Klerk with the charge that he has betrayed his nation by
dismantling the superstructure of apartheid, created to protect the language
and identity of the Afrikaner as a island in a sea of black cultures.
For his part, Mr de Klerk argues that the Afrikaners' only hope lies in
accepting change before it is forced on them through revolution. If the
Afrikaner cedes power now, he will still be left with enough influence to
protect Afrikanerdom in perpetuity.
He is convinced that apartheid, which remains the platform of the
Conservative party, could never survive the force of numbers ranged against
it: 28m blacks, 5m whites. He acknowledges that most whites still prefer
apartheid; they want to live with their own kind in a culture which reflects
white values. But, as the president told the voters of Potchefstroom last
week, apartheid is no longer an option. The grand strategists of apartheid -
former prime ministers such as Hendrik Verwoerd and John Vorster -
demonstrably could not make it work; Mr de Klerk asked voters to judge
whether Mr Andries Treurnicht, the rather insipid leader of the Conservative
party, could do any better.
Mr de Klerk has not renounced apartheid out of the goodness of his heart; he
is haunted by an apocalyptic vision of the consequences of pursuing it. He
believes it would make race war inevitable. As he told senior policemen two
years ago, 'if this Armageddon takes place and blood flows ankle deep in the
streets and four or five million people lie dead - the problem will remain
exactly the same as before the shooting started.' That explains his
conversion to multi-racialism: the alternative was too ghastly to
contemplate.
Last week the president urged the voters of Potchefstroom to put aside their
preference for racial purity and vote for the policy they thought would
work. It was surprisingly honest counsel from a politician - and hardly the
stuff to win him many accolades.
Now he will put the same choice to the national electorate. The referendum
question has yet to be written, but it will certainly be formulated to
guarantee maximum positive response. Voters will probably be asked whether
they support peacefully negotiated change - the Conservative party currently
refuses to negotiate with black groups - and may be asked for a vote of
confidence in the president himself. Either way, the Nationalists are
confident they will win, perhaps by a substantial margin.
They were also confident about Potchefstroom. But a referendum is not a
by-election: the Nationalists can manipulate the referendum question; and Mr
de Klerk's promise to resign if he loses will concentrate the minds of
voters on the consequences of a 'no' vote. Many will shy away from the
prospect of a Conservative government; they may prefer an uncertain future
under the Nationalists to the certainty of race war.
Recent opinion polls also give Mr de Klerk cause for optimism. Last week's
Sunday newspapers carried a poll showing 63 per cent support for the
president among whites, against 15 per cent for Mr Treurnicht. And the
Conservatives' election pitch is hardly alluring: they offer racial purity,
but at a price. 'We must make a choice between the survival of the Afrikaner
volk and two cars in the garage. If sacrifices are required of us we will
make them,' a party spokesman vowed recently.
With luck, Mr de Klerk's gamble will pay off. He will have proved that he is
not prone to the Gorbachev malaise: a leader estranged from his people, more
popular abroad than at home. But if the Gorbachev parallel is correct, and
Mr de Klerk is ousted from power, South Africa will retreat into a feudal
past where violence prompts repression, engendering more violence. For most
South Africans, that is the stuff of which nightmares are made.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Victims of disinflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR is in the best possible company. Mr George Bush may have been
victor in the Gulf war and presided over the disappearance of the Soviet
Union, but neither achievement saved him from a mauling at the hands of Mr
Patrick Buchanan in the New Hampshire primary. Meanwhile, the Japanese
government sinks ever deeper into the swamps of financial scandal.
Mr Francois Mitterrand's Socialist government seems doomed to lose the next
parliamentary elections, while only the peculiarities of Italian electoral
politics can save Mr Giulio Andreotti's despised coalition. Mr Bob Hawke,
Australia's long-serving prime minister, has been defenestrated. Meanwhile,
Mr Brian Mulroney's Canadian government may be the most unpopular of all,
with less than 20 per cent support in opinion polls.
The unpopularity into which so many governments of leading market economies
have fallen is no accident. It reflects the current disinflationary stage of
the global economic cycle. Canada, for example, has just announced annual
inflation down to 1.6 per cent. Who can wonder that its government is so
unpopular?
The credit-driven economic expansion that has now come to its painful end
everywhere began in the US almost 10 years ago. But the weakness of the US
dollar, which started in 1985, and especially the intervention aimed at
halting the dollar's fall in 1987, loosened monetary policy elsewhere. Japan
discovered the delights of the 'bubble economy'; the UK enjoyed 'the Lawson
boom'; and even the Bundesbank tolerated interest rates lower than it would
have preferred, briefly easing its iron grip on the rest of Europe.
Slow growth
When economies are good, they are very, very good, but when they are bad,
they are dreadful. In the expansionary stage, growth tended to be stronger
than expected. As is their wont, policy-makers thought the early stages of
an inflationary process proved their brilliance. The greater their
self-confidence, the more they allowed domestic policy to reinforce the
global expansion.
As recently as 1989, every important economy was growing quite rapidly. Now
they are all either growing slowly or contracting. But the slowdown in
between has been unsynchronised.
It started where the expansion had begun, in the Anglo-Saxon economies. A
combination of tight money and overindebtedness brought the US and UK
economies into recession by late 1990. Japan's economy raced ahead, despite
successful, if belated, efforts of the Bank of Japan to prick the bubble,
starting in 1989. But all good things come to an end. Japan's economy has
been slowing rapidly in 1991, if still to rates that others envy.
Bundesbank's vengeance
Since the Bundesbank tightened monetary policy as early as 1988, Germany
largely escaped the global credit expansion. But the unification of Germany
has forced the Bundesbank on to a long inflationary deviation from the path
of monetary rectitude. Having now imposed three successive quarters of
contraction, the Bundesbank is back on course with a vengeance.
The US led the world economy into recession. It is likely to lead it out of
it. In his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins monetary report, Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, predicted that the US economy would grow
modestly this year. Unemployment would soon begin declining and the
inflation outlook was the best for a generation. Mr Bush should no longer
complain about Mr Greenspan's zeal in his cause.
Elsewhere, policy is less expansionary. The Bank of Japan tightened too late
and has loosened too slowly. It could well be underestimating the force of
debt-deflation. If the British Treasury is still determined to commit that
error, it makes little difference, except to the quality of its forecasts.
The Bundesbank is unlikely to permit Europe to do much about the recession
until it is confident German inflation is well under control, perhaps in the
second half of the year.
A strong global recovery may take as long to arrive as the slowdown. In the
meantime, the world economy will remain on a knife edge. The refusal to
resort to inflation as a way of liquidating the excessive lending of the
1980s is praiseworthy, but the risks of not doing so are considerable.
Many are taking the wish for the deed and are already hailing the virtual
elimination of inflation. Should governments keep their nerve, the
achievement is, indeed, within their grasp. Yet the achievement would have
its costs. One is unemployment, which may prove transitory in some
economies, but will be longer lasting in others. Another could be the
disappearance of most of the governments that initiated the disinflation,
with Mr Major among the first in the firing line. Disinflation is a fine
thing. But politically, it may well be best for oppositions.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Radio for new world order: The changing role of Voice of
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Voice of America, the radio service established and financed by the US
government, began broadcasting on February 24 1942, the news was almost all
bad; Japanese armies pressed onwards in the Pacific, and Germany moved
deeper into Russia.
Fifty years later, the news is good: the US has declared victory in the Cold
War and Voice of America can claim at least part of the credit for what
American politicians describe as a victory over 'imperial communism'.
In its hour of triumph, however, VOA must face a new debate over its role,
its usefulness and its cost.
As new, independent broadcasters start up in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union, the need for the US to maintain its broadcasts is questioned
by American critics, mainly from the right of the political spectrum. They
always found it anomalous that the ideals of the free market should be
spread by a Voice of America controlled by the US government.
VOA, according to Mr Robert Coonrod, its deputy director, is already
adapting both its programming and the way it delivers its message.
'It is clear to us from the anecdotal information we get that what audiences
need and want is quite different today from what they were looking for three
or four years ago,' he says.
According to Mr Coonrod, basic news on what is happening on a day-to-day
basis is being satisfied by the local media. He sees Voice of America's role
as supplying interpretation, analysis and context. He cites a recent series
on 'Democracy in Action', designed to provide practical information for
citizens of a new democracy.
At the same time, VOA is building on its traditional short-wave broadcasts
into eastern Europe and seeking to reach a larger audience by providing
higher quality FM broadcasts. To achieve this, it is developing affiliations
with local broadcasters, which it supplies with programmes.
But is VOA, which has never quite shaken off the image of being a weapon of
the Cold War, ideally structured to meet these new needs?
Like its UK counterpart, the World Service of the British Broadcasting
Corporation, VOA is financed by the government. Unlike the BBC, it is
administered by a government department, the US Information Agency. Mr Kim
Elliott, director of VOA's research department, acknowledges that in many
markets the BBC's reputation beats that of his own service.
'The BBC is considered a more reliable source of news than VOA,' he says.
But Mr Coonrod believes this perception is based on a misunderstanding. He
complains that VOA's critics confuse its news broadcasting, which is
impartial and independent, with its editorials.
In fulfilment of its charter, VOA must 'present the policies of the United
States clearly and effectively'. It does so by means of a daily signed
editorial, which is vetted beforehand by the State Department.
In many markets the reputation of an international radio service is also
linked to the strength of its radio signal.
In the past, VOA has concentrated much of its effort on eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union. It is much weaker than the BBC in regions such as the
Middle East and Africa - where it lost its principal transmitter during the
Liberian civil war.
It is in the Far East, however, that the next main battleground may lie.
Since the Tiananmen Square uprising in the spring of 1989, US politicians
have sought ways of bringing more independent news to the airwaves of China.
The argument has been over whether this should involve stepping up VOA's
Chinese services, or setting up a new station like Radio Free Europe or
Radio Liberty.
These stations, like Voice of America, are funded by the US government. But
they provide more detailed news of the countries they broadcast to and are
intended to act as 'surrogates' for the local radio stations.
The State Department has argued that a Radio Free China would unnecessarily
antagonise the Chinese government. VOA, meanwhile, argues that it could
provide a much expanded coverage with the money needed to set up a new radio
station.
In December, a presidential taskforce chaired by Mr John Hughes, a former
VOA director, came down in favour of creating a Radio Free Asia, principally
targeted on China but also broadcasting to countries such as Burma and
Vietnam.
The proposal draws an enthusiastic response from Mr Malcolm S Forbes Jr, the
magazine editor who, as chairman of the Board for International
Broadcasting, oversees and allocates funds for Radio Liberty and Radio Free
Europe. 'We can have a tremendous impact for what amounts to pennies per
person,' he says.
But while the proposed Radio Free Asia may be seen as VOA's rival in the
battle for pride of place in the broadcasting onslaught on China, Mr Forbes
urges politicians to provide money for both.
'Some day, policymakers may understand that this is a very effective weapon
that has been grossly underused. If the US wants to avoid another round of
isolationism, this is an extraordinarily cost effective way to do it.'

FT  22 FEB 92 / Move to widen role of friendly societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BILL to create a new legislative framework for friendly societies was
published yesterday.
The government bill would enable friendly societies - ranging from
industrial assurance funds to those that are mainly social or philanthropic
 -to provide a wider range of services. It should also allow them to compete
on more equal terms with other financial institutions.
It would establish a new regulatory framework including a Friendly Societies
Commission. Societies would also be brought within the scope of the
Policyholders Protect-ion Act 1975, the investor-protection scheme covering
insurance policyholders.
The bill would enable friendly societies to incorporate and establish
subsidiaries to provide various financial and other services to their
members and the public.
These would include: managing unit and investment trusts and personal equity
plans; arranging credit; long-term or general insurance business; insurance
intermediary services; administering estates and executing will trusts;
managing sheltered housing, homes for the elderly and hospitals; providing
fund management services for pension-fund trustees.
The investment funds of friendly societies are free of tax within certain
limits. For instance, the amount an investor can put into a tax-free
friendly society savings scheme is Pounds 200 per annum.
The bill was welcomed by Mr Peter Gray, chairman of Tunbridge Wells
Equitable, the largest friendly society, and secretary of the Friendly
Society Parliamentary Committee. 'Our competitors have had a tremendous
advantage over us and we need the same sort of fiscal incentives. The
government has given them tax breaks such as tax-exempt special savings
accounts and Peps. What do they give friendly societies? Pounds 200 a year.'

FT  22 FEB 92 / Labour launches poll tax offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday highlighted what it called the 'government incompetence
surcharge' on the poll tax. The jibe was made as Mr Bryan Gould, shadow
environment secretary, published figures showing that Labour councils had
issued more than double the number of summonses for non-payment issued by
Tory councils.
Labour's offensive is intended to undermine Tory assertions that the extra
sums people will have to pay to make up for non-payment - the 'other
adjustments' figures on poll tax bills - derive from Labour councils'
failure to pursue non-payers.
The analysis, giving the numbers of summonses and liability orders for
non-payment for each authority since April 1990, shows that the London
borough of Haringey had issued summonses to 99 per cent of its entire poll
tax register.
'Even allowing that some people have received more than one summons, this is
an astonishing total,' Mr Gould said. 'It is hard to think what more
Haringey could have done to collect the tax.'
The average number of summonses even for shire districts, the class of
authority where the percentage is lowest, amounted to more than a fifth of
the total poll tax register.
The number of summonses in England and Wales now totalled about 11m, Mr
Gould added. He had written to the Guinness Book of Records seeking
inclusion for the poll tax as 'the greatest debt-collection exercise in
world history'.
The Tories say Labour councillors who supported non-payment of the poll tax
have contributed to collection difficulties, and that those councils which
have high non-payment surcharges are those which have traditionally been
inefficient at collecting charges.

THE PRIME MINISTER will today launch the Tories' fight-back in Scotland with
a clear warning to the country's electorate that the survival of the union
with the rest of the UK is 'more important' than party politics, Ivo Dawnay

Mr John Major will use a campaigning speech to Tory parliamentary candidates
in Glasgow to rally them behind a 'fight for the union', stressing that
Scottish Conservatives must speak with one voice to get their message
across.
Downing Street said he would repeat his warning, made earlier this month,
that the advocates of devolution or independence had told the people 'the

patients on hospital waiting lists for more that two years will be treated
by April.
The final Pounds 3m from this year's Pounds 39m waiting-list fund, used to
buy extra treatment for health conditions which have long waiting lists, is
about to be allocated.
In December 28,197 people had been on waiting lists for more than two years.
This figure is now around 20,000.
Health authorities can supplement NHS capacity by buying treatment in
Ministry of Defence or private hospitals, although they are expected to keep
within the broad NHS cost-structure when doing so.
The attempt to meet the deadline is producing extra work for private
hospitals, although leading private-sector health providers say that they
are not experiencing a large upsurge in NHS contracts.
The health department said that reports of surgeons being paid excessive
fees for extra operations would be investigated if there was firm evidence.
So far there had been no proof of abuse.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Washing-machine workers laid off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LEADING washing-machine manufacturers yesterday confirmed the depth and
severity of the recession by announcing plans to lay off almost 3,000
workers in an effort to cut unsold stocks.
The lay-offs at Hotpoint and Hoover suggest that the rise in retail demand
during the January sales may have been shortlived.
Hotpoint is to lay off 1,600 shopfloor workers at two plants in north Wales
for a fortnight next month. Workers at the factories at Llandudno Junction
in Gwynedd and Bodelwyddan, Clwyd, are already working a four-day week
because of the impact the recession has had on sales of washing machines and
dishwashers.
Mr Phil Collins, the personnel director of Hotpoint, said that continuing
poor sales of washing machines since Christmas meant that it was necessary
to have two full weeks of short-time working in the first and last weeks of
March.
Mr Trevor Gregory, the AEU engineering union convener for the plants, said
that the shutdown and short-time working would result in each employee
losing wages of about Pounds 700.
Hoover blamed an increasingly difficult economic situation for its decision
to lay off workers at its Merthyr Tydfil plant in south Wales for two weeks
from March 2.
The company said improved sales in recent months had not reduced the stocks
of finished goods to acceptable levels.

FT  22 FEB 92 / More aid sought for Welsh coal regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to seek further aid from the European Commission for the
depressed coal-mining areas of Wales. This is on top of the Pounds 17.8m
released by Brussels earlier this week.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, met Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner for
regional policy, on Thursday in Brussels when it was indicated that an
application for a further Pounds 10m would be 'looked on favourably'. Mr
Hunt said qualifying projects had been drawn up by the Welsh Office. 'We
have a long list of schemes ready to be put into Brussels as soon as we get
the nod,' he said.
The move will be welcomed by other British mining areas which are certain to
put in further applications now that the dispute over such funding between
Whitehall and Brussels has been settled. The government backed down on
Monday from its previous stance that European regional aid should go to the
Treasury to help finance schemes already authorised in Britain.
Mr Millan refused to release Pounds 120m to Britain for more than 50
projects unless he received an assurance that European finance would be used
in addition to anything the government might spend.
Mr Hunt and Mr Millan met at the opening of the Wales European Centre in
Brussels, designed to act as a link between companies in the principality
and the EC. Organisations that played a part in setting it up include the
Welsh Development Agency, district and county councils, the Training and
Enterprise Councils in Wales, the Development Board for Rural Wales and
University College, Cardiff.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Sinn Fein plans diplomatic effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINN FEIN, the political wing of the IRA, is planning a diplomatic campaign
to seek potential allies in the European Parliament and the United Nations.
A strategy document, Towards a Lasting Peace in Ireland, will be discussed
at Sinn Fein's annual congress in Dublin this weekend.
The document argues that the political and economic changes in eastern and
western Europe 'demand an equivalent breadth of vision and willingness to
innovate. The partition of Ireland and the British claim to jurisdiction
over the Six Counties (Northern Ireland) is a European issue'.
It argues that the UN can help to bring about abolition of emergency laws
and special courts in Northern Ireland and the republic and participate in
setting up talks.
The document says: 'As an interim measure Sinn Fein would propose that the
UN secretary-general requests annual reports from the British government on
its role in Ireland and conducts a yearly review of the consequences of the
continued partition.'
It envisages an international conference on the conflict which would
'involve representatives of all political views in Ireland, along with
international experts on decolonisation and conflict resolution'.
The British and Irish governments have rejected the inclusion of Sinn Fein
in political discussions on Northern Ireland, until it formally distances
itself from the IRA and renounces the use of force.
Neither government would comment yesterday on the proposals but could be
expected to block any attempt to involve the EC or the UN, arguing that it
was an internal matter.
Sinn Fein's weekend congress will discuss a range of social and economic
issues, including a women's policy document which includes motions on the
right of divorce and abortion in the republic.
The congress is not expected to produce serious divisions over moves to
distance Sinn Fein more clearly from the IRA.
In a recent interview with the Irish Times Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president, said the IRA 'does come from the same tradition as Sinn Fein. We
do share common objectives, but the IRA reaches its decisions independently
of Sinn Fein, and Sinn Fein reaches its decisions independently of the IRA'.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Traders angered by rise in charges on credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING RETAILERS' representative yesterday warned the high-street banks
that their plans to increase credit card service charges may lead to reduced
co-operation from retailers in the fight against fraud.
Mr Bob Woodman, a director of the Retailers' Consortium, said price
increases by Barclays and National Westminster had taken the spotlight away
from the fraud issue, expected to cost the banks about Pounds 200m this
year.
He asked: 'How can we co-operate with them when there is this sort of
friction between our two industries?'
In the past two weeks Barclays and National Westminster have started writing
to retailer customers informing them that the merchant service charge - the
commission paid on credit-card transactions - will have to go up.
The banks say reduced volumes of business are forcing them into losses on
their credit card merchant services in spite of reduced costs and a price
rise in unavoidable.
Both NatWest and Barclays say that retailers pay an average merchant service
charge of 1.6 per cent, though this varies from about 1 per cent for very
large groups with a lot of negotiating power to as much as 4 per cent for
some small businesses.
Barclays Merchant Services, the plastic card processing arm of Barclays,
said yesterday it would be raising charges by less than 10 per cent. This
would mean an increase of about 14p per Pounds 100 of turnover for its
average retailer customer.
Privately bankers admit that they priced their credit card services too low
in their scramble to enter the market from 1989. Until then, credit card
merchant services in the UK were provided only by Barclaycard for Visa and
by Access for MasterCard. Individual banks did not compete in the market.
Barclays says that average merchant service charges fell by 26 per cent in
the two years since 1989.
Only one bank, Lloyds, says it is currently making a small profit from
credit-card merchant services, but it admits that business volumes have
dropped sharply because of the recession. Its 1991 results, published
yesterday, show that its credit card income, including annual fees, fell to
Pounds 72m from Pounds 81m a year earlier.
Barclays last night dismissed the idea that the price increases might harm
co-operation with retailers over fraud. 'It must be as much in the interests
of retailers to discourage fraud as it is in ours.'

FT  22 FEB 92 / W Midlands engineers doubt recovery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are no signs of an impending recovery from recession, West Midlands
engineering employers warned yesterday. Mr John Owen, retiring president of
the region's Engineers Employers' Federation, said that the local
engineering industry 'has experienced perhaps its worst recession ever'.
The federation's annual report for 1991 said: 'For many companies
manufacturing output has stabilised at a very low and unacceptable level.'
With more than 1,000 members, the EEF West Midlands represents the largest
concentration of engineering companies in the UK and its collective
performance is a barometer of national trends.
'Four out of 10 (companies) continue to report a deterioration in their
business trends; and only one out of 10 reports an improving trend or more
buoyant circumstances,' reported Mr Owen.
This experience mirrors the national economy: government figures have shown
that the decline in output during 1991 was the steepest since 1931. It is
also a renewed pressure on the government, as it prepares a pre-election
Budget, for some stimulus to the domestic economy.
'Expectations for recovery extend into the second half of 1992; confidence
is low and employment prospects are not good,' Mr Owen said.
The West Midlands Enterprise Board said yesterday that, in the region as a
whole, 35 people are chasing every available job against a national average
of 27. In the urban areas of Birmingham, the Black Country, Solihull and
Coventry more than 40 people are chasing each job. It reported 11,655
redundancies over the past six months.
Limited employment prospects have also led to a fall in the level of wage
settlements. The EEF West Midlands reported that the average increase in
1991 was 6.4 per cent, compared with 7.6 per cent in 1990.
Although the EEF West Midlands remains worried about levels of productivity
 -'the UK still lags behind world competition' - independent analysts are
sanguine about the medium-term future.
The enterprise board, although ruling out any immediate prospect of a strong
economic recovery, believes that 'prospects for engineering may be better
than those for much of the rest of the economy'. It cited the export
potential of new Japanese car plants which, it said, would create a demand
for components. West Midlands industry is strongly dependent on the
fluctuating fortunes of the motor industry.

FT  22 FEB 92 / Philippines reaches deal on rescheduling Dollars 5.3bn debt
to banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Philippines has reached a new deal with its leading creditor banks on
rescheduling Dollars 5.3bn of the country's debt to commercial banks. The
agreement, which must be put to the rest of the banks, replaces a deal last
September which foundered as the Philippines missed economic targets set by
the IMF, and Manila failed to win an accord securing the future of US
military bases in the country.
The government of President Corazon Aquino recently received IMF approval
for a new economic programme after forcing measures through the legislature.
Bankers believe the debt deal will provide significant relief to the new
government which will take office after elections in May.
A significant difference from the previous proposals is that banks will not
be able to lend money through a co-financing arrangement with the Asian
Development Bank. The US objected to commercial bank financing being secured
in this way. Otherwise, the terms are similar. The Philippines has obtained
lower interest rates on bonds being offered to the banks, reflecting the
general drop in dollar interest rates, though the cuts are not as great as
some bankers feared.
The package gives bank creditors the option to exchange loans for new bonds
carrying low fixed interest rates or to tender their existing Philippine
loans for a cash buy-back at a sizeable discount. Banks may also opt to
provide new money to the Philippines. Philippine monetary authorities
estimate that the programme will generate more than Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds
1.3bn) in fresh funds and debt relief over the next six years. The country's
foreign debt totals Dollars 29bn.
Bonds to be offered in exchange for existing loans include new money bonds
with a maturity of 17 years and an interest rate of London interbank offered
rates plus  13/16 percentage point. Interest reduction bonds with a maturity
of 15 years will carry interest for the first two years of 4 per cent,
rising to 5 per cent in the next two, and to 6 per cent in year six. From
the seventh year until maturity date, the interest will be Libor plus  13/16
per cent. A third option will be principal collateralised interest reduction
bonds to mature in a repayment in 25 years, initially carrying 4 1/4 per
cent interest.

INDIAN Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, has strengthened the position of his
Congress minority government after winning 12 of the 13 parliamentary seats
in Punjab, taking its tally in parliament to 244 in a house of 544.
The party is still in a minority but can count on the votes of 16 allies to
takes its support to 260. This leaves it short of a majority by 13 seats but
it is supported by some members of the split Janata Dal and others.
This will enable Mr Rao to face parliament in its budget session on Monday
with more confidence than before the Punjab election. Dr Manmohan Singh, his
minister of finance, is expected to present an austere budget on February
29.
Mr Rao's economic reforms and liberalisation programme have been severely
criticised by his opponents in other parties and from within Congress.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE attractions of the Shanghai Vacuum Electron Device Company may not be
readily apparent from its name, but the company opened a new chapter in
China's financial history yesterday when shares owned by foreigners began
trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
For the first time since the communists took power in 1949, foreigners have
been permitted to trade freely in a publicly quoted Chinese asset. The
company is also the first Chinese state-owned company to admit foreign
owners.
If Shanghai Vacuum's first day of trading is anything to go by, then China's
fledgling experiment with elements of capitalism, known as 'socialism with
Chinese characteristics', got off to a good start. The company's share price
rose 26 per cent from its issue price of Dollars 70 to close at Dollars
88.50 a share, on a turnover of 3,430 shares.
Shanghai Vacuum is one of China's leading manufacturers of television tubes
(both black and white, and colour) and electron guns. It is also the pride
of Shanghai and, by virtue of city government regulation, holds a virtual
monopoly for what it manufactures.
Three weeks ago, a group of foreign merchant banks, led by SBCI Asia
Finance, placed 1m 'B' shares in the company with international investors.
The placement, which was four times oversubscribed, raised Dollars 78m which
the company plans to use to increase its output of colour TV tubes. The
shares were due to start trading on Thursday but the Shanghai authorities
requested a day's delay because February 20 was not deemed auspicious.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN money supply growth accelerated again last month under the influence
of continued heavy demand for credit, the Bundesbank reported yesterday.
January's 9 per cent annualised increase in M3 followed a 5.8 per cent jump
in December. M3 is the broad money supply measure comprising cash, current
and savings accounts, sight deposits and time deposits of up to four years.
Private sector borrowing in January was DM4.6bn (Pounds 1.6bn), compared
with DM300m in month last year.
Although the result was more or less in line with unofficial forecasts, it
was still far above the Bundesbank's target range for M3 growth this year of
between 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent.
The figures added further weight to the bank's insistence that its tight
controls, especially high interest rates, must be maintained in the
interests of monetary stability and reducing inflation.
The Bundesbank claimed yesterday, however, that the January surge was
subject to special factors and stemmed in part from increased demand for
credit in December spilling over into last month.
The money supply increase for January was stated as a comparison with the
final quarter of 1991, when M3 growth was speeding up, while the December
figure related to the more stable situation during the last three months of
1990.
Conditions in the wages market, another area of prime concern to the
Bundesbank's policy-makers, remained tense yesterday.
Banks throughout the country were hit by selective strikes among workers
still pursuing a 10.5 per cent pay claim even though employers earlier this
week imposed a 5 per cent award. Textile unions, due to start pay talks on
March 17, approved a 9.5 per cent demand on behalf of the industry's 700,000
workforce.
The government, meanwhile, maintained the deadlock in talks with public
service workers.
Federal, state and local authority employers refused for the second time to
make a counter-offer to the union's claim for a 9.5 per cent wage increase
plus DM550 more holiday pay, a package estimated to be worth 11 per cent.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister and the government's main
representative in the negotiations, said the discrepancy between the demand
and resources available was so great that the employers were unable to make
an offer. He had brought 'plenty of time' with him to the negotiating table,
he said.
The 1991 public service pay contract expired at the end of December.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM seems poised to emerge from 13 weeks of political deadlock over
forming a coalition government.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the senior Flemish politician exploring the coalition
possibilities, has suggested that Christian Democrats and socialists from
both sides of the French-Flemish language divide should form a 'limited
government', with half the usual number of ministers.
Since November's inconclusive election, Belgium has been governed by a
caretaker administration under Mr Wilfried Martens, the long-serving prime
minister. Successive politicians have failed to form a new coalition.
Mr Dehaene's plan has a better chance of success because the Flemish
Christian Democrats have finally agreed to drop their demand for a coalition
with the liberal parties. 'It's the beginning of the end of the crisis,'
said a spokeswoman for Mr Dehaene last night.
If the Belgian king agrees with Mr Dehaene's plan, he will decide who should
form and lead a new government.
The government is expected to try to cut the country's large budget deficit
and push through constitutional changes.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is facing the danger of a united German political
establishment opposed to its demands for a substantial increase in funding
for the European Community budget.
Outright opposition from Germany, which is the effective paymaster of the EC
as by far its largest net contributor, would be likely to undermine the
entire budget strategy of Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, who
is looking for large-scale new funds to help the poorer member states join
the eventual European economic and monetary union (Emu).
The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) yesterday called on the German
government to reject any move to raise the ceiling on EC budget spending
above the present level of 1.2 per cent of gross national product. They said
any such move was unacceptable above all in Germany, which had already
reached 'financial breaking point.'
Within hours, the move brought a response from Mr Helmut Kohl's own
Christian Democrats (CDU), saying the opposition was pushing on an open
door. Mr Hans Peter Schmidtz, a deputy leader of the CDU group in the German
parliament, said it was 'self-evident that the burden on Germany should not
increase.'
It now looks inevitable that the budget debate for the EC will become
inextricably linked with the difficult debate in Germany over the
ratification of the Maastricht treaties on political as well as economic
union, presenting the Kohl government with an acute EC headache both with
its supporters and the opposition.
The SPD case against a budget increase was presented yesterday by Mrs Ingrid
Mattaus-Maier, a deputy parliamentary leader and finance spokesman. She
attacked above all the European Commission's proposal to increase the
absolute level of spending on agriculture, in spite of its hopes to reform
the policy and cut production of food mountains.
She said that according to the Commission forecasts, Germany's payments to
the EC budget would increase by 50 per cent, from DM40bn to more than DM60bn
by 1997, a period in which the German government budget was limited to an
increase of just 13 per cent.
She said that the SPD had no intention of linking the budget issue to
ratification of the Maastricht treaties, for which SPD support is needed for
a two-thirds majority in the parliament. But government officials fear that
is exactly what will happen.
The Maastricht treaty process is already complicated by the demands of the
16 German federal states to play a much greater role in EC decision-making
wherever their interests are involved. Ratification in Germany is likely to
take all year.
On top of that, the government itself is divided on the reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy, with half urging more radical moves to enable a deal in
the world trade liberalisation talks, and half seeking to protect Germany's
small farmers.

THE Irish Workers' Party is expected to split today over deep ideological

Mr Proinsias de Rossa, the party leader, has threatened to resign today if
hardliners led by Mr Sean Garland, a former general secretary, do not quit.
He said he would set up a new 'democratic and socialist' party which would
seek to replace Ireland's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland 'with an
aspiration for unity of people, rather than states'.
Mr de Rossa will be joined by five other MPs, leaving the Worker's Party

The Worker's Party split from Sinn Fein in the early 70s to pursue
parliamentary politics rather than armed struggle.

Dunton Group, the USM-quoted building and property concern, cut its pre-tax
loss from Pounds 2.71m to Pounds 252,000 in the six months ended November 30
1991.
At the operating level it was in the black but, while the recession
remained, was unlikely to return to overall profitability in the short term.
(Pounds 1.78m), the operating profit came to Pounds 454,000 (loss Pounds
2.23m).

FT  22 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Former Soviet republics to join IMF by summer
</HEADLINE>

Correction (published 25th February 1992) appended to this article.
RUSSIA and other former Soviet republics are expected to get the go-ahead
shortly for admission to the International Monetary Fund, with the prospect
of joining by early summer. Only Uzbekistan may temporarily be excluded due
to technical problems over its application.
Russia is expected to be given a 2.5 per cent quota of what is expected to
be an increased IMF capital, according to diplomats. This would place it on
a par with the Netherlands in joint ninth place in the IMF after the US,
Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Canada.
Apart from opening the door to badly needed assistance for its switch from
communism to capitalism, admission of the former Soviet Union to the Fund
will formally end seven decades of economic isolation.
Russia is expected to be given a 3.5bn quota of Special Drawing Rights
(SDRs) which will entitle it to around Dollars 20bn in balance of payments
and other IMF assistance over four years, as well as encouraging alternative
sources of public and private finance.
But the IMF is only expected to be ready to disburse funds from the third
quarter of this year, after elaboration of a binding programme of economic
reforms and its approval by the Fund. A draft programme, which is being
prepared by Russia jointly with the IMF, is expected to be finalised by the
end of March.
Other republics less advanced on the path of market reform are likely to
qualify for IMF funds later.
The combined quota of the 15 republics is expected to amount to 4.5 per cent
of the Fund's capital and will be divided on a similar basis to the formula
used by eight of the republics to share out the former Soviet Union's assets
and liabilities.
The decision to grant full membership to the independent states, agreed in
principle at the Garden City, New York meeting of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations last month, is expected to be discussed by the IMF
executive board next month and then at the annual meeting of the IMF interim
committeeon April 27.
An IMF spokesman in Washington said yesterday he hoped that all the other
steps necessary for the former Soviet republics to join the IMF could be
completed by early summer.
A stabilisation fund for the rouble, which will be available as early as
this summer, is being put together separately by western countries. But they
have made granting of Russia's request for Dollars 5bn conditional on its
admission to the IMF.
The Russian ministry of Economics and Finance has been split, with Mr Egor
Gaidar remaining in charge of the economics ministry and Mr Andrei Nechaev
in charge of the finance ministry.
Correction (published 25th February 1992).
Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, has become finance
minister, and Mr Andrei Nechayev has become economics minister, not the
other way round as reported in Saturday's FT.

FT  21 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo and Shell dominate equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGHLY erratic trend in the UK stock market yesterday saw share prices
close firmly but well below the day's best levels, finally responding to a
strong opening to the new Wall Street session.
Trading was dominated by profits statements from Glaxo and Royal
Dutch/Shell, as both heavyweight stocks exerted a powerful influence on the
FT-SE Index, attracting buyers as well as the sellers who drove their
respective share prices lower. With BP still the subject of heavy turnover,
the big investment institutions clearly had a very busy trading session.
Domestic factors continued to have a somewhat mixed influence on the stock
market. The announcement of a 0.3 per cent fall in UK gross domestic product
in the fourth quarter confirmed the bleakness of the UK recession. But hints
from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, of Budget tax moves and increased
government borrowing encouraged City optimism for base rate cuts ahead of
the UK general election.
Wall Street's strength provided a welcome surprise, in view of bearish
comments on the US trade figures for December. UK markets remained nervous
of the outlook for equities in New York and in Tokyo.
London opened strongly, in hot pursuit of the other European stock markets,
which took a favourable view of firmer performances from Wall Street and
Tokyo. However, there was little genuine investment support for a UK market
waiting for trading statements from Glaxo and Shell.
An early gain of 18 points on the Footsie was quickly reversed as Glaxo fell
sharply in spite of higher interim profits. Investors were upset by signs of
poor sales growth for Zantac, the group's high-selling ulcer drug. However,
Glaxo shares rallied well when Wall Street opened and US buyers appeared in
London.
There was little recovery in Shell Transport, which gave ground in
exceptionally high turnover after announcing sharply lower profits for the
final quarter and severely disappointing the market with the dividend
payout.
The FT-SE Index, down 5.5 at midsession, rallied as Wall Street opened. With
the Dow ahead by 36 points in London trading hours, the Footsie closed a net
6.7 up at 2,543.4.
At one time, losses in Shell and Glaxo share prices represented a fall of
around 12 points on the Footsie index. The setback in Shell was offset to
some extent by heavy switching from Royal Dutch shares.
Leading oils have been sold heavily in London over the past week as first BP
and then Shell have disappointed the market. With both stocks prominent in
international fund portfolios, some fund managers are believed to have
suffered substantial losses.
Seaq volume rose to 593.6m shares from Wednesday's 561.3m. Yesterday's total
was boosted by the activity in Glaxo and Shell, both of which are likely to
have contributed significantly to the day's retail, or customer, business in
UK equities.
On Wednesday, customer business moved up to Pounds 1bn once again,
indicating a more profitable level for London securities firms than in the
previous week.
Equity strategists were concerned yesterday that London owed so much of its
recovery to a US stock market still viewed with caution by London traders.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRIGHT start to the stock index futures was soon reversed by disappointing
corporate results and volatile trading, write Christopher Price and Joel
Kibazo.
The March contract opened strongly at 2,564 on the back of a firm Wall
Street overnight and improved performance by Tokyo; by 9am it had moved
swiftly to its high point of the day of 2,572. However, figures from Shell
Transport knocked March sharply, and it reached a low point for the day of
2,545 by 11am.
Positive sentiment from the other European bourses began to rub off on the
London market after midday and the FT-SE futures commenced a slow recovery.
In spite of a lacklustre start, Wall Street picked up and March followed
suit, ending the day at 2,564, up 14 on the previous session and some 11
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Turnover
reached 6,422 contracts.
In the LTOM, traders reported a 'directionless' session with turnover coming
to 23,112 contracts. The FT-SE Index option traded 6,624 lots. Glaxo was the
busiest stock option on 4,330 contracts dealt, with the March 600 calls the
most active series. This was followed by BTR with a day's total of 2,678
lots.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROUT of the oil sector, triggered by sliding oil prices, and helped on
its way by BP's poor results last week, continued yesterday following
acutely disappointing results from Royal Dutch/Shell.
Shell Transport shares weakened 15 to 440p, the lowest closing level since
February 1991, on turnover of 31m shares, the highest daily total for more
than five years.
Profits were at the bottom end of the market's expectations but it was the
dividend decision that prompted the sell-off. The final dividend of 12p
exceeded some of the most pessimistic forecasts but was below the general
consensus of 12.2p to 12.4p.
Analysts moved quickly to reduce their dividend expectations for the current
year. Mr Jeremy Hudson at Shearson Lehman shaded his forecast to 21.9p but
pointed out that he saw only 5 per cent downside in Shell Transport shares
from here. At Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, Mr Keith Morris, one of the more bearish
analysts on Shell ahead of the figures, saw the results as 'disappointing
but not catastrophic' and pencilled in a 21.7p dividend forecast for this
year, describing the shares as a sell.
Strauss Turnbull, among the market's most vociferous bears of oils over the
past year, predicted a dividend of 21.6p for the year and said: 'The signal
from Shell is quite clear; the outlook is poor and getting poorer, we see
the stock yielding 40 per cent more than the market, and that points to a
share price of 400p.'
An oil specialist commented: 'Fund managers are now reducing their
weightings in oils to neutral and that means there is some more big selling
to come.'
The big selling of Shell yesterday was accompanied by aggressive switching
out of Royal Dutch into Shell and further exceptionally heavy activity in
BP. The BP share price stabilised to close 3 firmer at 254p on volume of
23m. Turnover in BP since last Thursday week's figures is just short of 200m
shares.
Glaxo volatile
Half-year results from Glaxo yesterday prompted significant volatility in
the stock, which saw more than 15m shares dealt in one of its heaviest daily
volumes for at least five years.
Just after the market opened, Glaxo shares were up strongly. They firmed
further on the announcement of a 41 per cent rise in the dividend. However,
the gain was reversed on further consideration of the results, particularly
disappointment over sales growth for Zantac, the company's anti-ulcer drug.
The shares tumbled almost 60 points from the day's high before they were
considered to be oversold.
In the afternoon, light US buying lent support to the stock and the shares
picked up slowly to close only 10 off on the day at 816p.
The profit figures appeared to fit in with the views of most financial
observers. Cautious houses such as Nomura retained their sell stance,
regarding the results as 'a bad day for Glaxo'. Bullish BZW remained a
buyer, believing the declining sales growth for Zantac had been adequately
justified by the company.
Expectations for 1992/1993 now vary between Pounds 1.55bn and Pounds 1.77bn
as observers take varying views on the speed of development of Glaxo's three
principal new products, Zofran (the most well-established), Serevent and
Imigran.
Rank sold
Leisure group Rank Organisation dropped 22 to 681p as investors turned
bearish ahead of the stock going ex-dividend on Monday. There was also
renewed interest in Rank's accounts, published this week, with the group
coming under scrutiny at the first of a series of analysts' meetings
yesterday.
Rank has surged ahead since its results three weeks ago and many in the
market feel the run had been overdone. Mr Paul Heath at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
said: 'There has been some profit-taking on fears that a lot of people may
pull out of Rank after banking the dividend next week.'
Banque Paribas, the French-owned broking house, drew attention to Rank's
accounts, analyst Mr Nigel Reed pointing to 'the size of the release of the
provision on the Mecca acquisition', of some Pounds 48m
Reports that James Capel had joined County NatWest in recommending a switch
out of Rank and into Ladbroke were denied by Capel. Ladbroke was steady at
231p.
More big buying of TSB drove the shares higher to 126 1/2 p, while vague
takeover stories and a broker buy note helped Standard Chartered improve 13
more to 449p.
Lloyds, due to reveal preliminary figures today - the market range is from
Pounds 550m to Pounds 700m compared with last time's Pounds 591m - hardened
to 387p. It is expected to be the only bank in the so-called 'big four',
comprising Barclays, Lloyds, Midland and NatWest, to lift its dividend.
Provident Financial advanced 17 to 487p after the better than expected
dividend.
The rights issue announced by Germany's Allianz triggered a fresh bout of
takeover speculation in Guardian Royal Exchange, up 3 at 123p.
There was evidence of more selling and splitting of the Electricity Package,
although the unit price moved up 20 to Pounds 2,815.
Enthusiasm from securities house Smith New Court helped Rothmans
International to pick up 23 to 1081p. The house reiterated its long-term buy
recommendation, citing Rothmans' net cash position, its medium-term
opportunities in the Pacific Rim and eastern Europe and its attractive
assets in Dunhill and Cartier.
Reuters Holdings gained 13 to 1150p as US buyers absorbed selling in London
and securities house Henderson Crosthwaite continued to argue the case for
Reuters with clients. The house published a buy note this week which points
out that the stock is on a low cash flow multiple and argues that Reuters'
automated trading system Dealing 2000-2 is well ahead of rival products.
Racal Electronics attracted speculative buying, amid revived stories that
Tomkins, the conglomerate, may be about to make either a full bid for the
electronics group or buy Racal's Chubb division. There has been intense
speculation for a number of weeks, and suggestions that a stake-builder has
been operating in Racal, which firmed 2 1/2 to 57p on turnover of 7.2m
yesterday.
Headline Book Publishing, floated on the stock market last April, moved
ahead 12 to 174p after revealing more than doubled profits of Pounds 1.3m.
Reports from a conference in Florida that Philip Morris repeated its aim of
making acquisitions in Europe renewed bid speculation in Cadbury Schweppes,
which put on 3 to 469p.
Tate &amp; Lyle rose 7 to 430p, boosted by dollar strength and a buy
recommendation from Warburg Securities. The broker expects the shares to
outperform the market over the next year on above average dividend growth of
12 per cent and the potential approval of a new product, Sucralose.
Unilever gained 8 to 955p ahead of next week's results. The company's
proposed sale of its low-margin agribusiness provided support.
In the food retailing sector, Albert Fisher gave up 3 1/2 to 63 1/2 p
following the overnight sale of 1.5m shares at 63p.
Heavy activity continued in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which firmed a penny to 16p
with almost 19m shares dealt and US investors said to be keen. Dealers said
the interest had been sparked by a press report highlighting an upturn in
advertising spending in the States.
A positive statement from Yorkshire Chemicals and a one-for-one scrip issue
prompted the tightly-traded shares to jump 36 to 644p.
P &amp; O shrugged off recent gloom and improved 10 to 402p, with Panmure
Gordon, a broker to the company, reported to be among the day's leading
buyers.
US demand lifted British Airways 8 to 267p. Lehman Brothers has placed the
stock on its international buy list. Turnover reached 7.4m.
Profit-taking, along with a calmer view of Wednesday's results, left British
Aerospace 3 lighter at 300p as turnover reached 5.3m.

FT  21 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Cyclicals feature as Dow
surges to set record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER losses earlier in the week, US stock markets rebounded strongly
yesterday. The Dow blue chip indicator reached an all-time high in the wake
of heavy demand for selected industrials, cyclicals and a range of stocks
hard hit by recent declines, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 50.32 at a record
3,280.64, just past its previous historical peak of 3,276.83 recorded on
February 12.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 forged ahead 5.64 to 413.90, while the Nasdaq
composite index of over-the-counter stocks, which had fallen 14 points in
the previous two days, rallied 9.82 to 632.23. Turnover on the New York SE
was a heavy 270.6m shares and rises led falls by 1,157 to 571.
The buying was not triggered by any particular news, rather by a feeling
among some investors that recent selling - some of it in reaction to
President Bush's electoral troubles - had been overdone. Market analysts
reported that computer buy programs had played an important part in leading
the rally.
Among individual stocks, those which had suffered from profit-taking in
recent sessions put in some of the best performances. Merck rose Dollars 3
1/8 to Dollars 147 1/4 , International Paper Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 77 3/4
, McDonald's Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 42 1/8 and United Technologies Dollars
2 to Dollars 52.
Airline issues were also in demand. UAL climbed Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 155
1/2 , AMR (parent group of American Airlines) Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 78
3/8 and Delta Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 72 1/8 .
Other transport and freight stocks joined in the rally, with Federal Express
jumping Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 53 3/8 and CSX ending Dollars 1 3/4 higher
at Dollars 60 1/2 .
Procter &amp; Gamble put on Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 100 5/8 after Kidder
Peabody, the broking house, singled the stock out as its technical buy of
the week.
Selected bank stocks also benefited from sustained buying, JP Morgan gaining
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 60 5/8 , Bankers Trust Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 and
Chemical Dollars 1 to Dollars 32 1/2 .
On the over-the-counter market, the rally was inspired by a surge in demand
for computer technology, healthcare and biotechnology stocks. Leading the
way were Microsoft, up Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 117 1/2 , Apple, Dollars 2
5/8 ahead at Dollars 64 5/8 , and Medical Care International, Dollars 2 3/4
stronger at Dollars 70.
Invacare advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 after the home healthcare
and medical equipment group reported fourth-quarter net income of 34 cents a
share, up from 28 cents a share at the same stage a year ago.
Canada
Toronto stocks failed to be buoyed by the Wall Street strength and ended
narrowly mixed after heavy trading. An analyst said there is a wait-and-see
attitude in the market, with some investors looking towards today's Canada
consumer price index for January.
The composite index edged down 6.3 to close at 3,537.0, but rising issues
held a small lead over declines of 306 to 291. Volume came to 33m shares.
BC Sugar 'A' plunged CDollars 2 1/4 to CDollars 10 3/4 . The group reduced
its quarterly dividend rate to 10 cents from 20 cents following
disappointing first-quarter earnings.
Petro-Canada lost CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 10 1/8 . The company reported a
fourth-quarter loss of CDollars 364m, after a CDollars 369m restructuring
provision, compared with earnings of CDollars 98m a year earlier.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Profit-takers depress dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar came off its highs yesterday, pushed down by profit-taking late
in the afternoon, writes Peggy Hollinger.
Traders said a large selling order from a south-east Asian bank had been
responsible for the dollar's dip. In New York, rumours that the Bundesbank
and Federal Reserve were checking prices helped to push it lower in US
trading.
Traders said the US currency may have entered a phase of consolidation after
the heady rises of recent days. In fact, said Mr David Cocker of Chemical
Bank, the dollar had dipped almost to the level where, 'if it had gone lower
we would have started to see more aggressive selling'.
There appeared to be a growing sense of nervousness about the dollar's
strength, although there still appeared to be significant underlying demand.
Some economists suggested the US currency's strength was premature. 'We are
still likely to see further evidence of the weakness of the US economy,'
said Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International.
His comments were reinforced by worse than expected US data. The US December
trade deficit came to Dollars 5.94bn, compared with forecasts of Dollars
4.9bn, while the weekly jobless figure rose by 18,000 - some 12,000 more
than expected. The dollar largely ignored the numbers, however, and was
trading above DM1.65 for a good part of the day. The US unit closed
unchanged in London at DM1.6470. In New York it ended at DM1.6443.
Two tranches of overnight intervention from the Bank of Japan failed to
deter the dollar's early strength. The dollar ended near its highs against
the yen at Y128.55. The Bank of Japan had intervened at Y128.23 and Y127.75.
In New York it closed at Y128.60.
Mr Cocker said the market had been too aware of the Bank of Japan's actions,
too far in advance for the intervention to have any effect. 'If the market
knows the Bank of Japan will be there, it won't turn the yen around,' he
said.
The D-Mark weakened against the Japanese currency from DM1.2808 to DM 1.2844
per 100 yen. The Bundesbank made it clear, yet again, after the conclusion
of its council meeting that it had no intention of changing monetary policy.
The D-Mark hit a five-month low against the French franc, falling below
FFr3.40. It recovered to close at FFr3.4015. The franc was initially boosted
by comments from finance minister Pierre Beregovoy, although enthusiasm was
dampened by speculation of an imminent rate cut in France.
The Dutch took advantage of the weaker D-Mark to cut the special advances
money market rate from 9.4 per cent to 9.3 per cent. The guilder slipped to
112.5100/75 as a result.
Sterling fell below its effective exchange rate mechanism floor - which was
DM2.8853 last night - and closed at DM2.8825. Traders said the pound had
taken little notice of GDP statistics showing that the UK economy, excluding
oil, had shrunk for the sixth consecutive quarter.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES AT the short end of the money markets stayed high for most of the day,
as traders settled down to the idea of a hold on UK interest rates until
March.
Some dealers suggested the Bank of England had this week deliberately traded
in a manner designed to cool speculation over rates. 'It has operated in a
steady, non-hystrionic fashion,' said one senior dealer. 'It has been doing
its best to maintain the status quo in the markets, and I think it has
succeeded.'
There was little paper on offer to ease the money rates, as the Bank stayed
out of the market until noon. The forecast shortage was lower than expected
at Pounds 750m.
The shortfall was mainly comprised of treasury bills and maturing
assistance. Exchequer transactions provided liquidity of about Pounds 590m.
The Bank of England purchased band one and two bank bills totalling just
Pounds 21m at rates of 10 3/8 per cent before lunch.
Rates were somewhat easier when the Bank stepped in with help amounting to
Pounds 529m in band one treasury and bank bills, and band two bank paper,
all at 10 3/8 per cent. However, it took late assistance of Pounds 240m to
bring the overnight rate - which had been trading at more than 11 per cent
during the day - down by a significant amount. Overnight money closed at 10
3/8 - 1/4 per cent, thus promising an easier day tomorrow.
The one week rate, which edged as high as 10- 9/16 per cent during the day,
closed at 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent. The key three months interbank rate, which
shadows base rates, was steady at 10 1/4 - 3/16 per cent.
In the futures market, the March short sterling contract was looking for a
cut in rates next month, as it closed at 89.87. This implies an interest
rate of 10.13 per cent, lower than in recent days.
Call rates in Germany eased from 9.55/65 to 9.50/60 per cent, as payments of
government notes and a cash injection through a repurchase agreement boosted
liquidity. About DM6bn was expected to enter the banking system yesterday
through principal and interest payments on the government notes.
In the US, the funds rate was trading at 4 1/16 per cent, compared with the
perceived target of 4 per cent. The Federal Reserve added liquidity through
a Dollars 1.5bn customer repurchase agreement.

A SOUND system which upstages today's two-speaker stereo sound by giving the
impression that music is coming from all around has long been promised. Now
Perfect Pitch of London has developed a system called Om which, it believes,
will bring such an effect within the price range of smaller recording
studios.
The home stereo user will not need to buy extra equipment. Instead, a devise
in the studio, incorporated at the mixing stage, filters the sound by
reflecting it off an electronic circuit.
This fools the ear of the listener, when playing the music at home, into
thinking that the sound is emerging from in front, behind and from each side
 -rather than from the two speakers.
The Perfect Pitch equipment to achieve these psycho-acoustic effects is
available from Select Systems of Hanworth, Middlesex, for Pounds 3,500.

HOW do you cram more data on your optical disc? The answer could be a
technique developed by Toshiba in Japan which, the company says, will more
than double the data recording density of today's optical disc-based
recording systems.
Using a visible red laser diode, made from indium gallium aluminium
phosphide (InGaAlP), researchers have managed to squeeze 72 megabytes of
data - enough to record about 14m words - on to one square inch of disc
space.
The laser operates at the relatively short wavelength of 690 nanometres,
producing a smaller beam size which enables data to be recorded at a higher
density.

British Gas, together with Landis &amp; Gyr Energy Management, of Telford, has
developed a smart card system, called Quantum, which is now on trial and
looks set to replace the coin meter.
To use the system the gas consumer takes a gas card to a newsagent or
convenience store where the shopkeeper credits gas on to the card through a
counter-top charging unit - a minimum of Pounds 1 or a maximum of Pounds 9
can be put on the card. Information from the newsagent is collected by the
British Gas regional accounting centre over the phone network on a daily
basis.
By inserting the card in the 'slot', the user can see the amount of gas
credited on a liquid crystal display incorporated into the unit. As gas is
used, the amount credited drops.

THE neem tree, a native of India and Burma and a cousin to the mahogany,
could provide third world countries with products from pesticides to
contraceptives, as well as providing the means to reforestation in the
tropics.
According to a report from the National Research Council in Washington, the
drought-tolerant tree has internal chemical defences which protect it from
leaf-chewing insects - about 200 species as well as mites, fungi and
bacteria. But it is non-toxic to humans and other animals.
Combined with its antiseptic and antifungal activities, this makes the neem
tree ideal for products such as pesticides as well as toothbrushes, soap and
oils, says the report, Neem: A Tree for Solving Global Problems.
Because the oil of the neem is a strong spermicide, it could also be used in
contraceptives.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Technology: Faster than a speeding chip - The race to build
more powerful computers at cheaper prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new generation of microprocessors that promises to improve the speed and
performance of computers was unveiled in San Francisco this week.
Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems each described
'superscalar' devices upon which they will base their future products. These
super chips will be the engines of tomorrow's computers and will determine
the fortunes of some of the world's leading computer companies.
Used alone, they will power workstations that bring the performance of a
supercomputer to the desktop. Banded into groups for 'multiprocessor'
systems they will be used to create machines that will usurp traditional
minicomputer, mainframe and supercomputer designs by reducing the cost of
computer power.
Traditionally, the announcement of new semiconductor designs has signalled
the direction of computer products two or three years in advance. However,
the new microprocessors unveiled this week will be incorporated in computers
scheduled for shipment to customers later this year.
The front runner in the superscalar speed race is Digital. Its 'Alpha' chip
can achieve a theoretical peak performance of 400m instructions per second
(mips). Typical performance in a computer system is expected to be 150 mips.
The speed advantage of superscalar microprocessors comes from their ability
to process more than one instruction simultaneously. Traditional
microprocessors carry out one calculation at a time.
The pace at which new instructions are fed to the microprocessor is also
much higher. Digital's Alpha chip, for example, operates at a 200 MHz clock
rate, several times faster than the microprocessors used in today's personal
computers and workstations.
For Digital, the Alpha chip represents the culmination of a four-year effort
to create a computer architecture that will enable the company to reclaim
technology leadership. 'Alpha is the core technology for the company's
future,' says Peter Graham, project manager.
Alpha will drive a new family of products ranging from workstations to
mainframe computers which Digital plans to announce soon, with shipments to
begin before the end of the year. Alpha systems will be about three times
faster than equivalent systems in its Vax product line. Digital is engaged
in talks with Microsoft about putting 'Windows NT' software on Alpha
systems. Unlike other microprocessors, Alpha is designed to run any
operating system, including new ones that may emerge towards the end of the
decade, Digital says.
With the launch of the Alpha chip Digital is also adopting new business
strategies. In a break from past practice, the company will license the
design to chip makers for sale to other computer companies. It will license
Alpha software and if required provide support services to companies
designing Alpha-based systems.
Already, Cray Research, the leading supercomputer manufacturer, has said
that it will use the Alpha chip to build a 'massively parallel'
supercomputer - which will process thousands of instructions simultaneously.
Next week, Digital is expected to announce another licensing arrangement
with a computer company that will build Alpha computers.
While Digital's Alpha chip is a new computer architecture, HP has applied
superscalar techniques to accelerate the performance of the PA-Risc
microprocessor design that it uses in workstations and multiprocessor
minicomputers.
The HP chip will boost computer system performance by more than 50 per cent,
the company claims. HP has working prototypes of computers based upon the
chip in its development facilities and plans to introduce them before the
end of the year.
HP's plans include a desktop workstation with a performance rating of more
than 100mips. That is four to five times faster than current products from
competitors.
HP maintains that its superscalar version of PA-Risc will enable the company
to maintain its lead in system performance, despite Digital's claims for its
new Alpha chip. 'We deliver the powerful systems today that other companies
are now just talking about building some time in the future,' says Willem
Roelandts, vice president and general manager of HP's networked systems
group. 'Producing a fast chip is only the first step'.
For Sun Microsystems, however, applying superscalar technology to its
existing Sparc microprocessor has proven to be a challenge. Unlike Digital
and HP, Sun does not have in-house semiconductor manufacturing facilities.
Sun has been working with Texas Instruments to implement the superscalar
version of its Sparc Risc microprocessor. The SuperSparc represents a
critical development for Sun, which is trailing competitors HP and IBM in
terms of workstation performance.
The performance of Sun's SuperSparc is expected to be about 85 mips, well
below that of Digital's and HP's new devices. It may also, however, be
cheaper to produce.
Despite its slower speed, the new Sparc chip is ensured a leading role among
this new generation of microprocessors. Sun, ICL and other Sun partners have
announced plans to market computers based upon the SuperSparc chip this
year.
IBM is already one lap ahead in the microprocessor speed race with its
'Power' microprocessor architecture, used in the RS/6000 range of
workstations. IBM is now believed to be developing several versions of the
'Power' chip including low-cost models for use in PCs and high-performance
versions that will continue its challenge in the workstation market.
Nor can Intel, the microprocessor market leader, be counted out of the race.
The chip maker is preparing to launch a version of its 'x86' microprocessor
family later this year based upon a superscalar design with performance of
close to 100 mips.
While the microprocessor chips described this week by US companies are
destined to become the powerhorses of the computer industry, two of Japan's
electronics giants, Hitachi and Fujitsu, provided a glimpse of the types of
microprocessor chips that can be expected in the next century.
Hitachi described an experimental microprocessor that is capable of
processing 1,000 mips. Fujitsu unveiled what it calls a 'single chip
supercomputer'. The Fujitsu device is designed to work next to a standard
microprocessor acting as an accelerator to enable even a standard PC to
achieve supercomputer processing speed. Add-on circuit boards containing the
chip will be on the market by the end of the year, according to the company.
The impact of this new generation of chips upon the cost of computer power
will be striking. 'The trend is really frightening,' declares Roelandts.
'Before long you will be able to buy desktop supercomputers for Dollars
10,000.' Today, supercomputers sell for millions of dollars.
The speed of superscalar microprocessors also raises the question of what
computer users will do with so much computing power. 'These devices will
bring speech processing, image processing and artificial intelligence
applications within the reach of most computer users,' Roelandts predicts.
He also suggests that with faster response times computers will raise office
productivity by eliminating the delays that interrupt workers.
While computer users will look forward to cheaper, more powerful machines,
the price/performance trend threatens to undermine the economies of the
industry which is struggling to find cheaper ways to deliver more powerful
computers at decreasing profit margins. By the end of the decade only three
or four microprocessor architectures are expected to survive as
industry-standard devices. The rest may prove to be expensive losers.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Record year yields to change
of sentiment - Why enthusiasm for Canadian bond offerings is waning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST as Canadian and foreign securities dealers are rushing to capitalise on
last year's surge of interest in Canadian bonds, investors' enthusiasm for
these securities shows signs of waning.
Foreigners poured a record CDollars 27.3bn into bonds issued by Canadian
borrowers in either the domestic or international markets in the first 11
months of last year, more than double the inflow for the whole of 1990.
However, a weakening Canadian dollar, narrower spreads between North
American and European interest rates, and Canada's political uncertainties
have lately raised doubts about the wisdom of further beefing up Canadian
bond portfolios.
ScotiaMcLeod of Toronto notes in its latest bond market letter that US and
German institutions, which made up close to half of last year's buying,
'have begun to lighten their exposure'.
New issues in the domestic and EuroCanadian markets have virtually dried up
over the past month as borrowers wait for stability to return to the
Canadian dollar and the bond market. One Toronto bond analyst predicts that
'Canadian entities will not achieve the same volumes, spreads or amounts in
the Euromarket this year that they did in 1991'.
They are expected to rely heavily in coming months on global offerings and
foreign-currency issues, which can then be swapped into Canadian dollars.
The impact of investors' loss of appetite for Canadian issues is likely to
hit some borrowers harder than others. Thanks to , and CDollars 800m in
'pre-borrowings' completed last year, Ontario Hydro has already raised about
half of its 1992 requirements of CDollars 4.6bn. The province of Ontario,
which raised CDollars 6bn outside Canada last year, appears to face a
stiffer challenge. With a spiralling budget deficit, the total amount of
foreign borrowing is unlikely to be less than last year.
The province's credit rating is expected to be lowered after the 1992-1993
budget is presented this spring. Treasury officials acknowledge that the
proportion of foreign funding is bound to drop from the unusually high 70
per cent reached in 1991.
Despite the recent setbacks, last year's huge inflows have fuelled
unprecedented foreign interest in the Canadian market. The Canadian
government bond market is now the world's seventh biggest, with a market
value of close to CDollars 160bn.
The cumulative return on federal government bonds included in Goldman Sachs'
new Canadian government bond index was an annualised 15.8 per cent (measured
in US dollars) between January 1988 and December 1991, including a 22 per
cent return last year. By contrast, the return on Goldman's US Treasury
market portfolio was an annualised 11.3 per cent over the past four years.
Some institutions still hold as much as 40 per cent of their portfolios in
Canadian bonds. Mr Steve McGirr, vice-president for government finance at
Wood Gundy in Toronto, estimates that the firm's economists now spend about
half their time with European and Japanese investors with Canadian bond
portfolios.
Wood Gundy has set up a desk in its London office to trade domestic Canadian
issues, and has also started selling Canadian mortgage- and asset-backed
securities in London.
Another sign of the broadening investor base is an unaccustomed degree of
competition among providers of bond indices. The Canadian bond-index market
has long been the preserve of ScotiaMcLeod, which compiles more than a dozen
different indices to help portfolio managers assess the performance of their
holdings.
But Scotia's heels are now being nipped by Burns Fry of Toronto and, most
recently, by Goldman Sachs. Burns Fry began compiling a family of Canadian
bond indices in 1990. Goldman launched its government bond index last month
to supplement similar services on the US, German and Japanese markets.
Prior to the present lull, interest was especially strong in bonds issued by
the provinces. Yields on provincial issues are typically 40 to 60 basis
points higher than those on federal government bonds. The yield on
ScotiaMcLeod's portfolio of provincial issues was 23.4 per cent last year,
compared with 21.3 per cent on its Universe Canada index.
Provincial yields are somewhat lower than those of the two big power utility
borrowers, Ontario Hydro and Hydro-Quebec. For instance, 10-year British
Columbia bonds currently yield 8.92 per cent, against 9.13 per cent on a
comparable Ontario Hydro issue.
The outlook for Canadian issues should become clearer over the next few
months. The federal government is due to present its budget within four
weeks, to be followed in April and May by budgets for most of the 10
provinces.
Those crossing fingers for a renewed burst of interest are pinning their
hopes on the release of January's consumer price index figures on February
21. The figures, the first without the one-time impact of the 7 per cent
goods and services tax imposed in January 1991, are expected to show a
slowing of the inflation rate, perhaps to an annualised rate of less than 2
per cent.
If the Bank of Canada sticks to its anti-inflation guns, confidence in the
Canadian dollar and expectations of a further drop in interest rates could
be revived.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Chrysler's debt outlook now
'stable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit rating agency, yesterday gave Chrysler, the
financially-stretched US automotive manufacturer, a boost by changing its
rating outlook from 'negative' to 'stable'.
The move follows a year of downgradings of Chrysler's debt by the credit
agencies. Chrysler currently ranks below investment grade.
Standard &amp; Poor's said it had made the change because of Chrysler's recent
issue of up to Dollars 850m of new convertible preferred stock in a private
sale to investors. The agency said this materially improved the company's
near-term financial flexibility.
The proceeds of the issue, together with Chrysler's existing cash position,
saleable assets, and access to bank credit, meant 'financial flexibility
should be adequate at least for the next one to two years'.
However, it added that negative cash-flow this year, due to persisting weak
car markets, would leave Chrysler ill-prepared to meet future challenges.
'The ratings,' it said, 'still reflect concerns about Chrysler's long-term
staying power.'
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the 'Big Three' US auto manufacturers,
have formed a partnership to carry out research on the recycling of car
parts.
About 75 per cent of a car consists of metal, which is usually recycled. The
study will examine recycling the remaining 25 per cent, made of materials
such as plastic, rubber and glass.
'Through the partnership, we hope to avoid duplication of effort and
expense, while enhancing scientific knowledge,' said a spokesman for the
team.

speculative trading

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices eased at the short end but held their ground at the long
end yesterday in a quiet session dominated by speculative trading.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 101,
yielding 7.905 per cent. The two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 1/4 , to
yield 5.267 per cent.
Prices had been lower across the board in early trading, a reaction to
reports that an influential newsletter had suggested that Federal Reserve
officials now believe the economy is growing faster than expected.
The market recovered some of the losses later, although it was unclear
whether news of an 18,000 rise in weekly jobless claims sparked the rebound.
The day's other economic news, the posting of a Dollars 45.94bn merchandise
trade deficit in December, was generally ignored by market players.
In the credit markets, the Fed arranged Dollars 1.5bn in customer repurchase
agreements in an attempt to push the Fed funds rate nearer its target of 4
per cent. By late afternoon, Fed funds had eased from 4 1/8 to 4 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds ended higher after the release of favourable money
supply data raised hopes of a cut in interest rates.
Money supply grew at a record low rate of 1.8 per cent in January from a
year earlier, compared with a rate of 2.0 per cent in December and 2.4 per
cent in November. The slower growth rate raised hopes of an easing in
monetary policy.
Prices climbed in the afternoon after the release of the money supply data,
but slipped taking and as the yen weakened against the US dollar. The Bank
of Japan sold dollars for yen after the US currency strengthened to 128.25
yen. However, despite repeated intervention by the central bank, the dollar
ended the day at Y128.60.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue ended at 5.37 per cent, having
opened at 5.41.
BELGIAN government bond prices closed higher on the day, helped by a
successful auction of the new 15-year bond issue.
The Treasury sold a total of BFr38.66bn of 15-year bonds at an average
weighted price of 98.335, yielding 8.69 per cent. After the auction, the
price of the 15-year bond rose as investors switched out of 15-year Dutch
government paper into the 15-year Belgian issue.
The combination of profit-taking and switching into Belgian stock pushed
Dutch government bond prices slightly lower. The Dutch central bank lowered
its special advance rate yesterday but the cut, from 9.4 per cent to 9.3 per
cent, had little impact on the bond market.
Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds traded in a narrow range as the
market awaited the release of the January money supply figure. The Liffe
bund futures contract moved from its opening of 87.78 to 87.86, helped by a
rise in the US Treasury bond market, but drifted back to close at 87.71.
Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, was reported as saying that an
inflation rate of around 4 per cent was unsatisfactory, adding that there
was no hope of an easing in monetary policy in the near future.
UK government bonds traded in a narrow range, ending slightly stronger due
to the firmer US Treasury market.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.23 and climbed to 98.00 before
closing at 97.27 on below-average volume. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt
opened at 116 3/16 , unchanged on Wednesday's close, and traded up to 116
3/8 to yield 9.32 per cent.

Dollars 32m

<TEXT>
NAVISTAR, the leading North American manufacturer of medium and heavy
trucks, yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 32m and said
it also expected to be in the red in the second quarter.
The group, which has been hit hard by weak demand for trucks due to the US
recession, said its loss worked through at 16 cents a share.
This compared with a net loss of Dollars 38m, or 18 cents a share, in the
first quarter of last year. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 902m, up 7
per cent.
Truck shipments totalled 17,100 units, up 3 per cent, mainly because of
higher shipments of school-bus chassis to customers who normally took
delivery later in the year.
Shipments of medium-range diesel engines to original equipment manufacturers
increased 11 per cent, reflecting higher retail demand for diesel powered
trucks and vans.
Navistar said it had increased its share of the North American retail market
for medium and heavy trucks to 28.1 per cent, from 26.5 per cent in the
first quarter of last year.
The industry sales of medium and heavy trucks fell 9 per cent from a year
earlier to 52,800 units.
Mr James Cotting, chairman, said Navistar's margins had improved slightly
from the 1991 first quarter because of the additional sales volume and the
impact of a cost reduction programme.
He expected a moderate strengthening of the US economy as the year
progressed, but at current demand levels expected a second-quarter loss.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Harley-Davidson, the only US motorcycle manufacturer, soared
yesterday after the company turned in a 22 per cent increase in
fourth-quarter sales.
Although Harley's fourth-quarter operating profits slid 2 per cent to
Dollars 13m from Dollars 13.2m in 1990, lower interest and other expenses
helped the company's underlying pre-tax earnings soar 289 per cent to
Dollars 10.7m from Dollars 3.7m.
Net income in the 1991 fourth quarter was Dollars 7.3m, or 41 cents a share,
on sales of Dollars 237.7m, against earnings of Dollars 3.9m, or 22 cents,
on sales of Dollars 194.3m a year earlier. Motorcycle and related product
sales surged 29 per cent in the 1991 quarter.
On Wall Street, Harley's stock added Dollars 5 1/4 to close at Dollars 53
1/2 .
Harley, the sole survivor of the 143 US companies which once made
motorcycles, has overcome Japanese competition to regain the top spot in the
big motorcycle market. It now commands about 61 per cent of the 850cc class.
Harley shipped 68,626 motorcycles in 1991, up 10 per cent from 1990, with
most of the growth coming in the fourth quarter when they climbed 31 per
cent to 18,839.
For the whole of 1991, operating profits fell 18 per cent to Dollars 68.6m
from Dollars 83.4m, while earnings before tax and extraordinary items slowed
to Dollars 58.1m from Dollars 62.6m.
Net income for the year was Dollars 37m, or Dollars 2.08, against Dollars
37.8m, or Dollars 2.12. Sales grew 9 per cent to Dollars 939.9m from Dollars
864.6m.
Mr Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, was disappointed by
Harley's flat underlying fourth-quarter earnings on strong sales, but he
remained bullish about Harley's prospects. 'What other consumer durable
company is making money and apologising to dealers for not being able to
meet demand?' he said.
In the 1991 quarter, Holiday Rambler sales rose 19 per cent to Dollars 51m.
The improvement, however, was led by lower margin vehicles and the business
suffered a greater operating loss of Dollars 6.9m, against Dollars 1.9m in
the 1990 quarter.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sheraton to lease hotels from
rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHERATON, the hotels subsidiary of US conglomerate ITT, is to buy or lease
eight hotels from Marriott Corporation, a rival American lodging chain, in a
deal worth about Dollars 160m which will give Sheraton a presence in Paris.
Sheraton is purchasing the Prince de Galles, a 170-room hotel in central
Paris, as well as buying five and leasing two all-suite hotels in the US.
The US acquisitions will triple its presence in the growing suites market.
The deal is a further significant expansion for Sheraton, which, backed by
ITT's strong balance sheet, has spent some Dollars 1bn over the past few
years on renovating and acquiring properties in the US.
Mr Robert Bowman, executive vice-president of the chain, hinted yesterday
that the deal could be the forerunner of other international acquisitions.
'Current market conditions,' he said, 'will allow the company to pursue
further expansion possibilities throughout our worldwide network.'
For highly-indebted Marriott, the deal represents an opportunity to reduce
its borrowings. Last December, Marriott said it planned to raise about
Dollars 220m within 60 days through a variety of trans actions.
Caesars World, the US gaming and hotels group, attributed improved
second-quarter results to increased casino revenue from all three of the
company's casino/hotels, AP-DJ reports .
Net income in the quarter jumped to Dollars 23.1m from Dollars 4m last time
on revenues which rose to Dollars 253.5m from Dollars 208m last time.

<TEXT>
TRANSAMERICA, the San Francisco-based financial services group which holds a
25 per cent stake in Britain's Sedgwick Group, yesterday reported an
after-tax loss of Dollars 77.5m in the final three months of 1991 - compared
with Dollars 28.7m profit a year earlier.
The company blamed the loss on its commercial lending division, where it
took a previously-announced special charge. This reflected 'the decision to
substantially reduce lending to certain industries and to aggressively
liquidate receivables from previously sold businesses'.
Commercial lending contributed a Dollars 154m operating loss for the
three-month period.
Both life insurance and property-casualty operations produced improved
figures, and insurance interests overall made a Dollars 60.7m operating
profit, against Dollars 56.3m in the fourth quarter of 1990.
Consumer lending profits nudged up from Dollars 24.7m to Dollars 25.2m, but
leasing slumped from Dollars 19m to Dollars 15.5m.
For 1991 overall, net profits were Dollars 50.1m, down sharply from 1990's
Dollars 266.3m.
The loss from commercial lending, at the operating level, was Dollars 217m.
However, the company said it expected Transamerica Commercial Finance
Company to be profitable in 1992, and for the group overall to achieve 'a
strong consolidated earnings performance.'
Transamerica shares eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 .

GILLETTE, the US shaving products company, yesterday unveiled a strong
profits growth for 1991, with the after-tax figure increasing to Dollars
409.4m from Dollars 310.6m and earnings per share rising to Dollars 1.94
from Dollars 1.60.
In the fourth quarter, profits after tax were up at Dollars 113.1m from
Dollars 92.2m. Sales in the period were Dollars 1.34bn against Dollars
1.24bn, and for the full year, Dollars 4.68bn against Dollars 4.34bn.
Gillette said progress was broadly based, both in terms of product and
regional area. However, while sales and operating profits from the
international businesses were described as increasing 'substantially,' the
North Atlantic interests saw moderate sales growth with 'good progress' in
operating profits.
The company's shares eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 48 1/2 on the news.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NICHOLAS J. Nicholas, president and co-chief executive of Time-Warner,
surprised Wall Street last night by resigning from the media company because
of policy differences with its management and board. He will be succeeded by
Mr Gerald Levin, the group's chief operating officer.
The shake-up is the latest in a series of controversies at the
highly-indebted company ever since the 1989 merger between Warner
Communications, the entertainment group headed by Mr Steven Ross, and Time
Inc, the blue-chip publishing group.
Mr Nicholas, 52, who was viewed as a potential successor to Mr Ross, Time
Warner's chairman, gave no details of his differences with the management.
He said merely that 'for a company to fulfil its potential requires a clear
strategic focus shared totally by its leadership.'
There was sufficient difference between himself and the management and board
that his resignation should 'enable a single and consistent view to
prevail.'
Mr Nicholas was the most senior manager at Time Warner to have risen on the
Time side of the business. He was a key player in the negotiation of the
merger with Warner, alongside Mr Richard Munro, the then chairman of Time.
Mr Levin, 52, also rose through the ranks at Time, where he was closely
involved in the development of its Home Box Office cable television movie
channel.
Time Warner has been a subject of controversy since the merger. Critics say
it has yet to prove that such a global entertainment conglomerate makes
strategic sense.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Preview of the Results Season: Cash flow statements should
be of help in diagnosing the health of a company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE USEFUL new feature of many companies' accounts this reporting season
will be a cash flow statement designed to shed light on their financial
strength.
The old source and application of funds statement, introduced in 1975, was
often criticised for its obscurity. The complexity of the new cash flow
statement has already caused analysts to scratch their heads. It is
certainly not a statement for the amateur investor.
Some companies - including Hanson, Bass and Carlton Communications - have
already produced the statement, introduced by the new Accounting Standards
Board as its first financial reporting standard last year. It becomes
compulsory for all medium and large companies with year ends after March 23
1992.
The majority of the information that the cash flow statement contains could
be gleaned from the old source and application statement and notes to the
accounts - for those with a calculator and incredible persistence.
The new statement makes some figures much easier to obtain, and reveals
others which were not always provided in the past. It will also make far
easier comparisons between companies, and with those in the US, which use a
similar cash flow format.
Overall, the statement shows the patterns of cash generation and
consumption. It indicates how tax, dividends and new investment are paid for
 -from operations or through new capital raised.
Through a note to the accounts, it also reveals figures - which are not
reconciled in the statement - under the heading 'analysis of changes in
financing during the period', which show any debt acquired from
acquisitions, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
One example of the new format comes from the most recent annual report of Wm
Low, the Scottish supermarket group which issued a profits warning last
week.
It would be difficult to have predicted its current problems from the cash
flow statement, but it does give insights into last year's operations.
For the year to September 7 1991 the company had a net cash inflow from
operating activities (shown under this heading in the accompanying
illustrated statement) of Pounds 27.8m. Note 24 to the accounts breaks the
figure down further, showing that operating profit (as shown on the profit
and loss account) was Pounds 22.3m.
The note shows net changes in stocks, debtors and creditors - the working
capital of the business - are just Pounds 48,000. The small proportion of
working capital to operating profit is typical of a cash-generative business
like a retailer.
The note also shows a contribution from provisions of Pounds 374,000. These
were made in the previous year for reorganisation and have been written
back, boosting operating profit beyond the figure derived from normal
activities - a number to watch to see the underlying profit of the business.
Wm Low had returns on investments and servicing of finance consuming net
cash of Pounds 7.1m, in which dividend and interest payments of Pounds 9m
easily offset interest received of Pounds 2.1m. The interest received has
increased sharply from Pounds 215,000 in 1990. But the profit and loss
account shows interest payments of only Pounds 556,000 for 1991.
The difference is explained by a large increase in the amount of interest
which has been capitalised.
Adding the taxation charges of Pounds 8.9m shown on the cash flow statement
to the returns on investments and servicing and the inflows from operating
activities, Wm Low had net 'revenue' cash inflows totalling Pounds 11.8m.
Companies with net revenue cash outflows are not necessarily unhealthy. They
may be investing heavily with the expectation of increases in sales the
following year, for example. But the figure does give some indication of how
and whether a business is able to service its outgoings.
Adding back the dividend payments and dividing the sum by the number of
shares would give a revenue cash inflow per share, which could be usefully
compared with earnings per share. Other simple ratios show how far dividends
or interest payable are covered by cash.
Under investing activities, Wm Low spent Pounds 41.2m buying tangible fixed
assets. This represents its ambitious and continuing programme of expansion
of supermarkets during the year.
This expansion programme has more than consumed the cash generated from a
rights issue in December 1990, which is shown under the financing section.
The issue of new shares raised Pounds 38.5m, although the expenses paid to
generate the money cost just over Pounds 1m.
Given a recent statement by the chairman that he intends to continue
expanding space with further large expenditures in the future, Wm Low will
clearly needs to turn to new sources of cash soon.
Analysis of the cash flow statement is certainly still not simple. Mr Clive
Goodhead, project director for the cash flow statement at the Accounting
Standards Board, frowns on the demand from users of accounts for a single
key number or ratio which can provide all the answers on the health of a
company. 'To get sensible information you have to spend a lot of time
looking at accounts,' he says.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: France Telecom poised to join BT's global
alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE TELECOM seems close to winning its campaign to join Syncordia,
British Telecommunications' global alliance.
The UK group was originally against the French state-owned company becoming
a partner in the venture. It wanted only to do a deal with Germany's
Deutsche Telekom and Japan's Nippon Telephone and Telegraph.
However, following persistent lobbying through both political and commercial
channels, France Telecom has succeeded in winning the principle that it can
be admitted. The exact terms of its involvement remain to be finalised.
Syncordia, based in Atlanta, Georgia, aims to provide multinational
companies with comprehensive communications services.
It is part of a trend whereby telecommunications monopolies are trying to
compete in foreign markets and provide global services.
The industry has been in a frenzy of match-making as companies manoeuvre to
form alliances with the most attractive partners.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, has been trying to attract Deutsche Telekom
and NTT into the venture for over a year but has run into a series of
obstacles. In particular, France Telecom has put pressure on the German
company with which it has close ties, not to join unless it is also
admitted.
A compromise has now been reached under which the German company is expected
to sell on part of the stake it buys from BT to the French company. BT
itself is dealing directly with Deutsche Telekom rather than the French
concern.
The size of the stakes and the number of directors each company would be
able to appoint are still unresolved. BT originally wanted 48 per cent with
the German and Japanese groups each receiving 26 per cent, but they were
unhappy with the junior status this implied.
Marketing procedures, such as whether shareholders will compete with each
other in signing up customers, have yet to be determined. Such arrangements
will need to be carefully drafted if they are not to fall foul of the
European Commission's competition regulations.
Meanwhile, NTT has to receive permission from its government to take part.
BT said there seemed to be a willingness from the German side to reach
agreement.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Maxwells reassured trustee over pension
loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Ian reassured one of Mirror Group
Pension Fund's managers, apparently worried about loans of stock without
collateral, that there was nothing improper going on barely three months
before the fund was placed in administration.
Minutes of the fund show that on September 2 1991, the Maxwells convened a
meeting of trustees consisting only of themselves and Mr Trevor Cook, the
fund's manager. At the time, the fund had 10 trustees, but had given the
authority to Robert Maxwell to make decisions if a quorum were not present.
At the meeting, they drafted a letter to Mr James Scrymgeour-Wedderburn of
Invesco MIM, reassuring him of the propriety of the fund's stock lending
activities.
The Maxwells said Invesco MIM should comply with instructions from
Bishopsgate Investment Management which managed the bulk of the fund's
assets and added that they believed stock lending to be a proper activity
for the fund. They noted that Invesco MIM was given no collateral against
the shares and reassured the fund manager that stock certificates would be
returned shortly.
On November 20, the trustees were called together to be told that funds
managed by BIM for the fund and 'held on deposit by the Robert Maxwell Group
could not be repaid.' On December 3, the company publicly announced it had
called auditors into the funds.
Meanwhile, the minutes of the fund meetings are striking for their absence
of detail. Beginning in 1988, there is no record of debate among trustees of
items on the agenda, except to record that discussions of benefits took
place. Minutes of decisions of the investments committee apparently do not
exist and there is no reference to questions raised by trustees about the
propriety of investing in several Maxwell-related companies and properties.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals' Pounds 11m pleases
City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Yorkshire Chemicals, the dyes and specialist chemicals group, rose
34p to a record 644p yesterday after the company announced a rise in profits
and said sales in 1991 ended 'very strongly'.
Pre-tax profits improved to Pounds 11m (Pounds 10.8m), at the top end of
City forecasts, on turnover of Pounds 92.8m (Pounds 81.6m).
Mr Phillip Lowe, chair-man and managing director, said: 'We've come through
two years of very difficult trading conditions, and we are confident we will
improve in fundamentals again this year.'
Yorkshire Colours, the largest division, reported a slight fall in operating
profits to Pounds 8.3m as capacity constraints affected margins. Yorkshire
Americas was affected by recession in the US and by expansion costs.
But Yorkshire Specialty Products and Yorkshire Australia both increased
turnover and operating profits, partly due to acquisitions.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 1.1m, reflecting borrow-ings taken on
to fund an expansion programme. Gearing, based on net borrowings of about
Pounds 2m, remained under 5 per cent.
Earnings per share improved to 40.1p (37.8p). A recommended final dividend
of 9.75p makes a total for the year of 14.5p (13p). A 1-for-1 scrip issue is
also proposed.
COMMENT
The market's enthusiasm for Yorkshire's results was more a response to
despondency with the rest of the sector. While the outlook for chemical
groups remains gloomy, Yorkshire is being rewarded for maintaining sales in
niche markets. Whether the shares can go much higher at this stage is more
difficult, especially given their almost vertical ascent since late 1990.
Analysts' upgraded forecasts for 1992 of Pounds 12m-Pounds 12.5m put the
shares on a prospective multiple of 14 which may not be excessive. But
capacity constraints at Yorkshire Colours will remain a problem for most of
this year. New facilities will not be commissioned until the second half and
will not come fully into play before 1993, presumably in time for a cyclical
upturn. Exchange rates are the other intangible, especially for a company
which now derives 92 per cent of sales outside the UK. The risks have
decreased since sterling's entry into the ERM, but more than 40 per cent of
sales are sensitive to the dollar, either directly through the US or
indirectly through Asia. After Yorkshire's Pounds 1m loss on exchange
movements in 1990, investors need to be be sure movements this time are more
friendly.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Royal Dutch/Shell profits depressed by fall
in oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Dutch/Shell Group's earnings from exploration and production were
depressed by the decline in the oil price last year.
For the full year profits from exploration and production fell by Pounds
384m to Pounds 1.44bn.
The company said it expected its oil production to continue to rise this
year, following last year's increase of 10 per cent. Growth areas were cited
as the UK, Gabon, Syria, Malaysia and Colombia.
Gas production rose last year by 8 per cent to 6.56bn cu ft a day. The group
expects sales to increase this year in the UK, Denmark, Malaysia and
Australia.
Royal Dutch/Shell experienced a record year in its refining and marketing
operations where replacement cost profits rose by more than 40 per cent to
Pounds 1.62bn from Pounds 1.15bn.
Oil product sales increased by 2 per cent over the year and the amount of
oil refined rose by 5 per cent to 3.6m barrels a day (b/d) - the highest for
more than a decade.
Sir Peter Holmes, Shell's chairman, said this year's outlook for the
refining business continues to be good since capacity in the Far East market
remained tight. But analysts doubt that 1991's performance can be repeated
without the special circumstances of the Gulf war, which caused a large jump
in refining margins.
The results were hit by the drop in the contribution from its chemicals
division, where profits slipped to Pounds 23m for the year from Pounds 519m
in 1990, while the group's coal operations incurred a loss of Pounds 33m.
Earnings per share for the year dropped from 39.6p to 24.9p.
The group's capital expenditure rose to Pounds 6.5bn, up from Pounds 5.9bn
in 1990, and Sir Peter said the company would spend another Pounds 6.5bn
this year.
The fourth quarter showed a sharp drop in group income on a replacement cost
basis from Pounds 963m to Pounds 492m following a decline in the oil price
and a loss in the chemicals business.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Nestle ponders bid for Exor as Perrier battle heightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group, may consider mounting a counter bid to the
Agnelli family's FFr5.6bn (Pounds 570m) offer for Exor, the controlling
shareholder in Perrier, the French mineral water company for which Nestle is
in the throes of a FFr13.4bn hostile bid.
Mr Reto Domeniconi, director-general of Nestle, said in Paris yesterday that
his company had considered the feasibility of bidding for Exor, which
controls 35 per cent of Perrier. Any bid would be made together with Banque
Indosuez, the French bank, its partner in the bid for Perrier.
'The price offered by the Agnellis for Exor is relatively low and there is
clearly room for another bid,' he said. 'So far we have decided against a
counter-bid. But we cannot exclude the possibility in the future.'
The fight for Perrier, a bitter battle involving some of the best-known
names in Europe's industrial establishment, has moved into the legal arena
while the protagonists await the conclusion of two French court cases which
will be critical in determining the outcome of Nestle's bid.
The commercial court at Nimes in southern France has since Tuesday been
considering Nestle's appeal to freeze the voting rights on the Perrier
shares held by Exor and Societe Generale, the French bank. Next Tuesday the
Paris commercial court will begin a second case in which Nestle is trying to
annul the recent acquisition of 13.8 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, the
French sugar company allied to the Agnellis.
Unless Nestle wins at least one case, its hopes of seizing control of
Perrier seem slight, given that the Agnelli/Exor camp controls nearly 49 per
cent of the voting stock.
Mr Domeniconi said Nestle was prepared to negotiate an amicable settlement
over Perrier. He said he believed the Agnellis would be willing to
negotiate, but that the boards of Perrier and Exor, both chaired by Mr
Jacques Vincent, were not.
Legally, Nestle would have to negotiate a settlement with the Perrier or
Exor boards. Yesterday the Perrier board issued a formal statement rejecting
the Swiss group's offer. All the directors voted for rejection apart from Mr
Philippe Jaffre, president of Credit Agricole, the French bank that owns 2.5
per cent of Perrier, which has already announced its support for Nestle.

pension fund assets held by Bishopsgate Investment Management, from which
the late Mr Robert Maxwell took money in an effort to save his crumbling
business empire.
Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with Robson Rhodes, who was appointed provisional
liquidator to BIM by the courts in December, said yesterday in his first
public statement since starting the investigation, that he had traced all
but Pounds 2m of the pension fund assets.
He estimated that Mr Maxwell transferred Pounds 217m from BIM to third
parties, in transactions including security against loans made by banks to
his companies. Any attempts to recover these assets over the coming months
are likely to involve a flurry of legal actions.
A further Pounds 239m was liquidated by Mr Maxwell and the balance
transferred to other companies in his group.
Any cash remaining from these transfers is now controlled by the
administrators and receivers of the businesses and Mr Cooper said it is
probably 'irrecoverable'.
He believes the value of the assets managed by BIM would now total about
Pounds 695m. The figure is lower than some previous estimates because it has
been revalued in the past few days to reflect current market values.
Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell private companies' pension fund
members association, said: 'It's good news to realise that something is
happening, but there is still a massive black hole. There may well be some
people who never receive their pensions.'
Some Pounds 111m of the safeguarded assets belong to the Common Investment
Fund, which contained the assets of six pension funds of Maxwell companies
and should have totalled Pounds 411m.
The remaining Pounds 126m recovered belonged to pension funds in their own
names. However, Mr Cooper refused to state how the assets recovered divided
between the different pension funds.
Mr Cooper said he had informed the independent trustees of these figures.
Over the past few weeks Mr Cooper has interviewed Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian
Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg. He will interview other former directors
and senior employees of BIM over the coming months.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Glaxo rises 14% to Pounds 709m at interim: Pharmaceuticals
group announces 41% dividend increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, yesterday announced a 14 per
cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 623m to Pounds 709m and a
41 per cent dividend increase.
Sales exceeded analysts' expectations as they increased 24 per cent from
Pounds 1.59bn to Pounds 1.97bn. At constant exchange rates, sales rose 18
per cent.
Dr Ernest Mario, Glaxo's deputy chairman, said only 1 per cent of the growth
in turnover was generated by price increases. This meant increasing pressure
from governments worldwide to reduce pharmaceutical prices was irrelevant
for the company, he explained.
Sales of Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug and the world's best-selling
pharmaceutical, grew only 6 per cent at constant exchange rates.
Dr Mario explained US sales had been affected by providing discounts worth
Dollars 55m (Pounds 31.5m) to Medicaid during the first half of the year.
During the second half of this year, it will offer discounts worth about
Dollars 60m, but this will not have a great effect on the results as Glaxo
had given about Dollars 50m worth over the same period last year, explained
Dr Mario.
Zantac sales in Italy had been affected by wholesalers running down their
stocks before a 2 per cent reduction in price at the beginning of the year.
Analysts said Zantac sales should pick up over the second half of the year,
but in the longer term revenues from the drug were likely to slow.
Sales of Glaxo's new generation drugs accounted for 8 per cent of the
group's revenues. These included Zofran, the anti-emesis drug which had
sales of Pounds 120m and which the company expects to generate at least
Pounds 250m by the year end; Imigran, a new migraine drug which generated
sales of Pounds 13m; and Serevent, an asthma drug with sales of Pounds 9m.
Revenues from Serevent had been held up by worries about the drug's safety.
Mr Ian White, pharmaceuticals analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'There's
not really enough evidence to be really confident that the new potential
blockbuster drugs will provide the necessary revenue streams to take over
from Zantac when its patents expire.
'We should know whether there is another drug on the scale of Zantac within
the next 12 months.'
Earnings per share increased 14 per cent from 14.6p to 16.7p.
The board recommended a dividend of 6p (4.25p). Dr Mario said the dividend
increase had been motivated by a desire to ensure the gap between the final
and interim dividends was not too large.
Glaxo's shares closed down 10p at 816p.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Toshiba warns of 58% fall in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOSHIBA yesterday became the latest Japanese electronics company to issue a
sharply lower profits forecast for the current year ending next month, in
response to the worsening market for semiconductors, computers and
communication equipment.
Toshiba said consolidated pre-tax profits would be Y110bn (Pounds 489.9m),
58 per cent below last year, and 44 per cent below a forecast three months
ago. Toshiba shares closed down Y27 at Y596 in Tokyo yesterday.
Toshiba has suffered from falling semiconductor prices, especially of the 4
megabyte D-Ram chip, and competition in laptop computers in Japan and the
US.
The company last week announced 150 redundancies at its Irvine, California,
computer assembly plant and is abandoning the lower end of the US personal
computer market, where it says it cannot offer competitively priced
products.
In Japan, Toshiba has lost market share to NEC and to Apple Computer, whose
sales have been growing strongly.
The Toshiba board is expected to cut capital spending next year by between
20 per cent and 30 per cent. Capital spending this year is budgeted at
Y250bn. Company officials are also deciding whether to cut the research and
development budget, which they have avoided in the past. Toshiba is expected
to spend Y280bn in the current year on R&amp;D.
The company admitted that it had expanded into too many areas in the past
decade and said it would attempt to concentrate capital spending and
research in strategically important sectors. A cost-cutting programme
introduced last April has been strengthened.
The company continues to be supported by demand for heavy electrical
apparatus and home appliances. More than half Toshiba's sales, however, are
in computers, telecommunications and electronic devices. Consolidated sales
at the company were expected to rise 3 per cent to Y4,820bn, while after-tax
income was forecast to fall 67 per cent to Y40bn.
NEC and Fujitsu last week revised profits forecasts downward. Sony, the
consumer electronics and entertainment group, said on Wednesday its parent
corporation would post a full-year loss for the first time since it was
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Shell fails to cheer City with pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Dutch/Shell group, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, disappointed the City
yesterday when it increased its dividend by 4 per cent to 20.9p from 20.1p,
just below the rate of inflation, after reporting a slight drop in profits
for last year.
The company's shares lost 15p to 440p as many traders compared the increase
with British Petroleum's move to raise its dividend 4.7 per cent, given
Shell's stronger cash position.
Sir Peter Holmes, Shell's chairman said: 'Inevitably, if times are hard, the
dividend may be shaved a bit, but our long-term objective is to keep up with
inflation in real terms.' He stressed that the company's dividend had grown
in real terms by 75 per cent over the last 10 years.
Shell reported a 4 per cent drop in its profit for 1991 to Pounds 2.89bn on
a replacement cost basis which strips out the effects of stockholding gains
and losses. On an historical cost basis, profit dropped by 33 per cent to
Pounds 2.4bn reflecting the fact that 1990 results were buoyed by stock
gains.
Sir Peter said 1991 had been a 'mediocre' year with a 'disappointing' fourth
quarter. But he said he was not pessimistic for this year as he believed
measures taken at Shell Oil, the company's US subsidiary, should lead to a
gradual improvement in North American results. In addition, 'chemicals have
probably started to bottom out and should start to improve this year'.
Sir Peter said he thought oil prices would remain in the range of Dollars 15
to Dollars 22 a barrel for the rest of the year. The company's investments
had all been tested against a 'challengingly low' oil price, he said.
Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst at Hoare Govett was sanguine about Shell's
prospects in spite of downgrading his profit forecast for this year to
Pounds 2.45bn from Pounds 2.6bn on the basis of last year's results.
'Shell has kept its balance sheet intact and gives the impression of a
company that is growing - on the operational side - through the recession,'
he said.
The company's refining and marketing division showed record profits after
extremely high refining margins during the Gulf war lifted income for the
full year. At the same time, crude oil production increased by 10 per cent
to 2.1m barrels a day for the full year.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Scottish businesses deliver double blow to Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party's hopes of securing the backing of Scottish
businesses for the preservation of the constitutional status quo in Scotland
suffered a double blow yesterday.
The Confederation of British Industry in Scotland said it now accepted that
constitutional change was inevitable and that 'the present mechanisms of
government could be improved'. But it said the alternatives on offer from
the opposition would be bad for the Scottish economy and challenged all
parties to offer better proposals.
Earlier, a cross-party group of businessmen heading medium-sized companies
launched an organisation named Business Says Yes - to constitutional change.
They said many business people were 'eagerly awaiting the establishment of
Scotland's own government' and believed it would be good for business.
Leading Scottish financial institutions on Wednesday expressed strong
misgivings about the possible effects on their business of a devolved
Scottish parliament of the kind proposed by Labour and the Liberal
Democrats. According to a trade association survey most believed it would
damage the financial sector.
The acknowledgment by the CBI in Scotland that the constitutional status quo
was no longer tenable came only 10 months after a survey showed that
three-quarters of its members were opposed to any form of Scottish assembly,
with more than half favouring no change.
Mr Alasdair MacCallum, chairman of the CBI in Scotland, said that its main
objection was to the proposal by Labour that a devolved Scottish parliament
could impose higher income tax in Scot-land than in the rest of the UK.
But independence, proposed by the Scottish National party, was the most
dangerous option of all, he said.
In Edinburgh, Mr Tom McGregor, chairman of Business Says Yes, said a
Scottish parliament would be responsive to the needs of Scottish business.
It would end the over-taxation of Scottish business caused by the fact that
business rates in Scotland are 40 per cent higher than in England.
It believes the business community would be represented in a Scottish
parliament in a way that it is not through the Conservative party, which it
sees as unpopular and out of touch in Scotland.
In the Commons yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, accused the
Scottish National party of 'profoundly misleading' the Scottish people in
its campaign to end the 1707 union,
He insisted: 'The union between England and Scotland is greater than the sum
of its parts and always has been.'

FT  21 FEB 92 / Banks look at central register for shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CENTRALISED institution to handle share registration, which could reduce
costs for listed companies and make private share ownership simpler, is
being considered by the UK's clearing banks.
If adopted, records of most shareholdings in British companies would be held
centrally by a new, jointly owned company. Co-operation on the project would
save the banks from investing separately in their own technology.
Otherwise, according to National Westminster, which is promoting the idea,
the banks face having to spend between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m each in
preparation for Taurus, the Stock Exchange's paperless settlement system,
due to be launched in April 1993.
The proposal was floated at a meeting of banks at the Stock Exchange
yesterday, chaired by Mr Peter Rawlins, the exchange's chief executive.
Banks at the meeting have until Monday to decide whether to take part in a
Pounds 250,000 study into the project's feasibility by consultants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte.
For listed companies, a central utility could reduce the costs of
maintaining shareholder records once Taurus is launched, though the scale of
savings has yet to be assessed.
The utility would act as a 'company account controller' under the Taurus
system, holding details of most private investor shareholdings.
Institutional investors and some private shareholders are expected to hold
their shares in separate accounts once Taurus comes into operation.
Holding shares in this way would simplify individual share ownership.
Investors with several shareholdings would need to communicate with only one
company.
Once Taurus is launched, investors would receive one consolidated statement
showing details of all their shareholdings, and would have only one Taurus
code number.
While details of shareholdings would be held centrally, banks would continue
to provide separately the more profitable registration services, such as
shareholder analyses.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UN urges Israelis to end incursion: Bloody clashes in
southern Lebanon prompt appeal by secretary-general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE secretary-general of the United Nations yesterday called on Israel to
withdraw its forces immediately from the zone policed by UN peacekeeping
forces in southern Lebanon.
The plea from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali came hours after Israeli armour
pushed aside UN peacekeepers and fought bloody battles to occupy strategic
hilltops beyond Israel's 'security zone' in Lebanon in a widening effort to
wipe out Shia Moslem forces.
The UN said Mr Boutros Ghali viewed the incursion with 'grave concern'. In
Washington, the US State Department said it was worried by the 'renewed
cycle of violence in southern Lebanon' and said it had sent urgent
diplomatic messages to Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
About 350 Israeli soldiers, backed by 17 tanks, bulldozers and helicopter
gunships, seized the villages of Yater and Kafra in southern Lebanon where
they blew up buildings and searched for rockets.
Israeli leaders said the action was intended to stop Hizbollah firing its
Katyusha rockets at Israel and its security zone. Guerrillas in southern
Lebanon began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the
assassination by Israeli forces on Sunday of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, leader of
Hizbollah (Party of God). Military officials said about 100 rockets had been
launched by yesterday evening.
In their thrust to reach guerrilla forces, Israeli troops yesterday broke
through barriers manned by soldiers of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon
(Unifil).
Unifil troops from Ireland, Finland, Fiji and Nepal erected a roadblock and
grappled with Israeli soldiers in an attempt to halt the advance. But
Israeli bulldozers and tanks smashed a path through.
Two Israeli soldiers were killed in fighting, the fifth successive day of
clashes between the two sides. Seven Lebanese militiamen and at least two
civilians also died. Four UN soldiers from Fiji and a number of militiamen
and Israelis were wounded.
In Washington, Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokesman, said:
'We have made high-level demarches to those involved to urge the exercise of
maximum restraint in order to bring the violence to an end. We have made
those demarches to Israeli officials, Syrian officials and Lebanese
officials.'
Ms Tutwiler said the US had received assurances from all parties that they
would arrive for a scheduled third round of Middle East peace talks due to
open in Washington on Monday, in spite of the armoured Israeli thrust.
At the UN, Mr Boutros Ghali ordered an official to summon Israel's UN
ambassador to receive a protest note.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, said the troops would remain
in their new positions for only a limited time.
Israel launched a full-scale invasion of Lebanon in 1982 designed to wipe
out Palestine Liberation Organisation guerrillas who had attacked Israel
from Lebanese territory for several years. Since the army withdrew to the
present security zone in 1985, ground forces have occasionally struck north
against specific targets, but usually withdrawn in hours.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Porsche runs full-speed into management crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORSCHE, the German sports car manufacturer struggling to prop up sales and
preserve its exclusive image, last night appeared to be heading for a
management crisis with its most senior figures undecided about who should be
at the wheel.
Dr Arno Bohn, chief executive of the Stuttgart company's management board,
effectively threatened to resign next Friday unless he is given a vote of
confidence by the supervisory board.
His ultimatum followed a board meeting yesterday which failed to muster the
two-thirds majority needed to endorse the extension of his contract beyond
the end of this year.
The supervisory board met as it became clear that Dr Wolfgang Reitzle,
research and development director of executive carmaker BMW - and heir
apparent to BMW's 63-year-old management board chairman, Dr Eberhard von
Kunheim - had decided not to accept an offer, believed to have come from Dr
Ferdinand Porsche, chairman of the Porsche supervisory board, to take over
from Dr Bohn.
Dr Reitzle is understood to have been offered both a generous salary and a
personal shareholding of up to 5 per cent in Porsche, in exchange for
steering the car maker through a maze of troubles.
Some 4,000 Porsche workers are being put on short time after a slump in 1991
worldwide sales to 26,200 vehicles - down 4,000 on 1990, and little more
than half the 50,000 sold in Porsche's peak year of 1986. Dr Bohn has
already warned that sales will drop further to about 25,000 in 1991-92.
Most ominously, sales in the US - the world's most important prestige car
market - plunged below 5,000 last year, only one-sixth the level of the
mid-1980s.
At the same time Porsche has encountered mounting criticism for failing to
invest adequate finance and other resources in new model ranges, despite
reaping big profits from the 1980s boom and the ever more obvious challenge
to its position which is posed by Japanese manufacturers.
Last month, Dr Bohn announced that the company was shelving previous plans
to build a new, expensive four-seat model and would concentrate instead on a
cheaper two-seater.
Some industry analysts believe its response may prove too little and too
late to avert an independence-threatening crisis.
Control of the company is shared between the Porsche and Piech families, who
between them control all the company's ordinary shares and 40 per cent of
its preferred stock.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Letter: Not a cheap alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing to correct the implication that New Zealand lamb is a
cheap alternative to British in David Richardson's article (Farmer's
Viewpoint, February 18).
New Zealand lamb has a place in the European market in providing a
complementary supply and sustaining interest in lamb at a time when the
domestic product is either not available or of variable quality.
British producers rushing to get the most out of the variable premium, prior
to its abolition at the end of last year, created some of the problem by
having lower than normal stocks available to supply their customers in the
new year.
Traditionally, at this time of year, the British product is variable and
supermarkets, as always, supply their consumers with the best quality
product available. They have chosen the New Zealand product. Their decision
is not solely based on price but on value for money.
New Zealand's unsubsidised producers are constantly having to compete with
situations such as this which have been created by market distorting
policies.

'not in the mood for joking' either]

FT  21 FEB 92 / Tracking Virgin's vapour trail: Richard Branson is selling
parts of his empire. Bronwen Maddox examines this strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After several years of turning down offers for Virgin Music Group, Mr
Richard Branson is on the verge of selling a majority stake in the record
label, the largest and most profitable part of his empire. At the same time
he wants to sell stakes in other companies - prompting Virgin watchers to
ask whether the UK's second-largest private group is strapped for cash.
The music industry expects that the Virgin Music Group deal will value the
record label at more than Pounds 570m. Mr Branson also hopes to raise Pounds
55m from the sale of a 20 per cent stake in his airline, Virgin Atlantic
Airways; and he is seeking a 20 per cent partner for his continental
European record stores, known as Megastores. His communications companies
have just sold their largest profit-earner, the computer games company,
Mastertronic, for Dollars 60m (Pounds 34m).
Mr Branson's rivals, as well as those who see him as a rare British
entrepreneur, are intrigued. Do his airline and record shops need cash
urgently? If not, why is he selling? And what will he do with the money?
Of the four separate Virgin enterprises - music, retail Megastores, airlines
and holidays, and communications - the airline raises the most pressing
questions about financial stability. It is operating in the worst airline
recession for decades, and is involved in a bitter commercial and publicity
war with British Airways. It has also borne the heavy start-up costs of
flying from Heathrow airport since July.
Created in Mr Branson's image - young, cheerful - Virgin Atlantic started
flying to New York from Gatwick in 1984. Its executives feel it came of age
last year after winning access to the Heathrow slots.
'People think you need a lot of money to run an airline but it isn't true,'
Mr Branson said. The airline's latest results, for the year to July 1991,
show it has been hit hard by the recession, and that without more cash it
will not be able to expand. But they also establish that the airline's debt
did not soar last year, contrary to the expectations of competitors.
Voyager Travel Holdings, the holding company for Virgin Atlantic Airways,
and its linked tour operator, Virgin Holidays, made an Pounds 800,000
pre-tax profit in the year to July 1991 compared with Pounds 8.5m for the
corresponding period of the year before. Its executives described this as a
'considerable relief', as the Gulf war had pushed up fuel prices and the
Heathrow start-up had meant acquiring aircraft and more staff. The figures
indicate Virgin Atlantic made a Pounds 3m loss, offset by a Pounds 3.3m
profit at the tour operator.
Despite this squeeze on profits, Mr Branson stuck to his philosophy of low
fares and 'add-on' incentives, such as a free economy ticket with a business
ticket. He credits his success with business travellers - who now account
for 36 per cent of its revenues - to this philosophy.
Voyager points out that it scraped into profit with only eight aircraft,
while British Airways, with more than 200 aircraft, made a pre-tax loss of
more than Pounds 10m in the 12 months to June 1991. However, BA's loss
contains Pounds 120m of exceptional costs and the airline rebounded with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 285m for the last nine months of 1991.
But the pressures on Voyager are clear. Its interest bill of Pounds 1.3m was
only just covered by operating profits of Pounds 2.1m.
The decline in airline profits cut operating cashflow to Pounds 1m from
Pounds 29m. It was still able to spend Pounds 27m on new equipment, only
slightly less than the previous year, but that was partly financed by
selling an aircraft for Pounds 27m. Even so, net debt at July 1991 was up by
Pounds 9m during the year to Pounds 39m.
Virgin executives see last year as a short-lived trough. They are projecting
Pounds 4m pre-tax profits in the year to October and Pounds 29m the
following year as conditions improve and start-up costs are left behind.
Now they want to apply for routes to Johannesburg, and perhaps San Francisco
and Washington DC. They insist that Virgin will always be a 'point-to-point'
service and that the airline is not trying to build the expensive 'hub and
spoke' networks of the world's largest airlines. But the expansion will take
more money.
'If we stick with the routes we have now, we're fine - we don't need more
cash. But it's an exceptionally good point to buy aircraft cheaply while the
market is depressed,' according to Mr Trevor Abbott, group managing director
of the airline and retail companies.
Some industry observers are sceptical about Virgin's expansion plans. They
argue that the company's existing services already tap into the world's
busiest routes and that profits from those routes will come under increasing
pressure.
By moving into Heathrow, Virgin has taken on US carriers such as American
Airlines and United, which were also granted rights to fly to the airport
for the first time last year. These giant carriers are expected to launch a
second marketing onslaught on transatlantic routes this summer, putting
pressure on yields.
Despite such reservations, it seems likely that the airline can avoid
serious financial difficulties, provided that Voyager manages to attract a
20 per cent investor.
Virgin's Megastores also have heavy investment plans but these pose less
risk and the shops probably offer less potential than the airline. The
Megastores, while accounting for a fifth of all the Virgin companies' Pounds
1bn turnover last year, made a small pre-tax loss. The earnings from the UK
and Japanese stores are offset at the moment by the development costs of the
continental European stores.
Looking at the investment plans in the airline and Megastores, one of
Virgin's former City advisers points to Mr Branson's policy of joint
ventures as a sign of his financial prudence. In 1988, Mr Branson sold 25
per cent of Virgin Music Group to Japanese conglomerate Fujisankei, for
Dollars 150m; this year he has agreed a 50:50 venture in the UK shops with
retailer W H Smith.
'He doesn't seem to have the hang-ups some tycoons have - insisting on total
ownership - in fact he's shown a real knack for using other people's money
to do what he wants,' said the former adviser.
Even so, it will take years to see whether the investment in airlines and
Megastores will match the striking success of Virgin Music Group, or
whether, five years from now, they will seem an expensive hobby. Virgin
Music Group still dwarfs its younger sister companies, with turnover last
year of Pounds 350m and estimated pre-tax profits of some Pounds 15m-Pounds
20m. Selling a majority stake will mark a turning point in the Branson
companies and, on a more personal note, in Richard Branson's life. Mr
Branson said: 'It just seemed the right point not to keep shutting the door
on these offers.'
According to Mr Abbott, the willingness to consider selling the group also
marked Mr Branson's new confidence that he had built other businesses - the
airline and Megastores - to replace it, and that they were here to stay.
Clearly the sale is a wrench, and his preferred deal would be one that
allowed him to keep a small stake, Mr Branson said. But his colleagues
pointed out that he had not been closely involved in the music group for
years. One, who asked not to be named, said: 'Richard may have got to that
age where he thinks there's more to life than music. Please don't say he's
grown up - he's just changed.'
How will Virgin spend the cash? The record industry's giants, including
Thorn EMI, the UK leisure conglomerate, and Bertelsmann, the German media
group, have pushed the bidding higher since serious negotiations started
this year, and Mr Branson could realise up to Pounds 428m on the sale.
The group's broadcasting ambitions seem unlikely to swallow much of this new
cash - Virgin failed to win any of the new ITV licences when they were
auctioned last year, although this did not deter it from applying for the
second national radio franchise.
But the word that gets Mr Branson excited is railways. He has made no secret
of his dream of running a high-quality train service, aimed at the business
market, on British Rail's longest routes.
Or Virgin could simply sit back and enjoy having cash in the bank. Mr Abbott
said: 'It could be really rather a lot of money, couldn't it? And we're not
short of ideas, you know.'

Most people would agree with Labour's tribute to Britain's nurses whose
dedication means they 'routinely do more hours than they are paid (for),
staying on without overtime or working through lunch'. But when the new
policy document 'Your Good Health' goes on to lavish praise on the
consultants, Observer begins to feel a bit queasy.
After all, many GPs attribute delays in treatment under the NHS to
consultants who find lengthy waiting lists a useful marketing aid for their
lucrative private practices. And consultants' working practices (not to
mention their devotion to improving their golf handicap) are often
responsible for under-use of hospital beds.
Didn't Barbara Castle fall out with the consultants over their hours of work
when she was Labour's health secretary in the mid-1970s? Not unreasonably,
she wanted those who were paid by the NHS to work for the NHS rather than
for themselves. Perhaps Robin Cook hopes to avoid such confrontations by
this sort of sucking up - but Observer doubts whether it will cut much ice
with the long-suffering NHS-user.

While it is no surprise to see a voluble critic walking out of the door,
nobody quite believes the reasons LWT chief Greg Dyke has offered for his
resignation from the board of ITN.
Citing conflicts of interest over bids for the new Teletext licence, Dyke
pointed to a disagreement on the fact that ITN, shareholder in current
franchise holder Oracle, also leads the consortium for rival bidder Update
Teletext.
But the bids were submitted a month ago, so why on earth has the normally
irrepressible Dyke waited until now to voice his displeasure?
Given that LWT has only around 6 per cent in ITN, Dyke can undoubtedly plead
more pressing calls on his time - the ITV Association of which he is
recently chairman, inter alia.
More pertinently, just this week LWT and Carlton unveiled an important joint
venture, initially a London regional news service - but, both parties no
doubt hope, a serious competitor to ITN one day.

President George Bush, the kinder, gentler president, now knows what it is
like to feel homeless.
Although he has lived in Washington for years and owns a holiday home at
Kennebunkport, on the Maine coast, his official residence for tax purposes
is a suite at the Houstonian Hotel in Texas. Unfortunately, The Houstonian
has now collapsed under Dollars 3m of debt and has filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
The big advantage of living at the hotel is that Texas levies no state
income taxes. According to Money magazine, the Bush family paid Dollars
99,241 in federal income taxes in 1990 on a presidential salary of Dollars
200,000 and investment income of Dollars 253,000. But the president paid
only Dollars 3,596 in state taxes, however, rather than the Dollars 29,000
he would have paid as a Maine resident, or the Dollars 30,000 that would
have been levied by the District of Columbia.
Thousands of Americans have written to the Texas state comptroller
requesting Texas citizenship after a Doonesbury cartoon strip urged its
readers to follow the president's example. 'I think this might help him get
the message. Most people understand economic problems when something
personal happens to them,' crows Ed Martin, the Democrat party's Texas
executive director.

When it comes to matters of judgment, Britain's clearing bankers have not
emerged at all well from the Robert Maxwell disaster. Not only did they lend
his empire well over Pounds 1bn but even worse they handed over to him
control of their professional organ - Banking World.
The big selling point of the magazine is that it provides model answers to
bankers' exam questions - which makes it an essential tool for young bankers
on the make. Back in 1983, the Chartered Institute of Bankers agreed to
merge its own journal with Maxwell's newly-acquired Bankers' Magazine.
Maxwell controlled the Banking World title and his printing presses look
after the monthly print-run of 130,000 copies. It is a nice little earner
and has saved the institute a lot of money and heartache.
However, the Maxwell connection is proving an embarrassment and the
institute is now wondering how to extricate itself gracefully from the mess.
There is talk of a management buy-out of Maxwell's contract publishing
interests. Since the Banking World print run is a valuable contract the
managers would obviously like to retain it.
Not surprisingly, the institute is worried lest its organ falls into the
hands of another unsavoury character. Model answers please to Roger
Flemington, president of The Chartered Institute of Bankers, 10 Lombard
Street.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Labour fails the health test
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a strange quirk of British political life that the electorate does not
trust the Labour party to run the economy or the Conservatives to run the
National Health Service. The fact that the UK is in a deeper recession than
most of its competitors does not appear to have shaken the former view.
Voters may be equally prepared to be taken in by Labour's promises to sweep
away the government's long-overdue reforms of the NHS, designed to improve
the allocation of funds and curb rising costs.
Mistrust of Conservative intentions on the NHS is fuelled by the Labour
party's success in portraying the reforms as a form of privatisation which
will destroy the flagship of the welfare state. That charge was repeated
yesterday by Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health spokesman, when Labour
published its plans for the health service in greater detail than before.
Previous versions had promised to reverse the government reforms - for
example, by taking the self-governing trust hospitals back under the control
of district health authorities. But it was possible to believe that Labour
had accepted the wisdom of key elements of the internal market. For example,
the split between the purchaser of health services and the providers looked
set to continue, albeit described in more PC (politically correct) terms.
Yesterday's policy paper rudely dispels any such illusion, with the stark
promise to sweep away the internal market.
Tough talk
In its place, Labour proposes a return to top-down administration for the
health service. The government would set targets for the regions, which
would set them for the districts, which would set them for the hospitals and
other health care units. Tough talk about rigorous performance agreements
cannot hide the fact that this is a return to the planned economy in health
care, with the inflexibility and inefficiency which that brings.
Labour recognises the need to reward efficient providers of health care, but
cannot accept that competition offers a tried and tested mechanism for doing
this. So a system of 'incentive funding' would hold back money to be
distributed to service units which perform well against targets. Since some
units will receive incentive funds and others will not, it is hard to see
how this can be described as avoiding the need 'to compete in order to
succeed'. Labour's promise that incentive funds will be introduced only
after economic growth permits an increase in NHS funding does nothing to
resolve the contradiction.
Market competition
These contortions cast doubt on Labour's avowed conversion to the merits of
the market as a means of allocating scarce resources and driving up
standards through competition. Mr Robin Cook certainly seems unpersuaded: he
claims that market competition in the NHS will produce a 'two-tier' health
service. He is presumably working on plans to nationalise food distribution
to avoid a two-tier market in this equally important staff of life.
Labour is, however, correct to point out that the government's reforms have
created a two-tier service. But the cause of this is not the internal
market: it is the partial introduction of self-governing trust hospitals and
GP fund-holding practices which has created the differentials. Both have
improved the quality of health care for those who use them: both should be
extended to all parts of the NHS so that those currently not covered can
benefit.
All over the developed world, health care systems are confronting
inefficiencies and escalating costs similar to those which faced the
pre-reform NHS. Despite national differences in health care provision, many
are moving in directions similar to those mapped out by the government's
reforms. Labour's determination to duck such questions is understandable
given the political dividends from attacking the Conservative reforms. But
it could be a crude form of 'short-termism' if a future Labour government
were to reverse the reforms and then find itself facing exactly the same
problems which led to them in the first place.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Arts: Christopher Hollyday - Ronnie Scott's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to feel cast down at the prospect of hearing another implausibly
young, yet skilled, jazzman. There are a lot of them around. These
fresh-faced things front festivals, make record deals and wear Armani suits
before they have got the chops in. They appear self-confident and can read
all right, but they do not sound interesting - yet.
It is a comfort then to find Christopher Hollyday, from Norwood
Massachusetts, walking uncertainly to the stand and looking every inch the
nervy 22 year old, before blowing with the abandon a young man should. This
skinny altoist, who has yet to grow into his suit jacket, started on the sax
at the age of nine, according to his biog, and had most of Bird's solos down
before the onset of puberty. By 15 he had cut an album on his own (sic)
Jazzbeat label and at eighteen was recording with seasoned pianist Cedar
Walton and drummer Billy Higgins behind him.
Awkwardness aside - he refers to Ronnie's smoky club as a 'performance
centre' - the shy demeanour evaporates as he puts the reed to his lips and
tears headlong into 'Scorpio Rising', a cut from The Natural Moment
(Novus/BMG), his most recent recording. What he lacks in hot-house technique
Hollyday more than compensates for in sour-toned strength - it is said that
his hard bop playing has been tinged by Jackie McLean and he has a similar
flawed beauty in his phrasing.
But his real appeal lies less in the influences of McLean and Parker and
more in the reckless lack of restraint shown with even pretty tunes like
'September in the rain' and a bittersweet ''Round midnight'. A substantial
and galloping rhythm section in Ritchie Goods (string bass) and Ron Savage
(drums) gives Hollyday impetus and hardworking pianist Anthony Wonsey's
sparkling right hand adds again to the excitement in numbers like McCoy
Tyner's 'Exotique' or his own 'A treaty of jazz'.
A bit of greased and greasy lightning, Hollyday's pitching alto is a welcome
contrast to the flatness of so many young fogies painted as young turks by
their record companies. It would be as well to hear him before he starts
relaxing.
A bonus at this week's residency is the ample and often bawdy blues shouting
of American Irene Reid. More, er, experienced than Hollyday, her raucous
tale of Long John the dentist is a fine complement to the saxophonist's
blushing impetuosity.

<TEXT>
'YOU have how many weeks' holiday?' An American business school graduate in
her late-30s, and working in middle management at a large telecommunications
company, boggles at the thought of six weeks' annual leave.
She gets two weeks - into which are crammed a passion for skiing, family
responsibilities and a desire to travel. In the unlikely event that she ever
becomes boss of this multi-billion dollar company, her vacation allowance
might increase to four weeks.
This is the typical US experience and to a European, it looks a lousy deal.
Yet, here is a nation writhing in self-doubt because a Japanese prime
minister recently called its workers lazy. Hasn't something, somewhere, gone
awry?
Juliet Schor, in 'The Overworked American', (published by Basic) certainly
thinks so. This analysis by an associate professor at Harvard University
seems timely, given the heated political debate.
The balance struck between work and leisure is fundamental to millions of
employees' lives. It also raises practical management issues. Does insisting
on a little more leisure actually improve workforce efficiency?
When unemployment is rife, should labour be distributed more evenly between
those who want to work? An answer is going to have to tackle psychological
and cultural questions, not just economic ones.
Schor, however, has little time for this. Her aim is simple: to prove that
capitalism is destroying leisure, a trend she views with sentimental regret.
Very crudely, her argument is that profit-driven employers will always
encourage long working hours. Workers get trapped by an addiction to
consumer goods, and demand more money, not more leisure.
Her contention is backed up by evidence of longer working hours in the US -
although despite copious footnotes, finer details of the statistical
analysis are opaque.
The reader is treated to a romp through working practices in pre-capitalist
'Olde England' - where British peasants probably got a rotten deal compared
with the French or Spanish.
From there, it is a quick trip forward to the arrival of 'werkgloken' - or
work clocks - in the textile factories and on to the Victorian mills.
The argument does contain some obvious truths. Greed has always been a
powerful motivating force, and 'keeping up with the Jones', an accepted
social phenomenon.
'Big business', meanwhile, probably does encourage employees to contribute
more than the required working week. If someone is prepared to do unpaid
overtime in order to climb the promotional ladder, a profit-conscious
employer is hardly going to complain.
But, to lay blame for 'the decline of leisure' on capitalism is simplistic.
There are thousands of professionals, from teachers to artists, whose
willingness to work hard is not explained by the desire for another TV set.
Nor have some 'non-capitalist' economic systems been noted for their sloth.
Take the early kibbutz settlers, for example. In short, material reward may
be an important incentive once enough has been earned to clothe the family
and pay the mortgage. But it is not the end of the story.
The pity is that Schor skimps on more interesting detail.
She mentions in passing experiments by Kellogg in the 1930s and, more
recently, Medtronic Corporation and Ideal Industries - where attempts to
reduce working hours have actually brought productivity gains.
Slog away for a few extra hours, save up the book's Dollars 21 cost, and
squeeze a couple of hours reading into a tight working schedule, and you may
be marginally enlightened. In the process your blood may boil and stress
levels rise - but, by Schor's reckoning, you're probably a dead man anyway.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock taunts prime minister over
recession - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLE of Mr John Major, the prime minister, in determining policy as the
economy plunged into the longest recession in 60 years was firmly underlined
by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, in the Commons yesterday.
In another bout of fevered pre-election skirmishing he stressed that Mr
Major had been chancellor before the recession started and prime minister
throughout its course.
Mr Kinnock told Mr Major: 'You are not only the prime minister of recession,
but the prime cause of recession.'
The prime minister urged Mr Kinnock not to go into 'overdrive', but to
acknowledge that in the past three months industrial production fell faster
in Germany, France, the US and Japan than in the UK.
Mr Major emphasised that last year industrial production fell more in Japan
and Germany than in the UK. Facing Mr Kinnock he demanded: 'Why do you think
that is if you blame me for everything?'
The Labour leader retorted: 'British people are not on the dole in Germany.
They are on the dole in Britain.'
Mr Kinnock urged the prime minister to stop groping around for excuses for
his own failures and recognise that it was now official: 'Majorism is not
working.'
He said Mr Major had been 'convicted by his own record and condemned by his
inac-tion in the face of the slump'.
The prime minister said interest rates had been reduced on seven occasions
and inflation halved. Insisting that the 'right circumstances for recovery'
were in place, he said: 'The people of this country will not let Mr Kinnock
throw that away.'
The Labour leadership was in disarray over taxation policy, he continued,
with proposals drawn up over five years being 'ditched' under Conservative
probing in a period of five weeks. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, who
had earlier ruled out a 'phoney shadow cabinet Budget' had now decided to
produce one after all.
Mr Major said Labour's proposal to abolish the ceiling on National Insurance
contributions would affect more than 1m people, 750,000 of whom paid
basic-rate tax. 'So much for the promise that no one earning under Pounds
20,000 a year would be hit,' he said.
Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaign manager, pressed for an assurance that
the Budget debate to be opened by the chancellor on March 10 would run its
normal four-day course and not be curtailed by the timetable for the general
election. He emphasised that if, as expected, the election took place on
April 9, the proclamation dissolving parliament would have to be made on
March 16.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major sets up election 'A-team' -
Heseltine and Clarke drafted on to inner cabinet to advise on strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has set up a general election 'A-team', drafting in Mr Michael
Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke to a tightly knit group charged with
finalising preparations for an April 9 poll.
In a move which underlines their growing authority within the cabinet, the
environment and education secretaries have joined Mr Chris Patten, the party
chairman, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in an inner cabinet
advising the prime minister on strategy for the general election.
Its members, who have been working for much of this week on the Conservative
manifesto, will be the most prominent spokesmen for the party during the
election campaign. They will share most of the ministerial 'air-time' on
television and radio and will join the prime minister in making wide-ranging
policy speeches.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has joined the team to take a
behind-the-scenes role in costing - and sometimes vetoing - any manifesto
pledges which would commit the Conservatives to higher public spending.
The Conservatives have not publicly acknowledged the existence of the group
in order to avoid comparisons with the inner circle - first dubbed the
'A-team' - established by Mrs Margaret Thatcher before the 1987 general
election.
But Mr Patten is said to refer to them privately as the 'Big Beasts',
reflecting their heavyweight status within the cabinet and their claim after
the election to the most important jobs in the government.
The group has held a number of Downing Street strategy meetings with the
prime minister over the past few days to translate the broad themes of the
manifesto - ownership, choice, opportunity and responsibility - into
concrete policy proposals.
Among the measures agreed are a promise of fresh incentives for saving and
home and share ownership, further action to remove education from local
authority control, a new programme to revitalise the inner cities, and a
shake-up of the rented housing market.
The group is meeting in parallel with the other team of ministers - led by
Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip - which takes day-to-day responsibility for
campaigning.
Earlier this week Mr Heseltine underlined his personal standing among
Conservative MPs with a bravura Commons performance. His participation in Mr
Major's inner cabinet will reinforce expectations that he will head an
expanded trade and industry department after a Conservative election
victory.
Mr Clarke, meanwhile, has combined a growing following on the right of the
party with an increasingly close relationship with the prime minister.
Colleagues say that Mr Clarke's commitment to the government's education
reforms and his robust performances in defending them have greatly impressed
Mr Major. He is seen as a future chancellor.
Ironically, Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine would be the strongest contenders for
the party leadership if a Conservative defeat at the election put Mr Major's
position at risk.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to stress stark differences
 -Tax policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR leadership is to press home to voters the stark choice between
Tory tax cuts and better public services following Mr John Major's
disclosure that he is ready to authorise increased public borrowing.
Party campaign strategists were also delighted yesterday that Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, had refused to be drawn by questions at a morning
news conference asking why extra spending was legitimate to finance tax cuts
but not for public services.
Party organisers believe that Mr Major's public support for 'prudent'
increases in borrowing now offer them a better opportunity to highlight the
differences between the two parties. They claim that poll evidence has
repeatedly shown a preference among voters for better services over tax
cuts.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, used the launch of his party's health policy
to stress his commitment to reverse any reduction in the 25p basic rate of
income tax. He said tax reductions were not a stimulus to the economy. Such
a move would only encourage a growth in imports: 'It won't bring recovery,
it won't advantage the nation.'
Party officials were careful to emphasise, however, that Labour would not
use an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement to promote
consumption, but only to finance investment or capital expenditure. If the
government did use more borrowing to cut the base rate of income tax, Labour
would revoke the measure and use the resources for its public services
programme.
The importance of better services was at the centre of a speech yesterday by
Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, to Manchester Business School.
Spelling out 'the positive case for the public sector', he said advocates of
laissez-faire were losing ground against those arguing for a more pragmatic
assessment of the 'best mix' of public and private intervention in a modern
mixed economy.
He pointed out that government spending now amounted to about 40 per cent of
gross domestic product against an average of 48 per cent in the European
Community. He said even prudent institutions such as the Geneva-based Bank
for International Settlements had recently expressed concern that low public
investment in core infrastructure could hinder UK economic growth.

proposal - National Insurance contributions

<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES yesterday hit out at Labour proposals for a 9 per cent
'tax' on unearned income of more than Pounds 3,000 a year, in an assault
featuring a rare excursion from pre-Budget purdah by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor.
Labour plans to extend National Insurance contributions to income from
savings of more than Pounds 30,000 held by those below retirement age. Mr
Lamont, flanked by a picture of a blood-filled mosquito that will star in a
Tory poster campaign, inveighed against what he said was an 'envy tax on
savings'.
Mr Lamont, attempting to tap a vein which has proved rewarding for the
government in recent campaigning, said: 'When it comes to tax, the Labour
party is still socialist. It has to be - that is the price of Labour's
spending plans.'
He sought to highlight the contradiction between Labour's commitment to
training and investment as an economic cure-all and its simultaneous
espousal of a policy 'which will slash investment'.
The 'worst effect' of the tax would be on the overall level of savings, said
Mr Lamont. 'Fewer people will save with a top rate of income tax of 59 per
cent on earnings and on savings.'
Mr Lamont said the proposed savings charge could hit 1.1m taxpayers and
would undermine the promise made by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, that
nobody earning less than Pounds 21,000 a year would pay a penny more in tax
or national insurance.
Some 750,000 of those affected would be basic rate tax payers, he said.
'Many people who are not at retirement age but depend on their income from
savings would indeed be hit hard,' he said.
Mr Lamont was supported by Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, who
portrayed the tax as a last-ditch stand against a Tory-inspired revolution
in inheritance.
The tax would take an average of Pounds 5.40 a week from 750,000 basic-rate
taxpayers and would cost a further 360,000 higher-rate taxpayers an average
of Pounds 34 a week, he said.

Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR GRAHAM DAY, chairman of PowerGen, has clashed with Mr Frank Dobson,
shadow energy secretary, over the role of government-appointed directors in
determining the policy of privatised companies.
Speaking on BBC television, Mr Dobson said it would be possible for Labour
ministers to appoint directors to both PowerGen and National Power, the
privatised generating companies, to ensure they complied with government
policy.
In letters to Mr Dobson and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, Sir Graham
said the government had no special powers to appoint directors. He insisted
that the idea that replacement directors could be obliged to follow Labour
policies - 'by implication without regard to their legal duties' - was
ill-founded.
Mr Dobson commented that 'private profit-seeking electricity companies'
would not be allowed to ruin the economy. A Labour government would use its
powers to ensure that electricity companies pursued the policies of a Labour
government as assiduously as they had pursued those of the present
administration.
Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, last night ruled out government
intervention in the negotiations between British Coal and the electricity
industry which are likely to determine the future size of British Coal.
His statement follows reports that the government was attempting to persuade
the electricity industry to sign contracts with British Coal which would
force the closure of all but about a dozen pits.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hattersley seeks to end secrecy -
Freedom of information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPAIGNERS against government secrecy were last night expressing delight at
a newly published Right to Information Bill unveiled by Mr Roy Hattersley,
Labour's deputy leader.
The bill, which has no chance of being passed before an election, would
replace the Official Secrets Act with a general right of access to official
records.
It is almost identical to a 'model' bill drawn up by the Campaign for
Freedom of Information lobby group.
Under its provisions the public would be able to request any government
information, and civil servants would be obliged by law to supply it.
Although the bill includes 11 categories of information exempt from its
provisions, including threats to national security and breaches of personal
privacy, it also has a catch-all clause that can force disclosure in cases
of overwhelming public interest.
Announcing the bill at yesterday's What The Papers Say press awards lunch in
London, Mr Hattersley said a Labour government would enact it in its first
parliamentary session.
He added that it enshrined in law the principle that public information must
be freely available unless deemed detrimental to state security or
individual rights.
But in a speech dotted with side-swipes at the tabloid press, he went on to
warn his audience of senior journalists: 'The new act will only bring light
into dark places if newspapers take serious advantage of its provisions.'
Mr Hattersley added that a Labour government might well use further
legislation if the privacy of individuals continued to be abused. That
question will be examined in July when an 18-month trial period of newspaper
self-regulation, set up by the Calcutt committee on privacy, is to be
reviewed.
Mr Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information,
said the group was 'very pleased' with the shape of the newly tabled bill,
which included provisions over and above the draft legislation published by
CFI last November.
'It goes about as far as it is possible for an opposition party to go,' he
said,
He added that once in power Labour could expect to come under pressure from
Whitehall to dilute its measures.
Ironically, Mr Hattersley's largely symbolic bill itself escaped all press
attention when notice of its imminent publication was discreetly tabled in
the Commons last month.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: How to make a healthy mix of care
and cash - The choices facing voters over the NHS reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTORATE faces an apparently clear choice. Labour will enter the
election pledged to abolish the market principles on which the government's
National Health Service reforms are based.
Out would go the internal market, self-governing trust hospitals and GP
fund-holders under proposals published yesterday in 'Your Good Health' -
described as a white paper for a Labour government. While it would require
legislation to bury the last remains of the Conservatives' NHS reforms,
Labour could sweep away much of them, like trust hospitals, by immediate
administrative action.
The NHS is, however, influenced as much by evolution as by legislative
change. Although the government put a commercial gloss on its NHS reforms
the central idea driving them - the separation of the funding of health care
from its provision - is becoming a feature of many health systems around the
world. Labour, while expressing determination to free the NHS from
'commercial pressures', does not entirely reject this purchaser-provider
split.
It acknowledges the case for ensuring 'the two functions of assessing needs
and delivering services remain distinct' and proposes to do this through
service agreements between health authorities and hospitals. These would
translate priorities in health authority performance agreements into
specific targets for hospitals.
Health authorities would use an unspecified portion of their budgets as
incentive funds to reward outstanding performance by hospitals and community
units. In this way, argues Labour, each unit would 'have an incentive to
improve the services it offers to the community without, at the same time,
having to compete in order to succeed'.
The Conservative government, says the Labour document, modelled its contract
system on business practice and contracts have been negotiated in commercial
secrecy. Labour's performance agreements would be developed as part of a
democratic process in a public service.
While self-governing trusts would disappear, hospital managers would be
given 'maximum freedom of decision-making'. GPs, although no longer
fund-holders, would gain a 'central role' in setting and monitoring service
agreements.
One of the first questions that health-care specialists will ask about
Labour's proposals is whether, having accepted the need to retain a
separation between assessment of needs and delivery of services, the party's
proposed service agreement structure would prove sufficiently robust for the
job.
The King's Fund health policy centre, while saying that there was 'much more
to welcome than to be concerned about' in Labour's plans, yesterday
questioned whether the proposed incentives and sanctions for promoting
efficiency were strong enough in the light of the decision to abandon the
internal market.
It also asked whether Labour had given sufficient thought to the balance
between central specification of performance and local freedom for action.
All political parties are seeking means of squeezing increased efficiency
out of a cash-limited public service, and there is some convergence in their
ideas for achieving this.
Overshadowing this remains the huge question of whether the NHS is
adequately funded. Labour's position is that the service has been
underfunded during the past decade and the document gave a renewed
commitment to tackling this. It commits an incoming Labour government to
reviewing the coming year's health budget against the background of public
accounts 'in order to establish how we can attack underfunding from the
start'.

POLL TAX: The High Court yesterday refused to close the loophole holding up
poll tax prosecutions, ruling that liability orders based on computer
print-outs were illegal.
Declaring computer evidence 'hearsay', the court upheld an earlier ruling by
Coventry magistrates. The ruling could affect thousands of pending
debt-collection cases.
The bill introducing the council tax, currently before the Lords, will make
such evidence admissible for the future, but councils are unlikely to
proceed with liability orders affected by the ruling until the bill becomes
law early next month.
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said the bill had been
amended 'precisely to make clear that in future computer evidence will not
be regarded as hearsay'.
*****
ENVIRONMENT: The government has dismissed as 'unrealistic' European
Commission plans to start an energy tax to combat global warming early next
year.
Officials giving evidence to the House of Lords' European Communities
committee yesterday said it could take five years to agree details and
introduce an EC 'carbon tax' on fossil fuels.
They also said they doubted that detailed proposals on the tax would be
ready for presentation to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June.
*****
TRANSPORT: The Transport and Works Bill failed to complete its report stage
in the Commons last night when the government chose not to extend the
sitting until consideration of the measure had been concluded.
The bill would empower the government to authorise rail, tramway and inland
waterway work schemes, replacing the need to go through the lengthy and
often costly private-bill procedure currently required.

MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liberal Democrat leader, confirmed last night that he
would want a seat in the cabinet and other ministerial posts for his MPs if
he supported either Labour or the Tories in a hung parliament.
Speaking on BBC television, Mr Ashdown signalled his determination to push
for the best terms possible if he held the balance of power. Liberal
Democrats would be almost certain to vote down a Queen's Speech on the
incoming government's legislative programme if it did not contain a bill to
introduce proportional representation.
Mr Ashdown said the effects would be 'devasting' if either the Conservatives
or Labour 'inflict on Britain a minority government, which will provide
another lame duck government'.
His aim would be to create a stable government. He added: 'You can't have
partnership government unless you are in that government, operating as a
member of it at all levels from the bottom to the top.'

FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher becomes 'freelance writer'
 -MPs' interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, has become a 'freelance
writer, lecturer and broadcaster', according to the latest annual register
of MPs' business interests, published yesterday.
She also records some staff to help with her lecture tours in the US and
Japan, and visits around the world.
Sir Geoffrey Howe, former deputy prime minister, is now listed as
non-executive director of BICC, the international cables and construction
group, and Glaxo Holdings, the pharmaceuticals group. He is also a special
adviser to Jones Day Reavis and Pogue (International Law Firm), and lists
occasional fees from lecturing, broadcasting and writing.
It is the first time these activities have been set out in the register, as
last year's register was published too close to the Tory leadership contest
of November 1990 for the departing protagonists to have acquired their new
interests.
Other former ministers have continued to add to their business activities.
Mr Nicholas Ridley, former trade and industry secretary, has become a
consultant to Whittingdale Holdings, the unit trust group, and Mr Nigel
Lawson, former chancellor, has joined the international advisory board of
Creditanstalt, the bank.
Apart from his brief connection with Maxwell Communication Corporation, Mr
Peter Walker, former Welsh secretary, lists new interests as a director of
the Vietnam Fund, which will invest in joint ventures with Vietnamese
companies. He is also an adviser to the Treuhandanstalt, the body for
privatising former east German companies.
Under parliamentary rules MPs have to register interests as they are
acquired, but the register itself is printed only annually. The all-party
committee responsible for the register is due to publish a report early next
month on tightening up the registration and declaration of interests.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Satellite communication licences awarded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO companies were licensed yesterday to provide international satellite
communications services.
British Aerospace Communications and Alpha Lyracom, the US private satellite
operator, plan to provide a range of voice and data services by installing
satellite dishes on office roofs. They are expected to provide a new form of
competition to the international services run by BT and Mercury
Communications.
The government has awarded the licences as part of its policy of
liberalising the telecommunications market following last year's review of
the BT/Mercury duopoly.
The market for satellite communications has developed quickly in the US
where there are nearly 70,000 dishes in use, according to Comsys, a
specialist UK market research company. In Europe, however, the market has
been slow to develop because of tight regulations which are now being
relaxed.
Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, claimed the UK had 'gone
further than any other country in liberalising satellite networks'. He said
other applications to provide similar services would be considered on their
merits.
BAe already has similar satellite licences in France and Germany. It is also
part of a multinational consortium that plans to build and launch the
Dollars 500m (Pounds 284m) Orion satellite system in 1995. Alpha Lyracom has
satellite licences in France, Germany and the US. Its first Pan American
Satellite has been in operation for several years and several more are
planned to be launched over the next few years.
The new licences are unrestricted for data services but have one important
restriction if they are used for voice services. They will only be allowed
to connect with the public telephone network in either the UK or a foreign
country but not with both at the same time.
The government yesterday also awarded four radio-based data communications
licences. The operators, which have already been providing data services
under a more strict regime, are: Cognito, Hutchinson Mobile Data, Paknet and
Ram.
Mr Lilley said the Department of Trade and Industry had received 20 other
firm applications for telecommunications licences since the market was
liberalised last year, and 30 indications of strong interest from companies.
The DTI said there would be a 'rolling programme' under which perhaps one
new licence would be awarded every month.
The DTI also confirmed it was close to licensing a new type of international
operator to lease telecommunications capacity in bulk from BT and Mercury
and re-sell it.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): New terms for ambulance staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLEVELAND Ambulance Service plans to break with national pay and conditions
for its 350 employees when it becomes an independent trust in April, Lisa
Woods writes.
It wants to lengthen the working week from 39 to 42 hours and is offering
paramedics and technicians pay increases of up to 13 per cent.
Northumbria Ambulance Service, one of the few health trusts that has broken
from National Health Service pay rates and industrial relations structures,
also intends to make a locally determined pay offer in the next few weeks.
Ambulance unions have recently lodged a claim for a 9.5 per cent pay rise
and a reduction in the 39-hour week through the Whitley Council, the
national negotiating body for health service staff.
Cleveland Ambulance Service said yesterday that the first response from
staff affected by the proposals had shown more than 60 per cent in favour.
Nupe, the public-service union, disputed the figure. Mr John McDade, the
local Nupe officer, said: 'People who have accepted the new terms and
conditions may have done so under duress or misconception. The service has
not told people that they are entitled to keep Whitley Council terms and
conditions.'
Trusts can impose terms and conditions on staff they recruit after gaining
trust status, but under government rules they have to honour national terms
for staff who transfer to a trust. Cleveland says it wants the new
conditions to apply to all staff who agree to them.
Mr John Burneside, chief executive of Cleveland Ambulance Service, said:
'Our manpower strategy is simple - fewer staff, working harder, getting paid
more. We are a less complex organisation than a large acute hospital for
example. We have identified our strategy and gone for it.'
He said Cleveland had no plans to seek a single-union agreement such as
operates in Northumbria.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Scheme launched to boost private share ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSHARE, an organisation committed to turning the UK into a 'nation of
shareholders', was launched yesterday with financial backing from the
Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange and 20 industrial and
commercial companies.
The new organisation will campaign for reforms such as fiscal incentives for
private equity holdings, more education of schoolchildren in personal
finance and for companies to use 'best practice' when establishing employee
share-ownership schemes.
ProShare has initial funding of Pounds 1m a year for three years.
The organisation said that in spite of the privatisations of the 1980s,
which increased the number of shareholders from 3m to 11m, the habit of
shareholding was not deeply rooted. Three quarters of private investors own
shares in no more than two companies and 54 per cent own shares in one.
Only 3 per cent of private investors own shares in 11 or more companies,
which is generally accepted to be necessary to build a diversified
portfolio.
The proportion of shares held by private individuals has fallen from 65.8
per cent to 21.3 per cent over the past 30 years.
Sir Peter Thompson, the former chairman of transport company NFC, is
ProShare's chairman. He said an increase in private share ownership would
improve the liquidity of the stock market and would have beneficial effects
on the economy by increasing the feeling of ownership among the workforce.
ProShare would try to provide private investors with improved information
and research and would encourage more user-friendly and lower-cost share
distribution services. Sir Peter said there was a lack of knowledge of share
ownership among the population and ProShare would aim to educate people in
the risks and rewards.
The organisation has letters of support from all three main political
parties. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said in a letter to Sir John
Harvey-Jones, ProShare's president: 'The aim of the new body, which we
share, is for a society whereby the fortunes of shareholders, management and
employees are successfully bound up together.'
Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the
chief regulator for the financial services industry, said: 'We welcome the
formation of ProShare. There is a clear need for a responsible organisation
to represent the interests of private investors.'

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Postal union faces structural shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Union of Communication Workers, the main postal union, risks the loss of
recognition and financial collapse unless it can reach internal agreement
over a complete overhaul of its structure and industrial relations strategy
next week.
More than 2,000 union officials will have, in effect, to vote themselves out
of jobs if the union is to survive, Mr Alan Tuffin, the UCW general
secretary, will tell a four-day special conference next week.
The changes will practically decimate the union's current local structure,
reducing the number of branches from about 700 to 80. The proposed reforms
are closely linked to changes in industrial relations agreements being
demanded by Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, which are due to
be in place by April.
Royal Mail is reducing its headquarters staff from 2,000 to 140 and
devolving responsibility to nine new divisions. Overall, 3,500 management
and administrative jobs will go. Also, the reporting lines will be shorter:
the number of management layers between the managing director and delivery
workers will be cut from nine to six, says management.
The UCW's structure currently reflects Royal Mail's and is based on 64
districts. Management has made it clear that from April it will refuse to
negotiate with union officials who do not relate directly to the new
divisions.
The union is heavily financially dependent on the Post Office: it is
estimated that management currently provides annually Pounds 7m to Pounds
10m worth of time off for officials to carry out union business. This is
seen by management as a high price to pay for the representation of about
120,000 UCW members in Royal Mail. Total subscription income to the UCW
totals about Pounds 8m, so the union would be unable to finance
independently the existing branch structure.
Mr Tuffin will tell the conference that the union has little choice about
accepting Royal Mail's ultimatum and he will commend the new industrial
relations agreement as having many positive features. A new national joint
consultative council, for example, will be set up which will entitle the UCW
to discuss Royal Mail's business plans with management.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Lack of training strategy criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT-funded training suffers from a lack of a clear and coherent
long-term strategy, Astra Training Services, the biggest national provider
of craft training, has told a Commons select committee.
Astra, created in a management buy-out of 45 of the 60 skillcentres
privatised by the government in 1990, said in a written submission to the
Commons employment committee that the training market had become
under-resourced. The company also said that funders were too concerned with
the short term.
It said: 'Skill shortages are already reappearing despite the recession and
rising unemployment.'
Astra said the government's strategy was to increase the commitment of
employers and individuals to meeting their own training needs, thereby
minimising its own involvement. 'This has not happened in practice, thereby
reducing total funding available and consequently the range and quality of
training provision.'
Astra estimated that government grants covered less than 50 per cent of the
total costs of training. Increased employer contributions were difficult to
achieve because most companies were cutting jobs and found it difficult to
justify taking on extra staff.
'The prospects of increasing the placement fee to compensate for the reduced
government funding are remote during a recession,' Astra said.
The company said that the auditing procedures demanded by the government
were costly to provide and were not allowed for in funding regimes.
It said it was deeply concerned that many training providers were in
financial difficulties and were leaving the training market. 'This damage to
the training infrastructure may take years to repair,' it said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT risked provoking a fresh row with the European Commission
last night by demanding assurances that UK coal and steel areas will not be
hit by planned changes to an EC loan scheme for hard-hit regions.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said he was 'much concerned'
at the damage the new rules may cause. He complained that the commission had
made the announcement without consulting member states.
His comments came only three days after the UK settled a long-running
dispute with the commission, which had blocked the release by the European
Regional Development Fund of Pounds 120m for coal-mining regions.
The latest row centres on fixed-interest, medium-term loans available under
the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty for projects which create jobs
in areas affected by redundancies in the coal and steel industries.
UK companies have been the biggest recipient under the scheme with loans in
1990 reaching Pounds 191m - almost half the community total. The Department
of Trade and Industry fears the loans available to the UK would fall under
the new arrangements.
According to commission officials, guidelines will be set for the loans,
which have previously been handed out on a case-by-case basis. One official
said: 'Now there will be more planned action and better co-ordination with
the objectives of structural funds.'
Mr Lilley said it was 'still far from clear what the commission intends'. He
understood, however, that loan applications already made would not be
affected.
Regional aid and loans under the old treaty of the European Coal and Steel
Community are overseen by different commissioners - Mr Bruce Millan and Mr
Karel Van Miert - even though their goal is often identical.

THE government yesterday rejected proposals by an advisory committee for
stricter curbs on shops that make misleading price claims and bogus special
offers, Guy de Jonquieres writes.
The government's decisions, spelled out in a speech by Mr Edward Leigh, the
consumer affairs minister, were criticised by the Retail Consortium, the
retail industry trade association, the government-backed National Consumer
Council and the Institute of Trading Standards Administration.
The committee set up by the Department of Trade and Industry to monitor the
largely voluntary scheme to prevent misleading price claims concluded that
it was being evaded. The committee recommended that the scheme be backed by
legally enforceable regulations.
Mr Leigh said that the government was not convinced that more detailed
regulations would be effective.

<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS at Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, yesterday
chose an overtime ban as the best method of pursuing a dispute with the
company over pay, Michael Smith writes.
However, the start of any ban - already sanctioned by workers in most unions
through a series of ballots - will be delayed by at least a week.
Plant conveners and local union officials are asking the company to meet
national union officials and to improve a two-year pay offer of 5 per cent
in the first year and a rise equal to the inflation rate in the second year.
They also want the EETPU electricians' union to re-ballot members in the
Luton manufacturing and parts plants on the ban.
The electricians at the two plants have already voted to accept the offer.

THE government is believed to have received three bids for British
Technology Group by yesterday, when the deadline for submissions passed.
In addition to two well-publicised consortia - one led by BTG management and
the other by Mr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics -
a group put together by Strategy International, a London consultancy, is
thought to have made an offer for the state-owned technology transfer
organisation.
A fourth consortium, headed by Sir Ronald Mason, former chief scientist at
the Ministry of Defence, withdrew on Tuesday.
The BTG management group identified CINVen, the venture capital arm of the
British Coal pension fund, as its lead investor.
Mr Ashworth heads a British-American consortium including Research
Corporation Technologies, BTG's closest US equivalent.
The DTI hopes to select the winning consortium next week and to complete the
sale before the general election.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Spens renews plea seeking formal not-guilty verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD SPENS will today renew his plea for a formal verdict of not guilty
following the Serious Fraud Office's decision not to offer further evidence
against him on fraud and false accounting charges arising out of the
Guinness takeover of Distillers.
The application, to be heard in private by Mr Justice Henry at Southwark
Crown Court, London, is made under section 17 of the 1967 Criminal Justice
Act. This provides that: 'Where a defendant . . . pleads not guilty and the
prosecutor proposes to offer no evidence against him, the court . . . may,
if it thinks fit, order that a verdict of not guilty . . . be recorded
without the defendant being given in charge to a jury, and the verdict shall
have the same effect as if the defendant had been tried and acquitted on the
verdict of a jury.'
The matter is subject to the discretion of the judge who must decide whether
the particular circumstances warrant an acquittal.
The application was first made last Friday after the SFO's announcement that
it would not force former merchant bankers Lord Spens and Mr Roger Seelig to
face a second trial as a consequence of the view of two psychiatrists that
Mr Seelig could no longer defend himself adequately.
The court was told that although Mrs Barbara Mills QC, SFO director,
remained satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to proceed against
Lord Spens, the public interest did not require him to be subjected to 'the
rigours of a second lengthy trial'.
Mr Justice Henry, before going into closed session to hear Lord Spens'
application, said there was a certain illogicality in making a section 17
order in respect of Lord Spens when the effect of a nolle prosequi in Mr
Seelig's case was simply to stay the proceedings against Mr Seelig and was
not the same as an acquittal.
Guinness Two is not the first City trial to be halted because of a
defendant's health. In August 1989 Mr Kenneth Grob, former chairman of the
Alexander Howden insurance group, was acquitted on theft charges. In January
1990 a judge refused to allow a linked trial in which Mr Grob faced further
theft charges to go ahead because Mr Grob's poor health meant he was at risk
of both physical and mental breakdown.
Also, the judge said, Mr Grob and his co-defendant in the second trial could
not get a fair trial because material witnesses had either died or were too
ill to give evidence.
Before the first Howden trial began the prosecution had been abandoned
against one defendant because he was too ill to stand trial, and a few weeks
into the trial charges were dropped against another defendant, also on
health grounds.

FT  21 FEB 92 / MoD to ground cheque flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY MONTH a group of companies hires a helicopter to collect contract
payments from the Ministry of Defence in Liverpool and fly them to London.
Among the quaint practices that have become part of British military
tradition, the 'helicopter club' is among the least known.
Its existence is revealed in a report today by the National Audit Office,
which monitors how public funds are used. But the practice is set to
disappear when the MoD introduces automatic payment transfers, due in April.
The ministry has been chewing over this change for eight years. Meanwhile,
contractors such as GEC-Marconi and Westland have organised the helicopter
run to collect payable orders from the MoD's Directorate of Accounts (Bills)
in Liverpool, rather than wait for the post.
Under current practice, the companies present bills to the MoD every fourth
Monday. Payable orders are available for large contractors at 11.30am on
Friday, and for other suppliers the next Monday. Using the mail would mean
companies waiting until Wednesday or Thursday for the funds to be cleared.
Leading contractors yesterday confirmed the arrangement - one acts on behalf
of the others to pick up payable orders often worth tens of millions of
pounds. The round-trip, usually by twin-engined helicopter, might cost
between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 5,000, and the cost can be more than covered
by earnings on overnight money markets.
The NAO found that the MoD overpaid contractors by Pounds 166m in 1989-90.
The money was subsequently recovered, but on average five months later. Half
the mistakes were because of amendments made after companies had taken their
payments, and in one in four cases there were errors in the bills sent by
contractors.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Sixth quarterly decline for economy: Recession is longest,
but not yet steepest, since Second World War
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S economy showed its sixth successive quarterly decline at the end
of last year as non-oil output shrank by 0.4 per cent.
The latest three-monthly fall in output for the whole economy, excluding oil
and gas extraction, makes this recession the longest, but not yet the
steepest, since the Second World War.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office show that in 1979-81 non-oil
gross domestic product fell for five successive quarters. The fall from peak
to trough was 6.2 per cent.
So far, since the peak in the second quarter of 1990, non-oil output has
contracted by 3.9 per cent. But the yearly decline in output in 1991 was the
steepest since 1931 when output fell 5.5 per cent. GDP is provisionally
estimated to have fallen 2.5 per cent last year compared with 1990. Non-oil
GDP fell by 2.6 per cent over the year.
The Treasury blamed yesterday's poor figures on the deterioration in the
world economy and the weakness of domestic demand.
It said: 'It is clear now that the signs of recovery we saw in the summer
and early autumn were not sustained.'
GDP including oil and gas extraction has not shown the same sustained fall
as non-oil GDP because of a slight increase in output in the third quarter
of last year. This was due to extra activity in the North Sea. Including oil
and gas, GDP was 0.3 per cent lower than in the previous quarter.
supply all the significant components of GDP - including construction,
transport, banking and business services - fell, reflecting the width of
this recession compared with the recession in the early 1980s when declining
output was concentrated in manufacturing industry. Output in the service
sector was down 0.2 per cent compared with the previous quarter and down 1.6
per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago.
Within the service sector the output of distribution, hotels and catering
fell by 0.5 per cent on the previous quarter and by 1.7 per cent compared
with the same quarter in 1990.
Manufacturing output fell by 1.2 per cent on the previous quarter and by 3.5
per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago.
The only sector to grow was energy, which increased by 2.8 per cent on the
previous quarter and by 7.6 per cent compared with the same three-month
period a year ago.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Shift seen in women's retirement age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN IN occupational pension schemes which provide for them to retire at 65
for the first time outnumber those in schemes which provide for retirement
at 60, according to a survey of pension fund managers.
The survey also showed a sharp rise in schemes with equal retirement ages
for men and women.
The 1991 annual survey of the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF),
released yesterday, showed that 42 per cent of schemes - with 51 per cent of
women in pension schemes - have a normal retirement age for women of 65.
A further 49 per cent of schemes - with 42 per cent of the women - have 60
as the retirement age for women.
Men and women have equal retirement ages in 75 per cent of schemes, compared
with 53 per cent last year. In 57 per cent of those schemes the common
retirement age is 65 and in 32 per cent it is 60.
This reflects changes in the private sector while the government is
considering the equalisation of pension ages for state pensions. The
Department of Social Security issued a consultation document on the subject
late last year.
Mr Brian MacMahon, NAPF chairman, said: 'Industry is sending a clear message
on the need to resolve the equalisation of state pension ages. The NAPF
continues to support the principle of flexible retirement with 65 as the
pivotal age.'
The survey was conducted among 778 members of the occupational pensions
industry and covered 900 pension funds. It showed that 90 per cent of those
in pension funds now receive guaranteed annual increases and a further 9 per
cent have payments reviewed annually.
For 94 per cent of those in the public sector, payments increase in line
with the retail prices index. In the private sector 45 per cent of schemes
offer limited price indexation, which is the RPI up to 5 per cent.

TRADE UNION pressure for greater control on the administration of pension
funds in the wake of the Maxwell affair intensified this week as unions
submitted evidence to the Commons select committee on social security, Diane
Summers writes.
The National Communications Union, which represents 150,000 members, the
majority of whom are in two BT pension schemes, told the committee it wanted
a range of measures in recognition that 'pensions are the deferred pay of
employees'.
The NCU submission includes proposals for regulations to guide actuaries in
the assumptions they use to value surpluses. The union says there should be
rules on the provision of information to pension scheme members about
management and investment strategies.
The Trades Union Congress has already called for pension legislation to
ensure half of a trust board is taken from the scheme's membership. The TUC
wants unions and trustees to receive information at the same time as
employers.
Other unions to submit evidence to the select committee have mostly been
directly involved in the Maxwell businesses. They include the GPMU print
union, the National Union of Journalists and Balpa, the airline pilots'
union.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Money supply figures show no sign of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PICTURE of an economy stuck in recession was underlined yesterday with
news of weak figures for the growth of money in circulation.
The Bank of England said narrow money or M0, which mostly comprises notes
and coins and indicates underlying demand pressures, grew 2.2 per cent in
the 12 months to January on a seasonally adjusted basis.
This was the smallest year-on-year growth figure for M0 since August and
followed an increase of 2.8 per cent in the 12 months to December. The
figure was 2.9 per cent in November.
M0 fell 0.2 per cent bet-ween December and January. That ended a run of four
months in which the month-on-month M0 figures showed a small rise.
M0 is among the main economic indicators tracked by the Treasury, which said
the latest figures showed inflationary pressures were weak and gave no
concrete signs of any upturn.
Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the M0 data
indicated 'a flat economy'.
Broad money or M4 - notes and coins, and sterling deposits at banks and
building societies - grew 6.2 per cent in the 12 months to January, the same
as in December. In November the figure was 5.6 per cent. M4 grew 0.4 per
cent between December and January.
Bank and building society lending in sterling rose Pounds 3.4bn last month.
City economists had predicted Pounds 2bn.
The rise is not thought to indicate any underlying increase in demand for
credit. Much of the increase is believed to have been due to short-term bank
loans taken on by companies to finance payments of corporation tax.
The British Bankers Association, which represents nine big high street
banks, said their lending increased by just Pounds 400m in January.
It added that demand for borrowing by consumers and industry 'remained
weak'.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Further action considered to recover Outhwaite losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lloyd's Names who were not included in last week's out-of-court
settlement in the Outhwaite case are examining legal action of their own in
an attempt to recover losses.
About 150 of the Outhwaite Names received legal advice this week from the
solicitors DJ Freeman and will meet on Monday evening to consider their next
move. Names are the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's.
Last week, 987 Names backed legal action against RHM Outhwaite and 80 other
agents on the grounds of negligence and breach of contract and won Pounds
116m in a negotiated settlement. Other Names on the syndicate - of whom most
appear to have been working Names (Names employed by Lloyd's agencies or
brokers) - opted not to join the action and do not benefit from the deal.
'The non-litigant Names felt legal action was not the way to proceed but are
now unhappy that their interests have been ignored,' said an Outhwaite Name
who has helped co-ordinate the action.
Mr David Tiplady of DJ Freeman said that because more than six years have
elapsed since Mr Outhwaite underwrote the loss-making US liability contracts
that were at the centre of the original legal case, future actions could be
'time-barred'. He has examined a number of technical arguments to circumvent
this obstacle.
Separately DJ Freeman, which represents three other groups of Names involved
in legal disputes with their agents, has dissociated itself from the
campaign by a separate firm of solicitors, Michael Freeman, to prevent
Lloyd's from drawing down Names' deposits in order to meet cash calls (to
fund anticipated insurance losses). Mr Michael Freeman issued motions for
the injunctions - which seek to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on Names
deposits - on Wednesday.

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian rancher and his son convicted for the murder of Mr Chico
Mendes, the ecological campaigner, will today appeal for their sentences to
be overturned, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
Mr Darli Alves da Silva and his son Darcy were sentenced in December 1990 to
19 years' imprisonment for plotting the shotgun killing of Mr Mendes in his
home in the Amazonian town of Xapuri two years earlier.
As leader of the Amazonian rubbertappers, Mr Mendes was credited with
bringing the destruction of the rainforest by landowners to the world's
attention. His fight to save the Amazon from destruction by large landowners
ultimately cost him his life and gave the international green movement its
first hero.
Mr Darcy da Silva, 23, admitted the crime but later withdrew his confession
and subsequently maintained his innocence along with his father. However, a
15-year-old boy who had worked at their ranch gave detailed testimony of
their plotting and they were convicted unanimously.
The da Silvas hope that with the fading of international attention, their
sentences may be reversed.
However, environmental campaigners believe this would cause an international
outcry which President Fernando Collor is anxious to avoid as host of the
UN-sponsored World Environment Conference in Rio de Janeiro in June.
Mr Marcio Tomas Bastos, the prosecution lawyer, said he was confident that
the appeal would not succeed, calling the defence arguments 'poor and
inconsistent'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINAL vote counts from Tuesday's New Hampshire primary have cut the tallies
of both President George Bush and his right-wing challenger, Mr Patrick
Buchanan.
After adding in candidates written in on the ballot papers, officials said
President Bush had won 53 per cent of the votes in the Republican party
primary, rather than the 58 per cent he was initially credited with.
Mr Buchanan won 37 per cent of the vote, rather than 40 per cent as
initially reported.
While the revised official count lowers Mr Buchanan's vote below the 40 per
cent barrier, it also narrows Mr Bush's margin of victory.
It does not appear to have substantially altered the view that the
television commentator had badly embarrassed the incumbent president.
For the Democratic primary, the adjustment was much smaller. Mr Paul
Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator, saw his winning total cut to 33
per cent from 34 per cent, while Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, in
second place, dropped from 26 to 25 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to restart contract negotiations between Caterpillar, the world's
largest maker of earth-moving equipment, and the United Auto Workers union
have failed.
Both sides in the three-month-old dispute appear to be digging in for a
lengthy battle.
After a brief meeting on Wednesday, the UAW rejected the company's latest
amendments to its previous contract proposal.
The union said that the modifications fell short of 'an equitable pattern
agreement'.
Pattern agreements are comparable labour contracts within an industry.
The UAW is determined to win a contract similar to that it agreed last year
with Deere &amp; Co, also a heavy equipment maker. Caterpillar said it was
'disappointed' with the UAW's decision and it warned that its latest
proposal was its final offer.
The company had asked for a return to the bargaining table this week after
recalling some 5,600 union members it had locked out last November.
The lock-out was in retaliation for a partial strike by 2,400 UAW members.
The union, however, has placed those 5,600 members on strike, bringing the
total number of strikers to 8,100.
The UAW represents a total of over 16,000 Caterpillar workers.
The union also charged that the company was engaging in 'union-busting
behaviour' by hiring a private security company which it claims has been
known to use very heavy handed tactics in labour disputes.
While the strike affects plants in four states, the economy of Illinois,
where Caterpillar is based, is being hit especially hard.

In the case of women with mastectomies or other deformities, the panel
recommended that the implants be available as long as the women agree to
take part in clinical studies.
Women wanting to have their breasts enlarged represent about 80 per cent of
the estimated 2m women with breast implants.
The panel's unanimous decision comes a month after Mr David Kessler, FDA
commissioner, issued a moratorium on the devices amid growing concern about
their safety.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Canada faces many pitfalls on its long road to unity and
stability: A conference for the broadest imaginable constituency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF POLITENESS and bonhomie were enough to solve a country's political
problems, the spirit at a series of conferences held across Canada over the
past five weekends might suggest that the threat of a Quebec breakaway has
been averted.
The broadest imaginable cross-section of Canadian society - including the
Bank of Montreal's chairman, a British Columbia Indian leader, the blind
director of the Canadian Disability Rights Council and several dozen
'ordinary' folk chosen by lottery - gathered in a different city each
weekend to swap ideas on how to prevent one of the world's most stable
democracies from breaking apart.
With the help of some careful behind-the-scenes planning, the conferences
demonstrated the famed Canadian spirit of tolerance and compromise at its
best.
In an atmosphere akin to a trade convention, the 240-odd participants split
into small working groups and lined up at microphones in plenary sessions to
politely spell out their views on the thorniest issues in Canadian politics.
Many acknowledged that the experience changed their minds, especially
towards the French-speaking province of Quebec.
Such open-mindedness has undoubtedly improved the climate for the tough
negotiations which lie ahead in the run-up to the sovereignty referendum
which Quebec is expected to hold in October. The conferences succeeded in
finding broad and, in some cases, surprising agreement on some of the issues
which will confront both French and English-speaking Canadians over the next
few months.
But Canada is by no means out of the woods. As Mr Gordon Robertson, one of
the country's most respected constitutional experts, put it at the final
meeting in Vancouver last weekend: 'We've achieved success by avoiding a lot
of the hard questions.'
The conferences, each with its own theme, were organised by Constitutional
Affairs Minister Joe Clark to counter criticism that the public was not
being adequately consulted in drawing up a new deal between Quebec and the
country's other nine provinces.
The meetings were designed to dovetail with the work of a 30-member
parliamentary committee which is gathering reaction to a series of
constitutional proposals submitted last September by Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's government.
Ottawa has suggested in essence a greater devolution of powers to Quebec in
return for greater federal authority over economic policy. The package also
includes concessions to numerous other disaffected groups. Western Canadians
would be offered a stronger voice in Parliament, and aboriginal people would
get a commitment to a measure of self-government.
Judging by the conferences, English-speaking Canada is now willing to give
Quebec constitutional recognition as a 'distinct society,' the issue which
more than any other fuels Quebec nationalism.
The conferences have cleared the way for the Senate, the upper house of
Parliament, to be converted from an appointed body into an elected body, and
for a more concerted drive to bring down the pervasive non-tariff barriers
which impede trade between the provinces.
But, in all these areas, some big gaps remain.
Quebec separatists, who have had the bit between their teeth for the past
two years, were among the few constituencies not represented at the
conferences. Even the more-flexible Quebeckers are warning that their
English-speaking compatriots may be lulling themselves into false
complacency. 'On a symbolic level, we've made progress,' said one Quebecker
in Vancouver. 'But we haven't begun to find a consensus on what powers
should be devolved.'
There is a widespread fear that the old rifts will open up again, once
specifics are put under the microscope. All the bonhomie of the past few
weeks could not hide a disagreement among English-speaking Canadians over
whether extra powers should be granted to Quebec alone, or whether they
should also be offered to any other province which wants them.
The process for approving a new deal also holds many pitfalls. The federal
government has so far given no indication how it plans to proceed once the
parliamentary committee submits its report at the end of this month.
The premiers of the nine provinces outside Quebec, who all have their own
agendas, are demanding that they be consulted more closely. Some have
promised their citizens a referendum, and even a national referendum remains
a possibility.
The only certainty is that Ottawa will avoid any proposals which involve the
unanimous ratification which the constitution required for the provisions of
the earlier, now scuppered, Meech Lake accord on the issue. Whatever deal is
drawn up will probably need approval of only six provinces in addition to
Quebec.
One of the thorniest unanswered questions is how Quebec Premier Robert
Bourassa will react. He has made his name as a political weathervane, rather
than as a courageous leader, and may be under intense pressure to reject
just about any deal which English-speaking Canada can cobble together.

<TEXT>
MR Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, pressed Argentina to keep its promise
to halt the Condor II medium-range missile project and impose tighter
controls on other sensitive projects, especially its small nuclear
technology industry.
Mr Cheney arrived yesterday in Buenos Aires as part of a tour of five Latin
American republics.
The US is leading an international campaign to halt the Condor project. The
Argentine air force has systematically evaded civilian control and is
believed to have transferred Condor designs to Middle Eastern countries.
Only last week did the air force formally transfer the Condor to a civilian
space commission.
Mr Cheney's visit comes as the region's armed forces are searching for a new
role, now that civilians govern South America. Mr Cheney gave his firm
backing to efforts to professionalise the military.
Mr Erman Gonzalez, Argentine defence minister, agreed broadly with Mr
Cheney.
The Argentines demanded that Washington resume arms sales to its armed
forces. Mr Cheney did offer to supply some equipment, but the US has
informally backed Britain's arms embargo, introduced at the time of the 1982
Falklands conflict, by withholding sensitive hardware.
Argentina wants to buy second-hand F-16 jet fighters, a move opposed by
London.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Shamir retains grip on Likud party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, last night retained his
position at the head of the ruling Likud party as it moves towards a June 23
general election.
He will face a recharged opposition Labour party under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who
ousted Mr Shimon Peres as leader on Wednesday night.
Mr Shamir, 76, who has led Likud since 1973, scored a comfortable victory,
but it was less than crushing.
He won just 46.4 per cent of the votes of the 3,000-strong Likud central
committee.
He failed to win an outright majority over his two challengers, even though
his supporters had been striving for such a majority to underscore his
authority over the party.
Mr David Levy, the Moroccan-born foreign minister, came second with a
creditable 31.2 per cent, while Mr Ariel Sharon, the hardline minister of
housing and construction, won 22.3 per cent.
The outcome was particularly satisfying for Mr Levy, a perennial rival of Mr
Shamir.
The prime minister's camp had been hoping Mr Levy would be badly enough
beaten to cripple his hopes of eventually succeeding Mr Shamir and to
undermine his claims to senior office should Likud form the next government.
Instead, Mr Levy's position appeared to have been strengthened, especially
given his complaints that the central committee was weighted in favour of Mr
Shamir's supporters.
He will go on to a ballot next week for the position of deputy leader
against Mr Sharon and Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister and Shamir ally,
who is confident of victory.
Mr Levy immediately launched a bitter attack on Mr Arens, who seems to have
suffered a setback to his ambitions eventually to overtake the foreign
minister and become the Likud party's heir apparent.
The result will also bolster Mr Levy's stance as the Likud minister most
enthusiastic about the Middle Peace talks due to resume in Washington next
week.
He has consistently struck a more conciliatory tone than the recalcitrant Mr
Shamir.
By the same token, Mr Sharon, the government minister most hostile to the
peace process, failed to register the big protest he had hoped for against
the government's participation in the negotiations.
Mr Sharon has been the driving force behind the big expansion of Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories carried out by Mr Shamir's
government over the past two years.
The settlements have brought Israel increasingly into conflict with the US,
which says they are an obstacle to the Middle East peace process.

Japan's broad money supply expanded at a record low year-on-year rate of 1.8
per cent in January, the Bank of Japan reported yesterday.
The Bank said the decline in monetary growth from 2 per cent in December was
due in part to large tax payments to the government and to a shift of money
to postal savings accounts and to money trusts with higher interest rates.

The massive UN operation proposed for Cambodia under the Paris peace accords

Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the operation, called it the most ambitious

approve a detailed blueprint prepared by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the

If so, the troop build-up will begin next month, with full deployment due by

FT  21 FEB 92 / Taiwan's central bank faces criticism

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan yesterday wrote to the island's
central bank expressing concern about a freeze on the inflow of foreign
funds for investment in equities.
The Central Bank of China has been the target of increasing criticism since
it became known this week it had imposed the freeze for an indefinite
period, apparently to reduce upward pressure on the Taiwan dollar. Bank
officials said it was a temporary measure.
The Taiwanese Finance Ministry has expressed concern at the potential
setback to its programme of financial liberalisation, and is to discuss with
the central bank the apparent conflict of interest.
Critics say the move, which has not been announced officially, could
seriously damage the island's reputation among international investors.
Local share prices have fallen and securities analysts say the risk of
investing in Taiwan has been heightened.
The central bank has come under strong pressure from exporters hurt by the
rapid appreciation in recent months of the Taiwan dollar. The currency
reached a record high of TDollars 24.9705 to the US dollar last week,
despite five consecutive interest rate cuts in as many months.
Some securities analysts say the bank's move is a gesture to exporters, and
not a serious measure against currency appreciation.
The impact of foreign investment funds on the foreign exchange markets is
likely to have been small. Only Dollars 500m has been remitted into Taiwan
since the bourse was opened to foreign investors in January 1991, compared
with a total stock market capitalisation of over Dollars 100bn.
Mr Peter Kurz, chief representative of Baring Securities in Taipei, said a
more mature foreign exchange market would cushion the Taiwan dollar against
the effects of capital inflow.
Large trade surpluses and the central bank's reluctance to cut interest
rates still further have been mainly responsible for the upward pressure on
the Taiwan dollar.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMID the excitement in the Israeli Labour party yesterday over Mr Yitzhak
Rabin's dramatic unseating of Mr Shimon Peres as leader, no-one seemed
bothered that Labour's 150,000 members seemed to be harking back 18 years
into the past.
In fact, the re-elevation of Mr Rabin to the position he first assumed on
the retirement of the late Mrs Golda Meir in 1974 was what excited many
Labour supporters.
Mr Rabin, an unspectacular prime minister until 1977 when he gave way to Mr
Peres under the cloud of a minor financial scandal, recalls the glory days
of Labour when it was Israel's pre-eminent political force.
He may be only 10 days short of his 70th birthday, but Mr Rabin's assertion
that only he can reverse Labour's 15-year eclipse by the right-wing Likud
party won over a party which still judges itself by the standards of its
past strengths.
But can he? Certainly opinion polls have consistently shown Mr Rabin to be
the most popular leader in the eyes of the electorate, usually a few points
ahead of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader and prime minister.
Interestingly, he is popular among the young.
There seems no doubt that Labour will present a more credible challenge
under Mr Rabin than under Mr Peres. The former leader was a skilful and
popular prime minister in the two years he held the post in the mid-1980s.
But he failed to beat the Likud in four elections and in recent years was
fatally associated with Labour's long decline.
The Likud made no secret that it would rather face Mr Peres in the June
election.
Mr Rabin's main pitch to the electorate is that he combines toughness on
security issues to match the Likud without the Likud's ideological
commitment to the occupied territories and Jewish settlements which has
brought Mr Shamir's government into conflict with the US, Israel's paramount
ally and bankroller.
As Chief of Staff during the 1967 Six Day War, and later as a tough defence
minister during the Palestinian uprising of the late 1980s, Mr Rabin's
credentials on the security issues are impeccable.
But, unlike Likud, he is also committed to a pragmatic settlement with the
Palestinians accepting that Israel will have to cede land in exchange for
peace. Opinion polls show most Israelis are prepared to accept such a deal.
Mr Rabin has said he would negotiate Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
None the less, the task facing him is immense. A man whose weary appearance
often betrays his years, he has to rejuvenate a party which for years has
lacked direction and trails the Likud by five points in the polls.
Not least, he must resolve the conflicts within the party over economic
policy. Immigration-induced unemployment is a prime election issue.
A Labour victory in June still looks unlikely. But a strong Labour
performance, perhaps enough to win a place in a coalition with Likud, is
possible.

FT  21 FEB 92 / De Klerk throws down gauntlet to right: Referendum for
whites aims to defuse Conservatives' threat to reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk's announcement of a referendum to determine white
support for political reform in South Africa shows considerable political
courage. It carries enormous risks.
If he wins, he will be the hero who saw off the right wing threat, clearing
the way for peaceful transition to majority rule. Should he lose, the
alternative is too ghastly to contemplate.
The return to power of a party, in this case the Conservative Party,
committed to returning to the days of grand apartheid, would provoke civil
conflict on a scale not yet seen in South Africa.
In the short term, Mr de Klerk has regained the initiative from the
right-wing CP which trounced Mr de Klerk's National Party (NP) in
Potchefstroom by-election on Wednesday. Both parties billed the by-election
as a test of white opinion on the negotiation process. The Conservative
Party's victory has allowed it to boast that it is now the voice of the
majority of whites.
Mr de Klerk's announcement will test that boast, but this time on conditions
more favourable to the president.
By-elections are great opportunities for casting a protest vote.
Potchefstroom, a small town 120km south of Johannesburg, was no exception.
There was much to protest about. White voters are nervous about the pace and
content of political reform. Compounding this anxiety are spiralling levels
of violence, three years of recession and a debilitating drought.
All these factors assisted CP candidate Mr Andries Beyers in overturning a
NP majority of 1,583 votes to win by 2,140 votes on Wednesday, a swing of 11
per cent.
However, the conservatives will find a referendum more difficult to win. Mr
Donald Simpson, a pollster at Potchefstroom University, calculates that
based on Wednesday's result, an alliance of the NP and the liberal
Democratic Party should win 59.5 per cent of the vote in a referendum to
40.5 per cent by pro-CP right-wingers.
Mr Tony Leon, Democratic Party MP, argues that voters will reward Mr de
Klerk for his bravery. 'It is a remarkable move. People will always respond
to courageous and strong leadership and he's offered both in strong doses.'
Surprising though the referendum announcement was, the reasoning is not hard
to discern.
The CP believes the Potchefstroom victory merely proves its contention that
while the NP is negotiating on behalf of whites at the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa, the CP truly represents most whites.
The National Party knew it faced a haemorrhage of support to the right while
having precious little to deliver to the electorate in terms of a clear
political future, or better economic conditions.
Mr de Klerk turned the tables. The CP will have to replace electoral
triumphalism with a reasoned defence of its view of the future. This
prospect fills the NP with confidence. At an election meeting last week in
Potchefstroom, Mr de Klerk said voters should not vote for the policies they
prefer, but for the policy which can succeed. He described CP policies as 'a
suicide path for Afrikaners, whites and all other minorities'.
Mr de Klerk said there were two issues facing white voters: which party will
they trust to negotiate for them, and whose policy can best secure their and
their children's future. The NP is sure to stress in the weeks ahead the
CP's inability to deliver on either score.
But the National party will be aware too of the need to communicate much
more closely with its followers about what is happening at the Codesa talks
on democratic reform; in particular, that the government is not planning to
hand over power.
Commentators have recently likened Mr de Klerk to General Jan Smuts, the
South African statesman respected abroad but rejected by the electorate at
home in 1948. Mr de Klerk will be determined to prove the comparison
invalid.
Ironically the ANC - which is opposed to any racially-based referendum  - is
likely to play an important role assisting Mr de Klerk. It will be forced to
support him, if for no other reason than the fact that there is no prospect
of negotiating with a Conservative government.
Professor Mervyn Frost of Natal University notes that on the one hand the
ANC will have to be reasonably low-key, so as not to frighten white voters
away from the NP through guilt by association.
On the other, they can considerably strengthen the National Party's hand by
issuing mollifying statements on issues such as nationalisation, white
schools, and job security in the civil service. The ANC will not like having
its hand forced in this way, but it has little choice.

AUSTRALIA'S Labor government faces a difficult by-election following the
resignation from parliament yesterday of Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime
minister.
Mr Hawke's retirement follows his defeat by Mr Paul Keating, the former
Treasurer (finance minister) in a bitterly fought Labor leadership battle in
December.
Labor is expected to lose Mr Hawke's suburban Melbourne seat in the
by-election, which must be held within three months. Mr Hawke had a majority
of 8 per cent at the last general election in 1990, but Labor's popularity
has plunged over the past 18 months as the government has struggled to cope
with recession and rising unemployment.
The government is likely to put off the poll as long as possible in the hope
that the economy will begin to recover following a statement to be made by
Mr Keating next week.
However, a bad result could further damage the party's fading chances of
winning another three years in power at the next general election, which
must be held by mid-1993.
Mr Hawke said he had decided to resign because his growing business
commitments would not allow him to continue to represent his constituency
'in good conscience'. The former prime minister is understood to be
negotiating with Mr Kerry Packer's Channel Nine television station to
present a series of programmes about world leaders he met while in office.
He has appointed IMG, the personality management group which represents Mr
Greg Norman, the Australian golfer, to seek other business interests in the
media and the international lecture circuit.
Mr Hawke also said he wanted to spend more time with his family,
particularly his wife Hazel, who underwent an operation in Sydney this week
to remove a benign tumour from her brain.
Mr Keating said Mr Hawke's eight-year term as prime minister - Australia's
second longest - had been a period of 'historic change' in which the nation
was transformed into a modern diversified economy.
However, there was unease among some Labor leaders about the style and
timing of Mr Hawke's announcement, which was made in an interview on Channel
Nine, for which he was paid.

VIOLATIONS of human rights by the present Iraqi regime are so grave and so
widespread that few parallels can be found since the Second World War, a UN
human rights report says.
Presenting his report yesterday to the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in
Geneva, Mr Max van der Stoel, the special rapporteur for Iraq, said
exceptional measures were called for.
'Every day, Iraqi citizens are in danger of losing their lives. Scarcely a
day passes without executions or hangings. In such a situation, mere
condemnations are not enough.'
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd warned last night that the Gulf war
allies would not 'stand idly by' while President Saddam Hussein continued to
repress Iraqis and violated UN resolutions.
He said: 'Still he cheats: UN inspectors have found huge covert programmes
for weapons of mass destruction.
'Saddam's inner circle prevent supplies from reaching the Kurdish population
in northern Iraq, or the Shia in the southern marshes. The blockade of the
North is a clear violation of the Security Council that demanded an end to
repression in Iraq.'
In his UN report Mr van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister, urged
the dispatch of a team of human rights monitors to Iraq which would remain
as long as necessary. 'A resolute effort must be made to save human lives,'
he said.
The report catalogues summary executions, arbitrary detention of political
and religious opponents, enforced disappearances, and routine use of torture
to extract confessions. 'The number of victims  .. is certainly in the
hundreds of thousands,' it says.
Replying to Mr van der Stoel's remarks, Mr Mohammed Al-Douri, Iraq's chief
representative to the 53-member Human Rights Commission, said Iraq strongly
rejected the report as part of the west's propaganda campaign against the
country.
A commission established by the UN Security Council to determine
compensation payable by Iraq to victims in the invasion and occupation of
Kuwait is recommending surprisingly low ceilings - only Dollars 30,000 per
individual and Dollars 60,000 per family, Michael Littlejohns reports from
New York.
The Commission reported last night that the Iraqis want a five-year grace
period before making any payment into the UN fund to which claims will be
addressed. Officials said these were bound to run into thousands, but they
did not have a precise estimate.
In seeking a delay, Iraq said it must have time to meet its essential
domestic needs, including repairing an estimated Dollars 194bn of damage
done by the coalition forces.

TOUGH new curbs against abuse of export aid to buy market share in
developing countries should not be allowed to reduce the amount of help for
deserving cases, the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) has warned.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary-general, said the changes, which came
into effect on February 15, would have the effect of limiting the use of
tied-aid credits for projects normally able to raise commercial finance.
The aim was to channel aid to projects useful to development but genuinely
unable to raise money elsewhere, to ensure aid money was additional to,
rather than competing against, funding on market terms, officials said.
'I urge commercial lenders and export credit insurance agencies to accept
this challenge by expanding credits and coverage for commercially attractive
projects in developing countries so that total flows of resources to these
countries will expand,' Mr Paye said.
This reflects OECD fears that banks will not rush in to fill the gap likely
to be left now that tied aid is no longer allowed for commercial projects,
officials added.
The rules also ban use of any tied aid - assistance linked to the purchase
of the donor's exports - to better-off developing countries, broadly defined
as those with per capita GNP of over Dollars 2,465 in 1990. This includes
economies such as Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The ban on aid to
commercially-viable projects applies to poorer countries.
For the first time, OECD members are allowed to vet each others' aid
projects in advance to ensure fair play. The transition has been
controversial, as shown by a row between the US and Spain over an attempt by
Madrid to rush through two large credit lines for Mexico and Venezuela,
before the rules came into effect.
Both recipients are theoretically ineligible for aid under the new scheme.
Attempts to settle the row have made no clear progress, say officials.
Meanwhile, the US Export-Import Bank has rushed through a Dollars 60m
(Pounds 34.2m) tied-aid agreement for AT&amp;T switching equipment for
Indonesia, which would not qualify for help of this kind under the new
rules. This was to show the US was ready to go ahead with such deals if
other countries did the same, a bank official said.

FT  21 FEB 92 / MEPs to debate row over Irish abortion

THE EUROPEAN Parliament's legal affairs committee is to debate the Irish
court decision to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim having an abortion in
the UK, as pressure grows for the ban to be challenged under EC law.
Mr Willy Rothley, German Socialist MEP and vice-chairman of the committee,
described the ban - which has reopened the fierce debate on abortion in
Ireland - as 'an act of barbarism'. The legal affairs committee will discuss
the ruling next week to find out whether it can be overturned by the
European Court of Justice.
The girl's parents yesterday appealed to the Irish Supreme Court against the
ban. A hearing is likely next week.
MEPs are concerned that the judgment might contravene EC treaty obligations
on the free movement of people and services in the Community. 'The free
movement of citizens is a fundamental principle of the Community and must be
safeguarded,' said Mr Rothley yesterday.
The Irish High Court said in its ruling that the treaty obligations could be
overruled in this case because of 'public policy' considerations.
A spokesman for the European Commission said yesterday that the case did not
appear to fall under EC jurisdiction, but added that the Commission was
awaiting a definitive legal opinion.
Concerns have also been voiced that Irish liberals may vote against
ratification of the Maastricht treaty on political and economic union.
The text includes a special protocol promising that EC law will not affect
the application of Ireland's constitutional 'right-to-life' amendment.

FT  21 FEB 92 / 'Out-of-area' issue seen to threaten Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATO'S SURVIVAL may be at risk unless members are prepared to contemplate
the use of forces outside allied territory, at least in defence of democracy
in the countries of central and eastern Europe, a top alliance official
warned yesterday.
Mr Michael Legge, who was responsible for drawing up Nato's new strategic
doctrine, approved by all 16 members at a summit in Rome in November, said
he was disappointed at the lack of commitment on 'out-of-area' operations.
Several European members were reluctant to see allied forces employed
outside the Nato area 'in any circumstances'. But, speaking at the Royal
United Services Institute in London yesterday, he called on allies to extend
the boundaries of possible action 'at least throughout Europe'.
Failure to do so, he said, would put Nato's credibility at risk in public
opinion and undermine support for the alliance in the US. He emphasised that
any actions would not necessarily have to be under a Nato flag.
Mr Legge, a Briton, has been Nato's assistant secretary-general for defence
planning and policy since 1988. He oversaw the work on redefining the
alliance's purpose and military guidelines following its reassessment in
1990 of the threat from what was then the Warsaw Pact.
The agreed text of the alliance's new Strategic Concept acknowledged the
existence of 'risks of a wider nature' than direct threats to allies' own
territory. But it made no provision for dealing with them beyond a passing
reference to existing arrangements for consultation and co-ordination among
allies.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council is expected to approve a formal
resolution today launching the long-awaited international peacekeeping force
for Yugoslavia, the first ever in continental Europe.
However, the cost of the proposed year-long operation was estimated last
night to be as much as Dollars 635m, raising questions whether the UN could
afford this and the possibility that members might insist on cuts. Earlier
estimates did not exceed Dollars 400m.
The increase resulted from proposals by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, for a 40 per cent increase in force personnel to about
14,000, including 530 police.
A financial document was promised yesterday and then withheld until further
discussions could be held with the US, Britain, France, Russia and China,
the Security Council's permanent members, which must foot much of the bill.
Current peacekeeping operations have already created severe financial
problems for the UN as many members have failed to pay their contributions.
The US is the biggest delinquent.
With the Cambodia peacekeeping operation expected to cost the UN close to
Dollars 2bn in the next 12 months, questions now are being asked as to
whether the organisation may be getting out of its depth financially.

FT  21 FEB 92 / FT wins newspaper of the year award
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Financial Times has been named newspaper of the year in Granada
Television's What The Papers Say annual awards.
The judges praised the paper's 'new responsiveness' in its coverage of the
Gulf war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and a series of business
scandals, notably the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International and the Maxwell empire.
Although parts of the newspaper remained primarily of interest to the
specialist reader, the judges were impressed by the 'almost novelistic
newsiness in the way some of the scandals were reported.'
The award, said the judges, recognised the FT's 'remarkable energy, its new
investigative and news-gathering strength and its visibly broadened appeal.'
Mr Richard Lambert, the editor of the FT, received the award from Mr Roy
Hattersley, the shadow home secretary. 'This is a great and welcome tribute
to an outstanding team of journalists,' Mr Lambert said.
This is the 35th year in which the press awards have been made by Granada,
whose What The Papers Say is the longest running weekly programme on British
television.
The programme named Martin Woollacott of the Guardian journalist of the
year, citing the 'dignity and enormous influence' of his reporting from
Kurdistan.
Other awards went to Private Eye, the satirical journal, (magazine of the
year); Phil Davison of the Independent (foreign correspondent); Anne Leslie
of the Daily Mail (feature writer); John Naughton of the Observer (critic)
and Matt Pritchett of the Daily Telegraph (cartoonist).

FT  21 FEB 92 / Labour pledges to scrap Tories' health reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party pledged yesterday to abolish the government's National
Health Service reforms, clearing the way for a general election
fight-to-the-finish on the NHS.
Labour is committed to end the internal market on which the government's
changes are based, scrap GP fundholding and return self-governing hospitals
to health authority control. A Labour government would also restore free eye
and dental checks.
Mr Neil Kinnock, party leader, announcing Labour's health policy, expressed
determination to put improvement of the NHS and other public services ahead
of tax cuts.
The party's decision to fight the election on a clear pledge to wipe away
all the central features of last year's biggest-ever reforms of the NHS,
rather than adapt them, reflects continuing con-fidence that Labour enjoys a
strong lead over the Con-servatives on health issues.
Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, responded defiantly to Labour's
plans by announcing the expansion of GP fundholding, one of the most
controversial aspects of the reforms.
From next year, fundholders will be able to buy not only hospital treatment
for their patients, but district nursing, health visiting and other services
as well.
Labour's proposals retain the spirit of a split between the financing of
health care and its provision which is at the heart of the government's NHS
reforms. But this would be achieved through agreements between health
authorities and hospitals rather than in a competitive market. Incentive
funds would be introduced to try to ensure that targets were met and
performance improved.
Some health care specialists question whether this would impose enough
discipline on hospitals and authorities for maximum efficiency. The
Institute of Health Services Management said that it thought the proposal
would be a 'retrograde step in the light of experiences over the past year'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, said the Labour plans had 'three key
strengths' which the Conservatives could not match. They would treat people
by clinical need rather than purchasing power; enable patients rather than
managers to decide where they should be treated; and increase NHS efficiency
by cutting out the 'waste of creating a commercial market'.
The Labour programme emphasises the importance of developing health
promotion and non-hospital based primary and community care.
The Government has shelved plans to cut the fees paid to dentists for
National Health Service work, averting a threatened mass exodus from the
NHS.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Budget for expansion agreed by cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET gave the go-ahead yesterday for an expansionary pre-election
Budget against the backdrop of the longest UK recession since the Second
World War and an opinion poll putting Labour in the lead.
Mr John Major hinted at a significant increase in public borrowing to fund
tax cuts expected in the Budget on March 10 - but collided with Mr Neil
Kinnock, Labour leader, on spending priorities in an increasingly excited
atmosphere at Westminster.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed non-oil output in the UK
fell for the sixth successive quarter. Mr Kinnock turned a past Tory
election slogan on the prime minister to claim: 'It's official - Majorism
isn't working.' Later he said, borrowing for tax cuts was 'a confidence
trick'.
The NOP poll for The Independent today puts Labour on 42 per cent, four
points ahead of the Tories, with the Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent. For
the first time in recent months, it also shows more voters believe the
Conservative are not competent at economic management than competent.
In the same poll last month, Labour led the Tories by 43-40.
Labour strategists said election battle lines were clearer. Voters faced a
choice between basic rate tax cuts under the Tories or more health service
spending and incentives for industry under Labour.
In the Commons, Mr Major, who has brought Mr Michael Heseltine, environment
secretary, into a campaign 'A team' on election strategy, said the
government had spent 'in excess' of the real health spending increases
promised by Labour at the 1987 election. He again insisted that a world
economic slowdown was to blame for the UK's recession.
In an interview with The Daily Telegraph this week, Mr Major said it would
be 'prudent' to increase borrowing in a recession. Last night, however, Sir
Alan Walters, economic adviser to former prime minister Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, undermined Mr Major's stance. He said on Channel Four that Mr
Nigel Lawson, former chancellor, was '70 per cent' to blame for the UK's
economic problems.
The cabinet discussed the Budget for 80 minutes, including a presentation of
forecasts by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The figures for gross
domestic product exacerbated the 'mood of realism' described by Downing
Street.
Excluding oil and gas, GDP fell by 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of
1991 compared with the previous quarter. This brought the overall year on
year decline for 1991 to 2.5 per cent, the sharpest yearly contraction since
1931.
Downing Street acknowledged that lower-than-forecast growth would mean the
public sector borrowing requirement as a share of GDP would be 'somewhat
higher' than forecast in the Autumn Statement.
An official statement said cabinet ministers 'reaffirmed their commitment to
prudent management of the public finances'. However, a significant majority
of cabinet minsters expects a 1p cut in the basic income tax rate as the
showpiece for an April 9 election - likely to be called before the end of
Budget week.
As ministers pressed Mr Lamont to reconcile the Treasury's insistence on
fiscal prudence with the political need for tax cuts, Mr Chris Patten, the
party chairman, repeated the government's commitment to balance the Budget
'over the economic cycle'. Mr Patten refused to say whether that would imply
an obligation to wipe out the need for public borrowing during the lifetime
of the next parliament.
Mr Lamont, who emerged again from Budget purdah to join Mr Patten at a
Westminster press conference attacking Labour's tax plans, refused to answer
questions on the government's economic strategy.
Colleagues, however, said the chancellor was concerned to lower expectations
of a tax-cutting 'bonanza'.
In spite of Mr Patten's remarks, some cabinet members are convinced the
commitment to a balanced Budget will have to be dropped after the election
in order to meet pledges on spending and tax.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said there were 'more ministers
spray-painting rosy pictures than there are taking the tough action we
need'.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk confronted South African whites yesterday with a
stark choice of continuing his political reforms or facing his resignation.
In an attempt to seize the political initiative after his National party
suffered a crushing by-election defeat at the hands of the rightwing
Conservative party, he announced plans for an early whites-only referendum
on political reform and said he would resign if the vote failed to go his
way.
His move amounts to a challenge to the Conservative party to muster
widespread opposition to the reform programme, which has led to multi-party
negotiations on a constitution which will permit one-person one-vote
elections.
The National and Conservative parties had elevated Wednesday's Potchefstroom
by-election to the status of a barometer of the views of white voters on
constitutional change. The CP turned a 1989 NP majority of 1,583 into a
2,140-vote defeat, a result which allowed it to claim that it was now the
party which spoke for the majority of whites.
Mr de Klerk said it had become crucial to decide 'whom white voters wish to
entrust with negotiations on South Africa's constitutional future.
'If I lose the referendum, I will resign, the government will resign and
there will be an election,' Mr de Klerk said.
The referendum will be held before the end of next month. Mr de Klerk said
blacks should not view it as a white veto on political reform, but conceded
that democracy talks could be derailed if he lost.
Mr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the CP, said the party accepted the
referendum challenge 'on condition . . . that the playing field is level.'
He insisted on equal access to state-controlled radio and television and a
say in drafting the text of the question to be posed in the referendum.
The African National Congress, which is negotiating a new constitution with
the government, condemned the notion of a whites-only referendum as racist
and said the poll would delay reform.
The government will announce next week the date of the referendum and the
question to be asked. National party sources suggest it is more likely to be
phrased in terms of principles rather than personalities or parties.
South African financial markets fell steeply following Mr de Klerk's
announcement. There are fears a victory for the CP, committed to returning
to full apartheid, could provoke civil conflict on a scale not yet seen in
South Africa.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Appointments: RPC chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RPC Containers, the rigid plastics packaging company that has had four
different owners in as many years, has chosen Lindsay Mackinlay, an
ex-Rowntree man, as its non-executive chairman. He takes over from Charles
Nicholson, a director at CINVen, RPC's lead institutional investor.
Mackinlay, now 55, has made something of a career of assuming non-executive
roles since he stepped down as finance director of Rowntree when Nestle
acquired the confectioner in 1989.
With current directorships including Argos, Steetley, Henry Barrett Group,
and Bradford and Bingley Building Society, Mackinlay had turned down various
other offers before accepting the RPC assignment, says chief executive Ron
Marsh; he believes Mackinlay may have been attracted by a management buyout
company that has easily surpassed its first year targets despite depressed
conditions in many of its markets.
Mackinlay's main contribution to the board will be his financial expertise
and City contacts; the talents of the rest of the executive directors,
originally managers from the plastics packaging division of Reed
International, lie in other directions. If RPC decides to go for a stock
market flotation - rather than selling out, as Reedpack did within two years
to a Swedish group, a buyout from which formed RPC - he will be particularly
useful.

The appointment makes her the only woman head of sales of a big UK life

has a mandate to build it up to 700 by the end of 1992.
Johns, an American with three children, progressed from financial planner at

<TEXT>
Arthur Walsh, the 65-year-old chairman of Telemetrix who took over last
December, is reshuffling his board to create a 'young and enthusiastic team'
to take the information systems and electronics group through the next
decade and beyond.
He has picked Tim Curtis, main board director of Unitech, old Etonian,
Cambridge graduate and Harvard MBA as his new chief executive. Curtis is 49
and replaces Roy Cotterill, nearly 56, and credited with being the main
architect of the company's recovery since 1989. Cotterill stays on as an
executive member of the board.
With the need for both acquisitions and disposals in the near future very
much in his mind, Walsh is also bringing in on to the board a former
colleague from STC, the telecommunications group. Kenneth Gardener, recently
vice president, mergers and acquisitions at Northern Telecom Europe,
previously worked for Walsh at STC, and impressed him with his negotiating
skills, notably in the divestment of 80 per cent of ICL to Fujitsu.
Cyril Newnham, who has been on the board of Telemetrix for nearly two years
and is chairman of the US subsidiary GTI, is resigning to pursue his own
business interests in the UK.

FT  21 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): New York reinforces
continent's optimism

A STRONG opening on Wall Street underpinned the continent's optimism, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS continued its upsurge as investors scrambled to get into what they
perceived as an accelerating market. The CAC 40 index rose 35.81 or 1.9 per
cent to 1,951.22 in heavy turnover of FFr4.8bn. US brokers were reported to
be trading actively in futures. Cyclical stocks continued to rise, with
Ciments Francais, up FFr28 at FFr314 with 37,175 shares traded and Pechiney
International adding FFr8 to FFr192.
Even Credit Foncier de France, generally regarded as a conservative mortgage
bank, jumped FFr53 to FFr985 with 42,520 shares traded. Also in the
financial sector, Suez rose FFr8.80 to FFr336.20 on 891,325 shares.
The department store, Printemps, fell FFr45 to FFr862 after a government
prosecutor indicated that the government did not have a problem with Pinault
only bidding for two-thirds of the company.
FRANKFURT was positive in the pre-bourse after a strong New York bond market
kept bunds stable. Dealers reported futures-related buying in cyclicals,
anticipating the closing of DTB futures and options contracts today.
The DAX index pierced 1,700, at its sixth attempt over four weeks, closing
15.39 higher at 1,703.18. The FAZ index rose 4.57 to 694.05 at midsession.
In the post-bourse, the DAX future broke through 1,720 and held it to
register 1,724.5, its highest for seven months.
Volume climbed to DM7.4bn from DM5.3bn. Cars recovered from Wednesday's
weakness, Daimler rising DM11.40 to DM746 on its indication of higher
profits for 1991.
The dollar-oriented mechanical engineering sector showed some useful gains
with KHD DM5.80 higher at DM153.50, Kugelfischer up DM6.50 to DM251.50, and
Linde DM126 better at DM794.
MILAN closed slightly higher but shares in Cementir and Caltagirone, the
construction group which on Wednesday won its bid for a 52 per cent stake in
the cement company, both weakened. The Comit index rose 1.81 to 533.08 in
turnover estimated at near Wednesday's L83bn.
Cementir resumed trading after its one-day suspension and fell L160 or 5.8
per cent to L2,610 as operators who had bought shares in the hope of a
takeover battle sold out. The sale of the state's holding in Cementir has
been rushed through before legislation protecting minority shareholders in
takeovers takes effect. Caltagirone fell L610 or 13.2 per cent to L3,995 as
the market took the view that the company had paid far too much for the
stake - the L480bn price tag is about double the current market value.
Montedison continued to gain, adding L16 to L1,372 with some 4m shares
exchanged, in options-related buying.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by a strong dollar. The CBS Tendency Index rose 1.7 to
125.4.
Royal Dutch fell Fl 1.60 to Fl 140.50 after announcing a 33 per cent fall in
1991 net profits. Analysts were disappointed at the results, in spite of an
increase in its dividend.
Elsevier rose on foreign buying, closing up Fl 3.8 or 3.4 per cent at Fl
113.50. Hagemeyer, the trading group, gained Fl 2.00 to Fl 149.00 after
reporting a 26 per cent rise in 1991 net profit. Unilever recorded another
all-time high, closing up Fl 3.30 or 1.7 per cent at Fl 195.50.
MADRID found renewed confidence by midsession. The general index closed up
0.81 at 261.04 in turnover estimated at Pta18bn. High volume in Telefonica
continued with some 3.2m shares traded, against 3.5m, following news that
unions had rejected the company's pension plan. It closed down Pta20 at
Pta1,200, having lost Pta55 at one stage. The construction and utility
sectors were both strong, with Cubiertas up Pta460 or 4 per cent at
Pta11,890.
STOCKHOLM was disappointed with the 36 per cent jump in profits at Astra,
the pharmaceuticals group, and with the company's forecast of a 20 to 25 per
cent rise in sales and profits for the current year. The B shares fell SKr12
to SKr558. The Affarsvarlden General index closed 3.7 lower at 929.4.
ZURICH's SPI index closed 8.1 higher at a new 1992 high of 1,130.6.
Alusuisse bearers topped the actives list, closing SFr18 higher at SFr988.
Oerlikon, the arms manufacturer, put on another SFr17 to SFr345, taking its
rise on the week to SFr43 ahead of a news conference next Wednesday.
BRUSSELS saw the non-ferrous metals company, Acec-Union Miniere, add BFr95
or 4.2 per cent to BFr2,345 in active trade of 27,650 shares. The Bel-20
index rose 9.31 to 1,173.99 in turnover of BFr851m.
ISTANBUL fell to its lowest level this year as the rising dollar prompted
investors to shift funds into the foreign exchange market. The 75-share
index lost 180.66 or 4.3 per cent to 3,993.56.
OSLO, lifted by stronger prices for North Sea oil, closed up 2.36 to 416.22
in turnover of NKr213.2m. Norsk Hydro, which reported a 1991 net loss of
NKr498m, rose NKr1 to NKr140.

FT  21 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Fiscal reform triggers recovery in
Athens - But the market has performed less spectacularly than in 1990
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greek stockbrokers have been making good use of their time since last summer
when the Athens Stock Exchange went into a steady decline, ending 1991
underperforming Europe by some 23 per cent.
Many of the 50 brokerage houses set up research departments with the result
that, for the first time, a steady stream of information is available on the
150 listed companies.
'Investors were taking decisions on the basis of little more than hearsay.
Now we can offer them real analysis, even technical analysis,' says Mr John
Markopoulos of Sigma Securities, one of several brokerages which issue a
weekly report for investors on economic and financial developments.
Whether they are studying fundamentals or not, Greek investors have
certainly grown more cautious. When the market finally turned upwards last
month, the rise was much less spectacular than it had been in previous
recoveries.
The Athens General index started the year at 801.9, near to its lowest level
in 1991 when it declined by almost 30 per cent, reflecting a fall in
confidence as the government's economic stabilisation programme began to be
felt.
Prices climbed steadily to reach 1,009.4 early in February, before receding:
the general index closed at 942.27 yesterday. Turnover has risen since the
start of the year from Dr30m (Dollars 5.1m) daily to more than Dr3bn.
In one hectic day's trading, just over Dr5bn changed hands, briefly
recalling the heady days of 1990 when the general index rose by some 300 per
cent before losing more than half of that gain. However, turnover has now
fallen back, touching Dr1.5bn earlier this week.
The recovery was triggered by the government's announcement of a fiscal
reform package that would reduce corporation tax from 42 to 35 per cent, as
well as cutting the tax on share dividends from 45 to 32 per cent.
Greek companies are also being required to revalue fixed assets this year
and to capitalise their reserves, but this measure will be tax-exempt. As a
result, a number of companies are expected to make scrip issues later this
year.
In spite of the gloomy overall picture in 1991, affected by economic
weakness and predictions that the recession would continue well into the
following year, banks, leasing companies and food processors all performed
strongly. These sectors are expected to ride out the recession more easily
than most companies, say analysts.
Interest rates on three and six-month treasury bills, the government's
preferred instrument for financing the public sector deficit, are forecast
to come down this year as inflation gradually slows: it stood at 18.1 per
cent in January and is forecast to fall to 13.5 per cent by the end of the
year. However, it will take more than expectations of tax cuts and declining
interest rates to keep the market buoyant.
Mr Markopoulos says: 'Every time there is a dip, the institutional investors
start moving in. It is still very much a buyer's market.'
Although interest rates still hover around 26 per cent, few companies are
coming to the market for funds. Last year, there were 14 new listings and 28
rights issues, together raising a total of Dr157bn. So far this year not a
single prospectus has been issued.
Instead of tapping the bourse for fresh capital, Delta Dairies, a leading
milk and fruit juice producer, recently decided to raise Dr2.2bn through a
five-year corporate bond. The issue was taken up entirely by banks and
institutional investors.
Nevertheless, exchange officials are predicting more activity when automated
trading is launched, probably by the summer. The open outcry system now in
use will be phased out over the summer after screens are introduced on the
trading floor and in stockbrokers' offices.
Mr Nikitas Niarchos, the bourse chairman, says: 'Computerised trading will
boost confidence by improving transparency. At the moment, people complain
because they do not know what price they are buying at.'

FT  21 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on hopes of
early cut in discount rate
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF an imminent cut in the discount rate following news that money
supply growth had fallen to its lowest level ever prompted small-lot buying
by institutions, and the Nikkei average rose for the first time in three
trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average, which fell to a 16-month low on Wednesday, closed
153.62 up at 20,771.92 after a day's high of 20,837.36 and low of 20,621.00.
Traders were relieved by the absence of selling, as most market participants
previously feared that the index would drop below the critical 20,000 level.
Volume dipped to 190m shares from 200m. Most investors remained on the
sidelines, anticipating price fluctuations caused by options execution.
Advances led declines by 499 to 394, with 213 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks, which fell to a five-year low on
Wednesday, rallied 2.79 to 1,523.41. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
improved 2.08 to 1,165.61.
Expectations of a cut in the discount rate emerged after money supply growth
for January was announced at 1.8 per cent, a record low. News that more
companies were reducing their earnings forecasts also highlighted the
continued weakness of the economy.
Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities said: 'The market needs an overt
declaration from financial authorities that economic conditions are worse
than they expected.' He added that concrete measures such as lower interest
rates and a fiscal spending programme would provide support for the market.
Futures and bond prices were buoyed by the Bank of Japan's intervention in
the foreign exchange market to support the yen against the dollar. Although
the US unit closed higher against the yen, market participants were
encouraged by the central bank's action.
Toshiba weakened Y27 to Y596 after the company said it expected a 60 per
cent plunge in pre-tax profits for the current year to March. The
announcement dragged NEC down Y20 to Y1,030 and Hitachi Y3 easier to Y845.
Banking stocks continued to lose ground on corporate selling. Industrial
Bank of Japan declined Y90 to Y2,410 and Fuji Bank Y30 to Y1,960.
Speculative issues advanced on short-term buying. Japan Storage Battery rose
Y40 to Y1,030 and Tamura Electric Works added Y210 at Y1,880. Japan
Securities Finance, a private company with close ties to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange and the only company which can lend stock for margin trading, said
yesterday that it had put Clarion on its watch list due to the large
outstanding balance on margin trading. It will also limit stock lending on
Tamura Electric Works due to concern about speculative trading.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 105.87 to 22,460.97 in volume of 155.8m
shares. Dai-Dan, the air conditioning systems manufacturer, put on Y100 to
Y3,400 on projections of a double-digit rise in pre-tax profits for the
current year.
Roundup
THE REGION provided some winners yesterday, although Kuala Lumpur found it
hard to improve on its recent gains.
NEW ZEALAND finished broadly higher after private clients bought smaller
companies, especially export-related issues likely to benefit from the
relatively weak New Zealand dollar and the expected recovery in commodity
prices.
The NZSE-40 index moved ahead 17.23 or 1.1 per cent to 1,490.88. Turnover
was steady at NZDollars 27.3m.
TAIWAN rallied in brisk trading on a government move to delay a decision on
the dissolution of the largest local opposition party.
The weighted index appreciated 155.90 or 3.2 per cent to 4,995.32 as
turnover expanded to TDollars 40.85bn from TDollars 24.78bn.
MANILA steadied after Wednesday's drop, the composite index ending only 1.65
easier at 1,139.36. Turnover rose to 48m pesos from 41m.
The public offering of International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI) has
caused funds to be withdrawn from the market. ICTSI is offering 71.64m
shares worth 480m pesos at 6.70 pesos per share. The offering started on
February 17 and will end on February 28.
HONG KONG eased back in thin trading. The Hang Seng index dipped 9.70 to
4,716.00 in turnover of HKDollars 1.87bn, against Wednesday's HKDollars
1.90bn.
Profit-taking hit utilities hardest, with China Light losing 20 cents to
HKDollars 26.80 and Hong Kong Electric giving up 50 cents to HKDollars
15.70.
SEOUL was depressed by reports of a tax probe into all subsidiaries of the
Hyundai Group. The composite index fell 15.47 to 632.66 as turnover dropped
to Won221.2bn from Won259.3bn.
KUALA LUMPUR was restrained by profit-taking in the wake of the strong
recent rally. The composite index was up just 0.34 at 619.06 in turnover of
MDollars 261m, after MDollars 285m.
BOMBAY rose to a record high on hopes of freer rupee conversion. The BSE
index jumped 66.99 to 2,449.06.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fall in US wheat sewings may
lead to spring surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTED decline in the acreage of US farmland planted with winter
wheat might encourage farmers to increase their planting of spring wheat, a
US Agriculture Department economist said yesterday.
The drop in winter wheat acreage to 50.22m acres, along with tight US
stocks, has helped boost wheat prices in recent weeks. Instead of the 4 to 8
per cent increase in wheat sewings the industry had predicted this year as a
result of a steep reduction in the 1991 US acreage set-aside programme,
farmers created a stir in the commodity markets by reporting a 1.6 per cent
decline in planted acreage.
'Because prices have gone so high, we can expect higher planting of spring
wheat,' the USDA economist said. 'There could be late planting of winter
wheat in places like Kansas, which may not be high yielding but could have a
little effect on supply.'
Wheat farmers in Texas and parts of Oklahoma, who often use their wheat
acreage for grazing or haymaking, may be encouraged by the high prices to
harvest it, thus adding further to wheat supplies.
Cargill, the giant US grain house, is attributing the decline in winter
wheat acreage to the US farm programme. 'Where is all the land that was in
production in the early 1980s,' it asked in its recent bulletin. 'In some
cases, it sits idle. . . the Conservation Reserve Program has locked up 35m
acres, making them unavailable for planting at nearly any price. 'The
reduction - nearly 11m acres once devoted to wheat - simply means the US
productive base is significantly smaller, capped at current levels.'
According to Cargill, USDA 'tinkering' with set-asides has disrupted US
supplies, jeopardised market reliability and interfered 'with the few
remaining price signals that come from the market rather than the
government'.
Other farm organisations have differing explanations. An official for the
Family Farm Coalition said many farmers had difficulty borrowing operating
capital; others had been going out of farming without selling their land.
The USDA, in a report still to be released, attributed some of the decline
in planted wheat acreage to the 'flexibility' provision in the 1990 farm
legislation, which allows farmers to plant whatever crop they want on 15 per
cent of their land and still receive production subsidies. However, because
they get no payment on that 15 per cent, they may have decided to leave it
fallow.
Planting of soft red wheat dropped 7 per cent. According to USDA, producers
have had such poor yields and quality problems in recent years that they may
have decided not to bother planting wheat this year. Dry weather in the hard
red winter wheat areas could have also discouraged production.

reap benefits of CAP reforms
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAY MacSharry, the European Community's agricultural commissioner, is not
about to become the Robin Hood of Europe - taking from the large, rich
farmers and giving to small, poor farmers - according to a report published
here.
On the contrary, in Denmark's case the primary beneficiaries of Mr
MacSharry's proposed reforms of the EC's common agricultural policy will be
those relatively wealthy people who run farms as a hobby, the so-called
tarmac farmers from the towns, and they are estimated to account for about
half of all Danish farmers.
Mr Niels Groes, head of research at the local government research institute
(Amternes og Kommunernes Forskningsinstitut) in Copenhagen, who is the
author of the report, believes that his findings could be relevant to many
other parts of the European Community as well. He concludes that the effect
of the proposed MacSharry reforms will be that 'the EC's farm support will
go to university lecturers, company directors, postmen, teachers and other
part-time farmers. These are not the kind of people who need a hand-out form
the EC's coffers'.
By a big reduction in the cereals price and through land set-aside
programmes, the reforms will have a very serious adverse effect on the
large, intensively-operated cereals and dairy farms, however, which means
that they will have a second perverse effect. The large farms are found
especially in the poorer parts of Denmark, which will thus be made poorer by
the effects of the reforms, although Mr MacSharry's intention is that the
reforms should benefit poorer regions.
Instead, support will go to part-time farmers, who are found in the largest
numbers around the big cities, such as Copenhagen and the Jutland capital of
Arhus. Many part-time farmers, Mr Groes believes, will be able to achieve a
substantial improvement in their incomes from land which at the moment they
do not in fact cultivate.
'All they will have to do in future is to pretend they are cultivating the
land, drive the old Ferguson tractor over the fields when they have the time
and the sun in shining, and then drive past the bank to draw their subsidy,'
he says.
The perverse effects to which Mr Groes draws attention arise with Mr
MacSharry's proposals for a drastic reduction in cereal prices and the
extension of land set-aside programmes, which will be combined with direct
subsidies to small farmers.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big Bell strikes a minor chord
for owners - Why production prospects for the mine have been downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXASPERATED MINERS who have tried to make money out of the Big Bell mine in
Western Australia discovered too late that it has an ore body so perverse,
unpredictable and unique that they never should have tried to extract its
gold.
Placer Pacific, the mine operator, believes it has solved most of the
problems but admits that Big Bell is unlikely to recover the ADollars 145m
invested in it at the end of the 1980s.
Big Bell is testimony to the old adage: 'Mining is a risky business and
nothing can be proven until it is mined.'
Sportingly, Placer Dome, Canada's biggest gold mining group which owns 75.8
per cent of Placer Pacific, has described Big Bell's horrors in its latest
in-house magazine Prospect.
The mine is located 540 km (335 miles) north-east of Perth and 28 km
north-west of Cue in the Murchison Goldfields. Joint venturers, Placer and
ACM Gold, started mining in February 1989 in an orthodox open pit operation,
the type familiar to mining engineers the world over.
Exploration drilling in the usual way had determined the grade (the amount
by mass of metal or mineral in an ore) and limits of the ore body and a
mining plan was developed. 'With the benefit of hindsight, we should have
analysed not only the ore body but the waste as well to see what we were up
against,' Prospect quotes Mr Peter Neilans as saying. He was the mine
superintendent at Big Bell, but recently transferred to the group's
Gibraltar mine in British Columbia.
Big Bell's waste proved to be extremely hard and abrasive and drill
penetration was too low to keep up with the expected mining rate.
Another nasty surprise was that the contact between waste and ore was
sudden, erratic and unpredictable. In many ore bodies the grade varies by
gradual increments from lower to higher values. At Big Bell ore and waste
are mixed in an inconsistent jumble.
Placer says it is difficult to get reliable assays, which reveal the gold
content, because of the irregular way the gold is disseminated through the
rock.
From the moment mining started at Big Bell grades were disappointingly below
those predicted and the conventional solution - changing the cut-off grade
(the lowest grade of mineralised material considered economic) - was
attempted. But that did not work. And as Mr Neilans recalls: 'We found we
were stockpiling economic ore. There was no mineable cut-off between
economic and sub-economic ore.
'We have found that we have to mill sub-economic ore to avoid throwing out
the economic ore with it. There is material that contains grades ranging
between the geological and economic cut-off that is inseparable.'
All this meant that costs soared to unacceptable levels. In 1990 Big Bell
produced more than 111,000 troy ounces of gold - but at an average cost of
USDollars 504 an ounce. The gold price averaged Dollars 385 that year.
Placer went back to square one and developed a new 'life of mine' plan. This
will involve reducing the planned depth of the open pit from 315 to 240
metres so that not so much waste will have to be shifted.
For the life of the open pit, to early 1994, Big Bell is predicted to
produced about 115,000 ounces a year. At that stage the joint venture will
be wound up unless the partners decide to start underground mining. That
would not be worthwhile unless the gold price was likely to stay much higher
than it is today.
The new life of mine plan resulted in Placer writing down its investment in
Big Bell by nearly ADollars 30m net. (That was after accounting for the sale
of surplus equipment, such as five 170-tonne haul trucks.) About 50 of the
250 jobs at the mine were also lost in 1990.
Among other things, the new plan involves the Big Bell pit walls being
anchored with stabilisers of cable bolts driven as much as 30 metres deep
into them. Although this is not a new method of preventing walls from
falling into a pit, Placer points out that the method has never before been
tried in a pit with such steep walls.
In the first half of last year Big Bell's cash cost of production had fallen
to Dollars 364 an ounce, still only marginally below the average gold price
of Dollars 366 - and the cash cost does not include financing and other
charges.
Meanwhile, the mining problems are not yet over.
Big Bell used to be an underground mine. Between 1937 and 1955 about 5.6m
tonnes of ore was mined, yielding 643,000 ounces of gold and 219,000 ounces
of silver.
Mining the open pit has exposed the old workings. Placer's huge mechanical
shovels have been biting into old iron, rails and support timbers. This
necessitated another costly step unnecessary in a conventional mine: probe
drilling to ensure the ground over which the giant shovels and haul trucks
in the pit are travelling is safe. 'Otherwise the heavy machines might
collapse catastrophically into a cavern of old workings,' Placer points out.
Undaunted by the Big Bell experience, Placer says: 'Every cloud has a silver
lining. From Placer Dome's point of view the knowledge gained from this
unique mine is like money in the bank'.
That must surely remind us of another peculiarity of this business: mining
is indeed very risky - but it is an industry which attracts incurable
optimists.

THE THREAT of disruption to natural gas supplies in east Germany from the
former Soviet Union has been averted, thanks to a temporary - and secret -
agreement between suppliers and distributors.
The conflict involved the demand by Gasprom, the Russian gas exporter, and
Wintershall, its German partner, for a big increase in the delivery price of
some 2.8bn cubic meters of gas - roughly half east Germany's consumption.
Agreement was reached in the wings of the first German-Russian co-operation
council which met in Bonn this week, between Gasprom and Wintershall (a
subsidiary of BASF), on the one hand, and Verbundnetz Gas (VNG), the major
east German distributor, and its principal shareholder, Ruhrgas, on the
other.
It is understood that the agreement will be valid for the rest of 1992,
while a more permanent contract is worked out. Wintershall had threatened to
suspend gas deliveries from the beginning of March.
Wintershall and Gasprom, through their joint gas trading house WIEH had
sought an increase in the gas delivery price to 1.94 pfennigs per kwh,
compared with a price of 1.66 pfennigs offered by VNG, according to its
previous (East German) contract. VNG and Ruhrgas claimed that the lower
price was valid for all West European customers, and objected to paying
more.
Mr Klaus-Ewald Holst, chief executive of VNG, said he was now ready 'to
conclude a long-term natural gas contract with Wintershall-Gasprom on normal
market conditions'.

Coffee prices bounced on the London Futures and Options Exchange yesterday,
helped by gains in the New York market, where the smaller than expected
number of first day notices for physical deliveries against the expiring
March position prompted short covering and helped to narrow nearby
discounts. But London dealers thought the rally, which took the May robustas
position up Dollars 14 to Dollars 863 a tonne, still down Dollars 25 on the
week, was likely to be short-lived as plentiful supplies were available. On
the London Metal Exchange the slide in aluminium prices was resumed after
short-covering prompted an early rally. The cash position closed at Dollars
1,266.50 a tonne, taking the fall on the week to Dollars 30.50 a tonne.
Nickel prices rallied in the afternoon but still finished marginally lower
on the day. Dealers said the rally, which followed early falls on commission
house selling, was encouraged by talk of possible Chinese buying interest.
The copper market recovered some of Wednesday's fall and the cash quotation
closed Pounds 8 up at Pounds 1,262 a tonne, helped by gains in New York.
Dealers said the market seemed poised for another attempt at breaking upside
resistance around Dollars 2,230 a tonne for three months metal, about
Dollars 2 above yesterday's close.

expecting bumper crops

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA and Indonesia, the world's top two palm oil growers, are heading
for bumper crops this year because of rising yields, officials and analysts
say, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
But traders and refiners warn the production surge could put downward
pressure on prices later in the year. Seasonal supply tightness is keeping
prices steady at present.
'With the supply push, I guess in the next six months prices will ease
somewhat but not a real washout,' says Mr Jim Sutter, managing director of
Kupak, a local refiner.
The May contract on the local crude palm oil futures market is hovering at
R867 (Pounds 190) a tonne, up from R846 a year ago, aided by low stocks and
supply tightness.
Traders say Indonesian domestic demand for palm oil is high and exporters
have had to defer sales of 15,000 tonnes originally scheduled for shipment
from January to March.
The shortage results from higher exports of Indonesian coconut oil and palm
kernel oil and a drought expected to cause a lower-than-anticipated rise in
palm oil production.
Analysts expect production in Malaysia and Indonesia to recover sharply from
July to post a bumper crop. Meanwhile, Indonesia is buying about 120,000
tonnes of Malaysian palm olein between January and March to meet the
shortfall, Mr Sutter says.
'Malaysian production looks very good this year due to higher rainfalls and
better farm inputs (because of) recent high prices,' explains Mr ST Keoh,
managing director of Malaysia's Guan Soon Heng Futures Trading.
Malaysia's Palm Oil Research Institute has put Malaysia's 1992 output at a
record 6.3m tonnes, up from 6.14m in 1991, but some analysts say it could
reach 6.5m tonnes.
Indonesian output is expected to rise to 3m tonnes in 1991-92 (April-March)
from about 2.4m in 1990-91.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada to ask EC to curb
trawler catches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA IS dispatching a senior diplomat and a team of scientists to Brussels
next week to protest against a vast increase in the amount of fish caught by
Spanish and Portuguese trawlers in the north-west Atlantic.
The mission will coincide with the expected announcement of a drastic cut in
northern cod quotas for the domestic fishery, following an alarming drop in
the catch within Canada's 200-mile fishing zone.
The dwindling catch forced Newfoundland's biggest fish processing company,
Fishery Products International, to close one of its processing plants last
week, putting 1,000 people out of work.
Mr John Crosbie, the fisheries minister, said that Canada would ask the
European Community to respect a moratorium on cod fishing outside the
200-mile limit. During a special debate in Parliament on Wednesday,
opposition MPs also urged the government to extend unilaterally Canada's
fishing zone.
Canada estimates that Portuguese, Spanish and Panamanian-flagged vessels
caught 48,000 to 50,000 tonnes of cod outside the 200-mile limit last year,
more than double the 1990 catch of 22,000 tonnes.
The government is concerned that the spirit of understanding and compromise
that marked discussions with the EC early last year appears to have
evaporated. 'The Commission, faced with choices, is choosing to do very
little,' one official said yesterday.
Concern about fish stocks centres on an area stretching northward from the
south-east coast of Newfoundland to about halfway up the coast of Labrador.
Commercial and scientific evidence began appearing last autumn of shortages
in the northern part of this area, as well as a sudden drop in the
proportion of older fish.
A scientific advisory committee has urged the government to cut the northern
cod catch in the first half of this year to 25,000 tonnes from 50,000 tonnes
in the first six months of 1991. The entire catch for last year of 127,000
tonnes was well below the quota of 190,000 tonnes.
The government has previously been reluctant to order a heavy cut in quotas
in order to minimise the short-term damage to economic activity in
Newfoundland, which is Canada's poorest province. There now appears to be a
widespread realisation that the long-term health of the fishery requires
immediate measures to allow stocks to recover.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Sweden poised to overhaul
share ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGNERS should be entitled to acquire as many shares as they like in
Swedish companies from January 1 next year, it was proposed yesterday by the
state's company law committee.
The Swedish government is expected to endorse the recommendation and abolish
the current legal restrictions created by the dual system of free and
restricted shares, which prevents foreigners from being able to purchase all
or part of the shares in companies.
The proposed change is likely to pass through parliament during the autumn.
It will come into force at the start of 1993 with the creation of the free
internal market between the European Community and the European Free Trade
Association.
At present, an estimated 70 per cent of the shares traded in Stockholm are
restricted. Clauses which restrict certain shares to Swedes are contained in
the by-laws of more than an estimated 220,000 joint stock companies in
Sweden.
The company law committee said in its report to the government that 'many
people question whether it is consistent with the national interest to
shield Sweden from other countries. Instead, there is a widespread belief
that greater mobility of goods, services, people and capital create the
prerequisite for economic growth and greater prosperity'.
As a result, it added: 'It seems important to stimulate an interest among
foreigners to make investments in Sweden.'
The report emphasises that the change must be made because the existing
restricted share system is incompatible with the rules laid down by the
European Community's Treaty of Rome and the new 19-nation European Economic
Area between the EC and European Free Trade Association, which is supposed
to come into force next January.
The committee suggested there should be no exceptions to its proposal to
abolish restricted shares, and free shares should also apply to companies in
the Swedish defence industry.
The proposed change, when it is implemented, will mean a profound break with
past practice. Legal restrictions on foreigners wishing to acquire ownership
of Swedish companies and property date back into the 18th century, though
the laws only really became codified in their present form in 1916. They
were updated 10 years ago.
However, Sweden is not moving to a system of one share, one vote. The
present system, which differentiates between voting shares and non-voting
equity, will continue until the EC itself has agreed on comprehensive
company legislation. Many large companies will continue to be owned by
Swedish institutions and families like the Wallenbergs through their
dominant control of the voting shares.
In a further sweeping measure of liberalisation, the Swedish government is
expected to announce today proposals to de-monopolise the Stockholm bourse
and allow competition in Sweden share trading.
This suggestion has already aroused public criticism from Mr Bengt Ryden,
the head of the stock market, who has said it could have an adverse effect
on the Swedish stock market.

<TEXT>
DEN DANSKE Bank, Denmark's largest bank, plans to reduce employment by 20
per cent over the next three years in order to cut costs and improve
earnings, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
However, Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive, said yesterday the bank made a
DKr1.33bn (Dollars 208.5m) net profit in 1991 compared with a loss of
DKr1.17bn in 1990. The improvement reflected a reduction in loss provisions
from DKr4.25bn to DKr2.88bn and a DKr1.7bn gain from the adjustment of the
value of foreign exchange and securities portfolios.
The bank proposed an unchanged 16 per cent dividend, a pay-out of DKr847m.
Net interest income and income from fees and commissions declined to
DKr9.82bn from DKr10.22bn, which Mr Sorensen described as 'unsatisfactory'.
He attributed it to a trend which had lasted for several years and was
caused by increasing competition and the domestic economic recession.
Danske is the result of a merger of three large banks in 1990. Since then,
the branch network has been reduced from 750 to about 600, and further
reductions are on the way.
Employment has been reduced by about 9 per cent from 16,400 at the time of
the merger to 15,000. The number must be reduced to 12,000 by the end of
1994, said Mr Sorensen.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Warm reception to pricing on Y125bn
Spanish deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN yesterday launched its anticipated Y125bn issue in the international
bond market, but priced the deal more generously than expected to attract
investors.
The 5 3/4 per cent 10-year bonds were priced to yield 5.858 per cent, at the
higher end of market expectations. At this level, the bonds yield 7 basis
points more than Belgium's outstanding Y50bn deal and 27 basis points more
than Japan Development Bank's outstanding Y120bn deal, two benchmarks in the
Euroyen sector.
Nomura International, lead manager, said the deal was priced by consensus
among top underwriting firms. The realistic pricing was reflected in a warm
reception from investors.
Participants in the deal reported brisk sales, with UK and continental
European institutional investors the most active buyers. From a fixed
re-offer price of 99.20, the deal traded up to stand at 99.25 bid by the
close.
The European Community launched a Ecu490m five-year deal, lead managed by
Morgan Stanley International, to finance balance of payments loans to a
number of eastern European states.
The issue added to a Ecu250m deal lead-managed by Credit Lyonnais in
November. The bonds were priced to give a yield of 8.47 per cent, a small 2
basis point pick up over the outstanding bonds in the secondary market. The
issue is now likely to become a benchmark at the five-year maturity.
As with the Spain transaction, the pricing was considered to be fair by
market participants. The lead manager won the mandate for the deal following
a bidding process, but the EC did not pick the firm which offered to
underwrite the bonds at the lowest yield.
In the past, the EC has been criticised for awarding new issue mandates on
the basis of bids which were far more aggressive than the market consensus,
resulting in poorly-received deals.
The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate Ecu and on-lent to
a number of states, including Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Morgan Stanley
offered the EC the lowest cost of funds by engineering an attractive swap.
While most firms were satisfied with the pricing, many said investors were
not keen to buy Ecu bonds at this maturity and saw only limited buying.
However, other participants in the deal, including the lead manager,
reported steady sales to a range of European retail and institutional
investors.
The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price of 100.65 throughout the day.

golf resort

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE controversial Japanese owner of the Pebble Beach golf resort in
California, one of the most famous courses in the US, has been forced by
financial difficulties to sell out to a consortium organised by Sumitomo
Bank.
Mr Minoru Isutani, a self-made Japanese tycoon who bought the course for
around Dollars 1bn, has had to dispose of it for about Dollars 500m after
failing to complete a scheme to fund the purchase by sales of memberships to
wealthy Japanese.
Mr Isutani bought Pebble Beach in 1990 through a US subsidiary, which he
then quickly sold to US investors after the deal was concluded. Mr Isutani
is also well known for his ties with Mr Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, who was forced to resign due to his
involvement in the Recruit stock scandal.
Taiheiyo Club, a golf course developer, has joined Sumitomo Credit Service,
the credit card company under Sumitomo Bank, to buy Pebble Beach - which
will be the site of the US Open golf tournament this year - from Mr Isutani.
Mr Isutani's close ties with Itoman, the Osaka-based trading company facing
financial restructuring due to its involvement in real-estate-related
speculation, prompted Sumitomo Bank, under which Itoman is now undergoing
restructuring, to arrange the deal between Taiheiyo and Mr Isutani. Sumitomo
Bank will also finance the joint venture in the acquisition.
The move comes as Mr Isutani plans to turn the Pebble Beach resort's four
golf courses and two hotels - originally accessible to the public  - into an
exclusive club by selling private memberships, were rejected by local
authorities.
The California Coastal Commission's refusal stalled Mr Isutani's plans to
repay his main lender, Mitsubishi Banking and Trust. Japan's faltering golf
membership market also discouraged Mr Isutani to pursue original plans.
Mr Isutani's original purchase stirred criticism in the US as it was seen as
another move by Japan to acquire high profile 'trophies' such as Manhattan's
Rockefeller Centre and Columbia Pictures.
Taiheiyo, which runs nine golf courses in Japan, said it hoped Pebble
Beach's name would help the company's reputation. Taiheiyo said it did not
intend to turn Pebble Beach into a private golf club, and said it would
retain original management. The company, which also hosts domestic golf
tournaments, hopes to finalise the deal before the US Open in June.

INSTITUTIONAL support returned to the New Zealand bond market yesterday,
with the latest government tender closing oversubscribed, writes Terry Hall
in Wellington.
This was in contrast to the previous one a fortnight ago, a failure which
provoked considerable uncertainty in financial markets. The latest tender,
which sought NZDollars 350m, attracted bids of NZDollars 1152m for the three
maturities offered.
However, yields barely moved, indicating, according to the treasury manager
of a leading bank, that the market was unsure of where the economy was
headed over the next 12 to 18 months and was not prepared to take a strong
position.
He said the bids came from institutions and banks needing to do business,
but no one was prepared to take the market anywhere.
In the tender, the 1995 bonds saw an average yield of 8.10 per cent; 1996
bonds yielded 8.8 per cent; and March 2002 showed a yield of 9.35 per cent.

MAIR Astley, the New Zealand commodity trader and primary product exporter,
yesterday reported a surge in net profits to NZDollars 5.59m (USDollars 3m)
for the six months to December 31, from NZDollars 97,000 a year earlier. It
announced a one-for-three bonus and a return to dividend payments.
The company is New Zealand's largest exporter of venison and among the top
international traders in wool, leather and pelts. The profit improvement
follows a sharp rise in demand for these products, helped by the recent
devaluation of the New Zealand dollar.
Mr John Roy, executive chairman, said the turnround had also been assisted
by a refocus on value-added activities such as leather manufacture. At the
pre-tax level, profits turned round to NZDollars 8.01m from losses of
NZDollars 25,000. Tax took NZDollars 2.73m compared with NZDollars 167,000.
Total assets fell to NZDollars 166.7m from NZDollars 210.74m due to asset
sales. A 5 cent dividend was declared, the first since 1989, when the
company began a period of reconstruction.

HANG SENG BANK, the 61 per cent subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank,
yesterday reported a 28.5 per cent rise in 1991 net profits to HKDollars
2.8bn (USDollars 363.6m) from HKDollars 1.18bn in 1990.
Sir Q. W. Lee, chairman, said he was 'conservatively optimistic' about the
prospects for 1992. He said 1991 had been a very good year for banks in Hong
Kong. Two weeks ago, the Bank of East Asia reported a 30 per cent growth in
1991 earnings.
In common with all banks in the colony, Hang Seng's was struck after an
unknown transfer to 'inner reserves'. Variations in the amount transferred -
or, indeed, drawn down if the year is poor - allow the colony's banks great
latitude in the profits they declare.
However, analysts said that Hang Seng's results boded well for Hongkong
Bank. Already, Hongkong Bank has published results for it US subsidiary
which show a halving in losses and now Hang Seng has reported a near 30 per
cent growth in earnings.
Mr John Mulchay, head of research at Peregrine, a local brokerage, said he
expected the Hongkong Bank to report earnings of about HKDollars 4.6bn - up
nearly 50 per cent on 1990's HKDollars 3bn, but still less than the bank's
record of HKDollars 4.7bn in 1989.
He pointed out that banks in Hong Kong had their margins on mortgage lending
boosted by 10 per cent last June after the government decided not to lower
home lending rates when it cut deposit rates at that time. This margin still
exists today.
'Underlying growth in bank profits last year has been significant,' he said.
'They are suffering an embarrassment of riches, and I suspect their
transfers to inner reserves have been substantial.'
Hang Seng, whose earnings rise was in line with market expectations,
surprised with a one-for-four bonus issue. It declared a 75 cents final
dividend, making HKDollars 1.25 for the year - up 25 per cent on 1990's pay
out.

MAYNE Nickless, the Australian transport, security and medical group,
yesterday blamed difficult trading conditions for a disappointing 0.7 per
cent increase in equity accounted net profits to ADollars 52m (USDollars
40m) for the six months to end-December.
However, profits increased to ADollars 108m after taking account of an
abnormal gain on the disposal in September of the group's 11.8 per cent
holding in Amcor, an Australian packaging manufacturer.
Sales revenue fell 2.2 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn, largely reflecting the
Amcor sale, but was 9.4 per cent higher on a consolidated basis.
Mayne said the result was 'a creditable outcome in a continuing recessionary
environment where trading conditions have been tight in many of the
company's major markets.'
Mayne also announced a one-for-five rights issue to raise ADollars 322m.
The directors said that the capital injection would strengthen the company's
balance sheet and enable it to expand its core activities 'as opportunities
arise.'
Mayne is a big investor in the Optus Communications consortium which has
been awarded a licence to operate Australia's second telecommunications
network.
The company has also bought several small transport businesses in Europe
over the past year, and is believed to be seeking further acquisitions to
expand its express freight network.
In addition, its healthcare division has built a substantial private
hospital business in recent years through the acquisition of a number of
healthcare businesses, including Hospital Corporation of Australia and the
Sacred Heart hospital in Melbourne.
Mayne said the outlook was bright for its transport and security businesses
in Europe and North America. European profits increased by 195 per cent
during the six months, due to an improved performance by Parceline, the
group's UK express freight carrier.
North American profits fell by 11 per cent, primarily because of a strike
which affected the operations of the group's Loomis Courier express freight
carrier in eastern Canada.
Mayne said its healthcare, security and logistics management businesses were
expected to perform strongly in the second half, but the contribution from
express freight activities was likely to remain flat until the economy
emerges from recession.
The directors declared an unchanged interim dividend of 17.5 cents, fully
franked.
The group's shares closed 6 cents lower on the Australian Stock Exchange at
ADollars 7.88.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Surprise at Thai Airways price
tag - The airline's plans to sell a tranche of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAI Airways International, the state-owned airline run by senior air force
officers, has announced plans to offer a first tranche of shares to the
public between March 16 and 27, giving new life to the long-running
controversy over Thai's management and profitability.
Thailand is selling 95m shares, or about 7 per cent of the company, at Bt60
each, valuing the airline at Bt82.62bn (Dollars 3.2bn). A further 5m shares
will go to Thai's employees at the par value of Bt10. The shares, already
listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) but 99 per cent held by the
Finance Ministry, are due to begin trading on May 20.
Details of the offer have yet to be finalised, but the airline has drawn up
plans to sell 40m shares to some 200,000 small investors through commercial
banks, and a series of 'roadshows' will be launched next month to publicise
the stock offer. A further 15m shares will be set aside for foreign
financial institutions buying through brokers in Thailand, with the rest
reserved for Thai institutions and securities companies.
As is so often with initial public offerings in Thailand, brokers are in a
dilemma. They have grave doubts about Thai's profitability and have
expressed surprise at the Bt60 price. It gives a prospective 1992
price/earnings ratio of 16.2, which looks expensive alongside the much lower
p/e ratios of better-run competitors such as Cathay Pacific and Singapore
Airlines.
But the brokers are also aware that Thai will account for such a large share
of the SET index that it will be difficult for institutional investors to
ignore, and they know that local punters have a habit of driving up the
price of shares on the grey market and in the first days of trading.
'There's going to be fist-fights,' said one broker, assuming that shares to
small investors would be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, 'but
fist-fights push up prices in the grey market.'
Critics in Thailand say the airline is poorly managed by the air force
officers who have made it their fiefdom. Travellers complain of delayed or
cancelled flights, and Thai has been accused of deliberately neglecting
profitable routes to IndoChina for the benefit of 'rival' local airlines
with links to the military. There are doubts as to whether it is receiving
cost-effective services from all its suppliers.
Thai's first-quarter results for the 1991-92 financial year were
disappointing, casting doubt on the company's rosy projections for the three
years to 1994, and last year's Bt5.09bn pre-tax profit was massaged ahead of
the share flotation by the inclusion of more than Bt2bn from the sale of
four Airbuses which were promptly leased back.
Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, Thai's chairman and the head of the air
force, rejects criticism of the high p/e ratio implicit in the offer price.
'Thai's huge assets and its goodwill should be taken into account,' he said.
'Moreover, Thai is a state enterprise which has backing from the Thai
government.'
More pertinent for foreign investors is the fact that Thai's
less-than-sparkling management record gives it the sort of scope for
improvement not available to its competitors in Singapore and Hong Kong. 'It
has tremendous upside potential,' said one broker. 'There is great room for
margin appreciation.'
Bangkok has the advantage of a substantial domestic and regional hinterland
in a fast-growing market, and its profits could probably be rapidly
increased by eliminating corruption, cutting unprofitable domestic routes or
raising prices on them, and by negotiating the regional traffic rights which
are its due.
It is not yet clear if Thai will be able to grasp the opportunities at hand.
The Finance Ministry is said to be anxious to proceed with the offer of the
first 100m shares before a new - and possibly corrupt - government takes
over following the March 22 elections, and a further 200m shares are
expected to follow within months. Even then, nearly four-fifths of the
company will be in government hands.
Serious investors will hope the trading of Thai shares on the SET and the
need for foreign financing will make the airline's accounts more transparent
and its management more answerable to the needs of shareholders. But, in the
short term, the speculators will hold sway. As one broker put it: 'We see
very little fundamental justification to invest in Thai. But so what?
Clients should buy every share that comes their way.'

breweries

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASAHI Breweries and Sapporo Breweries, respectively Japan's second and third
largest beer companies, posted small rises in parent company profits for
1991, due to slack beer sales.
Since the success of Asahi's dry beer it has enjoyed a steady rise in sales,
but the recent stagnation of the dry beer boom and the company's failure to
introduce a new 'hit' beer stunted its earnings growth.
Asahi's non-consolidated net profits rose 1.6 per cent to Y6.2bn (USDollars
48.4m), while pre-tax profits rose 1.2 per cent to Y17.4bn. Sales gained 1.1
per cent to Y739.1bn, and the annual dividend is being maintained at Y8 a
share.
Meanwhile, Sapporo Breweries' non-consolidated net profits edged ahead to
Y4.07bn from Y4.01bn in 1990, although sales improved more than Asahi's with
a rise of 8.2 per cent to Y533.29bn from Y492.63bn. Sapporo's pre-tax
profits advanced 7.5 per cent to Y9.06bn from Y8.43bn and it is holding its
annual dividend at Y5 per share.
Asahi's beer sales, which account for 83.1 per cent of its total sales rose
2.8 per cent. Sales of its mainstay, Super Dry, fell 10 per cent and sales
of its new 'Z' beer remained at 20m cases, failing to reach the original
target of 30m. Asahi's problems started in 1990, when a premium-priced
luxury beer launched by Kirin Brewery, the industry leader, arrived on the
market.
For the current year, Asahi expects a 0.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to
Y17.5bn on an 8.2 per cent increase in sales. The company projects rising
personnel, distribution and other costs, in addition to a deteriorating
balance on financial items due to increased borrowings for plant and
equipment investment which will squeeze profits.
Sapporo expects a 10.6 per cent rise in parent net profits to Y4.5bn in
1992, on sales 6.9 per cent ahead at Y570bn.

<TEXT>
PLACER Dome, one of North America's two biggest gold producers, has posted a
final 1991 loss of Dollars 236.2m, or Dollars 1 a share.
This follows previously-announced writedowns totalling Dollars 294.7m on its
investments in the Mt Milligan hopper-gold property in British Columbia and
in smaller gold properties across Canada. The Mt Milligan special charge
alone was Dollars 195.7m.
In 1990, Placer, which has changed to US dollar accounting because of its
global operations, reported profits of Dollars 164.6m, or 70 cents a share.
Sales in 1991 were Dollars 968m, up 4 per cent from 1990.
The fourth-quarter final loss, including writedowns, was Dollars 283.1m,
against a loss of Dollars 7.6m a year earlier on sales of Dollars 277m,
compared with Dollars 247m.
The 1991 profits from continuing operations before writedowns was Dollars
58.5m, against Dollars 103.5m last time, due mainly to lower prices.
Average realised price for gold in 1991 was Dollars 399 per ounce, taking
into account forward contracts. Gold output was 1.68m ounces, including
276,200 oz from the first full year of Porgera in Papua New Guinea and
32,000 oz from La Coipa in Chile, which started on October 1.
Average cash production cost was Dollars 223 per oz, against Dollars 232 per
oz, because of low-cost Porgera and La Coipa.

<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock-listed company, slid into a net loss of
NKr498m (Dollars 77.2m) in 1991 from a profit a year earlier of NKr2.9bn,
the company reported yesterday. Hydro's poor result was due to a
non-recurring NKr2.9bn charge against accounts for the restructuring of its
agriculture and magnesium divisions. In 1990, the company charged NKr200m
against accounts for restructuring.
Local analysts had expected Hydro to incur net losses of between NKr400m and
NKr500m. The company is cutting its dividend from NKr4.25 to NKr3.50 a
share.
Operating revenue was little changed at NKr61.4bn against NKr60.9bn, and
operating income fell sharply to NKr922m from NKr6.7bn. 'All of Hydro's
activities showed a weaker operating income in 1991 than in 1990 - even
before taking 1991 restructuring charges into account - due mainly to weak
demand and lower product prices,' the company explained.
In the final quarter, Hydro made a net loss of NKr1.53bn, against a profit
of NKr1bn in 1990. The fourth-quarter operating loss was NKr2.08bn, in
contrast to profits of NKr2.1bn a year earlier.
Hydro said its agriculture division would achieve an annual cost reduction
of NKr800m from restructuring, while efficiency efforts in other divisions
are expected cut total annual costs by NKr1.5bn 'gradually' during the next
couple of years.
Our most cyclical businesses - aluminium and petrochemicals - are holding up
much better than in previous recessionary periods,' said Mr Egil Myklebust,
Norsk Hydro's president.
On a divisional breakdown, agriculture slid into a net operating loss of
NKr649m from a profit of NKr1.29bn. Oil and gas, the group's best performer,
saw operating income fall by NKr823m to NKr2.49bn.
Light metals made an operating loss of NKr1.18bn against a profit of
NKr1.28bn. Petrochemicals saw operating profits fall to NKr432m from
Nkr1.01bn.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Acquisitions behind 26% profits
rise at Hagemeyer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAGEMEYER, the Netherlands-based international trading company, posted a 26
per cent increase in net profit to Fl 85.2m (Dollars 45.8m) in 1991. The
dividend is to be increased by the same percentage to Fl 5.68 from Fl 4.52
in 1990.
Sales were up nearly 18 per cent at Fl 2.96bn last year and are expected to
show a further rise to around Fl 3.5bn in 1992.
Hagemeyer, which is 60 per cent owned by the Hong Kong investment company
First Pacific, attributed the rise mainly to acquisitions, including its
purchase in late 1991 of a 60 per cent stake in Froschl, one of Germany's
largest electro-technical wholesalers.
Growth of existing businesses was just under 2 per cent, reflecting slower
economic growth in Australia and setbacks on the German market for consumer
electronics. If these two areas are disregarded, organic growth totalled
around 5 per cent.
For 1992, Hagemeyer forecasts further profits growth.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Allianz in DM1bn rights issue to
fund expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, is planning to raise more than
DM1bn through a rights issue of new shares and profit-participating
certificates.
This is the Munich-based company's first capital-raising exercise since
October 1990. It mostly reflects the costs of expansion into eastern Germany
via the acquisition of Deutsche Versicherungs, the loss-making former east
German state monopoly.
Allianz said the issue would ensure its capital base expanded to keep pace
with increasing business volume, and the proceeds would help meet the
investment needed to integrate and develop Deutsche Versicherungs.
The issue is to be on a 1-for-12 basis at DM700 a share, which compares with
a closing price of DM2,306 yesterday, bringing in DM975m (Dollars 590.9m)
for the company. Holders of profit-participating certificates will be
offered new ones an the same 1-for-12 basis. The overall sum raised will be
DM1.06bn.
In December, Allianz agreed to pay the Treuhand privatisation agency DM440m
for the outstanding 49 per stake in Deutsche Versicherungs. This was
significantly more than the DM270.7m it paid for the first 51 per cent in
June 1990, and more than Allianz had indicated that it wanted to pay in the
light of heavy losses.
At the time, analysts said Allianz was paying a 'political premium' for the
right to acquire control over the former monopoly business.
Although the acquisition has brought Allianz premium income of some DM1.8bn
a year, Deutsche Versicherungs is unlikely to break even until 1995-96, by
which time it is likely to have built up cumulative losses of DM1bn.
Premium income is expected to grow to between DM3bn and DM3.5bn by 1995-96.
At the moment, Allianz is thought to be losing DM30 for every DM100 premiums
received.
Last October, Allianz warned that losses in the east would mean that for
1991 it would register its first ever group loss on mainstream underwriting
business.

DAIMLER BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, boosted total sales by
11 per cent to DM94.66bn last year and said net profits for 1991 would be
higher than 1990's DM1.79bn (Dollars 1.08bn).
The profit increase will be achieved after undisclosed but substantial
restructuring costs associated with the company's decision to close down the
AEG Olympia typewriter and office equipment market in Wilhelmshaven with the
loss of 1,300 jobs.
The increase was not unexpected but the announcement yesterday was taken by
analysts as confirmation that 1991 will prove to be a turning point for the
group and its chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter (pictured above), after four years
in which earnings dropped by one-third despite an ambitious acquisitions
programme.
The impetus for the growth last year came from what the company called an
'extraordinary boom' in its domestic German market, with a 25 per cent rise
in new car sales at the Mercedes Benz automobile subsidiary and a 30 per
cent increase in commercial vehicle sales, reflecting buoyant demand from
the eastern part of Germany.
Demand overseas was weak with sales falling 3 per cent in other European
Community countries and by 25 per cent in the US.
Mercedes Benz reported sales for the whole of 1991 up 12 per cent to
DM66.71bn.

KVAERNER, the diversified Norwegian company with main interests in
engineering, shipping and shipbuilding, yesterday announced record pre-tax
profits in 1991 of NKr1.1bn, up from NKr1.05bn in 1990.
Kvaerner plans to lift its dividend to NKr3 a share from NKr2.75.
The company said it expects to make a 1992 profit similar to last year's.
Group operating profit rose by NKr175m to NKr1.04bn, while turnover
increased to NKr18.66bn from NKr13.16bn in 1990.
'The big increase in revenue is primarily due to the acquisition of the
Kvaerner Masa shipbuilding group in Finland and Goetaverken Energy in
Sweden,' Kvaerner said.
On a divisional basis, shipbuilding, the group's best performer, boosted net
pre-tax profit to NKr535m from NKr22m. Mechanical engineering slid in a loss
of NKr51m from a NKr46m profit in 1990.
Pulping technology saw pre-tax profit in 1991 cut to NKr270m from NKr460m
while shipping saw profits decline last year to NKr260m from NKr342m.

<TEXT>
MANNESMANN, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday reported a 1
per cent improvement in group sales to DM24.1bn (Dollars 14.6bn) and said
profits for 1991 did not reach the same level as in the previous year.
It gave no indication of the scale of the profits fall, saying only that the
group had suffered from the impact of weaker economic conditions worldwide
on the demand for capital goods and because of the costs associated with the
development of its D2 mobile telephone network - estimated by some brokers
to be as much as DM350m last year.
The statement was the latest in a series of gloomy announcements from the
company, which reported a 27 per cent drop in after-tax profits after six
months of 1991 and a further fall after nine months. Analysts expect
earnings per share to fall to DM16 in 1991 from DM25.5 in 1990, when net
profit was DM464m.
The group blamed the profits fall on the costs of developing the D2 system,
plus the effects of a general fall in demand for mechanical engineering
products (which hit the Rexroth hydraulics and linear motion engineering in
particular) and development costs in its auto-components subsidiary.
It said profits actually rose at the parent company level (again by an
unquantified amount) and that orders for 1991 at DM25.29bn were virtually
the same as in the previous year.

<TEXT>
FOKUS BANK, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, yesterday revealed a
1991 net loss almost doubled to NKr2.1bn (Dollars 325.6m), from NKr1.15bn a
year earlier, and said credit losses in 1992 would remain high.
Fokus was formally taken over by the state in December after making huge
interim losses. The state became the bank's owner after a NKr475m cash
injection.
The bank expects the government-owned bank insurance fund to contribute to a
further capital strengthening exercise should one become necessary.
At end-1991, the bank's equity was just 4.65 per cent of risk-weighted
balance sheet items. By end-1992, under Norwegian law, the ratio will have
to be 8 per cent.
Losses on loans in guarantees rose to NKr1.80bn in 1991 from NKr1.15bn.
'There is reason to expect that the result before losses on lendings will
improve in 1992,' Fokus said.
Net income from interest and credit fell in 1991 to NKr1.26bn from
NKr1.35bn, while other operating income rose to NKr570.1m from NKr524.6m.
Fokus swung to an operating loss of NKr259.6m from a profit of NKr4m in
1990.
'The operating result in Fokus Bank in 1991 has been affected by the general
difficulties in the Norwegian economy,' Fokus said.
Norwegian banks will need more transfers of state cash this year in order to
meet new, tough capital adequacy requirements, Norway's central bank
governor, Mr Hermod Skaanland, said.
'In the course of 1992, we must expect that the (state) Bank Investment Fund
will supply several of the banks with capital to enable them to meet the
capital requirements implemented by the end of the year,' Skaanland said.
Last year, the state pumped in some NKr16bn to help banks survive.

ASTRA, Sweden's largest pharmaceutical company, announced yesterday a 36 per
cent rise in 1991 pre-tax profit to SKr3.41bn (Dollars 571.2m) from
SKr2.51bn for the previous year.
Sales rose by one-third over the same period to SKr12.5bn. Profits per share
jumped to SKr18.00 from SKr11.90 and Astra proposes to improve its dividend
to SKr3.25 per share from SKr2.45.
The company expects its performance in 1992 to continue to remain strong. It
predicts a pre-tax profit increase of between 20 and 25 per cent.
Last year's performance extends the pattern of impressive results from
Astra. For 1990, the group achieved a 36 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to
SKr2.5bn, while in 1989 profits rose 23 per cent to SKr1.85bn.
Astra's success stems from its current range of drug products. Sales of
Losec - its anti-peptic ulcer drug - more than doubled in 1991 to around
SKr4.85bn from SKr2.1bn in the previous year, reflecting its successful
introduction during the year to both the US and Japanese markets.
The company's cardiovascular anti-high blood pressure drug Plendil, which
reached the German market for the first time at the end of 1991, enjoyed a
78 per cent boost in sales to SKr336m, while there was a 51 per cent growth
in sales of Pulmicort, the anti-asthma agent, to SKr1.22bn.
Sales of Turbuhaler, an inhaler delivering medication to asthma patients,

SPARBANK, the Swedish savings bank, boosted profits by 21 per cent last year
to SKr1.03bn in spite of SKr1.11bn credit losses, writes Robert Taylor in
Stockholm.
At end-1991, the bank had Skr5.2bn of extended credit but said while this
was substantial, there was no risk to the bank because 'a large part was
covered by first class security'.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Preview of the Results Season: Can't pay, won't pay - could
pay, should pay?

THE MOST difficult decision that many company directors will have to make on
the eve of their results announcement is what dividend to pay.
Last autumn several companies in danger of having insufficient earnings to
cover 1991's dividends decided to hold the interim payment. They hoped that
by this spring, when a decision would have to be made on the final, the
economic recovery would have arrived to justify maintenance. It has not.
Although crystal ball-gazing about the recovery will play a part in the
decision, the uncertainty will throw directors back on a variety of other
criteria. Is the cash available and, if so, is this the first call on it? If
retained profit is insufficient, should the company dip into balance sheet
reserves to make up the difference? What do the shareholders want and how
obliged is the company to them?
The cash problem is epitomised by Costain, the construction, property and
mining group. With year-end gearing estimated at 60 per cent even after a
Pounds 77m rights issue and a Pounds 101m disposal, it has warned it might
cut the final. A yield of about 9 per cent on the interim dividend alone
indicates the level of market pessimism.
High debt is seen as a potential justification for reducing the dividend
even by Mr Paddy Linaker, chief executive of M&amp;G Group, the fund management
concern, who has become sensitive at being cast as an outspoken advocate of
maintaining pay-outs.
In a recession that 'has been worse than most of us thought likely', he says
M&amp;G accepts that some companies will have to cut. 'We are not suggesting
that companies should irresponsibly maintain their distribution.'
His reminders to companies of the importance of dividend income to investors
are simply statements of the 'blindingly obvious', he says.
Different companies have different priorities for their cash. A growing
company will see dividends as a diversion of funds from investment. Spring
Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, has a yield of 0.2 per cent.
Mr Bill Rooney, its chairman, said recently that a 5 per cent yield would
cost Pounds 23m - 'I can build two factories for that.' Its share price, on
the other hand, has doubled in the past 12 months.
Some companies facing an uncovered dividend as profits have slumped have
nevertheless felt impelled to keep up capital spending. T&amp;N and GKN, the car
component makers, for instance, have continued to modernise plant to ensure
international competitiveness, particularly against the Japanese and the
Germans.
The market perceives a greater risk to the dividend at T&amp;N, which faces a
higher bill even if holds the payment because of extra shares in issue.
The case for reducing the dividend could refer to the views of Mr Paul
Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Management. He says the long-term
interests of shareholders are not served 'if maintaining the dividend
starves the company of important investment'. Some companies have been
locked into an excessive level of distribution and they should reduce the
payment to a level from which it can grow.
But a contrary view can equally well be applied to T&amp;N. With its balance
sheet strengthened by a Pounds 119m rights issue, year-end gearing is
expected to be below 35 per cent and maintaining the dividend would only put
a small dent in the balance sheet.
Using Kleinwort Benson's forecast of a 36 per cent pre-tax profit fall to
Pounds 45m and a 60 per cent tax charge, the Pounds 43m total dividend bill
will knock Pounds 25m off reserves. That is only 5 per cent of the December
1990 (pre-rights issue) figure for shareholders' funds.
Mr Clive Gilchrist, chairman of the investment committee of the National
Association of Pension Funds, says: 'Generally speaking, the dividend is a
relatively minor cost to a company. They should think seriously before
committing themselves to a course of action that may rebound.' Cutting the
dividend can send the message that the board lacks confidence in the outlook
and is 'chopping and changing' its policy.
His view is that a maintained dividend in recession should be the quid pro
quo for increasing it at a much slower rate than earnings in the good years.
The decision to maintain may be easier for companies that regard their
investment bulge as over. Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the chemicals, building
supplies and animal feed company, falls into this category after putting
together the Harcros builders' merchant chain. And as its shares have tended
to be bought for an above average yield, shareholders will expect a high
priority to be given to dividend maintenance.
Rewarding shareholder loyalty - especially when there has been a rights
issue within the last year or two - is also a factor. While it might be a
bit crude to suggest that maintaining the dividend is one way to buy a bit
more loyalty when a weak share price suggests bid vulnerability, a message
of confidence in the future is a sound defensive move.
As share price falls at British Steel and Trafalgar House showed, it may not
be enough to maintain the dividend this time while warning that the next one
might be cut.
On the other hand, Mr Myners of GIM points to two examples - Coats Viyella
and Midland Bank - where the share price recovered after results
announcements in spite of a dividend reduction.
He is concerned that dividend distribution, in general, may have become too
high through excessive increases in the good years. The chart shows that
dividend cover in this recession is lower than during the last one. The
income demands on companies may have become too strong through 'too many
investment packages based on a requirement for high distribution'. 'If they
want income, they should buy bonds,' Mr Myners says.
There is, however, one point on which fund managers should be able to agree:
they would like companies to have a consistent dividend policy and to state
the criteria they have used for fixing payments.
One said rather wearily that the decision seemed sometimes to be based on
the finance director ringing up the broker to ask what the market was
expecting.
A transparent policy would make it easier for companies' varying priorities
to be properly understood.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Preview of the Results Season: When rights may no longer be
right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO IS going to finance an upturn in corporate activity and the rebuilding
of recession-battered balance sheets in preparation for the economic
turnround now forecast for the second half of 1992?
Last year the early stage of this process coincided with the year-end
reporting period. In something of an open season for rights issues, more
than half the total Pounds 9.5bn taken from the market in 1991 was raised
between mid-March and the end of June.
This year analysts believe a similar amount could be raised, but that the
institutional appetite may not be as great. There are also some doubts that
banks will be willing or able to play a significant role in financing
corporate recovery.
In theory, companies should be gearing up financially as they move into a
recovery cycle, in the same way that they should have been running debt down
as they moved into recession in 1989.
In practice, it is obvious that the corporate sector entered the recession
far too highly geared. And despite substantial progress towards reducing
debt last year - to a level called 'comfortable' in a recent Goldman Sachs
report - the banks are in no mood to fall in line with the theory by
encouraging a return to borrowing.
Some bank balance sheets are themselves badly in need of a patch-up - if not
actually a call on shareholders - so that all but the strongest companies
are likely to be excluded from this route.
'The good quality companies will not want a lot from the banks because of
their own cashflow or disposals,' says Mr Trevor Laugharne, a UK equity
strategist at Kleinwort Benson. 'The problem is that there is not enough
capital going from banks to small- and medium-sized companies at economic
rates.'
Many companies are, therefore, likely to turn again to rights issues -
whether they go to the market voluntarily, like J Sainsbury, Tesco and Bass
early in last year's flood of issues, or of necessity, like British
Aerospace later on.
The extent to which they will tap shareholders will depend in part on the
market's fortunes.
The majority view, expounded by the likes of Mr George Hodgson, an equity
strategist at Warburg Securities, is that the FT-SE 100 Index is heading for
the 2,900 level by the calendar year-end, on the back of earnings recovery
and higher earnings multiples as the economy moves towards low inflation and
low interest rates.
Based on a similar forecast, Mr Bob Semple of County NatWest estimates
another Pounds 10bn of rights issues this year - though they will probably
come later in the year as few large companies appear prepared to risk going
to the market in the run-up to the general election.
A minority view, put forward by Mr Nick Knight, Nomura's head of strategy,
is that the market has seen its top level with the industrial index already
high at 15.5 times historic earnings. 'There will probably be a hung
parliament and political uncertainty will continue throughout 1992,' he
says.
A Conservative election victory could only temporarily boost the market and
companies thinking of a rights issue will gain only a marginal benefit from
waiting. Mr Knight admits, though, that companies do not appear to be
queueing up to launch cash calls at this time.
This year's call on the capital markets will also differ from 1991 in that
institutions are shifting the allocation of their assets. In simple terms,
they are debating whether to cut the proportion of their portfolios in
equities and increase the proportion in gilts - which are looking cheap as
interest rates and inflation stabilise at the lowest levels for 20 years.
'The gilts weighting will go up and the institutions will have to finance a
lot of the government's public sector borrowing requirement,' says Mr
Hodgson. But even though institutions are likely to increase their
weightings of gilts, this is likely to be at the expense of overseas
holdings of bonds and equities rather than UK equities.
Nervousness about Wall Street and the Tokyo stock market may in fact lead to
less outflow of capital from the UK market. Mr Hodgson says that increased
sterling stability within the Exchange Rate Mechanism could also encourage
foreign investors to greet a Conservative election victory by increasing
their investment in the UK market. This would be an additional source of
funding for rights issues.
Institutional reaction to the other route for companies to raise cash - the
cutting of dividends - is likely to be hostile, despite the Governor of the
Bank of England's suggestion last November that such cuts could be regarded
as 'a mark of responsible and resolute management'.
Institutions remember that when ICI cut its dividend by 26 per cent in 1981,
it took eight years for the dividend to be restored in real terms. Given the
relatively small contribution to the recovery cash pot from such a move,
dividend cuts are likely to be low on a finance director's list of options.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Preview of the Results Season: Between no gain and some pain
 -Last year's downgradings should limit the fall in an already weakened
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY

<TEXT>
THE STOCK MARKET is facing a testing time. Over the next few weeks it may
have to contend with a stream of companies cutting - or even passing -
dividends as they report their 1991 results.
After 18 months of recession, with precious few signs of a recovery and a
general election looming, investors are nervously avoiding action. 'The
market is hunkered down, waiting for the storm,' suggests one market
strategist.
'Its difficult to spot winners until we get a full damage report on 1991 and
the recession.'
'We are trapped between no gain and some pain,' says Mr Nick Knight, head of
strategy at Nomura, arguing that the best the market can hope for is to get
through the results period unscathed.
The reporting season is unlikely to produce many nasty surprises in terms of
the numbers companies publish, if only because there have been so many
revisions to forecasts already.
This time last year analysts were expecting industrial companies as a whole
to show earnings rises in 1991. But hopes of a post-Gulf war recovery proved
false. Now forecasts are for earnings of industrial companies to have fallen
in 1991 by about 10 per cent.
A heavy round of downgradings towards the end of last year means that
forecasts of companies' profits and earnings should by now be fairly
accurate. And since those downgradings were at least in part responsible for
the weaker stock market at the time, the hope is that the market should not
fall much on poor profits news now.
The expected fall in earnings might look modest, given the length and depth
of the recession.
Yesterday's figures for the UK's fourth quarter GDP (excluding oil and gas),
showing a decline of 0.4 per cent against the third quarter, was the sixth
quarter of recession and brought the fall for 1991 to 2.6 per cent (again
excluding oil and gas), the worst year-on-year fall in output since 1931.
However, companies have worked to cut costs to bring them into line with the
levels of activity, and the UK stock market derives a high proportion of its
earnings - approaching half - from abroad.
Also the average figure includes a wide variation of results.
Some sectors, such as health and household goods, are expected to show good
profit gains, while utilities are relatively unaffected by the recession.
It is companies in areas like capital goods which will bear the brunt of the
recession, seeing much larger falls in earnings.
Outside the industrial group, figures from financials such as the banks and
composite insurance companies will be bloody.
Surprises in the results season are more likely to come from decisions on
dividends, with the average level of dividend cover down to about 2 times -
lower than it was in the depths of the early 1980s recession. Then cuts were
rarer as the higher rate of inflation gave companies more scope to hold
dividends. This time round, with inflation lower, the decisions will be
harder.
The low level of dividend cover will take some time to restore. Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, the securities house, estimates that it would take three years
of earnings growing by 12 per cent a year and no dividend increases to
restore dividend cover to 2 1/2 times.
'The dividend issue is the big one,' says one fund manager, 'and there are
bound to be upsets.' However, he thought that price movements following cuts
will be 'stock specific', rather than pulling the market down as a whole.
However, dividend cuts could affect the market as a whole, if they were so
widespread that a large proportion of the market was involved or if a large
and leading company not expected to cut - an ICI for instance - decided to
do so.
There is also a political element to the dividend decision. A string of
headlines about the poor performance of British industry could be thought
unhelpful to the Conservative party's prospects in the election.
Shares of companies whose dividends are considered most at risk have already
moved to reflect fears of a cut, with stocks such as Royal Insurance, T&amp;N
and Lucas on double figure yields. But as one investor put it: 'Very often a
cut is not fully in the price even when you think it is.'
Some investors are prepared to accept cuts, hoping that even if a share
price falls on the day, once the bullet has been bitten they can stop
focusing on the short-term news and the investment horizon can move outwards
again.
'The atmosphere has changed from a year ago when companies were expected to
maintain dividends at all costs,' says one broker. 'Now it's recognised that
if companies over-distribute, the only result will be them asking for the
money back through a rights issue.'
Dividend cuts are not only important for companies to conserve cash.
The decision to make a cut will be seen by shareholders as a more tangible
and immediate indication of the directors' view of the future than a gloomy
statement would be.
'If they cut dividends it means there is no end to the recession in sight,'
is the opinion of a broker.
One fund manager says that 'at the end of the day companies will have to
make a decision about 1992. My fear is that they will get nervous and cut
when in fact they do not really need to. Cashflow cover of dividends is
better than earnings cover and many companies could take the long-term view
if they do not lose their nerve.'
If companies do cut their dividend, though, they may find themselves subject
to a takeover bid later.
'We are working on a lot of things,' says one corporate financier, 'and we
are just waiting for the dividend cuts and the election to get out of the
way before we move.'
As at this time last year, forecasts now are for a revival in earnings in
the current year. Some brokers are expecting a sharp bounce in profits in
1992, with estimates for industrial group earnings rising as much as 20 per
cent.
But already the estimates are being pulled downwards from numbers even
higher than that.
Most forecasts are now for percentage increases in the teens. UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew is claiming the low field with a forecast of an 8 per cent rise.
That low forecast is on the basis of no pick-up in economic activity, while
the more optimistic ones are hoping for some revival later in the year.
Thus, even without any help from the economy, earnings should begin to
recover.
It is widely expected that actions companies have taken to cut costs will
feed through to profits this year.
'If the volume of business is unchanged in 1992 compared to 1991, there will
still be gains from rationalisation,' says one stockbroking strategist.
While the economy has been falling, companies have been trying to cut their
cost bases to match the lower level of demand. If the economy stabilises,
the redundancies taken will have brought improvements in productivity, and
other cost cutting moves will also start to pay off.
Once there is a pick-up in business, then the lowering of the cost base of
industry will have increased operational gearing, meaning a sharper rise in
profits. British Airways, for instance, gave the market a pleasant surprise
when its third-quarter results showed a five-fold improvement in profits, in
part due to cost-cutting.
Another source of profit improvement is the overseas earnings of UK
companies. Other countries' economies have not fared as badly as the UK, and
there are early signs of recovery in the US. With foreign earnings such a
large proportion of the UK companies' profits, the impact on the stock
market is significant.
Companies should also find their interest charges reducing, as interest
rates have fallen and many have worked to improve their balance sheets.
Rights issues raised Pounds 9.5bn last year, helping companies to pay down
debt taken on in the late 1980s.
In the short term, then, strategists are not expecting the market to perform
well unless some unexpected good news arrives - such as a stronger
Conservative showing in the opinion polls or more certain signs of a
national economic recovery.
The FT-SE 100 Index is seen as being in a trading range between 2,450 and
2,600, with the lower figure regarded by many as representing reasonably
solid value on current earnings and dividend forecasts. 'The market is not
riding for a fall,' says one, 'but there will be individual surprises.'
Once the results season is out of the way, there will be the election to
contend with and then the looked-for economic revival to appear on the
horizon. It may be some time before the bulls can run again.

<TEXT>
BANK OF SCOTLAND is negotiating to take a stake in an Italian company which
operates in the home loans market. It would be the first venture the
Edinburgh-based institution has made in mortgage lending outside the UK.
The bank confirmed yesterday that it was negotiating with Finanziaria
Italiana Mutui (FIM), the mortgage lending arm of Sopaf, the Milan-based
merchant bank run by Mr Jody Vender, which has branched into a variety of
property-related activities.
The size of Bank of Scotland's stake could be about 25 per cent or larger,
but the bank is unwilling to give more details until a deal is concluded.
According to Italian press reports, both Bank of Scotland and SAI, the
Italian insurance company, would take sizeable stakes in FIM in order to
expand it. SAI is controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, a controversial
property developer who also has a dominant interest in Grassetto, one of
Italy's biggest building groups.
Italy has a relatively large mortgage market, which has been buoyed by the
high level of owner-occupancy and of second home ownership. About 65 per
cent of Italians own their own homes, a figure similar to that in the UK.
Mortgage lending has been dominated by local and regional savings banks, and
by co-operative banking institutions. However, glaring inefficiencies among
many of the domestic players, notably in the time taken to negotiate
mortgages, have attracted foreign participants, many of them from the UK.
Abbey National has opened eight branches since it arrived in 1989, while the
Woolwich building society provides mortgage services for smaller regional
and local banks. Both claim they can process a mortgage application within a
week - whereas some Italian banks take up to six months.
In the case of FIM, the alliance of a foreign bank and a domestic insurer,
linked with a builder and property developer, could produce a formidable
combination.
Bank of Scotland last year took a 5 per cent stake in Sistemi di Monetica,
an Italian credit card company. Its other foreign operations are a 30 per
cent stake in Dorian Bank of Greece and a joint credit card venture with the
Quelle mail order company in Germany.

Carbon Link of the UK has acquired AUG, an eastern German producer of
activated coal, from the Treuhand privatisation agency with the help of
venture capital from the East German Investment Trust.
The purchase, for an undisclosed price, commits Carbon Link to invest DM20m
(Pounds 6.9m) in AUG up to 1995.
Treuhand stressed that because of the sale to Carbon Link, AUG would not
become an 'extended workbench of west German companies'.
Under the deal AUG is assured of the exclusive supply of coconut shell
activated coal from Sri Lanka which is processed and marketed under the
Precolith label. This rounds out the company's line of products to include
all applications of activated coal: environmental protection, water
treatment and removal of pollutants from air and water.

INCREASED financing costs after the collapse of Polly Peck International in
late 1990 were responsible for the sharp fall in year-end profits reported
by Vestel Electronik, PPI's Turkish consumer electronics subsidiary.
Profits after tax for the year to December 31 1991 fell 53 per cent to
TL57.5bn (Pounds 6.32m) in spite of a 53 per cent jump in sales to TL1,304bn
(Pounds 147m).
The results are even worse when set against Turkey's 71 per cent inflation
rate in 1991, and reflect the company's continuing cash crisis since the PPI
collapse.
Vestel is the second largest producer of colour televisions, with a 14 per
cent share of the local market. The company floated 18 per cent of its
equity in 1990.
However, the shares are currently languishing at about TL2,500 compared with
their issue price of TL13,250.
The company exports about 20 per cent of production. It is also heavily
dependent on imported components and was badly hit by the steady
depreciation of the Turkish lira during 1991.
Before its parent went into administration in October 1991, Vestel relied
entirely on PPI for short-term credit, financing its imports through letters
of credit.
The company negotiated a line of credit with Goldstar, its Korean joint
venture partner. In January Vestel raised Dollars 24m (Pounds 13.7m) selling
an Istanbul property which was to have been the headquarters of all the PPI
Turkish companies. Mr Tahsin Karan, president of Vestel, said that the
proceeds would be used as working capital.
According to the latest accounts, Vestel still has outstanding trade debts
to its parent company of Dollars 11m.

FT  21 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Ship's first arrest has priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUBI SEA
Queen's Bench Division (Admiralty Court):
Mr Justice Sheen:
February 5 1992
A PLAINTIFF who arrests a ship in good faith in the first of two actions in
rem, preserves it within the jurisdiction for the benefit of all other
claimants and therefore, after the Admiralty Marshal, has a priority claim
for payment of the costs of arrest out of the proceeds of sale of the ship
sold by court order in the second action.
Mr Justice Sheen so held when giving judgment for caveators, Ince &amp; Co and
another, on an issue as to priority of entitlement to payment out of monies
in court representing the proceeds of sale of Rubi Sea, on an application by
the plaintiff, Hambros Bank Ltd, for payment out in respect of its action in
rem against the ship.
HIS LORDSHIP said that on June 7 1991 a writ in rem against Rubi Sea was
issued out of the Admiralty and Commercial Registry.
The claim endorsed on the writ was for Dollars 121,641 for goods and
materials supplied to Rubi Sea at the port of Houston at her owners'
request.
On the same day a warrant of arrest was issued.
The ship was arrested by the Marshal's substitute on Saturday, June 8 1991,
at her berth at Simon Storage, North Side, River Tees.
On June 10 a writ was issued by Norton Rose on behalf of Hambros Bank in
respect of a claim for Dollars 3.38m and interest due to the bank, secured
by a mortgage on Rubi Sea.
On June 12 Ince &amp; Co released the ship from arrest.
She was immediately re-arrested in respect of the claim by Hambros Bank.
On June 18 Hambros Bank applied for and obtained an order for leave to make
payments to the master, officers and crew of Rubi Sea in respect of wages
and repatriation expenses.
On June 27 the court adjudged that the mortgage was valid and gave judgment
for Hambros for Dollars 3.4m, and costs.
The court ordered that Rubi Sea be appraised and sold by the Admiralty
Marshal.
In due course the ship was sold for Dollars 3.5m, less the Marshal's costs
amounting to Pounds 15,619. Her bunkers were sold for Dollars 21,129, less
the Marshal's costs of Pounds 127.
The proceeds of sale had been brought into court.
In addition to the two claims there were also seven caveats against release
of the funds.
Ince &amp; Co had incurred Pounds 1,126 costs in connection with the first
arrest.
It was argued on behalf of Hambros Bank that Ince &amp; Co were not entitled to
recover their costs of arrest because they had not shown, and could not
show, that that arrest conferred a benefit on the mortgagees.
In The Falcon (1981) 1 Lloyd's Rep 17 his Lordship had said that the
proceeds of sale of a ship sold by court order should be used first to pay
the Admiralty Marshal's charges and expenses; and second, to reimburse the
plaintiff, who had incurred expense in preserving the property by arresting
the ship and maintaining that arrest.
He said: 'If there is more than one action and if the ship is appraised and
sold by an order made in a second or subsequent action, the plaintiff in the
first action should make application to the court for reimbursement of the
expenses of preserving the property. The court will so order unless he has
acted in bad faith.'
The argument advanced for Hambros Bank was that they would have arrested the
ship on June 12 in any event, and that no property was preserved for them by
the arrest by Ince &amp; Co. A solicitor who acted for a client with a claim in
respect of which an action in rem might be brought against the ship in
connection with which the claim arose, had a duty to his client to serve
that writ on the ship and arrest the ship at the earliest opportunity.
A warrant for arrest would not be executed until there had been lodged in
the Marshal's office an undertaking to pay on demand the fees of the Marshal
and all expenses incurred by him in respect of the ship's arrest and the
care and custody of it while under arrest (RSC Order 75 rule 10(3)).
That undertaking was normally given by the plaintiff's solicitor personally.
In such circumstances the solicitor could not be expected to delay giving
instructions to arrest while he made inquiries as to whether a claimant with
a higher priority was intending to enforce his claim and, if so, whether the
ship would remain within the jurisdiction of the court long enough for that
other claimant to arrest her. The 'other claimant' might change his mind.
The plaintiff who first arrested the ship preserved the property on behalf
of all claimants by arresting the ship within the jurisdiction.
There was no suggestion that Ince &amp; Co acted in bad faith.
Accordingly the order would be that they should recover their costs of the
arrest in priority to all claims other than the Admiralty Marshal's charges
and expenses.
For Hambros Bank: Simon Kverndal (Norton Rose).
For two of the caveators: Ince &amp; Co and Ingledew Brown Bennison &amp; Garrett.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Provident Financial 6% lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVIDENT FINANCIAL, the Bradford-based consumer finance group, saw pre-tax
profits fall by 6 per cent, from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 34.1m, for the year
to December 31.
Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said that the result was satisfactory
when set against the failure of the UK economy to improve during the year
and the fact that the group was without a chief executive for five months
after the sudden death of Mr Peter Hogg in May.
Provident Personal Credit, the largest subsidiary which specialises in
weekly collected credit, produced excellent results and kept tight control
on its costs and margins, the company said.
Two other weekly collected credit companies in the group, HT Greenwood and
Lawson Fisher, fared less well because of continuing re-organisation and the
impact of the recession on bad debts and sales of merchandise.
Mr van Kuffeler said that profits rose by Pounds 5m to Pounds 38m for weekly
collected credit as a whole.
Provident does not publish figures for its provisions against bad debt but
the charge for the year was about 30 per cent up on 1990.
Halifax Insurance, the motor insurance subsidiary, reported a 46 per cent
increase in the number of its policy holders, particularly in the woman
motorist sector. Profits were slightly down because of increased thefts
claims and the costs of expansion.
Colonnade Insurance Brokers increased its number of branches from 69 to 100
during the year.
Peoples Motor Finance suffered from the downturn in the car market and
higher bad debts and its contribution to profits was about Pounds 1m below
the previous year.
Steps have been taken to reduce costs and rationalise the branch network, by
reducing the number of its branches from 13 to eight.
Provident's staff numbers are 6,700 compared with 6,867 in 1990 in spite of
the Colonnade expansion.
Group turnover advanced from Pounds 318m to Pounds 360m.
Earnings per share came to 46.63p (48.05p) and a final dividend of 16.5p is
proposed, bringing the total for the year to 25p (23.5p).

Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCLUDING three acquisitions, Fairway (London) lifted sales to Pounds 19.8m
and pre-tax profit by 68 per cent to Pounds 1.77m in 1991. The figures
compared with Pounds 8.36m and Pounds 1.05m respectively.
The group supplies business and computer stationery. It bought GLS, supplier
to publicly-owned schools, educational establishments and councils,
Tonbridge Trade Binders, and Systemforms. GLS cost Pounds 2.3m and the group
raised Pounds 6m via a rights issue to meet that cost and provide working
capital.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said overall group results were satisfactory.
GLS made a substantial contribution for the seven months, Tonbridge results
were creditable, and Hickey's Trade Bindery also performed satisfactorily.
At Fairway Business Forms and Systemforms profits were substantially below
last year.
Earnings per share rose to 5.14p (4.17p). The final dividend is 2.15p to
make 3.15p on the increased capital (3p).

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bespak to spend Dollars 58m expanding US
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BESPAK, a maker of specialist aerosol valves for the pharmaceutical
industry, plans to increase its presence in the US through the acquisition
of Tenax Holding Corp, a privately-owned moulder of plastic medical
components, for Dollars 58m (Pounds 33.1m).
The takeover will be funded via a 3-for-8 rights issue, the second in less
than a year, at 410p to raise Pounds 25.5m. The rest of the cost will be met
through bank borrowings, taking Bespak's borrowings as a proportion of
shareholders funds to about 20 per cent.
The shares closed up 3p at 504p.
In the announcement the group also forecast that pre-tax profits for the
year to end-May would be not less than Pounds 6m, against Pounds 4.42m last
time.
The directors intended to recommend a final dividend of 5.5p to lift the
year's total from 8p to 9p.
Mr Alun Hicks, finance director, said the takeover allowed Bespak to expand
its range of products and customers and give it a greater presence in the
US. 'All the pharmaceutical companies are addressing international markets,
and we too need an international perspective,' he said.
There might be some cost savings from overlap between Bespak and Tenax's
North Carolina manufacturing plants.
Products of Tenax are mainly used in minimal invasive, or 'keyhole',
surgery. The company relied on US Surgical, a leader in the field, for more
than half its sales in 1991.
Tenax also makes components for devices to treat respiratory problems such
as asthma. This fits with Bespak, which is best known for its aerosol valves
sold with Glaxo's asthma medications like Ventolin.
In the half year ended December 31 1991 Tenax recorded profits before tax
and interest of Dollars 3.5m, compared with Dollars 4.1m previously.
The fall was caused by start up costs on new facilities and slower sales of
an anti-nerve gas injector, which had sold well to the US military during
the Gulf war.
Profits this year are expected to be flat, according to Mr Hicks.

exceptionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ward Holdings, the Kent-based housebuilder and property group, yesterday
said the poor state of the housebuilding market had contributed to a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 14m for the year to October 31.
The deficit, which compared with profits of Pounds 3.93m last time, included
Pounds 12.2m of exceptional charges, relating to a write-down in the value
of the land bank.
Losses per share were 19.1p (earnings 4.7p); the final dividend is passed
leaving a total of 0.5p (2.6p). Turnover fell from Pounds 35.4m to Pounds
22.9m.
Expectations of a housing recovery which never materialised adversely
affected the group.
The house construction division was worst hit, incurring a loss before
exceptionals of Pounds 3.39m (profit Pounds 1m).
The exceptional number of house repossessions in the south-east, together
with rising white collar unemployment, continued to overshadow the market.
Better news came from the property investment and commercial development
business which remained in the black, reporting a decline in operating
profits to Pounds 2m (Pounds 3.52m).

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Steetley attacks the German angle -
Redland's management record under fire in new line of defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEETLEY, the building materials group fighting a Pounds 639m hostile bid,
yesterday launched an attack on Redland aimed at undermining faith in its
assailant's management record and overseas expansion.
It accused Redland of being too dependent on Germany, of making 'a costly
mistake' in plasterboard and of needing Steetley to ease tax problems. The
arguments were set out in a document urging shareholders to reject the bid,
following Redland's reopening of hostilities on Wednesday.
Redland's German profits have helped to cushion it against the effects of UK
recession. However, Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's managing director, said
Redland now looked over-dependent on Braas, the German roof tile company,
which last year was thought to have contributed nearly half of group
operating profits.
Because Redland only owned 51 per cent of Braas, it had limited control over
both cash flow and the board. The outlook in Germany had, in any case,
deteriorated because of slower growth and increased competition.
Steetley accused Redland of issuing a flood of paper. Mr Miles said if the
all-share bid succeeded and the new paper were added to last year's 1-for-5
rights issue, the group's equity would be increased by 72 per cent compared
with this time last year.
He said that the March rights issue price had been 510p, while the
underwriting of new shares for the bid had been done in part at 410p.
The issuing of more shares while UK profits had been falling had aggravated
the ACT problem. Acquiring Steetley would not provide a complete cure, he
pointed out.
As for plasterboard, where Redland owns a minority stake in a joint venture,
Steetley estimated that Redland had lost Pounds 50m through its foray into
this market.
Mr Miles said of the document: 'It blasts holes in the carefully manipulated
myth that Redland are good managers.'
Mr Gerald Corbett, Redland's finance director, retorted that Steetley's
'profits have collapsed, their gearing is high, their dividend is uncovered
and their joint venture with Tarmac has been referred to the MMC.'
Before bid speculation began last November, he said its share price had
underperformed the FT-A Building Materials Index by about 25 per cent over
12 months.
He said Steetley had not understood how the German company worked and had
received the wrong message about the German market, which remained buoyant.
The plasterboard episode was largely history and he disputed Steetley's
estimate of losses. There had been no flood of paper: last year's rights
issue was the first since 1986. And on tax, he said Redland had managed to
keep its rate low for 10 years, whereas Steetley's most recent rate was 37
per cent.

SHAREHOLDERS in Govett Atlantic Investment Trust have requisitioned an
Extraordinary General Meeting and called on the managers to present plans to
enable shareholders to realise their holdings at net asset value.
ST Partners, a vehicle for American investor Mr Andrew Shechtel, and
Buchanan Partners, a London-based investment group, which each hold about 5
per cent of the equity capital, have requisitioned the meeting.
Investors holding a further 14.5 per cent of the equity have agreed to
support the motion which calls for the directors to produce 'proposals for
unitisation or other methods of substantially narrowing the discount'.
In January, Govett Atlantic said it was giving consideration to a scheme of
capital reconstruction designed to achieve this purpose.

The result was struck on turnover little changed at IPounds 17.3m compared

Mr R Ian Morrison, chairman, said that economic recovery worldwide was

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bensons pulled back by potato shortage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Principally because of potato shortages last summer, Bensons Crisps saw
pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1m in the year to November
30 1991.
Mr Malcolm Jones, chairman of this USM-quoted company, said the quality of
old crop potatoes in June was 'extremely poor' and there was a shortage of
new crop potatoes in July. The group ran up excess costs of Pounds 300,000
through higher prices paid for 'spot' potatoes, lower yields, factory
standing time and lost sales through limited production.
The pattern of forward purchases for 1992 has been changed to reduce the
risk of any recurrence, the chairman stated.
Sales rose to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 22m). There was a significant switch in
consumer purchasing from standard packs to multipacks, with their inherent
lower margins. In addition, higher priced products suffered under consumer
down-trading.
Earnings came to 9.8p (12.5p). The final is held at 2.15p for a total of
2.85p (2.75p).

<TEXT>
IN ITS first year as a public company Headline Book Publishing saw pre-tax
profit double to Pounds 1.3m.
The result compared with Pounds 637,000 for 1990, and was boosted by a swing
from net interest payable to net interest receivable after the flotation
last April. At December 31 cash stood at Pounds 1.3m.
Earnings per share rose to 9p (6.9p) and the final dividend is 2.5p for a
total of 3p.
Sales were up 35 per cent to Pounds 11.3m and operating profit rose 45 per
cent to Pounds 1.32m. The margin increased from 10.9 per cent to 11.8 per
cent principally because overheads were cut to 32.9 per cent of sales.
Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, managing director, said the substantial sales growth
was achieved by the policy of increasing investment in publishing lists.
Backlist sales of books published in previous years rose 30 per cent, and
continued to build one of the most important elements in the group's
longer-term strategy.

FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Surprise sale of Greencore stake by Irish
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A surprise move which caused considerable annoyance on the Dublin stock
market, the Irish government yesterday sold a third of its 45 per cent
holding in Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods group.
The 12.5m shares were sold at 265p each to the Investment Bank of Ireland,
an institutional fund manager for a number of Irish pension funds.
The sale has breached an undertaking made by the ministry of finance in
April last year at the time of Greencore's flotation, that the government
would not dispose of any further shares in the company for at least two
years unless there were unforeseen circumstances. The company was floated at
230p per share.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, justified the move, saying that
circumstances had changed because of new budgetary pressures resulting from
1992 public sector pay awards. He said 'it had been the original intention
to make the disposal later in the year and thus stay as close as possible to
the two years mentioned . . . but a firm bid at a fair price came through
one stockbroker acting for an institutional fund manager who was prepared to
hold the shares.'
Dealers in Dublin said they were 'shocked', especially as Greencore shares
were being bought at between 270p and 280p during the week, and no effort
was made to make a pro-rata offering to existing shareholders at the
discounted price.
The market found out about the deal at 11am yesterday, but the Dublin Stock
Exchange was apparently not informed until late in the afternoon. One dealer
said: 'It was disgraceful as far as overseas investors are concerned.' Some
1.7m shares were later released onto the market, calming some of the
outrage.
The finance ministry said 'it was a difficult choice to make' but that a
sale to a single bidder was considered 'orderly from the market's point of
view'.
The ministry added that 'there is categorically no question of any further
share sales this year.'

FT  21 FEB 92 / ICL and Fujitsu form three joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU operations in the US and Europe will come under the direct control
of ICL, the Japanese electronics group's UK-based subsidiary, when the two
companies establish three joint ventures later this year.
The move, the result of an ICL initiative, marks a deepening of the trust
between the two companies which began with a technology agreement in 1981
and progressed to Fujitsu taking an 80 per cent stake in ICL in 1990.
Establishment of the new companies is also being interpreted as a way of
underlining ICL's managerial independence from its majority shareholder as
it moves towards flotation on the London market.
Fujitsu is expected to reduce its shareholding to 51 per cent within three
years as a result of the flotation; ICL is expected to announce its choice
of bankers and financial advisers this quarter.
Fujitsu and ICL are planning to launch on April 1 this year:
Fujitsu-ICL Systems in North America. The company will be owned 80 per cent
by ICL, 20 per cent by Fujitsu and will be under ICL's management. It will
comprise ICL's existing North and South American retail systems business and
Fujitsu's retail systems, automated teller machines and hand-held terminals
operations together with Fujitsu's customer service business.
The company, based in Dallas, will have about 2,000 employees and sales of
Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m). ICL Inc, the separate US operation, will
continue to sell industry standard systems to legal and federal government
customers.
Fujitsu Systems Business - Europe. The Bracknell-based company, which will
be wholly-owned by ICL and under ICL's control, will support European
customers for Fujitsu's large mainframes and supercomputers. Most of these
are subsidiaries of Japanese companies. Fujitsu Australia, under Fujitsu
management, will combine all that region's operations of Fujitsu and ICL.
Fujitsu will have 80 per cent of the equity and it will have a turnover of
about Dollars 300m. There will be about 1,900 employees.
ICL has worldwide revenues of about Dollars 4bn and has been the only
consistently profitable European computer manufacturer over the past few
years. Fujitsu's sales now total more than Dollars 21bn making it second to
IBM among information technology companies.

FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Shell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the 3 per cent share price fall that greeted Shell's annual
results, the market was less than impressed with its 4 per cent dividend
increase. BP would have liked to pay a more generous dividend, but was
constrained by its weak balance sheet. Shell had no such excuse; another
percentage point increase would have cost the group a mere Pounds 20m.
Granted, the dividend is only 1.2 times covered by net income, but the cost
of a more generous pay-out would have been marginal in the context of its
enormous cash flow. It is a measure of the group's strength that its
investment programme has so far been unaffected by the downturn.
The question is what message Shell intended to convey. Its statement on
trading conditions was decidedly bearish, so the answer is probably that
dividends will merely match inflation, at least until its chemicals and US
businesses perk up.
More generally, the market is obviously thoroughly disenchanted with the oil
sector; Shell shares have fallen by more than 12 per cent since mid-January.
The mood can be partly explained by investors' belated realisation that oil
companies are not the safe haven they were thought to be. In the last two
recessions, the companies were protected by oil price increases which
fostered the illusion that they were intrinsically defensive. This time, the
weak oil price has exposed their cyclical nature. Shell shares may have
further to fall before they fully reflect that perception, although a
historic yield of 6.5 per cent looks about right. By the same token, when
the cycle turns there should be big rewards. In 1988 Shell's chemicals
division earned Pounds 1bn. Last year, it made Pounds 23m.

FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Steetley's latest defence document is too backward-looking to pack a really
powerful punch. There is, to be sure, plenty to snipe at in Redland's recent
record - the disastrous excursion into plasterboard, an indifferent UK brick
operation and a fondness for issuing new paper. But by knocking the highly
successful German roof tile business, Braas, and Redland's proven financial
engineering skills, Steetley is in danger of taking the insults too far.
Moreover, as Redland underlined in a pre-emptive strike on Wednesday,
Steetley's recent performance is nothing to be proud of either.
The real difference at this stage is that Steetley has little to say about
the future. Redland certainly requires the bid to succeed, but this is not
to say that its target would be better off on its own. The game is up unless
Steetley, effectively denied its joint venture with Tarmac, can quickly
conjure up an independent vision for the 1990s.

FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was too quick to interpret yesterday's half-year figures from
Glaxo as evidence that Zantac is faltering. Underlying growth of the ulcer
drug was certainly down on the most recent 12-month period, but a buyers'
strike in Italy and an obligatory Medicaid refund in the US exaggerated the
trend. Even with these disappointments Glaxo's overall sales at constant
exchange rates increased by an impressive 18 per cent in the six months,
against just 16 per cent for the financial year 1991 as a whole.
Prospects for the new generation of Glaxo drugs are little clearer. The
anti-emetic product Zofran looks like hitting Pounds 250m of sales for the
full year, but the question remains whether it can be sold to treat other
illnesses. The jury remains out on Imigran, which looks set to receive US
approval this summer, and on scare-affected Serevent. Investors will take
more encouragement from news that marketing expenses should fall as a
proportion of sales, and that increases in R &amp; D spending will in future
mirror sales growth. Both developments are good for margins.
With perhaps one third of the equity now in US hands the key to the next
share price move almost certainly lies on Wall Street. Comparisons may be
pertinent with 1983, a year when the world economy was coming out of
recession and Zantac won approval in the US. The first half then saw
continued outperformance, though on the back of the sort of heavy US demand
which nine years later may have run out of steam. The second half of 1983
saw a sharp underperformance, more than wiping out the relative gains of the
first six months.

FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's chance to relax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,543.4 (+6.7)
It might have been more awkward for the government if yesterday's output
figures had turned out to be slightly better, rather than worse, than
expected. Voters would still not have been enjoying much of the feel-good
factor, but the markets might have been less inclined to give the benefit of
the doubt to a generous pre-election budget. As it is, the worse the
economic news, the greater the ap-parent scope for vote-winning fiscal
manoeuvre, even though the GDP figures, like last week's unemployment
numbers, are a lagging indicator.
The consequence looks increasingly like a stimulus nearer to Pounds 4bn than
to the Pounds 2bn which the City once expected, but that is not necessarily
the way to restore sustainable growth. Were it not for the ERM, this
objective would call for sharply lower interest rates to revive credit
demand and arrest asset-price deflation. If fiscal policy has to be the main
instrument, then it arguably makes more sense to target investment in
productive capacity for the future rather than personal consumption.
The markets may be forgiving before the election, but will they remain so
afterwards if Mr Norman Lamont does succumb to the temptation to woo the
individual consumer? Admittedly an injection of Pounds 4bn would be no more
than those of 1983 and 1987 in relative terms, and only half the Lawson
boost of 1988. Yetalmost forgotten by the electorate is the sizeable
spending increase already announced in the Autumn Statement. Tilting the
extra boost towards consumption could cause any recovery to run up quickly
against renewed inflationary pressure and a rising trade deficit. The likely
price is thus reduced scope for cutting interest rates down the road. But
tight money and a looser fiscal policy would be convergence of a sort. The
chancellor could even argue that he was still not as profligate as his
German counterpart.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Letter: Folly inherent in call for a managed economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The chairman of Rover Group attacks the government for its espousal of
market economics (February 18) but fails to tell us what corporate
mechanisms are implied in his call for a national industrial strategy.
Is Mr George Simpson suggesting, for instance, another National Enterprise
Board? If so, he would do well to reflect that, from over 100 investments
made by the NEB, 35 had to be put into receivership or went into
liquidation; 38 were sold at a loss to the taxpayer (including one which
lost Pounds 34m on its own), leaving a mere 29 to be sold at a profit.
Incidentally, the Labour party's proposal for something called British
Technology Enterprise, to be run along similar lines to the NEB, shows that
it is not only Mr Simpson who needs to re-learn the lesson of this
particular corporate folly.
Nor does Mr Simpson help his case by citing a so-called managed economy like
Germany's. There, for example, record public borrowing, excessive state
subsidies, heavily bureaucratic regulation and high corporate taxation all
add to the competitive pressures facing German business leaders compared
with the freer conditions applying in the seemingly reviled UK.
The Rover chief's ill-advised excursion into the political arena would carry
more weight if and when his company manages to get within sight of the
proposed output of his north of England Nissan competitors. In the meantime,
his shareholders can take little comfort from what looks conspicuously like
special pleading.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Beurre Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Butter wouldn't melt in the mouth of Mr Michael Heseltine. From the moment
he rejoined the cabinet in November 1990 he has been as good as apple pie.
Not a whisper of ambition emerges from his lips; not a shadow of a flicker
of a disloyal expression can be discerned on his face. He has adopted a new
role. He has an almost conventional haircut. He is the Conservatives'
Character. His formal appellation of environment secretary is an inadequate
description of his present position within the administration. Character is
his correct title. It is his alone. There is no other. Not even Mr Kenneth
Clarke deserves it; he is still an understudy.
We have now had 14 months of beurre Heseltine. Surely it cannot last? I
think it can, at least for another eight weeks or so. Character will hugely
enjoy adding himself to the Tory campaign. In Wednesday's economic debate we
saw what he can rustle up when there is nothing in the pantry. Teasing the
shadow chancellor for his attempts to establish Labour's respectability at
City luncheons he said of Mr John Smith: 'All those prawn cocktails for
nothing] Never have so many crustaceans died in vain] With all the authority
that I can command as secretary of state for the environment, let me say . .
. 'Save the prawns]'.'
As for Mr Neil Kinnock, whose famous ruminations about phasing in higher
taxation took place at Luigi's restaurant, Character invited the house to
picture 'the leader of the opposition fighting to prevent long strings of
spaghetti slipping through his fork, while the minutiae of national
insurance contributions slipped through the caverns of his mind'. It was
'economics bolognese'.
These trifles diverted our attention from Mr Smith's devastating attack on
the economic record of Mr John Major's government. It was a great service to
the prime minister from the man who, just a year and a bit ago, had
attempted to replace She who regarded herself as the sole bonne femme (or,
as Mr Heseltine might have put it, mauvaise femme).
If you take Character's characteristic explanation, Wednesday's performance
was normal service resumed. He was cooking up no sweet dish for himself,
least of all a future bid for the leadership of his party.
Nothing has ever been further from his thoughts. During his four years in
the wilderness there were, of course, many unworthy suggestions that he had
resigned from Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet and subsequently kept himself
in the limelight with the single purpose of becoming prime minister. The
many of us who conversed with him during that time all unaccountably came to
the same conclusion: he was after the top job.
Mr Heseltine will have none of this. He was determined to He was surprised
how wary of him the younger ministers were
survive as a politician after leaving the cabinet, that was all. As he
accepted the ever-increasing number of invitations to speak at this or that
Tory rally people began to ask if he was ambitious. Being honest, he
acknowledged that, like everyone else, he was. That was how the myth grew.
He did not expect to win in November 1990. His achievement was to survive,
unlike all the others who had departed from Mrs Thatcher's cabinets.
The test of Character will come after April 9, if that is to be polling day.
Before he returned to the fold the supposition was that he would be called
on to lead the party if Mrs Thatcher lost an election, or won it by a
wafer-thin majority. That was then. Now is different - or is it? The odds
are that Mr Major will either win by a handful of seats or find himself
swirling about in a hung parliament. Character will presumably want everyone
to believe, although he probably suspects that they will not, that what
applied when Mrs Thatcher was leader has no validity when Mr Major's goose
is the one that may be about to be cooked. In any case, Mr Heseltine's
firmly expressed forecast is that the Conservatives will return with a
decent majority.
If they do, his loyalists will insist that the party has him to thank for
it. Before he became leader Mr Major was asked whether he would appoint the
then highly controversial Mr Heseltine to his cabinet. His reply was that he
wanted to win the next election. Yet giving Mr Heseltine any big-spending
department is a political statement. It says that the government will put up
with a certain brand of interventionism. Mr Major offered him the
small-spending Home Office, but Character was too wise to accept that mess
of pottage.
His three preferred departments were environment, defence and industry.
Using environment as a base he has involved himself in many of the
politico-industrial decisions that cross Whitehall desks. He could have done
the same from either of the other two departments.
The chosen route of the Channel tunnel rail link into London is his. If a
local authority wishes to bid for some of the Pounds 750m City Challenge
money on offer, it must first demonstrate that its relationships with its
police department and local businesses are cordial. Treasury rules for
accounting for European Community regional aid must be amended, as, after
some delay, they were. He does not always get his own way, but he does so
often enough.
When Character first returned to office he was surprised by how wary of him
the younger ministers and officials were. It has taken time to allay their
fears. Now he finds himself close to the prime minister, not quite his
deputy - Mr Major is too sensible for that - but one of the inner circle of
strategists, able to go where he pleases and speak on any subject he likes.
If the Conservatives win well, and Mr Major has the courage to keep him, Mr
Heseltine will surely become his deputy for micro-economic management, just
as Mr Douglas Hurd is for foreign affairs. If not, there may be an awful
mess in the kitchen.

<TEXT>
Sir, My guess is that Labour's 5-point lead among women voters disclosed by
Harris (February 17) is directly due to different attitudes to the urgent
problem of childcare.
Until the present government overcomes the antiquated and short-sighted
views of the Treasury and some of its own party backwoodsmen on a national,
affordable, good-quality system of childcare, rather than tinkering at the
margins, it cannot rely on the votes of millions of working parents who
consider this matter ever more central to their economic lives.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Letter: 'Seeing the whole' - The route to introducing
management processes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was disappointed by Christopher Lorenz's conclusion from his reading
of 'The Fifth Discipline', by Peter Senge, that organisational learning is
likely to become the 'next American-spawned management fashion' (Management,
February 17).
Systematically, perhaps, Lorenz has captured the major themes of the book.
Systematically, he has failed, in spite of the fact that the Fifth
Discipline is all about systemic thinking. Lorenz shows every sign of being
event-driven rather than rising above management fashions to understand the
underlying processes. I accept that there are gaps and over-simplifications
in the book. However, the message is clear: we need to 'see the whole' if we
are to succeed in introducing any of the management processes of total
quality, time-based competition, change management, etc.
Our consultancy experience indicates that organisations are beginning to
realise the power of systemic thinking - it is this that integrates the
functional and operational areas of the organisation resulting in greater
organisational effectiveness. The concept of the Learning Organisation is
just one facet of systemic thinking. It is the application of systemic
thinking that permits organisations to address such paradoxes as 'autonomy
and control' and 'continuity and change'. TQM itself has raised these very
questions: how do you 'empower' the workforce without losing control over
the organisation; how can 'continuous improvement' take place? Management
fads and recipes are no substitute for systemic thinking as a way to manage
complexity.
True, Senge is not the first to promote these ideas. One of the UK's
foremost proponents of systemic management is Professor Stafford Beer, whose
numerous works include 'Cybernetics and Management' in 1959; 'Platform for
Change' in 1975; 'The Heart of Enterprise' in 1979; 'Diagnosing the System
for Organisations' in 1985. So, what is new? Again the UK has been slow to
accept its own home-grown ideas. If it takes Senge's evangelical fervour to
waken UK plc and public sector organisations to the potential of systemic
thinking, then so be it.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Letter: Ambitious, not unsuccessful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD WATNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Danny Chapchal's views (Management: The Growing Business, February 18)
on why so many small businesses fail are hardly revolutionary and are
particularly inappropriate for those companies fortunate to be still trading
successfully. His comments about management style, employability and the 'we
know best approach' are to be found in most business start-up handbooks.
Although many people start businesses to be more successful than they are
currently being, this should not imply that they are already unsuccessful,
just that their ambitions are not being realised quickly enough. I gave up a
successful career in the City during the boom years to set up my own company
because I felt I could achieve more running my own operation.
I was guilty of many of the traits he highlighted for failure, yet my
particular organisation continues to be highly profitable even in the
current climate. I would suggest that the secret for continued success is
determination and the ability to try out new ideas and learn from both the
unsuccessful and successful ones.
Finally, as Lord Hanson has proved, to turn loss-making operations into
profit by cost reduction and selling off subsidiaries is easier than profit
generation and job creation from new ideas and products.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Lessons of Potchefstroom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's president, Mr F W de Klerk, is fighting for his political
life. He is doing so with characteristic courage. He has responded to the
challenge of a serious by-election defeat with a challenge of his own. The
consequence is that white South Africans will now be faced with a fateful
choice - whether to press ahead with the reform process initiated by Mr de
Klerk, or whether to make what would be a disastrous attempt to stop the
clock.
Mr de Klerk's decision was announced yesterday, following the victory of the
pro-apartheid Conservative Party in Potchefstroom on Wednesday. This western
Transvaal constituency was formerly a safe seat for the governing National
Party, but the CP won it with a commanding majority. The outcome of one
by-election can often be brushed aside as the consequence of a protest vote.
Potchefstroom could be different. It may have signalled the draining-away of
white support for the reform process.
The answer will be established by means of an early referendum of white
voters. Its purpose will be to settle which party the white electorate
wishes to represent it in negotiations with the African National Congress
and other representatives of the black majority. A great deal of care will
have to be taken with the question, which could determine the outcome. If he
loses the referendum, the president said in the white parliament yesterday,
he would resign and call a general election. Thus has the man many South
Africans have compared to Mikhail Gorbachev put at risk his own fate and
that of his country in one dramatic announcement.
False promise
The choices before all South Africans could not be more stark. The
Conservative Party holds out the false promise of a white or white-ruled
Afrikaner republic whose land area contains the richest and most developed
mining and agricultural part of the countrywithout ceding, yet, any of the
rest of South Africa as currently constituted. It would be apartheid with no
real change except the possibility that the maps might be amended. Piling up
enough urban votes to win a referendum would be a triumph for the CP, since
it is strongest in the rural constituencies. If it won, it would be set for
a landslide victory in the subsequent election.
It is probable that the military would be able to contain the black uprising
that would be a consequence of such a retrogression, but the process would
be bloody. The revolt, and the cost of containing it, would be many times
greater than in the early 1980s. South Africa would be more isolated by the
world community than it was before President de Klerk released Mr Nelson
Mandela and began the process of seeking a peaceful settlement.
Powerful mandate
If Mr De Klerk wins, however, he will have a powerful mandate upon which to
base further negotiations, leading to an early interim government
representative of all parties. His difficulty is that, as a negotiator, he
cannot lay all his cards on the table. White South Africans are uncertain
about which compromises he is willing to make over power-sharing and
safeguards for minorities. They will be asked to put their trust in the
president. In a country riddled with fear this is asking a lot. Yet Mr de
Klerk's record suggests that there is no other white South African in whom
it would be better to place such faith.
Black South Africans meanwhile face a test of their patience. The way in
which the ANC and the other non-white or non-racial parties behave between
now and the referendum could affect its outcome. The option of sitting this
one out while the whites make up their minds will not be appealing to
leaders of what is still a quasi-revolutionary movement impatient to take a
share of government power. Yet the president of the ANC, Mr Nelson Mandela,
needs the support of Mr de Klerk just as much as the latter needs him. Mr
Mandela will have to draw on all the powers of vision and statesmanship
expected of him when he was released just two years ago if he is to steer
his own people to a successful negotiation with the only party willing and
able to agree power-sharing in South Africa.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Slow motion, but not a standstill: The state of Japan's
economy after recent bad corporate results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warnings of losses at Sony, the consumer electronics group. Boardroom
reshuffles at Isuzu Motors, the truck maker, and at Yamaha, the musical
instrument company. Unprecedented proposals for cuts in research and
development spending at Toshiba, the industrial combine.
The recent wave of Japanese corporate announcements leaves no doubt that the
country's economic slowdown is hurting even the largest companies. The gloom
has spread far from the recession-hit financial community into important
parts of manufacturing industry. An element of panic is creeping into some
businessmen's pronouncements about the future. Mr Masashi Iwasaki, the
vice-president of Toyota Motor, the carmaker, is not alone when he says:
'Conditions are worse than in the 1970s when we suffered from the oil shock
or the 1980s when we were hit by endaka (the sharp rise in the yen).'
And yet the authorities steadfastly maintain that the economy is slowing
gently following unsustainably rapid growth in the late 1980s. Mr Hiroshi
Yoshimoto, the deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday told a
parliamentary committee that there was no risk of a sudden decline in
Japanese economic activity.
Who is right? Mr Iwasaki at Toyota or Mr Yoshimoto. In a sense both are  -
the economy as a whole is in little danger of plunging into recession, as Mr
Yoshimoto says. But the difficulties facing individual companies and even
whole industries are possibly as severe as Mr Iwasaki claims.
The consensus view among private sector economists in Tokyo is that Japan is
in the midst of a slowdown that could last until the end of the year.
Recovery may be hesitant and modest in scale. But a prolonged recession of
the kind which followed the 1974 oil shock is unlikely.
Businessmen's anxieties are at least understandable. The stock market is in
its deepest slump since the mid-1960s. Banks are burdened with a mountain of
bad debt accumulated by stock and property investors who are going bankrupt
in record numbers. Insolvent companies left debts of Y8,000bn (Pounds 36bn)
last year - double the previous record of 1985. Industrial companies have to
cope with low growth, high inventories, and over-extended capital investment
and product development programmes. Losses are never to be taken lightly.
The squeeze on profits could last a year or more. However, even though many
companies will face difficulties, Japanese industry as a whole is well
placed to meet the challenge - by drawing on the resources accumulated in
the fat years of 1987-90, the longest period of sustained growth since the
second world war.
Figures put the problems in perspective. Economists polled this month by
Toyo Keizai, a business information company, forecast on average that
economic growth would slip from 5.7 per cent in 1990-91 to about 3.5 per
cent in the year to March 1992 and 2.5-3 per cent in 1992-93. That is a far
cry from the oil shock year of 1974 when the economy declined 0.8 per cent.
It is, however, similar to the growth of 2.6 per cent achieved in 1986, when
business sentiment was at least as bad as it is today. (Then, too, one of
Japan's premier companies - Nissan Motor - suffered an operating loss.)
Certainly, capital investment is expected to fall in the new financial year
 -the first decline in 15 years, according to Nippon Credit Bank. But the
bank expects a fall of only 1 per cent with continuing increases in
investment by service companies compensating for a sharp decline by
manufacturers. Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business newspaper, forecast a
decline of 4.5 per cent. However, these declines are from levels so high
that Japan has been investing more each year than the US, an economy nearly
twice as large.
Consumer spending is still fairly buoyant. Spending on luxury and high-cost
goods has fallen but purchases of a wide range of consumer goods and
services, even including non-essential items such as holidays, remain solid.
It is, for example, almost impossible to book a room in a ski resort at the
weekend within travelling distance of Tokyo.
Exports too have held steady, with orders from the growing economies of east
Asia and to some extent from Europe compensating for weak demand from North
America.
Nevertheless, there is no denying the shock caused by recent corporate
announcements. Sony, which this week forecast parent company operating
losses of Y20bn in the year to March, has not been in the red since it was
listed in 1958. Fujitsu, Toshiba and NEC, giants of the electronics
industry, expect profit declines of 40-80 per cent. Toyota, with a June
year-end, reported a 30 per cent decline in profits in the six months to the
end of December.
More nasty surprises can be expected as the great bulk of companies with
March year-ends prepare their final accounts.
Sluggish sales and falling profits are prompting severe cuts in corporate
spending, starting with capital investment. Sony is reducing capital
investment by a third to Y280bn. Toshiba says it is considering a reduction
of 20-30 per cent. Other electronics group are certain to follow suit.
Companies are even making cuts in their current operations. Nissan, the
motor group, announced plans to close its assembly plant in Australia.
Daihatsu, another vehicle manufacturer, is pulling out of the US market.
Toshiba is considering cutting research and development spending - for the
first time ever. The most hard-pressed companies are going as far as sacking
staff - a rare move in a country where lifetime employment is the norm among
large employers.
But anecdotes from the corporate battle front need to be put in context.
First, much of the bad news coming from manufacturing is concentrated in
three industries: motors, electronics and machine-making. These sectors
performed particularly well in the 1980s and are now suffering a sharp
cyclical downturn. Cars, electronics and machines account for more than half
of Japan's exports but only about 10 per cent of total output. Factories
still dominate large swathes of Japan's urban landscape, but they now
produce less than 30 per cent of the nation's output. Fully 60 per cent of
output services.
Next, even within these industries some groups are much better off than
others. Sony is worse hit by the downturn in demand than some of its rivals
because of its relatively heavy debt. Matsushita Electric Industrial, with
cash in the bank, has more room for manoeuvre.
Some industries have so far been untouched by the downturn, notably
shipbuilding where order books are so full that companies are rehiring
retired workers. Demand also remains buoyant in food processing and
toiletries and other non-cyclical industries. 'Our sales are good,' says an
official at Lion, a leading soap manufacturer.
Even Lion may yet feel the pinch. Some supermarket chains, notably Jusco,
one of the largest operators, are preparing price discounting campaigns. As
one Jusco executive says: 'Consumers are more worried about their money in a
recession.'
That is true. But Japan is still a long way from a true recession, when the
economy contracts for two successive quarters. Moreover, while some negative
influences, such as cuts in capital spending by electronics companies, have
still to exert their full impact on the economy, benign forces are also at
work, such as the effects of last year's three cuts in the Official Discount
Rate, taking it from 6 per cent to 4.5 per cent.
In the last resort, it is not forecasts, which could prove too optimistic,
but the ability of the authorities to react to bad news that gives
confidence. The Bank of Japan has room to cut rates further and is widely
expected to do so in the next two or three months. After a decade of fiscal
self-restraint, the government could also launch an economy-boosting
increase in public spending. Should a real recession appear on the horizon,
the government has adequate room for manoeuvre.

The Japanese economy may not be in recession, but this is cold comfort to
the country's electronics industry. The industry, which has been one of the
engines of growth of the Japanese economy, is sputtering and stalling,
writes Steven Butler.
Sony, a flagship company for Japanese consumer electronics, is currently
suffering losses of about Dollars 1.7m a day. Toshiba, NEC and Fujitsu have
already slashed profits forecasts for the fiscal year ending in March.
Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and Matsushita Electric Industrial are likely
to follow suit.
There are several reasons for the reversals. While consumer spending in
Japan remains relatively strong, the competition between electronics
manufacturers in the domestic market is cut-throat. At the same time,
electronics companies have failed to develop a new generation of consumer
goods to replace existing products. In the past, their strategy was to use
their technological strengths to develop new products, which in turn would
generate demand. But at the moment, this strategy does not seem to be
working.
In consumer electronics, where Matsushita and Sony are the biggest
companies, consumers' demand for the products on offer has been satisfied.
Sales of colour televisions, video recorders, hand-held video cameras,
Walkman-type cassette recorders and compact disc players  - the big hits of
recent years - have peaked. And there is little on the horizon to fuel a new
burst of demand.
Sony has managed to keep its factories humming, churning out more products,
but not at a profit. It is, moreover, burdened with net debts of Y1,000bn
(Pounds 4.5bn) following its purchase of Columbia Pictures in 1989 and CBS
Records in 1988. Sony is finally paying the cost of its willingness to take
big risks, and is being forced to cut capital spending by 36 per cent this
year as a result.
The other large Japanese electronics companies are suffering because of
their investment in developing semiconductor chips, the memory banks of
electronic products. Prices of the latest generation of high-capacity
semiconductor chips - the 4 megabit dynamic random access memory chips  -
collapsed even before demand picked up.
None of the companies is likely to make profits on the hundreds of millions
of dollars needed to develop the chips. The next generation of chips, the
16M D-Rams, is likely to be a money loser, and there is as yet no apparent
mass market application for 64M D-Ram chips, the following generation of
semiconductors.
Toshiba, meanwhile, has lost its leadership in the US market for portable
computers, which it helped to create, and is struggling at home. Fujitsu is
suffering from the 'downsizing' in the computer industry - the move away
from mainframes to small, powerful workstations.
Japanese electronics companies are facing difficult questions about where to
invest. They will have to spend less, and funnel it into products and
technologies that are less risky. Some will find they have to abandon parts
of their businesses and focus on what they can do best.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I had a really good time,' said a young man after this to his two female
companions. They agreed; and so do I. But, as he said it, we had to laugh,
because 4 Marys is obscure, complex, confusing and concerned with the
none-too-jolly tale of Mary Queen of Scots. It is also stimulating, poetic,
frequently witty and cumulatively poignant.
Mary Q. of Ss, you may recall, had four Marys-in-waiting. The story of one
of them, Mary Hamilton, became immortal in a trad. folk song (Joan Baez used
to sing it) and I was expecting an interweaving of four such Lives of the
Unknown. But Second Stride, with its fascination with doppelgangers, has
focused only on the main biographical facts, with the four Marys as
afterimages of their comrade and queen.
Part One is in France (Mary's youth), Part Two is in Scotland and England
(Mary's adult years). But no story is properly told; and in several scenes
more than one Mary is queen at a time. The ambiguity of multiplication is
part of Second Stride's house style. The movement, almost all the words and
most of the costumes are deliberately 20th-century. (The five Marys queue to
use a public telephone. The first one: 'Hello, is that Westminster? . . . Is
Elizabeth there? . . . It's Mary.')
4 Marys has more speech and less dance than most of Second Stride's other
mixed-media productions of recent years. It is called a play, and Martin
Duncan and Ian Spink devised and directed it. But what wells up through this
collage of often mundane and half-nonsense talk is a gathering of feelings
beyond words, of states that words may relieve but do not express. The
movement in the piece - mostly lyrical extensions of mime - heighten this
impression.
Part One creates a world of privilege, leisure, hedonism, high education and
finishing-school etiquette. Beneath the amusing veneer is a sense of absence
from family and home, of distance from serious responsibility or engagement
in life, of mysteries not comprehended. Part Two reverses all that. Mary
(times five) discovers home, mother, adult society, marriage, and
motherhood, all like double-edged swords - and then imprisonment and a new
kind of exile from everything she has discovered.
But I neither can nor should make sense of half of what occurs in 4 Marys.
For all the usual Second Stride cleverness in evidence here, this work
eventually achieves a surprisingly precognitive account of women's
experience. And it is funny. To take one small example, the Marys' shock in
rediscovering Scotland - they are woken, in one marvellous moment, by
bagpipes - is as drily satirised as Edith Sitwell's 'Scotch Rhapsody' or
Nancy Mitford's Highland Fling.

At 6.00 Channel 4 repeats Happy Days, a series about the 1950s with Henry
Winkler as Fonzie, which was made in the mid-seventies and has been playing
around the world ever since.
At 7.30 ITV screens yet another episode of Coronation Street, a soap which
began 32 years ago and has not missed a week on screen since then.
At 7.40 BBC2 shows Part 4 of a Doctor Who story which had its first outing
in 1968 and at 8.00 BBC1 begins a brand new batch of In Sickness And In
Health, a youthful slip of a thing which has only been running since 1985,
though its chief character Alf Garnett was originally introduced to us in
1966.
Dream On (10.00 C4) is an ultra-modern American sitcom: it is punctuated
with frequent monochrome clips from fifties TV series. Head is a 24-year-old
movie about The Monkees - remember them?
Awfully ephemeral, television. Tomorrow on C4 you can watch three hours of

FT  21 FEB 92 / Arts: Billy Budd - Theatre Royal, Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike the hapless Captain Vere, who leaves his crew becalmed and mutinous
after trying to engage the enemy when they are out of range, Scottish Opera
chose its moment well. The appointment of a new Music Director is always an
important one and the timing on this occasion was particularly felicitous.
On the day when he was due to make his return to the company as guest
conductor in a revival of Billy Budd Richard Armstrong was named as Music
Director at Scottish Opera with effect from July next year. It is an
appointment that places experience before novelty. During his long tenure at
Welsh National Opera Armstrong built up an extensive and wide-ranging
repertoire which should serve his new company well.
In short, he knows about being in charge of opera in general, and Billy Budd
in particular, as this revival reminded us. If memory serves right, he is a
less full-bloodied interpreter of Britten's score now than he was at the
time when he conducted it at Covent Garden; but the cumulative power of the
opera was amassed scene by scene, and it is a special virtue in any
conductor that he should allow so many of the words to be heard.
The chorus and orchestra supported him superbly. Whatever the present
financial tribulations at Scottish Opera, Armstrong will be taking over a
company in very reasonable artistic shape, as capable of sighting an
operatic success and bringing it successfully to battle as any other in
Britain at the moment.
If this Billy Budd never quite became an electric evening, it was
nonetheless a performance true to Britten's intentions and with a few
pertinent human touches of its own. The production, originally by Graham
Vick, dates from l987, but has held together well as a company effort. There
is the feeling of a real community on board ship, led by seasoned artists
such as Eric Roberts's Mr Redburn and Gordon Sandison's Mr Flint, while
younger singers like Iain Paton as the Novice and Quentin Hayes as Donald
are also offered chances, well taken.
The three principals looked every inch their roles. The innocent eagerness
as well as the youth and energy of Billy Budd were nicely caught by Simon
Keenlyside, who managed to suggest better than any other singer I have seen
in the role a naive unawareness of the dangerous currents swirling around
him. As Vere, Nigel Robson was particularly good at what one might call the
'Pears' aspects of the role, withdrawn, bookish, refined.
Both sang well enough, though Keenlyside wants a little of cutting
brightness to the tone, and the only potential disappointment of the evening
was that the Claggart, Gidon Saks, was having to take things easily in vocal
terms. When he is fully restored to health, he should make a terrifying
Master-at-arms, not least because he is a head taller than everybody else, a
towering demon, whose revelation of his own 'depravity' within wins for this
character too an unexpected measure of sympathy.
All were believable human beings. Indeed, the production's only serious
imposition is to have the aged Vere on stage from time to time, a silent
observer of events. But perhaps this is understandable if Billy Budd is to
be a classic tragedy in the Grecian mould, with Vere the tragic hero forced
to condemn the innocent and live on in the knowledge of his own guilt. For
Britten never quite gets him centre-stage as he should.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Arts: Ornament down the centuries - The new exhibition at
the V&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Henry Cole's day there would have been little need of a gallery examining
the use of European ornament at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Ornament was
an essential component of design, its vocabularly as familiar to the
educated man in the street as to the architect, craftsman or designer. With
the rise of Modernism and its emphasis on form rather than surface
decoration, that understanding all but disappeared. The word ornament lost
its association with state-of-the-art design and came to conjure up awful
images of knick-knacks on the mantelpiece.
Today, the language of ornament is deemed to be worth relearning. Next week,
the V&amp;A's Henry Cole Wing opens its doors on what is believed to be the
world's first gallery to focus on ornament in European design and
decoration. Such a gallery would have been almost inconceivable even in the
1970s, despite growing disillusion with the expressive poverty of Modernism.
The idea is a product of the last two decades - of nostalgic reverence for
the buildings and works of art of the past, and of the rediscovery of colour
and motif by Post-Modern architects and designers. The Modernists' adage was
'Less is more'. Robert Venturi's response was 'Less is a bore'.
The Post-Modernists' eclectic and whimsical use of decoration is a tongue in
cheek subversion of the grammar of ornament. They are not, however, the
first to break the rules. As the new gallery demonstrates so vividly,
ornament is in a constant state of flux.
From April, access to the gallery will be via James Wild's imposing
staircase, hitherto not used by the public but currently being arranged as
an additional picture gallery. Greeting the visitor outside is a decorative
overmantel panel painted by Rex Whistler in 1932 to match the Chinese
wallpaper in Samuel Courtauld's house in South Audley Street. Implausibly it
provided the surround for a Picasso. Inside is a set of car wheel trims.
In the 1860s the gallery was used by the School of Naval Architecture. Today
its central section resembles less an outpost of the Admiralty than an
extension of the Sir John Soane Museum. High terracotta walls are lined with
part of the museum's outstanding collection of ornamental prints, and with
row upon row of cornices and capitals, fragments of friezes, mouldings and
architectural models - a kind of three-dimensional encyclopaedia of the five
orders of classical architecture and its ornament. Articulating the space is
a handsome 1770s doorcase from a now demolished house in Kensington.
Objects are drawn from virtually all the museum departments and arranged
thematically according to motif. In a case devoted to geometric ornament,
say, we find a 16th-century Venetian marquetry box, an Eduardo Paolozzi
plate and a kipper tie. Elsewhere acanthus leaves adorn a workaday Norwegian
wooden butter tub, a fine Chelsea porcelain plate and a William Morris
wallpaper. Carved and gilded they are candle sconces.
What is unexpected is the effect of juxtaposing objects with the same
ornamental characteristics but of different materials, periods, cultures and
status. In a sense we are simply playing a multi-media game of Snap, but the
exercise encourages us to examine more thoroughly objects that we might
otherwise pass by, in or out of a museum case.
How many Concorde travellers have ever looked twice at their British Airways
crockery? A first inspection reveals a border decoration comprising a frieze
of upturned, snub-nosed Concordes. A second, that the pattern is also a
reworking of the classical Vitruvian scroll. We find it again on a handsome
Meissen breadbasket made two centuries before. Modern design is rarely as
divorced from the past as most people imagine. Even Concorde itself, here in
model form, is emblazoned with what is in effect an heraldic device. Planes,
cars and domestic appliances are shown to be no less significant bearers of
ornament in the 20th century than furniture, textiles and ceramics.
Classical architecture provided the Western world with its most enduring
design vocabularly. Its five orders and ornaments are thoroughly treated
here. Sections of non-architectural and non-European ornament are smaller
and offer not so much a visual dictionary as a glorious lucky dip of
comparisons, discoveries and insights. We see lyres and urns used as
ornament, for instance, but find that no other post-classical object has
achieved that distinction. A case devoted to ribbons and swags includes a
carved stone vase previously in store and catalogued as 16th-century
Venetian. Now it is proudly displayed as the work of Piranesi. Repeating
pattern is revealed to be an Islamic invention.
Throughout, the curators have used the museum's outstanding and diverse
resources, especially of prints and the great architectural textbooks, to
give us a sense of how ornament was able to travel through time and from
place to place - and how it was reinterpreted at each manifestation.
The European Ornament Gallery of Design and Decoration 1450-1991, opens at
the V&amp;A on February 26.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vogt is the young German pianist - now about 22 - who came second to Artur
Pizarro (three years older) in the 1990 Leeds Competition. He gave his
London debut recital on Tuesday: late Haydn, late Beethoven and late Brahms
with a couple of wilful novelties, his new Russian wife's 'Sonata' and
Helmut Lachenmann's early Variations on Schubert.
We have been hearing much more of Pizarro, and that has confirmed the
prizewinning impression he made at Leeds. Smooth mastery of the keyboard, a
'big' style of precocious maturity, a thoroughly respectful attitude to
historical norms of interpretation; but Vogt is more promisingly immature,
still ready to follow his own inquiring imagination against established
readings. That is no kind of prediction  - Pizarro may grow steadily toward
an individual authority, or Vogt become merely quirky. At the moment,
however, Vogt strikes continual sparks by unfettered alertness to his music,
with his own considerable technical finesse.
The Lachenmann set (pretty inconsequent stuff, presumably chosen on some
sentimental ground) at least afforded him room to play with witty digital
nuances. In Haydn's C major Sonata, Hob. XVI/50, he was full of eager,
astringent ideas: there were bright insights every few bars, without
prejudice to the poise of the whole work. Vogt made a miscalculation in the
op. 119 pieces of Brahms that Pizarro would not have - here and there he
essayed an innerlich pianissimo that simply failed to carry beyond the front
rows; but by the end every piece had left a vivid, slightly spectral
impression.
Tatiana Komarova's 'Sonata' (eight minutes, one movement) proved to be a
coherent fantasy in Skryabin's later 'sonata'-mould: spidery and
crystalline, evoking the sound-world of Ravel's 'Jeux d'eau' and even of
Bartok's 'Night Music'. It served nicely as a prelude to Beethoven's Sonata
op. 111.
Vogt made no pretence of wheeling out grave profundities, such as depend no
less upon a venerable performer's gravitas than upon the actual playing.
Instead, he laid bare Beethoven's argument in transparent terms, with only
as much audible muscle as it requires. Throughout the clipped drama of the
first movement and the steady unfolding of the Arietta variations, his taut
tempi and his unfailing tenderness with detail gripped one's attention. It
wasn't the grand, revelatory op. 111 of some people's ideals; but it was
visionary in its own way, and all of it had the ring of fresh discovery. If
it takes Vogt some years more to reach a settled professionalism, so much
the better for his lucky audiences.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Management: Refining the strategy - The impact of BP's
cultural revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broadcasting one's ambitions can be dangerous. Any organisation which issues
a public proclamation that it intends to become 'the world's most successful
company' in its industry may well succeed in its goal of lifting the
ambitions and performance of its staff. But it is also asking to be derided
at the first sign of strategic problems.
So is a chairman who, to achieve that vision, launches a cultural revolution
based on values such as 'openness, care, teamwork, empowerment and trust',
yet who is then forced by the strategic problems to tell his managers to
prune their ranks sharply.
His change process risks breeding widespread insecurity and falling into
disrepute.
Nor does it help if that chairman is then quoted as wishing that he could
use his 'good brain' to deal with some of BP's problems himself, rather than
waiting until his subordinates cope with them.
This, on the face of it, may seem the fix into which the usually rumbustious
and supremely self-assured Robert Horton has got himself at British
Petroleum over the past few weeks. He has been pilloried for it by UK
investors and much of the media.
In that time it has become clear that BP is experiencing an unexpectedly
sharp profits slump, that it is planning many more job cuts than most
outsiders thought, that it may have over-estimated the level which the
all-important oil price is likely to reach in the mid-1990s, and that it is
preparing one of its four business sectors for possible sale.
Last week BP revealed miserable profits for 1991, announced a disappointing
dividend payout, and gave a gloomy forecast for the near future.
The apparent humbling of Horton has attracted widespread attention well
beyond investment circles and the oil industry, because the progress of BP's
ambitious culture change programme is being followed avidly by western
companies and consultancies.
The question is whether Horton actually does risk being humbled over
strategy, and whether BP's culture change therefore really is endangered.
The answer on the first count has been debated extensively in the media. The
most that can be said is that the jury is out.
But does this mean, as some commentators have suggested, that the two
year-old culture change programme, originally called Project 1990 but now
expected to run well beyond 1995, could be at risk?
Far from it, would be the reply of many BP managers. Not necessarily, is a
more balanced answer.
To most insiders, other than those disaffected by the fear of redundancy, it
is the very success of the culture change programme so far which is enabling
BP to be able to react effectively to the deterioration in its
circumstances.
Up to now the myriad of workshops, communications and training programmes,
and new 'human resource' initiatives across the company, are thought to have
cost it considerably more than Pounds 20m.
The initial payback appears to have come in two main forms. The first is a
rapid shift last year in the 'ownership' of change, from top management to
employees at all levels.
Not only has the approach of each business varied, but a number of
initiatives within each business has welled up from below, rather than being
imposed from above.
This has helped produce the second payback from the change process: a
growing pile of 'war stories' from all sorts of levels and parts of the
group about how the new values and ways of working are boosting employee
motivation, breaking down departmental barriers, cutting costs, and boosting
revenues.
None of it is conclusive about the change programme as a whole, but it
suggests pretty good progress.
One of the most influential and indicative developments has been the
introduction throughout BP Exploration of 'upward feedback' - the appraisal
of managers by their subordinates. This is now spreading to other parts of
BP.
Most telling of all in current circumstances is the way that many people are
handling the need to rethink their own departments' activities, and if
necessary to trim or cease them. In the past, the company would have ground
almost to a halt for months, while top management wielded an axe in all
directions.
Now teams all over the organisation - from head office outwards - are
reassessing in a participative manner whether all their activities are
necessary, how far they really add value, and what that means for staffing
levels.
With one or two damaging exceptions, 'decisions are being made by those
directly involved,' says another insider. 'That should create far better
decisions than top management used to make, when it simply shared the misery
around, and handed out brown envelopes'.
Outsiders seem to have forgotten that Project 1990's primary purpose was not
to make BP a warm and friendly place to work, as the list of new 'values'
might seem to suggest, but to reduce overheads, committees and other layers
of management - to 'cut the cost of complexity', as BP explained it at the
time.
As one management consultant says: 'It's an illusion to think you can embark
on a change in culture, creating a flatter, faster, less hierarchical
organisation, without shedding jobs'.
Project 1990 meant that the entire BP organisation was in for several years
of frequent staff reductions. The cut of 1,150 jobs two years ago at head
office, and the much larger number that went in the exploration business,
were only just the beginning, both for HQ and the businesses.
Considerable upward pressure on Horton to cut the corporate centre for a
second time was evident at a top management meeting in March 1991, just 12
months after the original streamlining was announced. Several business heads
argued then that the centre still needed to demonstrate that, at its current
size, it really was adding value.
All this was before the prolonged recession and BP's latest profits slide
created pressure for still more cuts - and fast. An additional factor is the
group's growing keenness to subcontract as many services as possible. Much
of its information technology needs have been 'outsourced' since Project
1990 was launched, and exploration last autumn set a possible example to the
corporate centre and the rest of the group by subcontracting most of its
accountancy work.
The results of the corporate centre's current deliberations will be decided
by April.
Though further slimming was part of the new culture, it would be facile to
suggest that job fears are having no effect whatever on the readiness of
some people to be open with team colleagues, and to trust the company.
At a top management review of culture change progress last December, the
heads of the businesses agreed that 'as we remove complexity in our
organisations and reap the benefits of Project 1990, job security becomes an
increasing concern'.
In line with the advice given to many companies by management thinkers such
as Charles Handy, BP's top managers concluded that the group's traditional
implicit 'jobs for life' contract with its staff should be replaced by a new
employment strategy.
A main plank of this will involve employees more in the development of their
own careers, with 'personal development plans' agreed with each individual.
These "PDPs" are being introduced across each of the businesses and in head
office. They are intended to be exactly what the name implies, and are
starting to be accompanied by a substantial increase in training and
development for staff at all levels.
But not surprisingly, given the current climate, they have been
re-christened 'personal departure plans' by quite a number of managers - not
just by those who are disaffected, but by many people who have jumped at the
opportunity to take the quite attractive packages on offer for voluntary
redundancy and early retirement.
All the same, the PDP process could be damaged irrevocably if it became
associated only with departure. Hence the priority which each of the
businesses, together with the corporate centre, are now giving to the
agreement of plans with each employee.
On staff development, as in so many other aspects of the group's culture
change programme, it is vital that BP's top management is seen to put its
money where its mouth is - to 'walk as it talks'.
In this, as in the way the company's current 'downsizing' is handled, Horton
has been told by his senior advisers that, in the words of one of them, Roy
Williams, 'it's now that the rubber really hits the road - the next 18
months will determine the success or otherwise of our culture change'.
As Williams says: 'We're going to have to work hard at it to make it stick'.
This applies to every level of management, but especially to the top.
Paradoxically, Horton's newly-evident fallibility could work to everyone's
advantage - provided that he can temper his all-knowing air.
Otherwise sceptics will continue to argue that the many practical steps he
has taken to empower people are being undermined by the tendency of his own
instinctive management style to surge to the surface. That could damage the
change process far more than any number of job cuts.

FT  21 FEB 92 / The Property Market: Landlords' common front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the few areas of agreement between the Labour and Conservative
parties in the UK in the run-up to the general election concerns legislation
that will significantly curb the rights of landlords.
Whichever party wins power, residential leaseholders can expect legislation
to be introduced giving them the right to buy the freehold of their property
under a new form of tenure called commonhold. Labour, which unveiled its
proposals this week, will also allow leaseholders to extend their leases.
This proposal may also be adopted by the Tory party if it is re-elected.
In some respects, the parties' agreement is hardly surprising. The
legislation would affect some 250,000 flat leaseholders, many of whom feel
they pay too much in service charges, wait too long for repairs and
encounter difficulties in selling their properties because building
societies are unwilling to lend money on short leases.
Moreover, the concentration of dissatisfied flat-owners in marginal
constituencies in London such as Hampstead, Dulwich and Wandsworth has
probably concentrated politicians' minds even more sharply on reform.
Whatever the politicians' motives, the proposed reforms do not fit entirely
easily with their respective political philosophies. For Labour, it means
giving an unusually high priority to the the concerns of middle-class
home-owners, although Mr Clive Soley, Labour's shadow housing minister, says
any legislation would also affect 'coal board houses sold to Mickey Mouse
companies'.
For the Tory party, the proposed reforms overturn their traditional respect
for the right of landowners. Not surprisingly, the great landlords, who
still own large belts of property in London, are up in arms.
'It is confiscation,' says Mr Jeremy Newsum, chief executive of Grosvenor
Estate Holdings, which owns huge chunks of Mayfair and Belgravia. 'It means
the break-up of the Grosvenor Estate which has been held intact for 300
years. We created it and looked after it. There doesn't seem any purpose in
breaking it up.'
Mr Newsum believes that the government is wrong. 'We believe that contracts
freely entered into should not be torn up.'
The proposals are something of a sea change for the Tory party. When Mr John
Patten, the housing minister at the time, guided the Landlord and Tenant (No
2) bill through the House of Commons in 1987, he defended the rights of
landlords against proposals such as the right to extend leases. 'I would
have to be moved a long way to be persuaded that we should break the
principle of the reasonable agreement reached freely, with no coercion,
between a good landlord and a good tenant,' he said at the time.
'Anyone buying a lease should not be under any illusion about the nature of
the interest which she or he is purchasing,' he added.
But Tories now argue, with reason, that many distressed leaseholders did not
freely enter into a legal agreement with their freeholder. Some of the least
reputable landowners buy freeholds of properties on which leases are due to
expire.
Conservatives also argue that landlords will receive adequate compensation
for their freeholds, because they will receive the market value of the
property. Labour says that agreement will have to be reached between
leaseholder and freeholder, with recourse to an arbitration panel if
necessary. But even the Tory pledges do not not satisfy institutions such as
the Grosvenor Estate. The estate argues that the occupier will get a
windfall gain because the 'marriage value' obtained by merging the freehold
and leasehold will be split between the landlord and occupier.
Landlords are unlikely to win much sympathy from the public concerning
arcane arguments about 'marriage value'. But their complaints about the
effect of the proposed legislation on the property rental market might
receive more attention. 'If the government gets its way, there will be
nobody buying residential investments,' says Mr Stuart Corbyn of Cadogan
Estates. 'Housing legislation since the second world war has been impossible
for private landholders,' adds Mr Newsum.
Landlords fear that future legislation will make life even more difficult.
They say the proposed legislation may remove many of the restrictions in the
1967 Leasehold Reform Act. (This act, which the Duke of Westminster, head of
the Grosvenor Estate, fought unsuccessfully in the European Court, gave
leaseholders the right to buy their freehold if they occupied houses with a
relatively modest rateable value.)
A future government, landowners say, is also likely to remove some of the
other restrictions on leaseholders' rights to buy their freehold, such as
those concerning buildings with more than 10 per cent commercial occupancy.
Mr Newsum treats the government's commitment not to extend commonhold to the
commercial sector with scepticism.
Landlords also think it is just a matter of time before commonhold is
extended to leases below 21 years. Mr Dudley Fishburn, the Conservative MP
who has vigorously campaigned for commonhold, says that the right to buy a
freehold should not be extended to leases of less than 21 years. However,
Labour said it would consider stopping short leases being granted to evade
the legislation on the right to buy.
But campaigners for commonhold in the Tory party think new legislation will
have the opposite effect on the rental sector to that feared by the large
landlords. They say that once people are able to buy freehold flats, there
will be more property available for rent.
It is perhaps easy to over-emphasise the case made by the central London
landowners. Although the Bedford, Cadogan, Grosvenor, Howard de Walden and
Portman estates are generally well run and have an important place in
London's architectural history, they are greatly outnumbered by other, less
scrupulous freeholders.
But it is not just the landowners which have inveighed against the new
proposals. Many experts reckon that commonhold will bring a clutch of
unforeseen problems.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a professional body, says it
is 'totally opposed' to the commonhold proposals, partly because it would
not work well in practice. The RICS said that many leaseholders were happy
with their leases and should not be forced to change to a commonhold tenure
simply because other flat-owners in the same block want to do it. It also
thought that disagreements between commonholders will probably be difficult
to resolve, whereas in a leasehold system, clear responsibility rests with
the freeholder or The Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers,
another professional group, also said that the government's proposals were
'seriously flawed'. It said the proposed changes would not solve any of the
existing problems and would seriously jeopardise the position of the
minority who do not vote for enfranchisement.
Even if the new legislation helps many more people than it damages, these
criticisms suggest that it will be no panacea. Most legal changes to land
tenure since the second world war have had unintended and unwelcome effects.
Commonhold is unlikely to be an exception.

FT  21 FEB 92 / The Property Market: Unpaid rent recovery law may change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another legal change proposed by the Labour party this week will be cheered
by thousands of tenants but abhorred by many landlords in both the
commercial and residential sector.
Labour plans to repeal legislation that allows landlords to recover unpaid
rent from former tenants. The topic was addressed by the Law Commission in
1988 and the Lord Chancellor's department says it is looking closely at the
matter.
Labour says the current legislation is a anomaly that should have been
reformed years ago. 'It is a sixteenth century law. Its repeal should
receive widespread support,' says Labour's Ms Andrea Rushton.
The property industry is less convinced. 'If you accept a good covenant and
the lease is assigned to somebody who fails on you, it is equitable that you
can go back to the original tenant,' says Mr John Parry of Hammerson. Any
change would be 'most unfortunate', he adds.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors believes that existing
contracts should not be tampered with. Surveyors think that a change in the
law would diminish one of the attractions of UK property and could lead to
landlords restricting the rights of assignment in future leases.
On balance, however, RICS thinks there is a case for changing the law on new
leases. 'It is unfair to have a responsibility in year 20 for a lease you
assigned in year one,' says Mr Colin Vaughan of the institution's commercial
property and financial services committee. The many companies that are
facing crippling demands for rent arrears on properties they used to occupy
will agree.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Price claims plea is rejected -
Retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday rejected proposals by an advisory committee for
stricter curbs on shops which make misleading price claims and bogus special
offers.
It also said it wanted to limit the scope of proposed European Community
legislation against unfair contracts.
The government's decisions, spelled out in a speech by Mr Edward Leigh, the
consumer affairs minister, were criticised by the Retail Consortium, the
retail industry trade association, the government-backed National Consumer
Council and the Institute of Trading Standards Administration.
The committee set up by the Department of Trade and Industry to monitor the
largely voluntary scheme to prevent misleading price claims concluded that
it was being evaded. The committee recommended that the scheme be backed by
legally enforceable regulations.
Mr Leigh said that the government was not convinced that more detailed
regulations would be effective, although it was prepared to consider new
rules for the sale of tickets for entertainment and sporting events.
Mr Leigh said the government wanted EC efforts to protect consumers against
unfair contracts to be restricted primarily to transactions involving
monopolies and near-monopolies.
He also announced the publication of a discussion document setting out the
government's previously announced proposals to strengthen legislation on
consumer guarantees.

loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH COURT yesterday refused to close the loophole holding up poll tax
prosecutions, ruling that liability orders based on computer print-outs were
illegal.
Declaring computer evidence 'hearsay', the court upheld an earlier ruling by
magistrates in Coventry. The ruling could affect thousands of pending
debt-collection cases.
The bill introducing the council tax, currently before the Lords, will make
such evidence admissible for the future, but councils are unlikely to
proceed with liability orders affected by the ruling until the bill becomes
law early next month.
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said the bill had been
amended 'precisely to make clear that in future computer evidence will not
be regarded as hearsay'.
The Conservative-led Association of District Councils said the ruling was a
'disastrous setback to collection', which could jeopardise all liability
orders issued in the past three months.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Cumbrian opencast mining to end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is to phase out its opencast mining in Cumbria because of the
highly competitive nature and uncertain future of its markets, the
corporation announced yesterday.
The decision, which will cause 300 direct job losses over the next five
years, underlines the difficulties British Coal faces in competing against
new gas-fired power stations and cheap imported coal.
Opencast coal mining has until now been seen as a highly profitable activity
which has helped buoy up the corporation's overall financial performance.
Last year its opencast operations made a Pounds 160m profit on a Pounds 700m
turnover. Cumbria is the first coalfield where British Coal has said it
intends to cease opencasting.
Since the closure in the mid 1980s of Haig Colliery, Cumbria's last deep
coal mine, British Coal has extracted about 1m tonnes of opencast coal
annually from west Cumbria. It announced yesterday that it is to go ahead
with a large new opencast contract at Broughton Lodge, near Workington, but
is suspending all future site development work.
Its Cumbria offices near Workington, employing about 12 management and
supervisory staff, are to close. Most of the staff will be offered immediate
voluntary redundancy, with the remainder moving to a cabin office on the new
opencast site.
Broughton Lodge will mean the corporation will have three working sites in
Cumbria. British Coal Opencast directly employs 300 people in west Cumbria;
its sites also support about 300 sub-contract and haulage jobs. A
corporation spokesman said about 70 direct jobs a year would go from 1993.
Geological conditions and transport costs had led to the conclusion that
Cumbria was marginal in terms of viability. 'By 1997 the Cumbrian coalfield
will have come to a halt unless the price of coal rockets,' he said.

A PAINTING by Arthur Elsley depicting a little girl saying goodnight to her
pet dogs sold for Dollars 176,000 (Pounds 100,000) at Christie's in New York
on Wednesday. The sentimental picture, which doubled its high estimate, set
a record price for the late Victorian artist.
The auction of 19th century European paintings totalled Dollars 2.9m, with
22 per cent unsold. 'Retour des Champs', a young girl carrying foliage by
William Bouguereau, sold for Dollars 198,000 and 'The Golf Links, North
Berwick' by Sir John Lavery did well at Dollars 121,000.
Christie's in London yesterday disposed of 19th century decorative art. A
cabinet, made in ivory in the shape of a Gothic castle and created to
display the artist's virtuosity, sold for Pounds 19,250. 'Teucer', a Homeric
archer, cast by Hamo Thorneycroft around 1903, fetched the same sum.
Anthony Thompson, the former head of Christie's rugs and carpets department
who has set up on his own to compete with the large auction houses, brought
in Pounds 104,500 from his second textiles auction in London yesterday. The
top price was the Pounds 9,350 paid for an Aubusson tapestry of the 19th
century. A Crewel work panel, produced in England in the early 18th century,
sold for Pounds 3,960.
A painting by Cezanne, 'The Stove in the Studio', has been allocated to the
National Gallery under the acceptance-in-lieu procedures. In negotiations
between Christie's and the Museums and Galleries Commission, the estate of
the late Mrs Helen G. Chester Beatty has been relieved of a tax liability of
Pounds 750,000.
Phillips yesterday raised Pounds 124,888 from the stamp collection of Mr
Nissim Capon, who died last year aged 103. The top price was the Pounds
13,200 paid for a mint stock of stamps from Bosnia and Herzegovina, issued
just before the First World War.
After the creation of Yugoslavia in 1919 the new government bought back the
stamps from Cappon and over-printed them. He subsequently acquired them
again. Their appearance at auction could scarcely be more timely.

MR DEREK HATTON, former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, and six
others have been sent to crown court on charges of conspiracy to defraud the
council.
The case against Mr Hatton and his co-defendants was switched from Liverpool
City Magistrates Court to Mold Crown Court in north Wales.
Papers have been served on lawyers for the seven by the Crown Prosecution
Service for a transfer under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1987.
This process, used only in serious fraud trials, allows a case to be
transferred to the higher court without a formal committal hearing before
magistrates.
No date has yet been fixed for the first appearance at Mold.
Mr Hatton, of Childwall, Liverpool, faces eight charges of conspiracy to
defraud the council relating to periods during and after his time in office.
Two other former Labour councillors have been charged with conspiracy. Ms
Hannah Folan, of Liverpool, faces four counts and Mr John Nelson, of
Liverpool, faces five.
Mr Hatton's tailor, Mr John Monk, of Liverpool, faces two conspiracy counts,
and builder Mr Roy Stewart, of Woolton, Liverpool, faces one charge.
Businessmen Mr James Mutch, of Aughton, Lancashire, and Mr Michael Hanlon,
of Blundellsands, Crosby, Merseyside, face three conspiracy charges each.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Roof work safety to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEALTH and Safety Executive yesterday announced a national inspection
blitz on the roofing industry. The industry accounts for one in five
construction deaths.
Sir John Cullen, chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, the
executive's ruling body, said: 'Roof work is big business and attracts more
than its fair share of the 'get-rich-quick' brigade.'
He said 109 roof workers had died and 1,500 had been seriously injured in
the past three years. Many accidents could have been prevented by simple
safety precautions.
The HSE estimates there are more than 7,000 roofing contractors employing
about 30,000 workers. It expects its 800 inspectors to see more than 1,000
sites. No extra resources will be made available to its inspectorate.
The inspectors will start their campaign in May. Companies in breach of
regulations will be forced to stop work until they comply. Flagrant and
serious breaches of the law will result in prosecution.
Mr Paul Davies, head of HSE's Construction National Industry Group, said
almost three quarters of roof workers were with companies employing three
people or fewer.
The executive said the cost of safety equipment for a typical domestic
roofing job was about Pounds 400.
Unions are sceptical of the campaign because of the lack of extra resources.
They said it would divert resources from the HSE's normal work, jeopardising
workers in other industries, or fail to deliver improved standards in roof
safety.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress is set to pass a new energy bill this spring, after the
Senate reached agreement on compromise legislation to stiffen energy
efficiency standards, curb offshore drilling and promote natural gas use.
Environmentalists and energy industry advocates have been locked for months
in a stalemate that prevented the bill's sponsor, Senator Bennett Johnston
from the oil-producing state of Louisiana, from bringing it to the Senate
floor.
But in a compromise, environmentalists agreed to drop their demand that car
makers must raise fuel efficiency on the vehicles they sell, in exchange for
abandonment of efforts to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
Alaska for oil and gas drilling.
The bill passed by 94-4 in the Senate, backed by Mr James Watkins, energy
secretary, who said it was a 'substantial milestone' containing 'nothing we
can't live with.'
Similar legislation is expected to be moved by the House of Representatives
energy committee in the next few weeks, paving the way for a bill to be
enacted this year.
The Senate bill would:
Impose new energy efficiency standards on most commercial and residential
lamps and electric motors, saving an estimated Dollars 25bn in energy costs
over the next 20 years.
Promote alternative motor fuels by requiring private and public fleet
operators to buy vehicles powered by electricity, solar cells, ethanol or
natural gas. By the year 2000, 90 per cent of non-military federal vehicles
will have to run on these fuels.
Maintain the current ban on oil and gas drilling on the US Atlantic and
Pacific coasts.
Ease licensing rules for natural gas pipelines, making it easier for gas
producers to reach new markets.
Allow independent electricity generators to compete in the wholesale
electricity market.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Terror of taxmen strikes Argentina
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THEY are called the 'untouchables'. They attack unpredictably, hunting in
packs. Argentina's tax inspectors are striking terror into the hearts of
businesses great and small.
The 'untouchables' have been busy for over a year, in a tough campaign
against tax evasion. But they only really entered the limelight when
inflation in January lurched out of control, leaping to 3 per cent from 0.6
per cent in December. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, blamed the
retail and service sectors and unleashed the 'untouchables' in the hope of
halting index-linking, which he saw as mortal threat to his anti-inflation
policies.
Since then, there has been no stopping them. In Buenos Aires, they are
closing down over 10 businesses a day, taping bright red seals across the
doors of alleged tax evaders. The increasing risk of detection and the
considerable costs - offenders face one to three days' closure and heavy
fines - has prompted companies to come clean in unprecedented numbers. Above
all, the seals are blatant warning of the costs of raising prices.
The tax department was once a standing joke. Inspectors were notoriously
inept. Tax dodging reached such extraordinary proportions that the World
Bank reported that in 1988 corporate and individual income taxes accounted
for just 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
When Mr Cavallo took office in January 1991, he saw tax evasion as one of
the root causes of Argentina's economic malaise. He claims to have run a
Dollars 200m (Pounds 114.2m) budget surplus in 1991, and plans to raise
current revenues by 20 per cent to a forecast Dollars 35bn in 1992.

A COMBINATION of recession and robust export growth led to a sharp narrowing
of the US trade deficit last year, the Commerce Department reported
yesterday.
The merchandise trade deficit fell to Dollars 66.2bn (Pounds 37.8bn)
compared with Dollars 101.7bn in 1990, ending a seven-year string of Dollars
100bn-plus deficits.
Figures for December, however, showed a widening of the monthly deficit to
Dollars 5.9bn against Dollars 4.2bn in November. The deterioration,
concentrated mainly in capital goods, reflected a Dollars 1bn rise in
imports to Dollars 42.1bn and a Dollars 0.8bn fall in exports to Dollars
36.1bn.
The improvement in the deficit last year reflected a 7 per cent increase in
exports and a 1.5 per cent decline in imports.
Exports of manufactured goods rose 9.3 per cent, indicating that US industry
is more competitive in world markets.
US trade performance improved against most regions: the US surplus with
western Europe, for example, rose to Dollars 16.1bn compared with Dollars
4.0bn in 1990.
The bilateral deficit with Japan, however, widened from Dollars 41.1bn to
Dollars 43.4bn.
Many analysts expect a fresh deterioration of the overall trade deficit this
year.
Imports are expected to rise sharply if the domestic economy recovers from
recession. Weaker demand in overseas markets may curb export growth.
Nearly four in 10 Americans believe their personal finances have worsened
under the Bush administration, Money magazine said in a poll released
yesterday, AP reports from New York.
The poll also found that one in five Americans, when surveyed last year,
believed the country was in the beginning of a depression.
Money further found that 30 per cent of all consumers will continue to spend
less money after the downturn ends.

FT  21 FEB 92 / US rethinks arms procurement philosophy: The challenge to
stay supreme in defence technology as budgets shrink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Soviet threat has for decades been both gauge and goad for the
development of US military technology; its virtual disappearance is now
forcing changes not just in the size of the defence budget, but in the way
that money is spent.
'We are faced now with a different world situation in which we are no longer
being chased by the Soviets or the Russians in the development of new
technology,' says Mr Donald Atwood, deputy secretary of defence.
Some weapons systems specifically targeted at the Soviet threat, such as the
Seawolf submarine or the B2 stealth bomber, are being ended or cut. But it
is the whole philosophy of procurement which is changing; no longer can the
Pentagon rush new systems into production as soon as they are developed,
regardless of cost or operational problems.
'We have weapons which have proved themselves to be the finest in the world,
and we don't have to get into production on new ones just because we are
chasing someone or they are chasing us,' Mr Atwood says.
But with a shrinking budget forcing severe cuts in procurement programmes
over the medium term, how is the US to ensure that it has the technological
and industrial capacity to regain the upper hand if some future threat
emerges?
The Pentagon's 'new approach to defence acquisition' involves a much more
rigorous approach to the decision on when to move a weapon system from the
development phase into production. Many systems will stay as prototypes
until all their technical problems have been worked out, and a real military
need can be demonstrated. R&amp;D contracts are expected to move to a cost-plus
basis, instead of forcing companies to lose money on development projects in
the hope of making it back on the production run.
'In the past, the method of contracting with the industry has either
encouraged them or they have encouraged themselves to buy in on the research
and development phase, always in the back of their mind thinking they could
get well in production. I think that's a cruel mistake and something we have
to rectify,' says Mr Atwood.
Mr Les Aspin, chairman of the House of Representatives armed services
committee, thinks the Pentagon's new approach is inadequate.
In a recent report on the future of the defence industrial base, Mr Aspin
ridicules the Pentagon's assumption that companies will be able to convert
from military to commercial production and then back again as 'a kind of
industrial triple somersault'.
Mr Aspin's committee has in the last few years been particularly critical of
Mr Cheney's policy of shutting down the production line for existing weapons
and shifting funds to the development of new tanks and aircraft still in
gestation, and has repeatedly written these programmes back into the
Pentagon budget.
This has provided fertile ground for Mr Cheney to complain of a spendthrift
Congress forcing him to buy equipment he does not need. In many cases,
Congress's insistence is motivated largely by the desire to maintain
production in an influential member's district.
While this is certainly fair criticism when it comes to buying more Meals
Ready to Eat (the army's ration packs) when the Pentagon is still trying to
give away surplus stocks to Russia, Mr Aspin makes a more serious case when
it comes to major systems such as the M1 tank and the F15 fighter.
Mr Cheney and Mr Atwood argue that the 8,000 M1 tanks in inventory have
proved their superiority in Desert Storm; the army has no need of more or
better tanks.
Mr Aspin retorts that many elements of tank technology, especially armour,
are uniquely defence-oriented: upgrading the armour and electronics of the
M1 will maintain a 'warm' continuous production capacity.
He cites an army estimate that mothballing tank production facilities would
cost Dollars 758m over six years, and it would still take 51 months from
start-up, and another Dollars 750m, to get the first tank off the line.
Senior administration officials, however, say it would only take around a
year to get tank production started again so long - and the condition is
important - as the Pentagon preserves critical manufacturing capability for
components such as armour and engines. Some industrialists, however, believe
Mr Aspin's solution of 'warm' manufacturing rates combine inefficient
production and high cost with only minimal reduction in the lead time needed
to get the production line back up to speed.
'The conclusion I reluctantly draw is that maintaining a warm base for most
items is simply far too costly to contemplate under the type of defence
budgets being proposed for fiscal year 1993,' says Mr Norman Augustine,
chairman of Martin Marietta.
Mr Aspin goes further and advocates low volume procurement - regardless of
whether the equipment is actually needed - to keep suppliers in certain
critical areas, such as nuclear-powered vessels, alive.
Rebuilding a lost shipyard, Mr Aspin estimates, would cost at least Dollars
1.5bn and take six to seven years.
'If you want to be able to produce subs, if you want to be able to produce
tanks - but there is no direct requirement to do so right now in military
terms - you may need to produce some just to maintain the ability to produce
some. That may be a necessary inefficiency,' comments Mr Gordon Adams,
director of the Defense Budget Project, a Washington research group.
Neither the administration nor Congress, however, wants to grapple with the
question of choosing the survivors.
'He who gets the contract will survive. He who does not, will not,' says Mr
Aspin. But this kind of industrial Darwinism could leave the US dependent on
fragile single suppliers.
The choice becomes particularly difficult at the subcontractor level, but it
may be here that the most critical threat to US technological capacity is
posed. 'The problem with defence industrialisation is really at the
subcontractor and vendor level. There's a certain amount of guys where the
commercial world does not have a demand for what they make, and nobody has
the policy to deal with that,' says Mr John Ford, a former staff director of
the House armed services committee.
It is ironic that, before US generals and industrialists have finished
applauding the triumph of free market capitalism over the Soviet system,
they may be forced to back into a form of centralised industrial policy.
BOEING, the aerospace group based in the Pacific north-western US, is this
year to cut about 6,500 jobs in Washington state, or about 6 per cent of its
employees there, because of Pentagon cuts in defence spending and a weaker
market for commercial jets, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The company said the reduction, out of a total employment of 156,500, would
be achieved by redundancies and non-replacement. A company hiring freeze,
which went into effect last October, would continue indefinitely.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Brazil tries to draw foreign investors

<TEXT>
BRAZIL is to alter its privatisation programme rules in an attempt to
attract foreign investors, so far conspicuous by their absence, writes
Christina Lamb from Rio de Janeiro.
Almost all the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 970m) raised through state sell-offs
last year consisted of domestic debt swapped at face value. Only 0.3 per
cent was in the form of foreign debt instruments, which carry a fixed 25 per
cent discount. According to Ms Maria Silvia Bastos Marques, an adviser on
the privatisation programme, it is this discount that has deterred foreign
investors.
'All the foreign banks we speak to complain they are being discriminated
against and as a result there has really been no foreign participation,'
said Ms Marques yesterday.
Under a Brazilian Senate resolution, foreign debt instruments must be
discounted in conversion operations. However, under the new rules to be
introduced by mid-March the value of the discount will be determined by
auction, with a minimum of 5 per cent.
Auctions will be held quarterly for options to convert foreign debt in the
next three month's privatisations.
The National Development Bank (BNDES), which is co-ordinating the programme,
has altered other rules to attract foreign participation.
The two year lock-in period during which foreigners were required to
maintain shares in privatised companies has been abolished and the period
for which the money must remain in the country has been reduced from 12 to
six years.
BNDES officials have been anxious to change these rules before May, when
large companies from the petrochemical sector go on sale. This week an
auction for Goiasfertil, a loss-making fertiliser company, had to be
suspended because there were no buyers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S ruling Congress party yesterday won a majority of seats in the new
Punjab legislature in elections tarnished by a low turnout following threats
and a boycott call by Sikh militants.
The turnout of less than 30 per cent was seen as a victory for
pro-independence Sikh militants who have been responsible for violence in
Punjab since 1983. The militants are expected to intensify their movement
for independence and more violence awaits Punjab under Congress rule.
Observers do not expect the Congress government to stay long in power and
forecast the early reintroduction of direct rule from New Delhi. This is
because the party is in no position to reach a deal with the federal
government that will be acceptable to the militants or the people.
Before the election, Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, had been
discussing a 'Punjab package' for the state but delayed its announcement
until a popular government was elected in the state.
The package involves, among other things, making Chandigarh, the common
capital of Punjab and Haryana, the capital of Punjab alone. The package is
based on an agreement in 1986 between the late Sikh leader, Mr Harchand
Singh Longowal, and the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi, then prime minister. The
agreement proved unworkable then and is likely to meet the same fate again.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Deng tries to relight the torch of economic reform: Why
China's paramount leader appears to be seeking to end three years of
'retrenchment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENG Xiaoping, the 87-year-old who has commanded the heights of
policy-making in China since the late 1970s, once said: 'I will only speak
at significant moments.' If reports from Beijing are to be believed he has
been talking quite a lot lately.
His views on future economic reform, reinforced by a recent tour of south
China, are now said to be circulating within the national bureaucracy after
being read out to an enlarged Communist Party Politburo meeting two weeks
ago by party Secretary-General Jiang Zemin.
It is far from clear whether this latest outburst by Deng will presage fresh
radical change in China. Sceptics point to a similar flurry of pro-reform
reports this time last year. But a number of factors suggest something
significant is afoot.
There is a growing realisation that economic reform, on the backburner
forthree years, needs to be re-started. The party faces its five-yearly
congress later this year and must sort out its policy 'line' for the next
five years and pressure is growing for it to appoint key personnel to carry
that policy forward.
Deng's apparent purpose is to set the agendas for economic reform and
personnel changes. Underlying his analysis is the fear that, without change
the party's grip on power might prove as impermanent as communism's hold in
eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
'To keep stability we must boost the economy,' said Deng as he called for
'new thinking'. He criticised some in the party for droning on and on about
'peaceful evolution' and not getting down to work.
'We have not even reached a state of modest comfort, so there is nothing to
brag about,' Deng is reported as saying. 'One should carry out one's work
modestly - do more work and talk less. We rely on real effort and
experience, not on the churning out of articles.'
But if the reasons for Deng speaking out are plain the options for economic
reform are not. The problems China faces - from state finances, through
agriculture and industry - are as large and diverse as the country itself.
Economic reform has been stalled since the end of 1988 when, in response to
runaway inflation, a widening current account deficit, and widespread
official corruption, the government embarked upon a policy of 'rectification
and retrenchment'. This was a policy designed to cool an overheated economy
and put a break on the past policy of decentralisation of decision making.
At a national level the authorities succeeded in cooling the economy but the
greatest economic strides continued to be made in those regions which
successfully resisted recentralisation, such as southern China and in
particular Guangdong province and its special economic zones of Shenzhen and
Zhuhai.
Towards the end of last year the government said that the policy of
rectification and retrenchment had succeeded. Though this is debatable -
there are signs that inflation is beginning to accelerate again - the stage
now seems set for further reforms.
The problems are daunting: in agriculture the authorities are unable to turn
the clock back to collectivisation. The liberalisation of farming brought
about by leasing land and negotiating output levels, has produced higher
agricultural yields and peasant incomes. China is currently self-sufficient
in grains.
But the array of new incentives has meant that peasants have responded to
the higher gains to be made from meat and poultry production by giving over
cultivatable land to these uses. Yet, as the World Bank has pointed out 5kg
of grain must be sacrificed to produce 1kg of meat.
Peking may be forced to raise official prices for grains if they are to
encourage the peasants to produce more wheat and rice. Either way this will
cause problems in the cities.
The reforms have also spawned industrial growth in rural areas, creating
around 80m new jobs in the past decade.
These industries have been outlets for the entrepreneurial skills of the
Chinese peasant, but some economists believe their level of technological
sophistication is low and their scale of operation uneconomic.
The fact that they can make money from these industries is a poor reflection
of the state sector with which they compete. There is a pressing need to
rethink the operation of China's huge state-owned companies - perhaps the
country's greatest problem.
Today1-2 per cent of all the nation's companies produce 45-50 per cent of
its output - the result of a Stalinist quest for 'giantism' in the 1950s and
1960s.
These companies - which make producer, rather than consumer, goods - also
absorb around 35 per cent of annual capital investment, well above the
target rate of 25% set ten years ago.
Zhu Rongji, the man in charge of sorting out the problem, has made noises
about change. He talks of ending the 'job for life' entitlement of workers
and managers in industry - known to the Chinese as the 'iron rice bowl' -
but the language is still reminiscent of 10 years ago when talk about the
problem surfaced.
Reform in any sector of the Chinese economy is likely to have economic (and
political) consequences elsewhere. This is no more true than in the case of
price reform.
The price of many goods is set less by supply and demand than by political
requirements or outmoded concepts of Marxian economics. The result is a
pervasive irrationality about prices which makes assessing the profitability
and efficiency of companies virtually impossible. Needless to say the state
sector is highly inefficient, often producing goods few really want, and
generally imposing a dead hand on what many believe could be a dynamic
economy.
Half-hearted attempts at radical price reform were made in 1988, only to
fail. If the country is to meet Deng's call for an economy better suited to
satisfying the economic needs of the Chinese people, then the nettle of
price reform will have to be more firmly grasped.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Taiwan's central bank under fire

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan yesterday wrote to the island's
central bank expressing concern about a freeze on the inflow of foreign
funds for investment in equities.
The Central Bank of China has been the target of increasing criticism since
it became known this week it had imposed the freeze for an indefinite
period, apparently to reduce upward pressure on the Taiwan dollar. Bank
officials said it was a temporary measure.
The Taiwanese Finance Ministry has expressed concern at the potential
setback to its programme of financial liberalisation, and is to hold a
number of meetings with the central bank to discuss the apparent conflict of
interest.
Critics say the move, which has not been announced officially, could
seriously damage the island's reputation among international investors.
Local share prices have fallen and securities analysts say the risk of
investing in Taiwan has been heightened.
The central bank has come under strong pressure from exporters hurt by the
rapid appreciation in recent months of the Taiwan dollar. The currency
reached a record high of TDollars 24.9705 to the US dollar last week,
despite five consecutive interest rate cuts in as many months.
Some securities analysts say the bank's move is a gesture to exporters, and
not a serious measure against currency appreciation.
The impact of foreign investment funds on the foreign exchange markets is
likely to have been small. Only Dollars 500m has been remitted into Taiwan
since the bourse was opened to foreign investors in January 1991, compared
with a total stock market capitalisation of over Dollars 100bn.
Mr Peter Kurz, chief representative of Baring Securities in Taipei, said a
more mature foreign exchange market would cushion the Taiwan dollar against
the effects of capital inflow.
Large trade surpluses and the central bank's reluctance to cut interest
rates still further have been mainly responsible for the upward pressure on
the Taiwan dollar.
A difficulty which the central bank has pointed to has been the way in which
remittance applications for foreign funds have tended to be crowded together
just before the deadline for remittance, making them much harder to handle.
The European chamber of commerce, in its letter yesterday, suggested it
could co-operate in trying to alleviate the remittance problem.
Central bank officials say foreign exchange markets will have to stabilise
before any more applications to remit funds into the country can be
accepted.

THE Russian and Ukrainian governments have agreed to take joint
responsibility for nearly ADollars 100m (Pounds 42.9m) owed to Australian
wool exporters by Vnesheconombank, the former Soviet bank for foreign
economic affairs, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney.
Mr James Moore, insurance division manager for the Australian Export Finance
and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), said the governments had pledged to repay
the debt as soon as conditions allowed.
Russia and the Ukraine were the main destinations for wool shipped under a
ADollars 500m revolving 240-day credit facility negotiated in 1990 between
Vnesheconombank and Mr John Kerin, Australia's primary industries minister.
The pact was intended to help keep Soviet woollen mills running and reduce
growing stockpiles of Australian wool.
But no payments have been made because of the uncertainties in the Soviet
financial system following disintegration of the Soviet Union.
Arrears will reach just under ADollars 100m if the next payment is missed.
Mr Moore said EFIC was 'optimistic the people we are dealing with are doing
their best to get this issue settled'.

FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Many textiles quota curbs may linger on -
A not-too-handsome victory for developing countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR developing countries, the scrapping of barriers to world trade in
textiles and clothing, worth Dollars 240bn a year, has been a crucial
objective in the Uruguay Round of global negotiations. They have won their
case, but, contrary to the claims of the US and European textile lobbies, by
no means handsomely.
According to the draft textiles accord, many, perhaps most, quota
restrictions under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) need not be lifted
until the year 2003.
The MFA, established in 1974, was intended to give the textiles industry in
rich countries a breathing space to adjust to low-cost competition
(restrictions on cotton textiles had already been imposed in the early
1960s). The pact governs the bulk of textiles and clothing trade between
rich and poor countries. Nevertheless, textiles employment has halved in the
European Community and Japan since 1973 and fallen by a quarter in the US
and Canada, mainly due to heavy labour-saving investment.
Protection also costs western consumers billions of dollars a year in higher
clothing prices.
In poor countries, protection makes it harder to establish successful
textile and clothing industries, traditionally a first step in industrial
development. In addition, the quota system tends to reinforce the dominance
of established exporters, such as Hong Kong, and allows importers to
dispense favours to particular countries which may not be the most
competitive producers. Thus the Caribbean states have opposed the draft
accord which could ultimately end their preferential quotas in the US
market.
The accord provides for a 10-year phase-out of all existing MFA quota
restrictions, bringing textiles and clothing trade under normal Gatt rules
for the first time. But the deal is heavily 'back-end loaded'.
Before the accord comes into force with the rest of the Uruguay Round
package, planned for January 1993, importing countries must lift quotas on 4
per cent of total imports by volume, followed by an additional 12 per cent
by January 1993, 17 per cent by January 1996, 18 per cent by January 2000
and the remaining quotas by January 2003.
However, importing countries can decide which products to 'integrate' into
the Gatt system from among all textiles and clothing imports, whether
currently restricted or not. According to the International Textiles and
Clothing Bureau (ITCB), which represents 22 developing country exporters,
this could mean no abolition of existing quotas until the year 2000, as
importers first 'liberalise' the one-third or so products not now restrained
under the MFA.
During the transition, annual quota growth rates in effect for 1992 would be
raised by 16 per cent on January 1 1993. From January 1996 they would be 25
per cent higher than now, and from January 2000 27 per cent higher.
For countries with high quota growth rates, mostly medium and small
exporters, this could mean big quota increases for some products. Overall,
the ITCB calculates that quotas will expand on average by 55 per cent over
the 10 years.
In return, importing countries have secured special safeguard arrangements
for products not yet 'integrated' that allow them to impose selective quotas
(even where none now exist) if a surge of imports threatens 'serious damage'
to the domestic industry.
In addition, because the Uruguay Round package is a 'single undertaking',
developing countries will have to sign up to strengthened Gatt rules on
dumping, subsidies, rules of origin and counterfeiting, and their compliance
with these rules will be monitored under the textiles accord.
Finally, all countries including developing nations will have to scrap
non-MFA restrictions on textile and clothing trade which are not
Gatt-sanctioned (eg, for balance of payments reasons, or as part of
preferential trading arrangements).
The accord will apply to all Gatt members, whether MFA signatories or not.
But trade with countries which are not Gatt members, China being by far the
most important (see chart), will continue to be governed by bilateral pacts.
The future of the textiles accord now rests on two unknowns: the outcome of
the tariff negotiations now underway in Geneva, and the renegotiation demand
on the agriculture text by the European Community. In the tariff talks, the
US has been unwilling to lower its high tariffs on textiles and clothing,
while the negotiations overall are being slowed by uncertainty over the
agriculture deal.
The present MFA was extended last year for just 18 months to the end of this
year. If there is no Uruguay Round deal by then, the stage is set for a more
restrictive MFA or a protectionist free-for-all in which developing
countries would certainly be losers. The draft accord may not be what they
hoped for, but it is far better than the alternative.

FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: UK-German group in aero-engine talks with
MTU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW/Rolls-Royce, the joint venture formed two years ago between the German
car maker and the UK aero-engine group, is in talks with Motoren und
Turbinen Union (MTU), the aero-engine subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace, on
possibly collaborating in developing a new engine to power 70-100 seater
regional jets.
Both BMW/Rolls-Royce and MTU confirmed yesterday that the two aero-engine
groups had held preliminary talks about a possible collaboration. But they
stressed no deal was imminent. The talks have been prompted by Bonn's
decision to provide financial support for only one new German-led engine
programme to equip new regional jets, including the proposed 70-100 seater
aircraft Deutsche Aerospace is planning to develop in co-operation with
Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy.
Mr Erich Riedl, secretary of state for aviation at the German Economics
Ministry, has indicated Bonn would support the development of a new engine
programme only if BMW/Rolls-Royce and MTU decided to collaborate on the
project. Bonn is understood to be prepared to provide DM1bn (Pounds 30m) in
support for such a programme.
Rolls-Royce and BMW are developing, through their joint venture, the BR700
engine programme to provide engines with thrusts ranging from 12,000lbs to
22,000lbs for new regional airliners. The joint venture plans to build a
DM400m development and testing facility near Berlin. MTU, which has teamed
up with Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US, is working on a RTF180 engine programme
for regional aircraft.
The preliminary discussions between the BMW/Rolls-Royce venture and MTU
reflect continuing pressures for greater collaboration and consolidation in
the commercial aero-engine industry, currently facing tough market
conditions. The regional aircraft market has been badly hit because of the
financial problems of smaller airlines.
BMW's decision to move back into the aero-engine business through its joint
venture with Rolls-Royce has also worried MTU, which has argued Germany
could not afford to have two rival aero-engine makers.
Although MTU and BMW are involved in a wide range of commercial engine
programmes with Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce, their respective
international partners, they have had their sights firmly on Deutsche
Aerospace's proposed new regional aircraft collaborative programme with
France and Italy.

<TEXT>
THE presidents of Germany's six top economic institutes are urging the
government to back the effort for agreement in the Gatt Uruguay Round, even
if it means more drastic farm reform, Quentin Peel reports from Bonn.
Expressing their 'deep concern' that the talks faced collapse over farm
subsidies, the six spelt out a string of reasons why failure would damage
the German economy.
These include the fragile state of the world economy, the exposure of
Germany more than any other industrialised country to world trade, and the
urgent need for eastern Europe, especially east Germany, to gain access to
world markets.
The appeal amounts to an attempt to swing the debate in the government in
favour of farm reform. 'The government must disregard the particular
interests of agriculture, press for reform of European agricultural policy,
and overcome the resistance of individual EC member states, if it is to face
up to the economic responsibility expected of it throughout the world.'
The institutes include those from Munich, Berlin, Essen, Kiel, Hamburg and
Halle.

FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Balfour Beatty leads study to build
Malaysian airport
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN Anglo-Japanese consortium led by Balfour Beatty, construction arm of the
BICC Group, has won the contract to draw up the masterplan study to build a
Pounds 2bn airport at Sepang, Malaysia, Paul Betts reports.
The consortium also includes GEC Marconi, Trafalgar House Construction and
Marubeni Corporation of Japan. It is expected to complete the study in about
nine months. Winning the Pounds 2m contract has made the consortium strongly
placed to secure the order to build and develop the airport project. BAA,
the UK airport operator, has also been appointed lead consultant for the
study.
The Malaysian government aims to open the new airport, about 50km south of
Kuala Lumpur, in 1997. BICC said yesterday the detailed engineering and
first-stage construction would include two runways, terminals, associated
infrastructure and a high-speed train link. The project is expected to be
financed by a mix of private and public funds.
The masterplan project team will develop proposals for further links to
Kuala Lumpur. The airport project reflects the need to improve and expand
airport infrastructure facilities in the Asian region, which continues to
offer best potential growth in international passenger air traffic. The
International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects north-east Asia to
show average annual growth in international passenger numbers of 9.7 per
cent, and south-east Asia of 9.2 per cent between now and 1995.
GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French power generating equipment supplier, has won a
Pounds 95m contract to build a power plant in Pakistan. The plant, involving
conversion of an existing power station at Multan, north-east Pakistan, will
have total capacity of 600MW, and is due to be commissioned in 1994.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Russians forecast further sharp rise in rouble's value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN government officials predicted yesterday that the rouble could reach
Rbs50 to the dollar by the end of April as the currency continued to show a
sharp rise in value.
This would compare with a level of Rbs110 earlier this month. One Moscow
bank set a rate of Rbs70 to the dollar yesterday.
The rouble is still the official currency of all 15 of the former Soviet
republics despite moves in some CIS states to introduce separate currencies.
Mr Alexei Ulyukayev, the Russian government's senior adviser on the economy,
said this week's currency movements were due to higher demand for roubles
after the freeing of prices, the introduction of export tariffs and the rise
in interest rates. However, foreign bankers in Moscow say the main cause is
a shortage of roubles due to the inability of the printing plants to keep up
with demand.
The Russian central bank, which is creating a hard currency fund by taxing
export earnings to stabilise the rouble, has been selling Dollars 2m-Dollars
3m a week to stop the rouble falling too far. The Russian fund is expected
to remain relatively small because many Russian exporters are keeping their
hard currency abroad.
The government is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund on its
application to join the IMF - expected to be completed in early March - and
on the Russian demand for a stabilisation fund of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn
for the rouble to allow internal convertibility.
Mr Ulyukayev also said that President Boris Yeltsin would shortly sign a
decree penalising companies which charged excessively high prices. A
blacklist would be drawn up from among the 2000 monopoly suppliers - most of
the large enterprises - and those on it would suffer price and profit
controls, the freezing of export licences and wages and the withdrawal of
government subsidies.
The decree is another sign that the government is trimming its economic
reform in response to political and public pressures.
The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan yesterday called for an
immediate ceasefire in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter
reports from Moscow.
After eight hours of talks in Moscow, a joint statement said they had agreed
on 'the need for an immediate ceasefire in the zone of the Karabakh
conflict'.
The ministers also called for roads to be unblocked and communications
restored.

<DATELINE>
   VALLETTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALTESE membership of the European Community will be the key issue when the
260,000 voters go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new parliament.
Mr Eddie Fenech Adami's ruling Nationalist Party, which filed Malta's
application for full membership in 1990, wants negotiations with Brussels to
get under way next year and entry to be sanctioned by 1995. Some 70 per cent
of Malta's trade is done with the EC.
The opposition Labour Party, led by Mr Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici, opposes full
membership in favour of strengthening Malta's existing association agreement
signed in 1970. This grants the island access to Community markets and funds
without limiting Maltese governments in fashioning their own economic and
trading policies.
The race between the two main parties could be close. To increase its meagre
4,000-vote lead over Labour and its single-seat parliamentary majority, Mr
Fenech Adami's Christian Democratic party is counting on the impact of its
liberal policies.
The lifting of import restrictions imposed by previous Socialist
administrations has resulted in shops bulging with imported goods. Each year
10,000 new cars are snapped up by the increasingly affluent Maltese. To keep
the economy buoyant the government has pumped money into infrastructure
projects, including a new airport terminal and a sorely needed new power
generating plant.
The Labour Party claims the government has mismanaged the nation's coffers
by doubling the national debt to Lm200m (Pounds 355m) in the past five
years. To woo voters it has dropped several controversial policies,
including its opposition to private hospitals and free trade, and has
improved relations with the powerful Roman Catholic church.
A new party, Democratic Alternative, which emphasises the environment among
its policies, is appealing to those disgruntled by the established parties
and hoping for a hung parliament. The result is expected early next week.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Moscow seeks help to pay cost of industrial conversion:
Millions of jobs now depend on turning swords into ploughshares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONVERSION of the former Soviet Union's huge defence industry to civilian
output used to be just a slogan until the overthrow of the Soviet system
last year. Now it is a means of survival for thousands of factories whose
military orders have been slashed by a penniless government committed to
market reforms.
A chart in the office of Mr Nikolai Bazhanov, chairman of Russia's
Conversion Committee, lists the various areas of civilian production he
wants defence plants to switch to - ranging from meat processing to business
computer systems.
The problem is that the state cannot afford to turn swords to ploughshares
on its own. That is why his 200-strong committee is also available to match
foreign investors with enterprises seeking to convert. At stake is the
salvation of Russia as an industrial power, and the livelihood of millions
of people employed the sector.
A vague law setting out the legal foundations for conversion - such as
workers' right to unemployment benefits if they are laid off - passed its
first reading in parliament last week. But as Mr Igor Artiukh, one Moscow
defence factory manager put it: 'We don't need a piece of paper, we need
money.' According to Mr Bazhanov, for every rouble or dollar cut from making
missiles or guidance systems, another one and a half needs to be spent on
converting such capacity to make refrigerators or television sets.
While slashing defence procurement to just 13 per cent of last year's level,
the 1992 budget allocates Rbs10bn, or 2 per cent of total spending, to
conversion. According to Mr Bazhanov, this is not enough.
'The problem is the government wants a deficit-free budget,' he complains.
Mr Artiukh, who also heads Moscow's association of industrialists, warns
that 700,000 people out of the 900,000 employed by the defence industry in
the capital alone could lose their jobs unless factories find alternative
sources of financing to switch production.
Prof Alexander Smirnov, from the Rotor group which specialises in missile
navigation systems, says it can just about pay its 3,500 scientists a
minimal salary of Rbs2,000 (Dollars 20) a month but needs work to keep them
busy.
This does not mean that managers like him are not already trying to help
themselves. They argue with conviction that Russia's cheap but skilled
labour force, abundant raw materials, and remarkable technological
capabilities need only to be harnessed to outside capital to save an elite
industrial and scientific base.
Mr Smirnov is discussing with the UK Consumers' Association the possibility
of using existing facilities to set up a testing laboratory for consumer
products. While dreaming of more sophisticated projects, he would also like
to find a foreign partner to develop cash-dispensing machines for the
Russian market.
Apart from offering advanced technologies using microwave energy, Mr
Artiukh's enterprise, Toriy, is looking for a foreign partner to
mass-produce microwave ovens. Mr Artiukh says that while South Korea
produces 12.5m ovens a year, monthly wages there are Dollars 600; he pays
his workers Rbs2,000-Rbs3,000 (Dollars 20-Dollars 30).
The list of obstacles on the path to conversion is also familiar: a
non-convertible currency, monopolistic domestic suppliers, unpredictable
behaviour by the state, not to mention still unfavourable conditions for
investors. Most can and must be rectified by the government, which is
sorting out conditions for foreigners to take part in privatisation
auctions, and other issues such as land ownership.
Other problems will require far-sighted goodwill on the part of the
international community. The US has announced it will spend Dollars 25m for
a job centre for redundant Soviet scientists. But without investment in, and
international co-operation, for real projects to occupy these scientists,
such goodwill will not go very far.

CITING the urgent need to implement economic reforms, Ukrainian President
Leonid Kravchuk yesterday won preliminary parliamentary approval for widely
expanded presidential powers.
The legislation is likely to strengthen Mr Kravchuk's hand in increasingly
bitter disputes with Russia by bringing the historically Russified regions
of eastern Ukraine more firmly under his control.
A slim majority of Ukrainian MPs yesterday endorsed the first reading of a
bill creating a centralised, prefectural administrative system with
presidential representatives in each Ukrainian region. They will be
empowered to enforce presidential and parliamentary decrees on local
governments and enterprises.
'I support the introduction of a presidential system,' said Ms Larysa
Skoryk, a radical nationalist deputy. 'There is no other way of breaking
through the regional Communist party apparat.'
Ms Skoryk's support is another sign of the growing alliance between
nationalist forces and the ex-Communist president. It could be strengthened
further this weekend when Mr Kravchuk meets with opposition parties to
discuss the formation of a national unity cabinet which would be more able
to implement radical economic reform than the current conservative
government.
Such a cabinet would also likely be more firmly committed to asserting
Ukrainian independence in confrontations with Russia over military and
economic issues.
These disputes have troubled western observers. Yesterday, US defence
department officials visited their Ukrainian counterparts to seek guarantees
about the safety of nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory and
about Ukraine's plan to dismantle or remove the weapons by 1992.
The Ukrainian position on repaying the former Soviet debt received a boost
yesterday from Dr Erhard Busek, the Austrian vice-chancellor, who said in
Kiev that Austria was pleased with Ukraine's offer to pay its share of the
foreign debt independently and to take on some of the debt of the smaller
republics. Dr Busek predicted that the Ukrainian position would be accepted
by the Paris Club of creditors.
AP-DJ reported yesterday that the Paris Club will discuss setting a date for
talks with Ukraine when it meets privately next week.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Yugoslavia aid confuses the British
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH Red Cross appeal for eastern Europe, launched at the height of the
civil war in Yugoslavia, had failed because the normally generous British
could not understand why fellow Europeans were unable to resolve their
problems, the aid agency said yesterday.
Mr David Wyatt, director of the agency's international division, said that
despite harrowing television footage, many Britons, having been on holiday
in Yugoslavia and seen how well the people had lived there, believed that
'they're Europeans who should know better'.
Donations for aid projects in the former Soviet Union had also been
relatively low because the enormous scale of the 'structural emergency' left
Britons with the mistaken perception that their contributions would make no
difference.
Public subscriptions to the appeal for the whole of eastern Europe,
described anyway as a 'slow burner', have so far amounted to about Pounds
300,000.
In a review of Red Cross work last year, Mr Michael Whitlam, its director
general, said a series of disasters saw overseas aid up by 235 per cent over
the previous year at almost Pounds 30m. The Red Cross saw no evidence of the
charity being hit by 'compassion fatigue', although it suspected the public
was being more selective in its donations.
The International Red Cross had responded to 30 emergencies in the first six
months of the year, compared to the same number for the whole of the
previous year.

FT  21 FEB 92 / EC tries to keep war out of Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community will today hold talks in Lisbon with representatives
from Bosnia-Hercegovina's three ethnic communities to try to prevent the
Yugoslav republic sliding into civil war.
The meeting, occasioned by sharp differences between Serbs, Croats, and
Moslems over holding a referendum next week on independence, coincides with
fresh attempts by Croatia and Serbia to split the republic between them.
According to government officials in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia which
will act as the United Nations headquarters when peacekeeping forces arrive,
there is every likelihood that the Moslem community will be left without any
republic if the plan by Croatia and Serbia goes ahead.
'This could lead to the emergence of radical forces among the Moslem
community. They could become powerful. This would undermine our tolerant
tradition,' said Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, deputy premier. Bosnia's Moslems,
who are Sunni, make up 42 per cent of the 4.3m population, followed by Serbs
(33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent).
The EC called for this referendum last month as a precondition for
recognising Bosnia. But while Serb leaders have urged a boycott, Moslems
support the vote as a means of having an independent Bosnia internationally
recognised, and Croats remain ambivalent.
The Serb-dominated rump presidency wants Bosnia to remain part of a smaller
Yugoslav federation, mainly because 70 per cent of the military industrial
base is there.
The plan to divide Bosnia was mooted during secret talks a year ago between
Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman and Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic. It was shelved when the federal army intervened in Slovenia and
Croatia on June 25, but has since been revived, under a different guise.
Because the United Nations, and the EC, have insisted that 'the internal
boundaries of Yugoslavia cannot be changed by force, or without the consent
of the parties concerned,' Zagreb and Belgrade have adopted new tactics.
They have encouraged their respective sister parties in Bosnia to agree
peacefully to divide the republic from within. Moderates among Serbs and
Croats have been marginalised.
The rise of the Zagreb-backed Croat nationalists in Bosnia has isolated the
Moslems. Previously, Bosnia's Croats and Moslems together opposed attempts
to split the republic. Now Mr Marte Boban, new head of the Croatian
Democratic Union, is negotiating a carve-up with the Bosnian Serbian
Democratic party, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, a close ally of Mr Milosevic.
Few government officials in Bosnia doubt the inherent dangers in this, even
if Bosnia's Croats and Serbs agree to it. 'What would happen to the
Moslems?' asks Mr Haric Silajcic, Bosnia's foreign minister. 'Should the EC
accept a peaceful break up of the republic carried out without the consent
of the Moslems?'

FT  21 FEB 92 / Ifo says Germany is not in recession: Munich economic
institute believes recovery could start from mid-year
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN economy is not in recession, in spite of three consecutive
quarters of contraction, according to the highly respected Ifo economic
institute in Munich.
The chances are that the economy will avoid the full extent of the downturn
being experienced in other industrialised countries, and start to recover
from the middle of the year, the institute's researchers conclude.
The current downturn amounts to a cyclical weakening, but it looks worse
than it is because it includes a technical correction from the extra
ordinary economic expansion in the first quarter of 1991, according to the
latest assessment by the institute.
However, its cautiously optimistic forecast coincided yesterday with a
renewed stern warning from the German Bundesbank that no relaxation in
monetary policy could be The central bank's governing council yesterday took
no action on interest rates at its fortnightly meeting, but later Mr Otmar
Issing, a full board director, warned businessmen in Duisburg that the 4 per
cent rate of inflation remained 'highly unsatisfactory'.
Every additional burden on public spending which was not matched by a
reduction in state consumption and subsidies 'must endanger the further
economic development and stability in Germany, and exacerbate the task of
monetary policy,' he said.
Ifo says that recession should be defined according to capacity utilisation
in the economy, rather than changes in the rate of economic growth. On that
basis, the high point of the current German cycle was reached in autumn
1990, when industrial capacity utilisation reached 90 per cent.
In spite of a gradual decline since then, the average capacity utilisation
still stood at 86.8 per cent in December, 1991, compared with levels below
80 per cent seen in previous German recessions.
As far as growth of real gross national product is concerned, the first
quarter of 1991 saw an annualised growth of no less than 10 per cent, thanks
to a mild winter and a sudden inflow of foreign capital.
The contraction in the next two quarters was essentially a technical
correction. Only in the last quarter was there a real slowdown, it says.
In Ifo's view recovery depends on the world economy picking up from
mid-year. That should coincide with a recovery in private consumer demand in
west Germany, thanks to higher child allowances and the end of the
'solidarity surcharge' on income tax to pay for unification.
It warns, however, that its own indices of business confidence, business
expectations, and industrial orders all point to a more prolonged slowdown.
'Even if the panic-mongering with the code-word 'recession' is unjustified,
more attention is still needed to be paid to the risks in the Germany
economy,' it concludes.
KRUPP HAS emerged as a clear favourite to take over east Germany's largest
steelmill, EKO, at Eisenhuttenstadt on the Polish border, writes Leslie
Colitt in Berlin.
Mr Hans Kramer, a executive board member of the Treuhand privatisation
agency, said yesterday: 'We give Krupp the advantage,' although he cautioned
that the consortium of Thyssen, Peine-Salzgitter and Hoogovens (Netherlands)
could not be ruled out if there were last minute changes.
The agency's supervisory board will take the final decision on February 27.
The German Finance Ministry will also have to approve the deal along with
the European Commission; both have indicated they will go along with the
conditions of the sale.
Mr Kramer said Krupp planned to invest more than DM1bn (Pounds 300m) to
modernise EKO and add badly-needed rolling mills.
Bids by two Italian steel companies, Ilva and Arvedi, had been eliminated
after the proposals arrived piecemeal and too late, he added.

FT  21 FEB 92 / French far right's advance masks rise on another front: Next
month's regional polls are likely to show a dramatic surge in support for
the ecology parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURGE in voter support in France for the extreme right-wing National
Front is monopolising national attention, sending a frisson of anxiety
through all the mainstream political parties, on the right as well as on the
left.
Because of the ominous overtones of racism and angry xenophobia, it is
overshadow ing the important parallel surge in support for the country's
ecology parties, which may end up in next month's regional elections with a
share of the national vote not far short of that of the NF.
While all eyes seem fixed on the Front - with many surveys suggesting it
will gain between 15 and 20 per cent of the vote nationally - the dramatic
advance of the ecologists has also been shown in a series of regional
opinion polls. In the Paris region of Ile-de-France they should get 15 per
cent compared with 3.4 per cent six years ago; in the Centre region they may
score 17.5 per cent compared with 0.3 per cent; in Basse Normandie 17 per
cent, in Haute Normandie 18 per cent and in Brittany 16 per cent.
In tactical terms, the traditional parties are less worried by the ecology
breakthrough than by the National Front's: the NF faces them with agonising
dilemmas, not least about how to woo the Front's potential voters without
endorsing its prejudices, and, whereas the ecologists seem both innocent and
benign, all parties can profess friendliness towards the environment.
In reality, the political establishment should be twice as exercised,
because the message of the double breakthrough is that the electorate is
deserting its traditional political allegiances on a very large scale.
If one includes the rump Communist party, which is likely to stay stuck in
the 5-10 per cent range, it is entirely possible that the protest parties
will together account for some 40 per cent of the total vote, with the
remaining 60 per cent to be shared by the three mainstream parties.
The second reason the ecologists are not commanding much national attention
is that they are divided into two quarrelling wings: Generation Ecologie
(led by 46-year-old Brice Lalonde, who as the ecology candidate in the 1981
presidential election got 3.85 per cent and is now Environment Minister in
the Socialist government) and the Greens (led by 43-year-old Antoine
Waechter, who as the ecology candidate in the 1988 presidential election did
slightly worse at 3.78 per cent).
The quarrel dates to the formation of the Green party in 1984 and revolves
round the question of the relationship of ecology to the politics of power.
The Greens accuse Mr Lalonde of selling out to the socialists, in particular
for failing to strike a strong enough blow against nuclear power. Generation
Ecologie claims to be a movement (not a party) with the reformist aim of
changing minds, and accuses the Greens of being unrealistically purist. The
Greens claim that Generation Ecologie is an undemocratic machine for the
personal ambitions of Mr Lalonde.
But the central fact is that the split does not seem to have damaged the
ecologists' voter appeal. This started to take off three years ago, in the
1989 European elections, when the Greens scored 10.6 per cent. Next month
the combined ecologists' score could well be 50 per cent higher, probably
split fairly evenly between the two movements.
The unstated agenda behind the rise of the protest parties is the question
of electoral reform. Regional elections, like those to the European
Parliament, are decided on the basis of proportional representation, whereas
those to the National Assembly are decided on a majority vote. The result is
that neither the Front nor the ecologists are represented in Parliament.
President Francois Mitterrand has repeatedly indicated a temptation to
switch the national voting rules to proportional representation before the
general elections scheduled for next year. The ostensible purpose of such a
manoeuvre would be to make Parliament more representative. The real purpose
would be to prevent a tidal victory by the traditional conservative parties
over his Socialists, by letting in other minority parties.
Socialist Party leaders are opposed to PR, even though it might dilute the
scale of their likely defeat this time, because they fear it could also
dilute the scale of their possible recovery in some later election. But if
the regional elections show that 30 per cent of the electorate is
unrepresented in Parliament, the pressures for some degree of national PR
could become irresistible.

The General Confederation of Labour (CGT) called the 24-hour strike in its
printing branch as a warning to publishers in advance of negotiations that
will lead to lay-offs. Only the Quotidien de Paris appeared after using an
out-of-town printing plant.
The union has accepted a proposal by publishers for the early retirement of
about 2,200 printers, but it is opposed to tentative plans to lay off 750
younger printers.
The publishers say drastic cost reductions are necessary to maintain the

FT  21 FEB 92 / Cossiga vetoes asbestos law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE second time in less than a month President Francesco Cossiga has
used his constitutional powers to block legislation already approved by both
houses of the Italian parliament.
First he blocked a law providing new measures to accommodate social work for
those who wish to replace obligatory military call-up on the grounds of
conscientious objection.
He has followed this up by refusing to sign a law bringing Italy into line
with the European Community on the elimination of asbestos in industry.
In the case of the conscientious objectors law, President Cossiga claimed
the provisions for social work were inadequate.
In the case of the asbestos law he said that there was insufficient
financial cover for the L80bn expenditure over the next three years. But in
both instances the main political parties have reacted as if the President
were deliberately seeking to undermine their authority.
The asbestos law took two years to steer through committee and both houses.
President Cossiga's action has also caused something of a constitutional
stir since parliament dissolved at the beginning of the month prior to the
April 5 general elections.
After much argument, parliament is expected to take the unusual step of
briefly reconvening next week to consider a decree passing the conscientious
objection law, which President Cossiga would be unable to block a second
time round.
The president's objections to the asbestos law appear to be on firmer ground
since even for the current year the proposed financial cover is uncertain.
There is also strong pressure from the asbestos lobby, which employs 2,500
directly and another 25,000 indirectly, for a longer phasing out period.
This may mean the law will have to await the next parliament.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Italian wave of crime boosts security industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACED with a rising wave of theft, Italians are estimated to be spending an
annual L3,500bn (Dollars 2.8bn) on security protection, according to a study
by the research institute, Ispes.
This expenditure comes despite Italy possessing one policeman for every 240
inhabitants, the highest proportion in Europe.
The biggest cost is absorbed by L1500bn spent on the production and
installation of electronic security systems, with a further L500bn going on
safes, strengthened windows, barriers and reinforced doors. Each year an
average of 200,000 reinforced doors are installed.
Private security firms are in growing demand. Italy now has 1,106 registered
security companies supplying some 30,000 full-time guards at a cost of lire
1,400bn per year.
These figures are not surprising given the way robbery from banks and
institutions as well as private households has increased. Between 1975-90
the number of household burglaries has tripled to over 211,000; while the
booty stolen from banks and financial institutions now totals L72bn a year.
In the case of car theft, it is reckoned that some 240,000 cars are stolen a
year against 158,000 in 1983. This staggering figure and the consequent
replacement through insurance perhaps helps explain why Italy continues to
have such high car sales. Italians spend almost L150bn on car anti-theft
devices.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Voices from the grave return to haunt Italy: The fallout
from a letter written in Moscow during Mussolini's eastern front disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN establish--ment has fallen victim to a journalistic scoop turned
sour.
The scoop involved revelations about the late leader of the Italian
Communist party, Palmiro Togliatti, one of the country's few towering
political figures this century.
For two weeks the media and politicians of every colour rushed to judge the
conduct of Togliatti while he was in Moscow during the Second World War -
solely on the basis of a brief letter he purportedly wrote. Now everyone has
got egg on their faces, victims of the timeless practice of the truth never
being allowed to interfere with a good story.
The 1943 letter, it transpires, was taken out of context, was doctored by at
least one newspaper and crucial words were 'interpreted' by an academic
over-anxious to promote his own researches.
The good story lay in the brutally cynical portrait of Togliatti that
emerged when he was discussing the fate of large numbers of Italian
prisoners taken on the Russian front fighting with the Axis powers.
Togliatti appears to be rubbing his hands over the way Mussolini's venture
supporting Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union was coming to a disastrous
end.
Some 60,000 Italians died on the Russian front and in prison camps. In so
many words, he said this would be a good lesson for Italians to learn the
perils of siding with fascism. He reportedly said of his fellow-countrymen:
'I am not arguing that they should be killed, rather we can obtain certain
results in other ways.'
At least this was how the weekly magazine, Panorama, broke the story two
weeks ago, citing the research of Prof Franco Andreucci in Moscow. Prof
Andreucci had just obtained access to the archives of the (Communist
International) Comintern under a contract negotiated by the small Florence
publishers, Ponte alle Grazie, for whom he was historical adviser.
Prof Andreucci confirmed the contents of the letter along with his
publishers at a subsequent press conference. For the doubters, Il Tempo, the
Rome daily, published a copy of the damning extract in what seemed the
unmistakable hand of Togliatti. Coming right at the beginning of the
campaign for parliamentary elections on April 5, the tinder for polemics was
lit. The letter provoked an immediate outcry. President Francesco Cossiga,
ever keen to impose his stamp on a national debate, announced the formation
of a special committee of historians to examine the implications of the
letter to the standing of a national hero. (The committee in fact never got
off the ground because a number of those chosen refused to serve).
The Right weighed in, determined to wring the maximum from this magnificent
opportunity to discredit the Left ahead of elections. Here was the cold face
of Stalinism which had sought to impose communism on post-War Italy, the
Christian Democrat politicians cried.
Insinuations were also directed towards Ms Nilde Iotte, the head of the
Senate who is Togliatti's widow and the candidate of the metamorphosised
Communist party, the PDS, for the presidency of the Republic in the election
in July. Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the PDS, alarmed at the damage to
the image of the Left, declared the contents of the Togliatti letter to be
'chilling' - if true.
Only the enterprising Moscow correspondent of La Stampa, the Turin-based
daily, decided to check in the archives. And by this weekend he had blown
the scoop.
Togliatti had indeed written a letter in 1943 using his pseudonym, Ercoli,
to a colleague on the executive committee of the Comintern; but it was a
very long one. The language of the original was also far more nuanced. In
his controversial discussion of the plight of Italian prisoners on the
Russian front, Togliatti used the infinitive verb sopprimere (to suppress)
not the emotive word assassinare (to kill). It appears Prof Andreucci got
over-excited by the idea of using the letter to promote a future book.
Put in touch with Panorama, he accepted an immediate release and dictated
over the phone a poor photocopy of an extract of the letter, which he
liberally interpreted.
The newspaper Il Tiempo went one better: it acquired the photocopy and
proceeded to write in the contentious parts - changing the word sopprimere
for assassinare, and even converting a poorly legible reference to 'old
Hegel' into 'the divine Hegel'. The latter phrase incidentally was one of
the aspects which alerted those who knew Togliatti to the falsification.
The opening up of the Soviet archives has been accompanied by ample tales of
false documents being touted by former officials. This is the first case
where officials have provided genuine documents and the users have chosen to
falsify them.
Ironically, for all the scandal, the faked letter, when read in the
historical context, did not convey a new insight on Togliatti.
Rather it was typical of a committed communist at the time of the Soviet
Union's crucial battle against Hitler.

</HEADLINE>

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH politicians are tying themselves in knots over whether the country
should join the Western European Union (WEU), which will carry out defence
operations which may be required as a consequence of the European
Community's common foreign and security policy.
The issue is so sensitive that it may have an influence on the outcome of a
referendum on the Maastricht treaties to be held on June 2. Polls in January
indicated a 60-40 majority in favour of signing the treaties although there
was a high number of people undecided. However, by February 17 a business
newspaper opinion poll showed a steep decline in support for European union.
According to the poll, political union was opposed by 36.2 per cent and
supported by 35.5 per cent, with 27.6 per cent undecided.
At present, a majority of the eight parties represented in the Folketing,
including the minority coalition Conservative and Liberal parties, are in
favour of political union, but a majority (not consisting exclusively of the
same parties) are also against membership of the WEU.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, finds the situation
ridiculous. He argues that if one supports political union, including the
common foreign and security policy, then it does not make sense to refuse to
join the WEU, which will be responsible for executing decisions taken under
the auspices of the common foreign policy. The WEU is seen as the forerunner
of a common European defence and military policy. As such it raises hackles
on many Danes who are otherwise sympathetic to European political union.
The opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), which holds 69 out of 179
seats in the Folketing, is the key party on the WEU issue. The SDP is
officially in favour of ratifying the Maastricht treaties, but its
supporters are not. Antipathy to defence co-operation is strong within the
party.
The SDP argues that nothing must be done which can weaken Nato's role in
European defence.
Hence, it is opposed to Denmark joining the WEU, of which all other Nato
members except Norway, Turkey and Greece are members.
The WEU issue has come to a head in the party, however, for reasons which
appear to have little to do with the merits of the issue and more to do with
a clash of personalities between the party's leader, Mr Svend Auken, and a
prominent colleague, Ms Ritt Bjerregaard. In January, Ms Bjerregaard
declared in a television interview that the party was bound to reconsider
the question of WEU membership. Her statement acted like a red rag to a bull
and sent the party leadership into a spasm. Not only is the leadership
against membership: it will not allow the issue to be discussed.
The serious aspect of the situation for those supporting the Maastricht
treaties is that the SDP is so divided under the weak leadership of Mr Auken
that it is unable to give a clear, strong lead to its supporters as the June
2 referendum approaches. It is possible that this could lead to an upset in
the poll and an interesting situation, to say the least, for the the
European Community.

BESIEGED by nationalistic republics and plunging living standards, the Red
Army is redeploying lawyers and sociologists within its ranks to help
soldiers with pressing social problems.
Major-General Nikolai Stolyarov, a former Communist party liberal, said
yesterday his committee for work with military staff had substituted the
professionals for the old communist commissars - the political officers
responsible for everything from ideological rectitude to military welfare.
Although he said it was too early for army chaplains, the general disclosed
that the Pentagon had promised to supply Russian-language bibles, while
scientific atheism courses had been replaced by classes on the history of
religion.
His answers to questions about Ukraine's decision to demand an oath of
allegiance from forces stationed on its territory illustrated the stiff
challenge facing the army's top brass.
On the one hand, Maj-Gen Stolyarov had to recognise the right of sovereign
republics to create their own armies. On the other, he warned of the dangers
of undue haste in breaking up a formidable fighting-machine.
He said he could not condemn the decision by officers from strategic forces
based in the Ukraine - which are supposed to be under joint Commonwealth
command - to swear allegiance to the southern republic.
'What awaits them in Russia? Nothing, there are no apartments for them.'
Nor could he say to which motherland officers now owed their allegiance. 'We
will find a motherland,' he said.

<TEXT>
THE foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan called on Thursday for a
ceasefire in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, where four years of
fighting have claimed more than 1,000 lives, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The ministers said they would recommend a ceasefire to their presidents and
parliaments and urge steps to unblock roads, restore communications and
allow the urgent dispatch of humanitarian aid.
The move came as British officials said that the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) was likely to make its first foray into
international mediation by offering to host talks on the war in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
A CSCE team which returned yesterday from the disputed territory was
expected to urge talks among all interested parties under the auspices of
the CSCE's Czechoslovak presidency.
If yesterday's accord in Moscow leads to a meaningful ceasefire CSCE
intervention may prove unnecessary. Mr Raffi Hovannisyan, foreign minister
of Armenia, and Mr Hussain Sadikhov, his Azeri counterpart, both called the
accord a first small step towards ending what Russian television this week
called the first war of the post-Soviet era.
They were speaking after eight hours of talks chaired by Russian Foreign
Minister Andrei Kozyrev. 'All participants of today's meeting were unanimous
that when there is war, when the guns are roaring, negotiations cannot
succeed,' Mr Sadikhov said.
'Therefore this recommendation was worked out to implement a ceasefire in
the zone of the Azeri-Armenian conflict.
'We do hope that in the near future we will see an end to the conflict, a
ceasefire, a lifting of blockades and respect for human and civil rights,'
Mr Hovannisyan said. The Armenian said he favoured the despatch of UN or
Commonwealth peace-keepers.
Itar-Tass news agency said Russian President Boris Yeltsin was holding
separate talks with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan in the Kremlin.
Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, then Soviet president, sent Soviet interior ministry
troops four years ago to restore order in Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave ruled
by Azerbaijan since 1923 but populated mostly by ethnic Armenians.
The fighting has raged on despite mediation attempts by both Mr Gorbachev
and Mr Yeltsin, worsening sharply after the Soviet troops pulled out late
last year. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, military commander of the new
Commonwealth of Independent States, this week proposed sending troops back
in.

A BOMB exploded at Istanbul's Chamber of Commerce yesterday, killing a woman
and injuring 19 people, Istanbul's security chief said, Reuter reports from
Istanbul.
A statement from Istanbul's governor said four were in a serious condition.
Two Kurdish groups claimed responsibility for the explosion, according to
the semi-official Anatolian news agency.
Unidentified callers to Istanbul newspapers said the separatist Kurdish
Workers Party (PKK) and Kurdistan Revenge Units, a hitherto unheard of arm
of the PKK, were behind the bombing, it said.
PKK has stepped up attacks in cities, including a December 25 fire-bombing
of an Istanbul department store where 12 people died. It had previously
confined its eight-year guerrilla war for an independent state to south-east
Turkey.

The UK's know-how fund for central and eastern Europe is to be used to help
Bulgaria upgrade its tourist industry, writes Michael Skapinker.
It is the first time that the Pounds 50m (Dollars 87.5m) fund, which was set
up in 1989, has been used to support the development of tourism in eastern
Europe. Consultants from the UK will begin work next month, helping Bulgaria
draw up a strategic plan on the future of the industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL offered an amnesty to most illegal immigrants yesterday and
announced new measures to tighten up immigration controls, Reuter reports
from Lisbon.
More than 100,000 foreigners reside legally in Portugal, but up to 100,000
more have entered the country illegally, mostly from Portugal's former
African colonies.
Last year Portugal signed the Schengen agreement, which will eventually
abolish immigration controls between eight member states of the European
Community.
Since then, Portugal has been gradually tightening its slack immigration
controls to prevent it becoming a funnel for illegal entry to the Schengen
states from third countries.
Officials engaged in Schengen preparations say their work is necessary to
push the EC's own efforts to create a true 'citizen's Europe', and as a
fallback position should the EC fail to agree on crucial elements such as
the free movement of citizens between the 12 member states.
A Portuguese cabinet statement said the government would allow illegal
immigrants to legalise their status over the next four months, if they could
prove they had a job or means of support and had lived in Portugal for at
least six months.
But citizens of Portugal's former African colonies, Angola, Mozambique,
Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe and Cape Verde, would receive more
favourable treatment, it said.
Portugal would grant residence rights to any citizen of its former colonies
without a criminal record who had lived in the country continuously since
June 1, 1986.

FT  21 FEB 92 / Scandal prompts Austrian move to outlaw insider deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIA is likely to make insider trading a criminal offence, despite fears
that this will further encroach on citizens' right to hold anonymous bank
accounts.
Pressure to curb insider trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange has increased
sharply since a scandal erupted in December over sales of shares of IGM
Robotersysteme in advance of an announcement of a downward revision of the
computer group's earnings forecast.
At the moment, the only sanctions against insider trading in securities in
Austria are those applied by the stock exchange on its members, and it has
been easy for offenders to hide behind anonymous bank accounts.
Austria is one of the few western countries that still permits people to
hold anonymous accounts. The system is mainly used by Austrians to avoid
taxes, and many oppose any suggestion that it be eliminated.
Nevertheless, the government has been under pressure from the US to do just
that, because these accounts are sometimes used by foreign criminals,
notably to launder drugs money. Also, to prepare for membership in the
European Community, Austria will have to tighten its banking practices to
conform with EC requirements.
Last month, the Austrian banking community agreed to improve its screening
of deposits by foreigners. In the past, banks required identification from
foreigners seeking to deposit more than Dollars 200,000. From now on, they
will insist on identification of anyone depositing more than the equivalent
of ASch200,000 (Dollars 17,237) in any foreign currency.
Bankers and government officials say measures are likely to be taken later
this year to deter insider trading. First, the authorities will be able to
oblige banks and brokers to waive bank secrecy and divulge information about
clients' transactions. Second, the stock exchange will require member firms
to know the identity of their clients, even if those clients deal from
numbered bank accounts.
Austrian officials say that even after these changes the ordinary citizen
need not worry. He can still hide his savings in an anonymous account.

FT  20 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARCH stock index futures slipped back in volatile trading as the market
sought some direction on the back of a weak Wall Street, writes Christopher
Price.
With the New York equities market off 21 Dow points overnight, the FT-SE
futures opened weak, but in a busy initial trading period March reached its
high point of the day of 2,576 by 9am.
However, the appearance of a number of sellers saw March begin to drift away
in mid-morning trading.
Wall Street's opening in the early afternoon failed to give any direction
and March retreated to 2,544, the low point of the day, and around its fair
value premium to cash.
This proved to be a rallying point and the index eventually stood at 2,550,
down 28 on the previous session and some 5 points above its estimated fair
value premium to cash of about 10. Turnover reached 5,925 contracts.
In the traded options market, the stock option expiry day boosted the volume
in a number of stocks, including the leading three lots traded: Hanson
(4,212), Thames (3,178) and Cadbury (2,910).
The day's total turnover was a healthy 40,234 contracts, with the FT-SE 100
reaching 6,435 lots traded.

FT  20 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Falls in oil shares depress the
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED selling of the leading oil and pharmaceutical stocks, triggered by
worries over the outlook for Wall Street following the result of the New
Hampshire primary election, turned the London stock market lower yesterday.
The Footsie 2,500 mark was again abandoned as hopes of an early cut in base
rates melted away and investors turned their attention to the international
scene.
Equities opened easier after the Tokyo market had fallen back to a 16-month
low and sterling's weaker performance against the D-Mark had cast doubts on
the hopes for a base rate cut which had sustained the UK stock market
earlier in the week.
Stock index futures were firm in early trading but could not offset the
heavy falls in such equity leaders as BP, SmithKline Beecham, Wellcome and
Glaxo.
The stock market was soon down around 15 points on the FT-SE scale. An
attempted rally died away as London grew increasingly nervous ahead of the
opening of the new Wall Street session. News of a 0.4 per cent rise in
domestic retail sales in January had no effect on the stock market.
Wall Street lost ground in early deals, and London extended its fall to
around 25 Footsie points, but then rallied when the Dow turned higher for a
net gain of 4 points in UK hours.
At the final reading the FT-SE 100 Index was down 19.2 to 2,536.7. UK
traders sounded apprehensive, in spite of the relatively steady performance
in the early part of the New York session. There was little recovery in the
heavyweight oil and drug stocks. Indeed, the closing minutes of trading were
overshadowed by hints that US investors, after supporting BP last week, had
turned sellers of the blue chip oil concern.
UK investors were still waiting to see Wall Street's definitive response to
the New Hampshire poll, as well as to the appearance of Mr Alan Greenspan,
chief of the Federal Reserve, before the House of Representatives and also
the Fed's reduction in banks' reserve requirements.
Trading volume in equities in London totalled 561.3m shares yesterday,
compared with 559.3m on Tuesday, when retail, or customer, business
increased to Pounds 995.4m. Some stock in the Seaq leaders was sold
yesterday but traders said that pressure was no more than moderate.
Outside the oil and pharmaceutical sectors, the picture was less gloomy.
British Aerospace staged a strong advance in heavy trading after announcing
a loss for the year which was not far from the market's predictions. ICI,
with the trading report now only a week away, moved ahead in good turnover,
and there were scattered gains elsewhere in the Footsie list.
However, Drayton Consolidated Trust fell sharply after disclosing that a
substantial loss was likely in view of the appointment of receivers at Alma
Holdings, an unquoted company in which Drayton had invested. Invesco, which
manages Drayton, lost a few pence on the news.
The less certain tone of the market yesterday inspired some profit-taking in
those stocks which had led the market ahead in the two previous sessions.
Some store shares gave ground, although the market appeared to have no
agreed view on the latest retail sales data.

FT  20 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further selling hits BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE
THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELENTLESS selling by UK and international institutions drove BP down to its
lowest level since January 1989. One fund was believed to have unloaded a
large line of stock late yesterday. BP suffered renewed selling on bearish
stories regarding its Cusiana oil discovery in Colombia. Cusiana, one of
BP's biggest drilling successes of recent years, has generated considerable
excitement among investors, and prompted strong US demand for the stock last
week.
Strauss Turnbull, the securities house, said yesterday, however, that it
expected the latest drilling news from Cusiana to be 'disappointing in size
and structure; it means more expensive drilling'.
Further disappointing news has come with a series of boardroom changes. The
market is particularly concerned at the loss of Mr James Ross, chief
executive at BP America, who is moving to Cable and Wireless. Already badly
weakened by last week's disastrous preliminary figures, the shares have been
hurt further by the Opec agreement to reduce output by 1.4m barrels a day.
At the close BP was 14 lower at 251p, with the Seaq ticker revealing blocks
of 9m and 1m shares traded at 249p.
BAe outperforms
Standing out as the day's best FT-SE performer was British Aerospace (BAe).
The market greeted the group's figures and a maintained dividend with
relief.
The shares started rising early in the session as some dealers carried out
bear closing, but powered ahead after examination of the figures, gaining 30
to 303p by the close. Turnover soared to 18m shares, the highest daily total
for more than three years. Smith New Court was a sizeable buyer, while UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew was reported to have been among the day's big sellers.
Dealers said a large amount of the buying was for the dividend, which is due
on Monday.
Analysts differ on the outlook for the company. Mr Peter Deighton at Smith
raised his current year forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 250m. He said: 'We
are pleased that there are no surprises in the figures and the cash flow
position was better than we anticipated.'
Mr Paul Compton at UBS remained sceptical. He said: 'This is still a risky
stock. Defence profits will come under pressure in coming years and Rover
will not grow to counteract this.' He predicted a dividend cut this year.
News of UK government defence orders also helped sentiment.
ICI firm
A positive note on ICI, published by a leading securities house, ensured
that the shares were firm in a dull market. The stock, up 14 at one stage,
closed 11 ahead at 1301p in spite of the belief that ICI's full-year
results, due next Thursday, will show reduced profits.
Hoare Govett reinforced its existing buy stance on ICI and disclosed a
profits forecast of Pounds 1.4bn for 1993. Mr Martin Evans, the broker's
chemicals analyst, argued that a combination of cost-cutting and cyclical
recovery would result in earnings growth of around 33 per cent next year
that would leave the shares on a highly attractive discount rating of 10 per
cent to the market for 1993.
Institutions continued to sell their holdings in the Electricity Package to
marketmakers, who split them into individual stock holdings. Liquidity in
the Package is expected to shrink rapidly ahead of the cessation of trading
in the issue, expected in the summer.
Funds were said to have sold the Package at Pounds 2,760 and reinvested some
of the proceeds in a handful of the individual stocks. These included London
Electricity, where turnover jumped to 4.6m and whose shares firmed 3 to
278p, and Yorkshire, where 3.3m were traded but the shares settled a shade
easier at 313p.
A block of 5.4m TSB (3 higher at 125p) traded late in the session at 125 1/2
p boosting turnover to 12m.
Shell Transport, affected by extreme nervousness over today's fourth-quarter
figures and worries about the dividend, weakened 13 to a 12-month low of
455p on high turnover of 5.7m shares. Mr Keith Morris, oil specialist at
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, was cautious on the dividend payment, and said he
expected a final of 11.6p, against most estimates of 12.2p, pointing to
Shell's traditional conservatism during difficult times.
Second line oils were again in disarray, shaken by actual and expected
earnings and asset valuation downgrades said to have been carried out by a
number of broking houses. Enterprise dropped 13 to 392p, its lowest level
since June 1988, and Lasmo retreated 9 to 197p, its lowest point since March
that year. Clyde slipped 4 to 58p and Hardy Oil &amp; Gas 11 to 108p. Most
closed off the bottom, however, responding to a positive note issued by
Hoare Govett, which said most of the stocks, except for Enterprise, were
still trading at a discount to asset value, even with crude oil at Dollars
18 a barrel.
Pharmaceuticals were weak yesterday, reflecting falls in US pharmaceutical
stocks overnight. Merck fell Dollars 2 1/4 , and Glaxo, which tends to track
Merck, and which announces its half-year results today, failed to respond to
good news in the UK on asthma drugs and lost 22 to 826p. The performance of
Glaxo shares was also affected by expectation of a negative report today
from the authoritative New England Journal of Medicine. The report, part of
a long-running debate, is expected to be critical of some forms of asthma
drugs.
SmithKline Beecham dropped 26 to 924 1/2 p in the 'A' shares and 107 to
4153p in the units. The company announced that the American Academy of
Pediatrics was recommending immunisation for teenagers and infants against
hepatitis B. The vaccination is produced by SmithKline and Merck, but the
news broke after the market closed and failed to help the SmithKline share
price.
Profit-taking caused Wellcome to slide 29 to 1113p, while Fisons weakened 11
to 373p.
Kingfisher, parent of DIY company B &amp; Q, was the star of a mixed stores
sector. The shares advanced 8 to 531p following recommendations from UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew and Warburg Securities.
In an internal buy note, issued before yesterday's retail sales figures, UBS
said Kingfisher is reasonably geared into a consumer recovery. Warburg is
positive about the DIY division and suggests that the company is at a 13 per
cent price to earnings discount within the sector.
WH Smith 'A' put on 5 to 462p and Boots 2 to 465p, but Marks and Spencer
lost 6 to 318p, Sears a penny to 105p and Ratners 1 3/4 to 18 1/2 p. January
retail sales were better than expected, but this was entirely the result of
higher food sales, as clothing and footwear and sales of household goods
fell. Analysts were reluctant to read too much into the data, suggesting
stores are likely to benefit on expectations of a generous UK Budget in the
run-up to a general election.
Holiday group Owners Abroad reported a doubling of profits, triggering a
revision in analysts' estimates for the coming year. The shares, however,
dipped 3 to 117p, mainly on profit-taking, although there was disappointment
that the dividend was increased by only 10 per cent. Most analysts are now
looking for Pounds 36m to Pounds 38.5m this year and around Pounds 43m next,
with the shares remaining on most brokers' buy lists. 'Bookings are well
ahead, costs are being kept down and margins are not under pressure,' said
Mr Peter Hilliar at BZW. 'We think the stock is undervalued.'
Sentiment in BAe supported Rolls-Royce, which firmed a penny to 137p on
turnover of 4.8m. US buying was noted in British Airways, which moved up 4
to 259p.
Central Television continued to strengthen, with no one prepared to sell the
stock and speculation growing that a share split is on the cards. The shares
added 25 at 1308p.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, steady at 15p, was the most heavily traded stock in the
London market with more than 41m shares changing hands.

FT  20 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Broader market fails to

Wall Street
US BLUE chips showed gains that the broader market was unable to register
yesterday as investors, encouraged by January economic data, bought
economically sensitive Dow constituent stocks, writes Karen Zagor in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 5.59 up at 3,230.32, after having
posted a modest loss in the first half-hour of trading. On the big board,
declining issues narrowly led advances by 950 to 756 after a fair New York
SE volume of 234.8m shares.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was just 0.88 firmer at 408.26, while secondary
stocks posted losses on the day, with the Nasdaq composite finishing down
4.00 at 622.41.
Hewlett-Packard, the computer company, jumped Dollars 9 1/8 to Dollars 73
1/2 after turning in first-quarter profits of Dollars 1.10 a share against
83 cents last year.
Rohr, an aircraft component manufacturer, dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 18
1/8 . The company said it may face a federal indictment following a
government investigation of faulty testing which might bar it from winning
future government contracts.
Among active blue chip issues, AT&amp;T gained Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 38, Ford
Motor advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 and General Motors rose
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 3/8 .
News of reduced reserve requirements lifted some bank shares for a second
day. Citicorp added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 16 3/4 and BancOne Dollars  7/8
at Dollars 47 3/4 .
Bank of Boston moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to a 52-week high of Dollars 17 7/8
after the stock was added to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's recommended
list.
News that Kroger, one of the largest US supermarket chains, plans to buy
back up to Dollars 100m of high-yield debt had little effect on the
company's stock, which eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 17 1/2 .
Biotechnology issues led the secondary market lower. Centocorp plunged
Dollars 8 1/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 in very heavy over-the-counter trading after
the company said that the US Food and Drug Administration had raised
questions about its important Centoxin drug to treat septic shock that might
delay the release of the drug and reduce 1992 earnings. Centocorp also
posted a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 1.19 a share.
A series of disappointing corporate results also contributed to the
secondary market's slide. Fleer fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 22 1/2 on the
back of fourth-quarter earnings of 10 cents a share, compared with 27 cents
a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of about 30 cents in the
latest quarter.
Mail Box weakened Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 after turning in
third-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share, below earlier estimates of 35
cents a share but above the 24 cents reported the previous year.
Walt Disney declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 145 5/8 in spite of news that
its 'Beauty and the Beast' film had become the first animated film to be
nominated for the best picture category of the Academy Awards. The stock
gained Dollars 3 5/8 on Tuesday after the entertainment group announced
plans for a four-for-one stock split. Canada
THERE WERE moderate losses in most sectors yesterday, sending the Toronto
market lower for the seventh straight session. President George Bush's poor
showing in the New Hampshire primary added to the market's negative tone.
Analysts said the slim rise of only 0.1 per cent in the US consumer price
index for January eased fears of a resurgence in inflation, but had little
immediate effect on the market.
The composite index closed 7.9 easier at 3,543.3. Falls outscored rises by
350 to 230 after volume of 25.8m shares.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut fever cools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEVER of excitement over an imminent rate cut in the UK cooled off
yesterday, as the Bank of England stayed away from money market operations
until the afternoon.
Overnight rates, which began the day at about 10 per cent, were as high as
11 3/4 per cent by the afternoon. They fell back to close at 10 3/4 - 5/8
per cent, still higher than in recent days.
Virtually all money, right up to one and two years, was depressed at the
opening. The market was bracing itself for a rate cut following sterling's
resilient performance against the D-Mark this week.
The key three months interbank rate - which is a good indicator to the
course of interest rates - fell as low as 10 1/8 per cent at the bid, said
one dealer, the lowest seen in some time. By the end of the day, the rate
was looking for at least a quarter-point cut in rates, closing at 10 1/4 -
3/16 per cent.
On the futures market, the March short sterling contract finished at 89.86.
At this level, the market was expecting a rate of about 10.14 per cent by
the time the contract expires on March 18. Most economists and dealers are
expecting a rate reduction just after the UK Budget on March 10. However,
the market will continue to speculate on an imminent cut as the election
approaches.
The Bank tried to cool some of the rate cut speculation at noon by offering
to buy bills nearer the current 10 1/2 per cent base rate. It was ignored
until the afternoon, however, when the market accepted its first tranche of
assistance to stem the forecast Pounds 400m shortage.
Band one treasury and bank bills totalling Pounds 92m were purchased at 10
3/8 per cent. The bulk of the shortfall was eliminated by late assistance of
Pounds 240m.
In the US, the Federal Reserve acted to depress the funds rate by adding
liquidity through overnight system repurchase agreements. At the time of the
action, funds were trading at 5 1/4 per cent. The perceived target is 4 per
cent.
Economists suggested that the announcement Tuesday night that the Fed would
ease credit requirements reinforced the view that there would be no
immediate change in US monetary policy.
In Germany, the Bundesbank injected DM700m through securities repurchase
agreements. This helped to hold call money rates at 9.55/65 per cent.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar takes a breather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR took a break yesterday from its recent hectic scramble, even
ignoring better than expected consumer price data, writes Peggy Hollinger.
It finished the day in London slightly weaker at DM1.6470, compared with
DM1.6480. Strong rumours that the Federal Reserve had been checking
dollar/D-Mark prices pushed the US unit down from DM1.6475 to DM1.6425 at
one stage. The market had previously speculated there would be no hint of
intervention until the dollar rose to DM1.70. In New York it eased to
DM1.6430.
Economists stressed that yesterday's decline was minimal and the dollar was
expected to stay strong. 'It will not be rampant any more,' said Mr Mark
Austin, an economist at HongKong Bank, 'but it is not going to go down
either.'
The dollar enjoyed a half-hearted rally on the announcement of core consumer
prices up just 0.3 per cent, as opposed to the forecast 0.6 per cent.
However, stop-loss trading was triggered when it hit DM1.65, forcing the US
currency down to the low DM1.64 levels in the afternoon.
The long-awaited Humphrey Hawkins speech to Congress from Federal Reserve
chairman Mr Alan Greenspan offered no surprises. Economists said Mr
Greenspan had narrowly avoided congressional criticism over Fed actions to
encourage economic recovery, by announcing the easing of credit requirements
the night before the speech.
The dollar continued its cautious rise against the yen, closing in London at
Y128.35 from Tuesday's Y128.00. Rumours that the Fed had also been checking
dollar/yen prices in New York held the US unit back in Europe. But earlier
in Japanese trading the dollar enjoyed a more healthy rally from Y127.17 to
Y128.20. The Bank of Japan checked dollar/yen rates at the Y128.10 level,
but to no avail. In New York last night it ended at Y128.20.
Sterling was tarnished by the dollar's muted performance, remaining
unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.8850. Encouraging UK retail sales
figures had little effect as the market was looking towards today's
fourth-quarter GDP numbers. The speculation about a base rate cut was
'bubbling away in the background', said Mr Austin, but had done little
damage.
Rumours of an interest rate cut co-ordinated between the Spanish and British
central banks could resurface in three weeks when Spain releases its next
set of inflation figures. 'That would fit in conveniently with a cut around
(UK) Budget time,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank.
The pound remained at the bottom of the exchange rate mechanism grid and was
at its limit against the peseta, which slipped from Pta 62.56 per D-Mark to
Pta 62.61.
The Bank of Italy had been buying D-Marks at the Milan fix with an eye to
keeping the lira at about L750, said Mr Cocker. It ended at L750.05 per
D-Mark, against L750.13.

FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Honda Motor slides to Y10bn in
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA Motor, the Japanese car and motorcycle maker, yesterday reported a 36
per cent fall in net profits to Y10.72bn (Dollars 83.75m) for the third
quarter to end-December from Y16.75bn a year earlier, AP-DJ reports.
Sales advanced 2.8 per cent to Y1,045bn from Y1,017bn. Earnings per share
were down 35 per cent at Y10.96 compared with Y17.01.
The directors said the rise in turnover was made mainly on the back of
strong motorcycle sales in Asia and sales of new car models worldwide.
However, they said pre-tax profits fell because the yen was stronger during
the quarter compared with the same period a year ago, and operating expenses
grew at a faster rate than sales.
For the whole year, however, the directors are maintaining their forecast
that net income would come to Y80.10bn - a rise of 5.1 per cent over the
previous year - and they see sales of Y4,528bn, up 5 per cent.
Third-quarter operating income totalled Y22.01bn, down 20 per cent from
Y27.58bn. Net profits fell more sharply than both operating income and
pre-tax profits because of a fall in equity income in affiliates.
During the third quarter, motorcycle sales amounted to Y106.6bn, a gain of
0.1 per cent. Unit sales for the period totalled 802,000 vehicles, up 7.4
per cent from the year before.
Car sales rose 4.1 per cent to Y873.70bn, 'owing primarily to better product
mix in both Japan and North America,' the directors said, although in terms
of volume, car sales fell 3.7 per cent to 467,000 units.
Revenue from other businesses fell 9.7 per cent to Y64.8bn, mainly
reflecting a fall in sales of power products. For the first nine months
pre-tax profits fell 2.5 per cent to Y112.58bn, while net profits fell 13
per cent to Y53.84bn and sales rose 3.6 per cent to Y3,274bn.
Honda said sales had picked up in Japan and the US, but that improvement
probably would not be enough to boost full-year earnings beyond the
projections made in January.

US TREASURY prices changed direction yesterday, recovering most of their
previous day's losses as investors took heart from the consumer price index
for January.
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was 3/4 higher at 100 15/16, yielding
7.91 per cent, after dropping about 13/16 on Tuesday. Gains were less
pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, with the two-year note
unchanged at 99 3/8 , yielding 5.23 per cent.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange overnight system
repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 5 1/4 per cent, above
the Fed's perceived target for the rate of 4 per cent.
The Fed's action, which adds liquidity to the banking system, was widely
expected and did not signal a change in monetary policy.
An encouraging CPI report for January provided the impetus for yesterday's
rally. The index rose only 0.1 per cent, below the 0.3 per cent increase the
market had expected. The core rate, excluding food and energy, was 0.3 per
cent higher.
Longer-dated maturities were also helped by rumours that the Fed was buying
bonds for its own account.
GERMAN government bond prices slipped back following Tuesday's weakness in
the US Treasury bond market and ahead of the German M3 money supply figures
for January which are due this week.
Traders said there had been no sign of any significant change in the
Bundesbank's monetary policy at yesterday's securities tender. The
Bundesbank accepted bids for DM41bn at a two-tranche securities tender,
allocating DM30.7bn of 28-day funds mostly at 9.40 per cent and DM10.3bn of
56-day funds mostly at 9.45 per cent. That represented a net addition of
DM700m in liquidity.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.75 and traded down to 87.72
yesterday afternoon after moving in a narrow range of 87.64 to 87.80.
JAPANESE government bonds ended a touch lower due to the yen's weakness and
Tuesday's fall in the US Treasury bond market.
The yen traded at between 128.0 and 128.4 to the US dollar but traders said
there was no sign of central bank intervention. The futures contract had
fallen back from its opening level of 102.11 to close at 102.01 where it
remained well supported, traders said.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.40 per cent, traded in a
narrow range of 5.385 to 5.41 per cent and closed at 5.41 per cent.
UK government bonds opened on a weak note and ended little changed on the
day in light trading.
The Liffe gilt futures contract slipped from its opening of 97.23 to 97.19
before moving back to 97.24 by late afternoon. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent
gilt due 2003/07 opened at 116 3/8 and fell to 116 3/16 .
Traders said the 0.4 per cent rise in January UK retail sales announced
yesterday had been seen as an encouraging sign.

PLATE Glass and Shatterprufe Industries, South Africa's largest glass
manufacturer which recently became part of the South African Breweries (SAB)
group, has announced it will be raising R354m (Dollars 125m) in a rights
issue, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
The cash will enable PGSI to increase the equity base of its offshore
operations and refinance local borrowings. Some R210m will be used to
recapitalise PGSI's international operations, enabling them to take
advantage of growth opportunities. The balance will, in the short term, be
used to reduce local borrowings.
PGSI's ordinary shareholders will be offered renounceable rights to
subscribe for new ordinary shares at R43 a share, a 20 per cent discount to
the market price of R54 at the time of the announcement.
The move is part of a complex web of transactions announced over the past
two months between PGSI and SAB. The main transaction sees SAB acquiring
54.6 per cent of the equity of Placor, holding company for PGSI, with a
proposed scheme of arrangement in Placor whereby, if successful, it will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAB.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIOCHEM PHARMA, Glaxo Holdings' main Canadian research partner, expects to
disclose results of clinical testing of the new 3TC anti-Aids drug at an
Amsterdam conference in July, Dr Francesco Bellini, president, said.
The 3TC trials are being carried out in North America and Europe. Biochem
hopes to get North American approval late in 1993.
It has three main competitors: Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US, Hoffman-La
Roche of Switzerland and Boehringer-Ingelheim of Germany. All aim at
commercial production in 1994-1945, depending on the length of the
international approval process.
The 3TC compound may control the Aids virus and prolong the lives of
infected people with fewer side effects than existing drugs.
Biochem shareholders yesterday approved a name change from IAF Biochem. Dr
Bellini said Biochem was becoming an integrated pharmaceutical group in
therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. It has 300 staff, including 55
scientists, and spends several million dollars a year on research. It is
completing a CDollars 40m production and research centre in Montreal.
It retains a 40 per cent interest in North American Vaccine (Nava), a US
firm researching new bacterial vaccines.
Biochem, listed in Canada and NASDAQ, now has a market capitalisation of
CDollars 1.2bn (USDollars 1bn). On an operating basis it has yet to show a
profit.
In the first nine months of fiscal 1992, however, it posted an overall
profit of CDollars 14m, or 41 cents a share, including a CDollars 17m
special gain on a Nava stock issue. Revenues were Dollars 20.2m.
Dr Bellini said the full year ended January 31 would show profit between
CDollars 13 and CDollars 14m when the figures were announced next month.
Though Biochem has about CDollars 40m in cash, it would raise more equity
when markets are favourable.

<TEXT>
ONE of International Business Machines' top executives, Mr Michael
Armstrong, is to leave the company at the end of the month to become
chairman and chief executive of Hughes Aircraft, where he will succeed Mr
Malcolm Currie, who is retiring.
Mr Armstrong, 53, has been at IBM for 31 years. For the past three years he
hasheaded the computer company's international operations, a post he took
over after serving as director-general of European operations.
He was chairman of IBM World Trade and a member of the company's five-man
management committee and its corporate management board.
Mr Armstrong's departure comes as a surprise. He was considered to be a
potential successor to Mr John Akers, 57, who is expected to retire from the
IBM chairmanship in about three years.
Mr Armstrong is joining Hughes Aircraft as the defence electronics company
begins a drive to increase its commercial business and become less dependent
on defence contracts, which currently represent about 70 per cent of its
revenues.
Hughes, which produces missiles, telecommunications satellites and radar
equipment for the military, posted 1990 revenues of Dollars 7.8bn and is
expecting 1991 revenues of about Dollars 8bn.
The company, based in Los Angeles, is a unit of General Motors.

NORTHROP, the US defence contractor which is heavily dependant on the B-2
Stealth bomber programme, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars
200.8m for 1991 - a little lower than the Dollars 210.4m seen in the
previous year.
However, comparisons between the two years are slightly misleading. The 1990
figure included a Dollars 67.1m after-tax gain from the sale of the
company's headquarters complex, while the 1991 results are depressed by
about Dollars 4m by accounting changes.
At the operating profit level, Los Angeles-based Northrop reported Dollars
474.2m, compared with Dollars 346.8m in the previous 12 months.
The company said profits were higher in the aircraft and the missiles and
unmanned vehicle systems divisions, but fell in the electronics business
segment, where the cost of settling legal and product disputes impinged.
Overall, sales for the year reached Dollars 5.69bn, up by 3.7 per cent on
1990.
In the fourth quarter alone, net profits improved from Dollars 42.7m to
Dollars 158.5m, with sales totalling Dollars 1.57bn (Dollars 1.52bn).
Northrop shares rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 25 7/8 yesterday.

NATIONAL Semiconductor is to begin immediately a Dollars 120m expansion of
its semiconductor production plant in Arlington, Texas, writes Louise Kehoe.
The company said the decision to proceed with the expansion came after the
passage of a tax abatement plan by local authorities which will offset a
recent increase in Texas state taxes.
Over the past year, National has been restructuring its operations and
closing some manufacturing facilities.
National said, however, the CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-silicon)
technology used at Arlington was one of its core activities . 'One of our
corporate goals is to concentrate our manufacturing efforts in fewer sites,
each of which is more effective,' said Mr Scott Hendricks, the plant's
managing director. 'Now Arlington is at the forefront of that trend.'

MIPS is competing with Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and others to
establish its microprocessors as a standard in the workstation market. IDT

Pillsbury, which is owned by Grand Metropolitan of the UK, will own 75 per

<TEXT>
HEWLETT-Packard yesterday reported stronger-than-expected earnings for its
first fiscal quarter, hoisting the company's stock price by more than
Dollars 9 or 14 per cent.
The US computer and electronic instruments manufacturer attributed the
result to a sharp increase in orders for its popular laser printers and
strong demand for its computer workstations.
Earnings for the quarter rose 49 per cent to Dollars 306m, or Dollars 1.21
per share. Wall Street analysts had been projecting earnings between 79 and
95 cents per share. Net earnings in the same period a year ago were Dollars
205m, or 83 cents.
Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 3.9bn, up 13 per cent from Dollars 3.4bn
last time. US sales totalled Dollars 1.7bn, up 13 per cent, while sales
outside the US rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn.
'These results reflect the strong acceptance of HP's newer products and our
on-going efforts to slow the growth of expenses,' said Mr John Young, HP
president and chief executive.
Although the November acquisition of Avantek, a semiconductor manufacturer,
added about 1,800 employees, overall employment for the quarter increased by
only 700 people to 89,700.
For the first time, HP provided a breakdown of its computer sales revenues,
which rose to Dollars 2.8bn in the quarter from Dollars 2.4bn last year.
In the key computer workstation market, HP holds an estimated 16 per cent
share, running second to Sun Microsystems. Last month HP launched a new
Dollars 5,000 workstation twice as fast as Sun's lowest-priced model.
In the maturing market for electronic instruments, HP's sales declined, from
Dollars 568m in the first quarter of 1991 to Dollars 526m. Sales of medical
electronic equipment, however, rose to Dollars 229m from Dollars 214m, while
those for analytical instruments advanced to Dollars 169m from Dollars 154m.
Electronic components sales rose sharply to Dollars 106m from Dollars 68m.
Mr Young said the company 'remains cautious in our outlook because of
continuing economic difficulties in the US and slower growth in some key
markets outside the US'.
He said the goal for the year was to sustain its improved financial
performance.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: CountyGlen losses leap to IPounds 153,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CountyGlen, the Irish property investor and trader, continued to seek
suitable acquisitions; search and evaluation costs were reflected in a loss
of IPounds 153,000 (Pounds 141,700) for the six months to October 31.
That came from turnover of IPounds 38,000, and compared with a deficit of
Pounds 49,000 on turnover of IPounds 52,000 in the previous year. Losses per
share were 4.3p (1.5p).
The principal focus of activity was a joint venture on the proposed retail
development in the Tallaght area of Dublin. Though no longer a likely
investment, discussions continue to recover costs which were incurred.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bodycote International, the metal technology, packaging and textiles group,
plans to become a leader in the world market for 'hip'ing' - a process to
improve the quality of metals and glass - through the acquisition of two
companies for Dollars 14.6m (Pounds 8.3m).
The group is buying Industrial Materials Technology, which has two plants in
the US, and IMT Europe, based in Belgium, from National Forge Company of
Delaware.
Bodycote will pay Dollars 637,000 cash. The rest of the consideration will
be met through the issue at 356p of 2.23m new shares.
The acquisitions follow the takeover last year of HIP, which developed
hip'ing - also known as Hot Isostatic Pressing - in the UK.

Southdown Building Society incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.8m in 1991,
after bad debt provisions of Pounds 14.1m.
The loss was the fourth to be announced by a society in 1991. In November
Southdown agreed to merge with Leeds Permanent after it was evident it was
heading for a loss.
Southdown said that about half the provisions were made against residential
mortgage lending and the rest against losses on building finance and
commercial lending.
At the end of 1991, the society had assets of Pounds 746.3m.

Leslie Wise, the textiles, womenswear and knitted fabrics group, suffered a

end-November.
However, with the core companies reporting 'an improved outlook' and 'in the

year is maintained at 4p via a proposed same-again final of 2.25p. The
shares rose 7p to 65p. Turnover fell by 7 per cent to Pounds 40.5m. A 93 per
cent increase in exports to Pounds 5.31m partially offset a 14 per cent
reduction in UK turnover.
Tax was reduced from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 895,000 leaving earnings per
share at 5.8p (9.96p).

Coburn was put on the market last May when Pilkington hoped to sell it for

price achieved was not disappointing. It is likely to see a small loss on
the sale. The purchaser is a private company controlled by Mr Robert Jepson,

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMASC, the UK's biggest producer of beer kegs, and a maker of precision
components and building products, is raising its interim dividend on the
back of a 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profits.
For the six months ended December 31 1991 profits were Pounds 3.65m,
compared with Pounds 2.77m, from turnover of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 22.3m).
Earnings per share rose 13 per cent to 15.8p (14p), and the interim
distribution is lifted 11 per cent to 3.55p (3.2p).
The rise in profits came principally because the group had widened its
business through acquisition, it continued to draw interest from its net
cash balances, and it had sought to fend off pressure on margins by
stringent management controls.
Although, subject to any further expansion, the group expected to remain
cash positive for the second half, market conditions for its products were
depressed 'with particular weakness in demand for products linked to
consumer demand,' Mr John McCall, chairman, reported.
Operating profit rose to Pounds 3.54m (Pounds 2.7m), while interest
contributions climbed to Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 66,000).

<TEXT>
POLYFINANCE, the French laundry and sports equipment distributor, plans to
move into the UK via a recommended cash offer for its former parent,
Polymark International, the industrial laundry and label manufacturer and
supplier.
Polyfinance, which was set up as a separate company in 1990 following a
management buy-out, is offering 37p and 164 1/2 p respectively for each
ordinary and A share. This represents respective premiums of 10.4 per cent
and 25.6 per cent above Tuesday's closing prices. The offer values Polymark
at about Pounds 9.4m.
Polymark's ordinary shares, which traded at 25p before the bid was first
mooted in January, gained 2p to 36p. The A shares added 32p to 163p.
Polyfinance, which has operations in France and Germany, said it wanted to
expand its laundry business into the UK and identify cost savings.
Polymark has accepted the offer. Directors hold 0.23 per cent of the
ordinary and 8.44 per cent of the A shares.
The offers will be made by Societe Generale Merchant Bank on behalf of
Polyfinance.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Unipart weathers the recession with 18%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIPART, the vehicle comp-onents and accessories manufacturer and
distributor, increased pre-tax profits by 17.5 per cent last year and is
doubling its dividend.
The results come against the background of one of the worst recessions to
have hit the motor trade and industry since the Second World War.
Mr John Neill, chief executive of the former Rover Group parts and
accessories division, attributed the Cowley-headquartered group's sharply
improved performance both to aggressive marketing activity and to
investments in manufacturing, productivity and to employee motivation
programmes beginning to pay off.
Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 1991 rose from Pounds 13.1m to
Pounds 15.4m achieved on turnover 2.6 per cent lower at Pounds 567m against
Pounds 582m.
The figures were helped at the pre-tax level by Unipart eliminating some
Pounds 20m in borrowings associated with a 1989 share buy-back scheme, and
which had incurred Pounds 2.2m in interest charges in 1990.
Unipart was privatised in an employee buy-out in 1987. It is now owned by
its directors, employees and a small group of institutions, with Rover
maintaining a minority stake.
The company is to pay a dividend of 22.7p on each ordinary share, more than
four times the 5p paid by most employees at the time of privatisation.
About 2,000 of Unipart's 4,000 employees took up the original shares offer,
spending an average of Pounds 500 each on a package which also included
founder and preference shares, most of which have been redeemed.
Since then, share ownership among the group's employ-ees has widened
substantial-ly.
The group's retained profit was Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 9.5m).
Unipart's prospects have been boosted by the conclusion last year of
'lifetime' agreements for the worldwide distribution of parts for both Rover
cars and Land Rover and Range Rover models.
It is also moving to expand its components manufacturing operations as a
result of forging closer ties with both Rover and Honda, which is to start
car production at Swindon later this year.
Next month, Unipart is formally to commission a new plant to supply
catalytic converters and exhaust systems for the Synchro, the family car
Honda will build at Swindon - a Rover version of which is also to be built
at Longbridge.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland is negotiating to take a stake in an Italian company which
operates in the home loans market. It would be the first venture the
Edinburgh-based institution has made in mortgage lending outside the UK,
write James Buxton and Haig Simonian.
The bank confirmed yesterday that it was negotiating with Finanziaria
Italiana Mutui (FIM), the mortgage lending arm of Sopaf, the Milan-based
merchant bank run by Mr Jody Vender, which has branched into a variety of
property-related activities.
The size of Bank of Scotland's stake could be about 25 per cent or larger,
according to the bank. But the bank is unwilling to give more details until
a deal is concluded.
According to Italian press reports, both Bank of Scotland and SAI, the
Italian insurance company, would take sizeable stakes in FIM in order to
expand it. SAI is controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, a controversial
property developer who also has a dominant interest in Grassetto, one of
Italy's biggest building groups.
Italy has a relatively large mortgage market, which has been buoyed by the
high level of owner-occupancy and of second home ownership. About 65 per
cent of Italians own their own homes, a figure similar to that in the UK.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE and Wireless appointed a new chief executive yesterday, completing a
management shake-up instituted by Lord Young, the telecommunications group's
executive chairman, after he joined 18 months ago.
Mr James Ross, chairman and chief executive of BP America, the oil group,
takes up the job on May 1. He fills a position which has been vacant since
Mr Gordon Owen resigned last year.
Lord Young said it was 'more important to get a good international manager
than someone who knows telecommunications'.
Mr Ross is expected to be responsible for day-to-day management with Lord
Young, a former Conservative cabinet minister, keeping control of strategy
and political liaison. 'Someone has got to look at the wood and someone has
got to look at the trees,' Lord Young said.
Mr Ross, a UK citizen, has a reputation for having a safe pair of hands and
is thought unlikely to challenge Lord Young's authority. 'He is more of a
statesman and organiser than a street fighter,' said a stockbroker who
follows the oil industry.
The stockbroker said Mr Ross was not seen as a candidate for the top job at
BP and dismissed suggestions his move could be connected with reports of
boardroom divisions at the oil group. Mr Ross, 53, has been with BP since
1959, working in France, Africa, the UK and the US.
Top C and W executives will report to Mr Ross. These include Mr Peter van
Cuylenberg, executive director in charge of the group's businesses in
developed countries, who had been hoping for the job.
C and W will launch a new corporate identity later today, changing the
current logo, replacing the 'and' in Cable and Wireless with '&amp;'.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, France's largest chemical group, may be about to move more
fully into the private sector, it was announced yesterday.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chief executive, said it was probable the French state
would reduce its 56.9 per cent holding in the company. He raised the
possibility of a full-scale privatisation.
'The decision is not in my hands, but it is probable the government's stake
will be reduced within the next three years.
'The question now is whether the state holding should be a minority interest
or nothing at all,' he said.
'Whatever the conclusion of the legislative elections next year the
situation will change.'
Mr Fourtou announced the company's full-year results, which included a 37.5
per cent rise in operating income from FFr4.56bn (Pounds 460m) to FFr6.27bn
and profits before tax up 17.8 per cent from FFr3.75bn to FFr4.42bn.
Turnover rose 6.9 per cent from FFr78.4bn to FFr83.8bn.
The increase in operating income was highly dependent on Rhone-Poulenc's
pharmaceuticals operations, and particularly on the performance of
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which was created in 1990 after the French company
acquired a 68 per cent stake in Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group.
The dire state of the chemicals industry was demonstrated by the performance
of the non-healthcare divisions where operating income fell FFr400m. The
specialty chemicals division had a turnover of FFr14.8bn but made an
operating surplus of only FFr100m last year.
The healthcare division's operating income more than doubled from FFr2bn to
FFr4.2bn. However, without the Rorer acquisition the division's pre-tax
profits would have grown by only 13 per cent, said Mr Fourtou. He added that
it might take five years for the full benefits of the company's acquisition
programme to work their way through.
He said his priority remained reducing the company's debt following its
substantial acquisition programme in 1989 and 1990. Net debt had fallen from
FFr34bn in 1990 to FFr33.1bn at the end of 1991. The aim was to cut
debt-to-equity ratio from 0.78 at the end of last year to close to 0.5 in
1993, he said.
Earnings per ordinary share rose 1.9 per cent from FFr20.15 to FFr20.53. The
dividend was held at FFr15.75.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Coal director warns of drop in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL'S sales to the electricity industry could drop from 65m to 25m
tonnes by 1996, Mr Malcolm Edwards, the company's commercial director, told
the Commons energy committee yesterday.
This was because of the threat to coal-fired power stations from the many
new gas-fired power stations being built in England and Wales.
The sales cut would force British Coal to reduce the number of pits from
about 50 to even fewer than the 14 that NM Rothschild, the government's
advisers on the British Coal privatisation, have estimated would survive.
Mr Edwards' appearance before MPs followed controversial efforts by the
British Coal chairman to dismiss him.
Although Mr Edwards is still officially BC's commercial director, he is
expected to leave the company when his lawyers have settled terms.
Mr Edwards said coal imports, the subsidised nuclear industry and other
fuels were also threats to British Coal. If the government removed the
advantages these other fuels enjoyed, British Coal could still win a
five-year contract to sell 50m tonnes of coal to the electricity generators.
He said British Coal could help itself by cutting costs and prices to the
electricity industry. However, he said, the price should not fall below
Pounds 1.60 per gigajoule, compared with Pounds 1.85 today. Although imports
were only around Pounds 1.35 per gigajoule, UK coal offered better security
without exchange rate risk.
It was unlikely that British Coal would lose all its sales to gas and
imported coal. 'I'd say the centre of gravity for demand for British Coal
was closer to 25m tonnes,' he said. This compares with the 30m to 35m tonnes
predicted by NM Rothschild.
Mr Edwards also said there was no economic justification for building many
of the new gas stations because the power they would produce would be
expensive at 2.9p per unit compared with 1.8p to 2.2p at existing coal
stations.
The reason they were able to go ahead in spite of being uncompetitive was
because they were backed by long-term contracts to sell power to the 12
regional electricity companies which buy power from generators and sell to
customers, and so did not have to compete in the market place.
The reason the regional electricity companies had been anxious to back
independent generation projects was to gain bargaining power with the two
big generators, National Power and PowerGen, Mr Edwards said.
National Power and PowerGen had then felt obliged to build gas stations to
defend their market share. The industry would be relieved if this
competitive investment in gas could be stopped, he believed.
British Coal said yesterday that it welcomed Mr Edwards' warnings about the
'dash for gas'. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman for a year, had
'made it plain that all electricity users stand to lose from excessive and
unnecessary investment in new gas-fired stations', the company said.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Greenspan sees early US recovery: Federal Reserve chairman
forecasts a return to lowest inflation level for a generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday gave his most
upbeat congressional testimony since the summer, predicting an early
economic recovery and a fall in inflation to the lowest level for a
generation.
He said spending seemed to be rising in some sectors, and the decline in
industrial production in January did not appear to have carried over into
this month.
He acknowledged that the outlook was 'particularly uncertain' and warned
that recovery could 'peter out' as happened last year. However, he based his
prediction of a revival in business activity on structural changes under way
for the past two years.
Households and companies had made progress in repairing strained balance
sheets, he said. Banks and other lenders had begun to rebuild depleted
capital positions. Money supply was growing faster after a long period of
stagnation.
Mr Greenspan said the core rate of inflation was also falling rapidly,
forecasting that 'within the foreseeable future we will have attained the
lowest rates of inflation in a generation'.
Economic data released yesterday broadly supported his optimism. The annual
rate of consumer price inflation fell to 2.6 per cent in January. The
monthly increase in prices was only 0.1 per cent - less than financial
markets expected.
A separate report showed a 5.5 per cent jump in housing starts last month,
bigger than expected. The gain, however, was concentrated in only one region
 -the Midwest - and in the volatile apartment buildings sector.
Mr Greenspan was delivering testimony in support of the Fed's semi-annual
Humphrey-Hawkins monetary report to Congress. The report contains unchanged
target ranges for monetary growth. The target for M2, the main measure of
broad money, is 2.5 to 6.5 per cent. In recent years M2 growth has fallen
well below the mid-range of the Fed's targets, partly because of the
restructuring of banks and other financial institutions.
The report also predicts economic growth of 1 3/4 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent
during this year, roughly in line with the Bush administration's forecast of
2.2 per cent. It predicts inflation of 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent in the
year to the fourth quarter of 1992, with further progress in future years.
Mr Greenspan provided no clear signal on interest rates. However, his
bullish remarks about the economy may be interpreted as further evidence
that the Fed is not contemplating a further easing of monetary policy in the
near future.
He confirmed that the reduction in reserve requirements for commercial banks
announced on Tuesday was intended to boost bank profitability and ease the
credit crunch rather than as an easing of monetary policy.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Watchdog urges publishers not to run latest Benetton adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Advertising Standards Authority yesterday urged British publishers and
poster contractors to refuse all but one of a new series of controversial
advertisements for Benetton, the Italian clothes manufacturer and retailer.
One of the advertisements, which has already received wide publicity, is a
photograph of a dying Aids patient, Mr David Kirby.
The others show a burning car, Albanian refugees leaping from a ship, an
Asian couple struggling in flood waters, an African guerrilla soldier
holding a human thigh bone and a child being lifted by its arm on to a truck
in the midst of an African crowd.
The ASA said it had advised publishers that only the photograph of the Asian
couple is likely to avoid falling foul of its code of conduct. Ms Caroline
Crawford of the ASA said the majority were 'pure exploitation of scenes of
tragedy and would be highly likely to cause great distress'.
In London yesterday, Mr Luciano Benetton, one of the company's founders, and
Mr Oliviero Toscani, responsible for the creative aspects of the campaign,
vigorously denied suggestions that the campaign exploited human suffering to
sell clothing.
Since 1984 Benetton has regularly been censured in many countries for using
shocking photographic images in its advertising.
Mr Benetton said his company, which has 6,500 retail outlets in some 100
countries, will this year spend 4 per cent of its annual Pounds 1.96bn
turnover on the latest campaign and other planned media projects.
Mr Toscani said Mr Kirby's parents had consented to the use of the
photograph of their dying son in the campaign, and that 'it was a privileged
way to die, in the arms of his family.' He said Benetton's advertising
policy was 'to move from using advertising to promote a product, to the
promotion of greater social awareness.' He added that such advertising
'probably doesn't sell sweaters but I don't care'.
Asked whether the company had considered making charitable donations to help
solve some of the social problems featured in the campaign photographs, Mr
Benetton said: 'As far as making charitable contributions is concerned, that
isn't our job. The state must be present in those circumstances.'
Mr Toscani condemned conventional advertising as merely 'showing everything
that is fake . . . I think Benetton is doing something more useful than just
selling a product, though of course you have to do that too.' He added that
Benetton was very pleased with the mass of free publicity its controversial
advertising had attracted.
Mr Benetton also said that the company planned to move into other forms of
media, including magazine publishing and the production of 'educational
films'.

orders had been long awaited, followed confirmation last week of plans for
naval craft for amphibious operations, worth some Pounds 500m.
Both announcements appeared to be aimed at offsetting the negative publicity
caused by recent job losses in the defence industry, including jobs at
British Aerospace and naval shipyards.
BAe, with Westland the main beneficiary of the new orders, yesterday
announced preliminary 1991 figures showing a loss of Pounds 81m after
restructuring charges of Pounds 235m. This compared with a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 376m in 1990.
The largest of the orders announced in the Commons by Mr Alan Clark, defence
procurement minister, is for 13 two-seat trainer versions of BAe's Harrier
jump-jet, estimated to be worth more than Pounds 200m. A further five navy
T4 trainers will be upgraded.
BAe will also gain from an order to replace an estimated 100 Alarm missiles
which were rushed out to the Gulf a year ago and used against Iraqi radar
installations.
In addition, the government plans to convert the RAF's remaining five VC10
transport aircraft so that they can be used as tankers for in-flight
refuelling. The work is expected to be done at BAe's Filton site near
Bristol.
Westland, the Yeovil-based helicopter company, has meanwhile been promised
orders valued by the company at Pounds 70m to Pounds 75m. These include six
Sea King helicopters for RAF search-and-rescue duties, worth some Pounds
50m.
It will receive further work estimated at Pounds 20m to upgrade Royal Navy
Lynx helicopters.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Temperature rises over NHS reforms: The statistical war will
carry on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, today relaunches his party's
attack on the government's reforms of the National Health Service. He will
repeat the charge that the reforms are privatising health care. And he will
promise that a Labour government would sweep away the internal market at the
heart of the reforms.
Labour regards the NHS as its trump card: it has only to play it to win the
trick. That certainly has been the experience until now. The card has been
played to devastating effect in a series of by-elections, with the
Conservatives losing once-safe seats such as Monmouth under attack over
alleged threats to the NHS.
Every glitch in the implementation of the reforms has been gleefully
publicised by the opposition. With widespread mistrust of the government's
intentions, ministers' protestations that the NHS is safe in their hands
have tended to produce adverse results in the opinion polls.
Yet there is growing confidence among Conservatives that the health service
need not be a no-go area. Ministers feel that the reforms are beginning to
yield tangible benefits - and will claim as much in the election campaign.
Of course, it is far too soon to establish the effect of the reforms -
whether beneficial or damaging. Introduced only last April, they are being
gradually phased in to avoid undue disruption.
Nonetheless, Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, felt sufficiently
upbeat to call a press conference last month proclaiming that the first six
months had been an unmitigated success. He presented a glossy brochure
setting out the achievements:
A 3.7 per cent increase in patients treated in hospitals over the previous
year.
'Significant inroads' in reducing the time patients have to wait for
treatment, on target for meeting the pledge in the Patient's Charter to
eliminate waiting times of longer than two years by April 1.
Record levels of child immunisation - about 90 per cent of children are now
inoculated against diptheria, tetanus, polio, whooping cough and measles.
Other good news followed. A survey of eight of the new self-governing trust
hospitals showed that almost half the 900 patients who had visited them
before and after they became trusts thought that the service had improved.
And a study of GP fundholders, carried out by Professor Howard Glennerster
of the London School of Economics, found that fundholding had improved the
quality of service for patients.
Above all, the winter months have been largely free of reports of ward
closures and hospital budget problems for the first time in many years.
The best that Labour has been able to do by way of demonstrating that the
NHS is in crisis was a document leaked in January which showed that 86
hospitals were reporting current deficits of more than Pounds 100,000. Mr
Waldegrave was quick to point out that the total deficit was Pounds 15m,
less than 0.1 per cent of the NHS budget. And with only 29 hospitals
expected to be in the red by the end of the financial year, any deficits are
likely to be matched by surpluses elsewhere.
There is more than meets the eye in the good news stories. The absence of
ward closures, for example, can be attributed to a Pounds 200m slush fund
held back by the government to bail out importunate hospitals.
This is no more than prudent planning given the upheaval of the reforms. But
it hardly fits in with the idea of an internal market where purchasers and
producers must behave like rational profit-maximisers.
As for the drop in waiting lists of longer than a year, there is evidence
that this has been achieved at the expense of people who have been waiting
for less than a year - for whom waiting times have risen slightly.
And the 3.7 per cent increase in turnover of hospital patients is scarcely
more than the trend figure over the previous 10 years.
Moreover, the real problems may only be about to emerge. The internal market
is being phased in, with this year's provisions largely drawn up on a
'steady state' basis: the new arrangements largely mirror what was happening
in the year before the reforms were brought in. Steady state will give way
to a somewhat freer market from April 1, and it would be surprising if this
did not lead to some embarrassing problems for large hospitals.
At the very worst, however, the government can claim that no great harm has
been done by the introduction of the reforms. And there are some signs of
modest improvements.
Ministers can also point to the adoption of similar market-based reforms in
health care in countries such as the Netherlands and Germany. Even where the
private sector plays a more important role, the purchaser/provider split at
the heart of the internal market is being used to allocate scarce resources
and curb escalating costs.
And Labour's promises to abolish the internal market should be taken with a
pinch of salt. Today's announcement may include plans to scrap GP
fundholding and reincorporate the trust hospitals into the districts. But
the purchaser/provider split is likely to survive in some form, if only
because it is a principle that Labour has endorsed in other public services
such as local government.
Yet it may still be premature for the Conservatives to assume that the
health service reforms can be added to the litany of successes in their
election campaign. Opinion polls continue to show a high level of scepticism
about the government's commitment to the NHS. And Labour retains its
overwhelming advantage in the polls as the party viewed as best able to run
the NHS.
But as the parties scrabble to a fingertip lead over each other, the battle
of the NHS statistics looks set to run and run.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Battle for the soul: America's political landscape is
changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President George Bush has paid the price for complacency. The stunning
result in the New Hampshire primary election is first and foremost a protest
vote against his handling of the US economy; but it also signals a deep
misgiving about the direction of the country and Mr Bush's leadership.
For Mr Patrick Buchanan, the rightwing television commentator who captured
40 per cent of the Republican vote, the New Hampshire result is more than a
personal triumph: however controversial, his candidacy has been legitimised.
'And now on to the south,' he declared on Monday night in words which echoed
all the way to the White House.
Just six months ago, Mr Bush, the victor of the Gulf war, appeared
invincible. The president now faces a battle on two fronts, with both Mr
Buchanan and the Democratic candidates delivering the same message of
discontent.
Inevitably, these attacks will increase the impression that Mr Bush is
vulnerable, if not beatable, in the November general election.
Not since Mr Ronald Reagan ran within a percentage point of President Gerald
Ford, an unelected president, in 1976, has an incumbent Republican fared so
badly in New Hampshire, the first of the nation's primaries. Even if Mr
Buchanan has no serious chance of winning the Republican nomination, he has
the potential to split the Republican party in the run-up to November.
Mr Bush professes to have grasped the threat. 'I understand the message of
dissatisfaction,' he said hours after the polling booths closed. 'The
message tonight is that Americans are concerned about the future.'
If this is the case, it does not explain why Mr Bush fought such an inept
campaign in the granite state, which only four years ago handed him the
victory that launched his bid for the White House.
Mr Bush surely knew how vulnerable he was in the conservative state, where
the local economy has lurched from boom to bust during his three years in
office. Unemployment has tripled, bankruptcies have soared, banks have
stopped lending. New Hampshire is a metaphor for the 1980s, the decade of
speculation and over-building; but Mr Bush appeared oblivious until January
as the primary battle neared.
In two trips, Mr Bush appeared tentative, drawing small crowds at discreet
upper-class rallies. His desire to remain above the fray played into the
hands of Mr Buchanan who mocked 'King George' as an absentee president, out
of touch with ordinary voters.
Soon, a small army of volunteers, students joining forces with unemployed
hard-hats, mobilised in what became a genuine grass-roots campaign.
It was an astonishing effort. Mr Buchanan had never run for public office.
His television advertising was masterful. Mr Bush failed to respond to
accurate charges that he broke his 'no new taxes' pledge in the 1988
campaign - in retrospect a serious tactical error. Such mishaps revived
memories of the smugness which gripped Mr Bush's run for office in 1988,
when he was beaten into third place in the Iowa caucuses.
How then does the president intend to fight back?
From the viewpoint of the White House, the alarming conclusion must be that
Mr Bush has already delivered his best shots. These were unleashed in his
State of the Union address to Congress last month when he unveiled a
long-awaited growth package to revive the US economy.
The package promised a good deal more than it has delivered so far. Designed
primarily to insulate Mr Bush against charges of inaction, the proposals
included Dollars 50bn of defence cuts, relief for the real estate industry,
a reduction in the rate of capital gains tax to 15 per cent, a Dollars 500
tax allowance for families with children and a tax break for first-time home
buyers.
The sting came at the tail-end of the speech: unless Congress passed the
measures by a March 15 deadline, the president would mount a partisan
assault against the Democratic majority which would last until the November
election - an echo of President Harry Truman's successful tactic of running
against the 'do nothing Congress' in 1948.
At the time, it seemed like a brilliant political manoeuvre. But what plays
in Washington does not necessarily play in New Hampshire or elsewhere. Mr
Bush's delay in unveiling his proposals left him open to the charge that he
was a 'do nothing president'.
Moreover, Mr Bush's tardiness revealed a profound political weakness: his
inability, in the light of the Dollars 400bn budget deficit, to use a strong
fiscal stimulus to revive the US economy.
The president is a hostage of the ballooning deficit of the 1980s, in which
he, as vice-president, played a significant role. The truth is that Mr Bush
is saddled with policies dictated by the Federal Reserve, which was slow to
ease interest rates last year.
Like Mr Micawber, all he can do is to hope that something will turn up. He
must hope that lower interest rates will generate a recovery by late spring
or early summer which will cushion his re-election effort.
Mr Buchanan's challenge in New Hampshire has exposed the dangers of the
waiting game. It is bound to increase restiveness among congressional
Republicans pushing for bolder tax-cutting measures to revive the economy.
Mr Bush, who has made it clear he does not wish to amend the 1990 budget
agreement, will doubtless stand firm; but he needs to demonstrate that he is
not paralysed.
The president's response is likely to fall into three categories, none of
which is completely without risk.
First, he will take off the gloves and attack his opponent's
neo-isolationist, protectionist 'America First' message. The temptation may
be to hedge on trade issues - shelving, for example, consideration of the
Mexican free trade pact until after November; but the results in New
Hampshire suggest this would be unwise.
Although Mr Buchanan would disagree, the protest vote on the economy was
more compelling than the protectionist message. This was confirmed by the
performance of the two leading Democrats, former Senator Paul Tsongas, of
Massachusetts, and Governor Bill Clinton, of Arkansas, both of whom refused
to stoop to Japan-bashing.
Second, Mr Bush, helped by press scrutiny, will confront the more troubling
aspects of Mr Buchanan's past, notably his ambiguous remarks about Israel
and his defence of alleged Nazi war criminals. Even his conservative
supporters agree that Mr Buchanan has flirted with anti-Semitism.
Third, Mr Bush will cast himself once again as the victorious
commander-in-chief of Desert Storm. Mr Buchanan, like some Democrats,
opposed the Gulf war.
Yet Mr Buchanan has his own cards to play. He has already singled out five
key primaries to contest against Mr Bush. In Florida and Texas, he will play
up his opposition to immigration; in South Carolina and Georgia, he will
single out Mr Bush's support of a civil rights bill with congressional
Democratic majority, appealing, like Mr George Wallace in 1968, to
disaffected whites; in Michigan, where the car industry is being crushed by
Japanese competition, he will don the America First mantle.
Mr Ed Rollins, President Reagan's campaign manager in 1984, says the battle
has begun for the soul of the Republican party. Indeed, it is a battle to
preserve the coalition of suburban voters and ethnic blue-collar Democrats
who made up the Nixon-Reagan coalition which has triumphed in five of the
past six presidential elections.
This struggle may herald a realignment in the political landscape in the US.
Already, similar tremors are taking place within the Democratic party. These
were highlighted by the strong performance in New Hampshire by Governor
Clinton and Mr Tsongas, whose free-trade, tax-cutting centrism marks a break
with liberal orthodoxy which has dominated the party for the past 20 years.
The current crop of Democratic candidates is no longer beholden to organised
labour; nor to minorities or other liberal factions which have dominated the
contemporary presidential selection process. These candidates - Mr Clinton,
Mr Tsongas and Senator Robert Kerrey, of Nebraska - are wooing middle-class
voters with detailed economic plans and pledging a higher standard of living
for future generations.
By contrast with the Republican party, which looks back wistfully at
American greatness in the 1950s and the victory in the Cold War, the
Democrats are looking to the future. But they still need a candidate who can
bridge the stature-gap with Mr Bush, who has vowed to do everything
necessary to win re-election.

There is no longer any need to ask who is up and who is down in John Major's
cabinet. When John Smith yesterday launched Labour's full-scale Commons
assault on the government's handling of the economy, Major's response was to
field Michael Heseltine. No matter that the environment secretary has no
responsibility for economic policy.
The judgment of party managers was that the government needed a heavy hitter
to counter Smith's powerful rhetoric. Norman Lamont's face was saved by a
previous engagement with a Commons committee. There was no such consolation
for Peter Lilley. The trade and industry secretary was busy in Newcastle
giving a speech to businessmen, the sort of function which might easily have
been handed to a junior.
Heseltine duly turned in a virtuoso performance. No wonder some Tory MPs
have started to refer to Heseltine as the deputy prime minister.

Ex-Guinness chief Ernest Saunders is transforming himself from famous
defendant to respected pundit. Following appearances on television and
radio, Saunders has now made his debut in the Solicitors Journal, where he
argues that City-type offences which have resulted in no personal gain for
the alleged offender should be removed from the criminal process.
The fact is, he believes, that the public identifies fraud with stealing
large sums of money and pocketing the proceeds. 'Maybe the law should follow
this reality and find a new terminology for a category of regulatory offence
without personal gain and with appropriate penalties and a tribunal,' he
writes, somewhat inelegantly.
Saunders' appearance for the first time since his release from jail last
year, in apparent good health and spirits, has revived suggestions that the
appeal court's halving of his sentence, and his release after serving 10
months, resulted from him having feigned illness.
For the record, the medical evidence at his appeal was based on a brain-scan
which showed abnormalities, the appeal judges halved his sentence because
they thought it 'substantially too high' - adding that his illness did not
justify immediate release - and, like any other prisoner, he became eligible
for parole after serving a third of his sentence.

Gasps of astonishment from assembled and hard-bitten hacks greeted
Benetton's attempts yesterday in London to justify its latest foray into the
wilder Fellini-esque reaches of advertising bad taste.
Luciano Benetton, a founder of the Italian clothes firm, and his side-kick
Oliviero Toscani, in charge of Benetton's advertising campaigns, were
blithely oblivious to any and all suggestions that a photograph of a dying
Aids patient, another of a mafia murder victim, one of hapless Albanian
refugees, or yet another of a black
African guerrilla carrying a human femur, are pretty lousy ways to advertise
the merits of a Benetton T-shirt.
One black journalist asked what image the femur-photo was trying to depict -
cannibalism? 'If you interpret it that way, then it is so,' answered a
confident Toscani. His view of advertising is somewhat unusual; its purpose
for Benetton, he said, is to increase 'social awareness'.
Then again, what sort of social awareness was going to develop by showing a
picture of Albanians leaping into the sea in order to take refuge in Italy
last year - from whence the Italian government has since been trying very
hard to expel them? Sounds of spluttering from uncomfortable style gurus.

Young Peter van Cuylenberg might feel a bit miffed that he has been passed
over for the top job at Cable &amp; Wireless. But the rest of the team must have
realised that the next chief executive was going to be an outsider.
The old management at C&amp;W, like British Telecom's, was too inbred and in the
same way that Michael Hepher's arrival at BT was a 'good thing', the same
goes for James Ross. He has a multinational company background and after a
career at BP must know all about company politics. That said, Lord Young
remains an executive chairman, and Ross will have to prove that he is not
just there to take orders.
Meanwhile, BP's choice of Karen Horn, currently heading Bank One in
Cleveland, as a non-executive director - and its first female onto the board
 -is less surprising to those who remember that Bob Horton spent five years
in that town in the 1980s at the helm of Standard Oil. No doubt he rubbed
shoulders frequently with one of America's more successful businesswomen,
who was previously president of the Cleveland Fed.
Despite Horn's support for many of Cleveland's good causes, she is
remembered fondly at the bank for her talent for delegation when she was
called away to her other passion, which is riding.

Even the Tidy Britain Group is surprised at the findings of its latest
survey. London emerges as Europe's second cleanest city - after Berne, but
before Paris, Brussels, Rome and Madrid. How can this be?
Mostly, it seems, by omitting entirely the masters of civic cleanliness. 'We
are aware that Germany is a large and powerful country,' says the Wigan
Pier-based charity, 'but these projects have a long lead-time.' When the
survey was being planned 'Germany had not decided on its new capital'.
While London's ranking may still astound its residents, TBG only combed a
radial area of half a kilometre around respective parliaments. For London,
that means parts of Lambeth and Westminster, for which the study's sponsors,
MRS Environmental Services, just happens to have the cleaning contract.

THE PRINCE OF TIDES (15) Odeon Leicester Square
RAISE THE RED LANTERN Chelsea Cinema, Metro, Renoir
FATHER OF THE BRIDE (PG) Odeon Marble Arch
AFRAID OF THE DARK (18) Camden Plaza, Cannon Haymarket
UNE HISTOIRE INVENTE National Film Theatre
The Prince of Tides is a startling hybrid of a movie, a Freudian weepie in
which syrupy melodrama and sombre psychoanalysis uneasily coincide. Based on
Pat Conroy's bestselling novel, it tells the story of an emotionally
impacted teacher (Nick Nolte) who travels from his native South Carolina to
New York City to be with his twin sister after she attempts suicide. There,
he forms a strained alliance with his sister's shrink (Barbra Streisand, who
also directs) as they try to discover what caused the girl to slash her
wrists. It soon becomes clear that Nolte, whose marriage and career are on
the rocks, is just as badly in need of help as his sibling, sharing with her
an emotionally crippling upbringing.
The remainder of the film involves Streisand leading Nolte through the
swampy waters of his past, uncovering an abusive father, a neurotic mother,
a Vietnam vet brother who dies in a shoot-out with the police and,
ultimately, a Big Traumatic Event that is the key to everything. Along the
way, psychiatrist and patient fall in love, a relationship that deepens when
it becomes clear that the doctor suffers from some pretty hefty psychic
wounds herself. Together, they goad one another toward their respective
cures, each prodding the other into facing themselves while providing a
shoulder to cry on once the leap is made.
Despite tons of earnestness and some fine touches, Streisand is never really
able to balance the two very different currents at work in The Prince of
Tides, making for choppy waters all the way. The sweet romance of the love
affair seems distinctly at odds with the tension of the confessional
sequences - the viewer is left reeling when Nolte and Streisand go from a
combative therapy session to the corner table at a French restaurant without
even changing their clothes. Ultimately, something has to give. Not
surprisingly, it is the psychodrama, as the last half-hour of the film
abandons all pretence of being a carefully wrought study of the psyche's
dark side to become a feel-good flick full of hugging, rainbows and
reconciliation.
The movie's failure to sustain its early tone can be seen most clearly in
Nolte's performance, which is robust, ironic and tortured for most of the
film, yet evaporates after he gets his problems off his chest. It is
impossible to believe that the complex, fiery character he plays at first
can turn into a big, doughy palooka that easily. You feel cheated, as if the
film-makers were more interested in having a happy, healed-up ending than in
maintaining the story's credibility. Tellingly, the film's best performances
 -Blythe Danner as Nolte's fed-up wife and Kate Nelligan as his
social-climbing mother - occur when characters refuse to take the talking
cure, when they retain an aura of ambiguity and mystery. Streisand would
have done better to put less effort into trying to make her hero (and the
audience) feel so good. After all, what makes for good psychiatry does not
necessarily make for good drama.
Nobody tries to rescue the feelings of the main characters in Raise the Red
Lantern, a bleak and beautiful film from China that depicts how the
individual can be corrupted when living under a barbaric system. Set in the
1920s, it tells the story of Songlian (Gong Li), a 19-year-old student who
is forced to leave her university studies to marry a rich old man. To make
matters worse, her cold-hearted husband already has three wives, and
Songlian is forced to submit to the horrific household routine in which he
indicates his sleeping preferences for the night by lighting red lantern
outside the chosen wife's residence. Needless to say, this system makes for
pitched in-fighting among the women, conflict Songlian quickly becomes all
too adept at, leading to a tragic finale of death and madness.
Director Zhang Yimou has moulded this dark, simple tale into a hauntingly
resonant film. Starting slowly, he painstakingly accumulates mood and detail
to turn domestic drama into full-blown tragedy. Yimou has an exquisite sense
of menace, evoking it from such minutiae as the sound of a pair of shears as
they cut hair. His snowy, insulated household is claustrophobic and ripe for
tragedy, like some eastern Elsinore. The director is greatly aided by the
remarkable Gong Li, who perfectly embodies the torment of a spirited woman
forced to fight within the boundaries of a social system she knows will
ultimately crush her.
Marriage of a more benign sort is the subject in Father of the Bride, a
spiritless remake of the 1950 Vincente Minelli favourite. Steve Martin
reprises the Spencer Tracy role as a father who is forced to run a gamut of
emotions after learning that his only daughter wants to fly the nest. Martin
struggles heroically in the lead, his face a map of bemused anguish and
bittersweet pride as he tries to accept his daughter's impending marriage.
Unfortunately, he is let down by the remainder of the cast, particularly the
strangely detached Diane Keaton as his wife and the usually hilarious Martin
Short, who squanders his role as the wedding co-ordinator by trying too hard
for laughs. Director Charles Shyer is content to keep things as maudlin and
innocuous as possible, stringing together a series of tired jokes and
emotional cliches. The film's climactic sequence has all the poignancy and
originality of a very expensive home video. People who cry at weddings might
find something to like here, but for the rest of us it is like falling
face-first into the cake.
Mark Peploe's Afraid of the Dark is a potentially fascinating study of a
young boy's troubled mind that never really comes together. It tells the
story of Lucas (Ben Keyworth), an 11-year-old who appears to be playing
junior sleuth in order to protect his blind mother (Fanny Ardant) from a
slasher who has been preying on blind people in his neighbourhood. It
eventually becomes clear, however, that the boy's imagination is the
motivating force behind the drama, fuelled by his own anxieties at the
prospect of eye surgery.
You could see how this sort of dark psychodrama could have worked under the
direction of, say, Nick Roeg, but Peploe, a veteran screenwriter, is
insufficiently steady behind the camera to bring it off. His vision is too
fragmented, too personal to entice the viewer. As a result, the film is
torpid instead of moody, with surprisingly wooden performances by the
usually useful James Fox and Paul McGann. The only real tension comes from a
distinctly unpleasant suspicion that the boy might do injury to his baby
sister with a knitting-needle.
Another film ill served by its maker's idiosyncratic style is Andre
Forcier's Une Histoire Invente. Set in contemporary Montreal, it tells the
story of a mother (Louise Marleau) and daughter (Charlotte Laurier) engaged
in sexual competition for the attention of an ageing jazzman (Jean
Lapointe), known rather incredibly as 'the Don Juan of the trumpet'. All the
elements are in place for a witty farce - a potentially fruitful central
plot that pits an ageing siren against her vampish daughter, supported by a
host of crazy minor players, including a Bible-bashing bassist and a
sentimental cop who uses his handcuffs to bring lovers together.
But Forcier is never able to establish a comic tone to the piece, veering
wildly between gross caricature and stylised pathos, as well as trying to
maintain a series of running gags that usually stumble and occasionally
fall.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Stamp of authority
on election addresses - Candidates have discovered the value of direct mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next few weeks you can expect more newspapers, letters and
pamphlets to be pushed through your letter boxes than ever before.
The candidates in the general election have discovered junk mail, and this
year's batch is going to be far more copious and more sophisticated than in
any previous contest.
For one thing, it will be slickly and imaginatively produced, in some cases
laid out like a tabloid newspaper, with fun little stories to catch the
readers' attention.
It will also be accurately targeted, aiming to get maximum 'bang for the
buck'. For example, material regarding a local maternity home might be
addressed only to young couples. Greville Janner, Labour MP for Leicester
West addresses the Asian voters in his constituency in four different
languages - Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati and English - to make sure that the right
message is getting across.
And one Scottish MP aspires to send a personally-addressed letter to each of
the 5,000-6,000 self-professed Scottish Nationalist Party supporters in his
constituency.
The days when an MP's mind turned to direct marketing only once in an
electoral cycle - in order to exploit the free campaign mailshot to which
all candidates are entitled - are over.
There are a number of reasons for the rapid strides which have been made
since the last general election nearly five years ago.
First and possibly foremost is that typesetting and printing equipment
capable of producing material of quite high quality is increasingly
affordable.
According to Nigel Griffiths, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, an entire
package of printing equipment can be bought these days for less than Pounds
4,000.
Griffiths, one of Westminster's most diligent direct marketeers, undertakes
'a great deal' of target and mass mailing 'to show people I am not a blank
slate'.
Despite the additional expense, he says the Royal Mail has the edge over
hand delivery in cases where guaranteed speed of dispatch or blanket
constituency coverage is important.
Commercial advertisers discovered direct marketing a long time ago; now MPs
 -especially those with connections in the the public relations and media
fields - are realising how far they lag behind, and are starting to catch
up.
In 1990, advertising expenditure on direct mail rose by 29 per cent to
Pounds 979m, in a year when other forms of advertising were static.
The direct marketing industry has begun to sell itself to the political
parties. During the last two autumn conference seasons, it has mounted a
road-show, designed to demonstrate how the principles which underlie good
commercial direct marketing techniques can be applied to politics.
At these events, politicians and would-be candidates can become well-versed
in the intricacies of Royal Mail discounts and list brokers, from whom
directories of people with specified characteristics may be acquired.
'We explain how candidates should scientifically target their efforts by
going to the waverers,' says Jennifer Buhaenko, one of the road-show
organisers. 'Targeting is fundamental to good direct mailing.'
In terms of content, the advice is to address the voter 'as the person
sitting opposite you' and to engage their attention by focusing on 'what
people are saying on the doorstep'.
Effective use of the medium can be labour-intensive, Buhaenko admits. But,
she adds, general elections are a period when candidates can draw on the
assistance of 'lots of volunteers' for collating and delivery purposes.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Supergun' warnings given before
seizure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH intelligence received two separate warnings about the Iraqi
'supergun' project six months before British-made components for the gun
were seized, MPs heard yesterday.
Mr Stephan Kock, former non-executive director of the British defence group
Astra Holdings, told the Commons trade and industry committee that he had
notified the security services in September 1989.
He learned of contracts to supply propellants for the supergun during a
visit to PRB, the Belgian munitions company which Astra had recently
acquired. Mr Kock said he informed intelligence contacts by telephone on
September 22 and met them in London on October 11.
Mr Gerald James, then Astra's chairman, and Mr Christopher Gumbley, chief
executive, previously believed to have been the first to raise the alarm
about the supergun, were unaware of Mr Kock's actions. They met Ministry of
Defence officials, also believed to have links with the security services,
on October 26.
The MoD has written to the committee rejecting a request for the two
officials involved to give evidence, on the grounds that both have
'retired'.
A week after steel tubes intended to form part of the supergun were seized
at Teesport in April 1990 Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry
secretary, told parliament that the government only 'recently became aware
in general terms' of the Iraqi project.
Mr Kock was first named last year as a former consultant with Midland Bank's
secretive defence equipment financing department in a Financial Times
investigation which detailed links between some Midland executives and the
intelligence community.
While a career in the RAF, the special forces, and military intelligence in
Rhodesia had left him with extensive intelligence connections, Mr Kock said
yesterday that he had never worked as an MI6 officer.
He also denied any link between his work for Midland and his Astra role, and
allegations that he had known earlier of the PRB propellants orders and
visited Iraq to arrange financing by Midland.
He confirmed that he had fired a handgun into the air in an incident in 1990
near his home in Argyll. He denied, however, that his solicitor had said at
a subsequent court hearing that Mr Kock's defence work had left him with an
acute concern for his personal safety.
Earlier, Mr Christopher Gumbley talked publicly for the first time about a
meeting on March 22 1990 with Dr Gerald Bull, the Canadian scientist who
headed the supergun project, only hours before Dr Bull was shot by an
assassin.
Mr Gumbley, who had been arrested the previous week by Ministry of Defence
police on corruption charges, told MPs Dr Bull said he believed Mr Gumbley
was being 'set up' by the British government and PRB's former parent,
Societe Generale de Belgique, and offered to fund his defence.
'He said my arrest by the MoD police was an engineered manoeuvre, carried
out to discredit me and cause me to have to resign from Astra,' Mr Gumbley
said.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Sale of skill centres condemned by
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY that ceased trading soon after it took over four government
training centres was not fit to take over parts of the Civil Service, the
NUCPS Civil Service union told a cross-party committee of MPs yesterday.
In February 1990 the government paid Pounds 2.1m to TICC Skillcentres, which
took over four skill centres in Cumbria, East Lancashire, St Helens and
Ipswich. The company ceased trading in August last year. Only three of the
skill centres are likely to remain open, all with reduced provision.
Mr Tony Gallagher, NUCPS national officer, told the Commons employment
committee: 'We were concerned that TICC Skillcentres did not have a
background in training or any real knowledge of the sort of training that
skill centres deliver.
'We felt that they were characters that really were not worthy or fit people
to take over parts of the Civil Service.'
The union believes the government's choice of TICC was poor and said other
reputable companies had not been informed that the four skill centres were
available.
Mr Gallagher said TICC was headed by a Mr Lakin, whom he described as a
'Walter Mitty character' who claimed to have a friend at Deloitte Corporate
Finance, which handled the sale of the skill centres. Deloitte Corporate
Finance was part of Deloitte Haskins and Sells, the accountancy firm that
has since merged to become Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.
The union said that Mr Lakin went ahead with his bid after visiting the four
skill centres for an hour each over a weekend when none was open.
Union criticism of the sale surfaced after former civil servants were made
redundant when the skill centres went into liquidation last year.
It is understood that the government now feels the sale of the skill centres
to TICC was a mistake, but that at the time its vetting procedures passed
the company as suitable.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): AEU vote lessens likelihood of strikes
at Vauxhall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIKELIHOOD of strikes at Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary,
diminished yesterday after a vote against such measures by AEU engineering
union members at the Luton manufacturing and parts plants, Michael Smith
writes.
Although all unions at the company's other plant in Ellesmere Port,
Merseyside, voted to strike, it is unlikely that union leaders would
sanction stoppages which do not involve all workers at all sites.
Nonetheless, limited industrial action against a pay offer remains a
possibility. Virtually all unions at all three plants have voted for action
short of a strike.
The exception is the EETPU electricians' union at Luton, but it has
relatively few members there.
The ballots were ordered in protest against the company's offer of a
two-year pay deal in which basic pay would rise by 5 per cent in the first
year, starting last October. The second-year rise would be pegged to the
inflation rate and workers would also receive a one-off payment equivalent
to 0.5 per cent of pay.
Unions believe the offer, marginally less than that won by Ford workers, is
too low. They are also angry about the company's refusal to include a cut in
working hours in the package.
At Ellesmere Port, members of the TGWU general workers' union voted by 4-1
to strike and 57 per cent of AEU members were in favour.
Shop stewards at Ellesmere Port may press for one-day strikes at the plant
but it is unlikely that national union leaders would sanction such action.
One reason why Luton workers are less militant over the proposed deal than
their colleagues on Merseyside is that they are in line for further
increases of 5 per cent on top of the national pay deal.
The payments are linked to, and conditional on, acceptance of changes in
working practices and bargaining procedures. Ellesmere Port workers agreed
to similar changes last year and received 5 per cent rises then.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure seen from Commons business
 -Election timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will have no time to assess the impact of the Budget on
voters before it decides whether to opt for an April 9 election, the shadow
cabinet was told last night.
In a briefing paper on election timing, Mr Derek Foster, the Labour chief
whip, said that the tight schedule for Commons proceedings meant the
Opposition should refuse any backroom dealing to ease the pressure of
business on the government.
It was the weight of parliamentary business that meant Mr John Major, the
prime minister, would have only until the morning of March 12 - just two
days after the Budget - to make up his mind on whether to go to the polls on
April 9.
It was possible that the government would be forced to make MPs sit through
the weekend after the Budget to complete rushed business. Forcing MPs from
Tory marginals to stay in London was in Labour's interests, Mr Foster
concluded.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Electricity workers are offered 5.5%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 130,000 electricity workers have been offered a 5.5 per cent wage
rise in a move which is likely to fuel the pay expectations of other groups.
The offer, nearly 1.5 percentage points above the latest inflation figure,
is above the manufacturing norm, which most analysts say is below 4 per
cent.
The offer is being recommended by union leaders who are bargaining together
for the first time - previously there have been three separate negotiations.
The unions' recommendation means that this is the first time in several
years that the electricity pay talks have not resulted in threats of
industrial action.
The electricity industry is one of the largest sectors which still
negotiates national pay deals, and the 5.5 per cent offer is likely to be
cited by union negotiators in many other industries. It will be of
particular importance at British Gas, where negotiations for 27,000 manual
workers are in progress.
Most workers covered by the public-sector pay review bodies will receive
more - between 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent - but employers in the private
sector may dismiss such increases as irrelevant for comparison purposes.
One reason for the electricity employers' apparent desire to reach an early
settlement - and so offer a relatively high rise - is that this will be the
last year of national negotiations.
All 20 electricity companies have given notice that they intend to negotiate
local pay and conditions deals next year. That is likely to result in
protracted talks, and the employers wanted to clear the air for them and
avoid any sour relations that might have resulted from protracted
discussions this year.
Senior executives in the electricity industry have themselves been
criticised recently for accepting high pay rises.
The national talks cover all workers below management level in the 20
companies. Current salaries range from Pounds 6,178 for junior clerks to
Pounds 36,576 for senior administrative workers. Craft rates range from
Pounds 8,719 to Pounds 14,120.
Pay for most workers including manual employees will rise from April 1,
although engineers will receive their increases backdated to February 1.

THE Construction Industry Training Board will offer larger grants this year
to employers willing to take on or retain trainees.
The initiative includes a rise of nearly 20 per cent in grants to employers
who provide craft and technician training under the auspices of the Youth
Training scheme for first-year entrants to the industry.
Grants for employers whose trainees pass an approved skills test or gain one
of the new level three National Vocational Qualifications will rise by 40
per cent and 60 per cent respectively. The increased payments, which have to
be approved by the government, are part of a Pounds 45m CITB grants package
for 1992-93.
Course fees at the four CITB training centres have been frozen for 12
months.
There are about 8,700 YT trainees in the industry, compared with about
10,500 last summer.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Poll tax default summonses reach
11m - News in brief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A TOTAL of about 11m summonses for poll tax non-payment were issued between
April 1 1990 and the end of last year, Mr John Patten, Home Office minister,
said yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
His written answer came after Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government
spokesman, had highlighted the efforts of Labour councils to collect the
poll tax. In London's Lambeth and Islington more than 140,000 summonses had
been issued.
Mr Blunkett condemned the government for its delay in clearing up the
confusion about the admissibility of computer evidence in court and for
failing to abolish the minimum 20 per cent poll tax contribution by the
worst-off.
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said the 10 councils with
the worst poll tax collection rates were all Labour-controlled.
*****
UNION ATTACK: Sir Patrick Mayhew, the attorney-general, yesterday joined the
Tory attack on Labour's links with unions by highlighting the party's
'sinister' plans to reform union law.
Sir Patrick said Labour's plans for a special industrial relations court
called into question its trust in the 'fairness' of the judiciary. He also
said some proposals were so loosely framed that they would allow a return to
the mass picketing of the 1970s.
*****
SUNDAY TRADING: A fresh attempt to break the deadlock on Sunday trading
reform was made yesterday in a backbench bill which would allow limited
types of shops to open but set stiffer penalties for those which break the
law.
The bill, to be debated tomorrow, has some cross-party support, but stands
no chance of becoming law.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cash pledged for poorer EC nations
 -Economic and monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will pay to help the four poorest European Community countries
become members of a European economic and monetary union even if the UK
decides against joining Emu, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said
yesterday.
Mr Lamont told the Common's Treasury and Civil Service committee that the UK
had agreed under the Maastricht Treaty to contribute to a 'cohesion fund'
which would help the four countries upgrade their economies towards the
European average.
Even if the UK parliament decides against joining Emu towards the end of
this decade, Britain would be paying through the fund towards improving the
environment and transport infrastructure of countries where gross national
product per head was at or below 90 per cent of the EC average. Assuming
that the wealth rankings of EC countries stay unchanged until union,
Portugal, Greece, the Irish Republic and Spain could expect funds from
Britain to help them become part of Emu with its single currency and
European central bank.
The size of the fund has still to be negotiated among member states and the
chancellor insisted that the government would oppose 'huge transfers' of
resources as part of the programme. But his disclosure that the government
had accepted the principle of the cohesion fund while reserving the right
not to join Emu clearly surprised some members of the all-party committee.
Mr Lamont said that the government's decision on joining Emu would depend on
its view of the sustainability and size of the union.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour ready to flesh out tax and
spending plans - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party plans to give more details of its proposals for taxes and
spending before the general election expected on April 9, Mr John Smith,
shadow chancellor, said yesterday.
His comments came as senior ministers prepared to press Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, to reinforce the contrast between the Conservative and
Labour approaches to tax by cutting 1p off the basic rate in his March 10
Budget.
Speaking ahead of their traditional cabinet discussion of the scope for tax
changes, the ministers said that the Treasury's insistence on the need for
prudence had run up against a growing Tory consensus that tax cuts were an
essential springboard for the party's election campaign.
Speaking at a Westminster press conference, Mr Smith said that he would
defer some detailed tax decisions to his first Budget after Labour's
anticipated election victory.
He stressed that a plan to finance higher child benefit and pensions by
lifting the ceiling on National Insurance contributions and introducing a
50p top rate of income tax would remain a pivotal part of his party's
strategy.
But Mr Smith left open the question of whether the tax and National
Insurance increases might be phased in and where the new top rate would
begin to bite. He will unveil more details after the Budget, including how
Labour would reallocate funds committed by Mr Lamont to pay for the expected
cut in the basic rate of income tax at the Budget.
Senior members of the shadow cabinet last night sought to dismiss
suggestions that Mr Smith was under pressure to abandon or defer tax
increases because of the depth of the recession.
The shadow chancellor added that the net effect of his proposals had been
judged by independent economists as 'mildly reflationary'.
There is, however, concern among some Labour MPs that the Budget should be
followed by a simple package to show that most voters would not face higher
bills.
The Conservatives, meanwhile, plan to return to the offensive on taxation
later today by highlighting Labour's plans to impose National Insurance
contributions on the income from savings of more than Pounds 30,000.
Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, said last night that Mr Smith had
already been shown to be 'in full retreat'.

Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN COOK, shadow health secretary, said yesterday that a Labour
government would restore an integrated local health service.
He said in a preview of today's relaunch of the party's health policies that
Labour would develop a system in which hospitals could 'co-ordinate' their
activities rather than compete against one another for business. The new
regime would require managers who 'see things from a patient's perspective'.
Mr Cook told a gathering of political journalists that Labour would set up
local health councils with a 'clear obligation' to provide local services.
'We will be seeking to put the same stress on quality as this government has
on quantity,' he said.
Mr Cook pledged a more onerous burden of 'service sampling' on National
Health Service managers, who would be expected to assess the efficiency of
public transport and the quality of hospital meals.
He said he had been 'gobsmacked' at the recent increase in prescription
charges. Labour's private weekend polling had indicated the rise was the
second most important reason why voters were turning away from the Tories.
The government may authorise the spending of Pounds 1m for NHS patients to
be treated in private-sector hospitals in an to reduce waiting lists, it was
reported last night.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: A suburban sort of Toryism -
Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is a politician who has thrived on instinct. He prefers
personal intuition to philosophical blueprints. He is convinced that the
values which underpin his outlook match the aspirations of a broad swathe of
the electorate.
The prime minister is also a cautious man. He wants to hear every view
before reaching a decision. He needs to be sure that his decisions will
attract the widest possible support from colleagues.
Back in 1979 Mr Chris Patten - now Tory party chairman - likened an election
manifesto to a peace treaty which a political party had to negotiate with
itself. Under Mrs Margaret Thatcher they more often came to resemble
unilateral declarations of war.
But Mr Major's manifesto has been as painstakingly negotiated as any in
living memory. Mr Patten and Mrs Sarah Hogg - head of the prime minister's
policy unit - plan to complete the drafting later this week after a flurry
of meetings at Downing Street. But no member of the cabinet can claim he has
been left out of the exhaustive consultations to lay the foundations for the
final rhetorical flourishes.
Mr Major's combination of caution and instinct has proved a powerful one.
During the 1980s it allowed him to slip quietly to the front rank of
contenders for the Tory leadership. Since then it has ensured that he
remains far more popular than his party.
The proportion of voters who blame him for the economic recession is
minuscule. The number who would prefer him in Downing Street to Mr Neil
Kinnock is correspondingly large. It is hardly surprising that Mr Patten
will mount as presidential a campaign as is possible in Britain.
Presidential but not regal. His campaign tours will be qualitatively
different from those of his predecessor. Mrs Thatcher energised the party
faithful at rallies that came too close to stirring parallels with pre-war
Germany. Mr Major will be seen in the high street, in hospitals, mixing with
the people - his people. Photo-opportunities will be designed to show a
prime minister 'in touch' with the mood of the country.
His manifesto will echo the same theme. Mr Major's politics are those of the
hard-working nuclear family. They want to get on with their lives without
too much government interference. They are vexed by insensitive
bureaucracies. They seek security in home ownership and a savings account.
Their ambition is to pass on something to their children.
It is a suburban Toryism.
For the chattering classes that is a label to be applied disparagingly. Not
so for Mr Major. Those who know him well insist that others who still seek
to slot him into one or another grand Tory tradition are missing the point.
His view of the world owes everything to a childhood in the dull security of
Worcester Park, an unexpected tumble into tough adolescence in Brixton and a
single-minded climb back to adult prosperity in sedate East Anglia.
Personal experience constantly touches his politics. The clues are there in
his speeches as a backbench MP, his policy decisions as chief secretary to
the Treasury and chancellor, and his priorities as prime minister.
The officials who wondered why as chancellor he was so determined to double
the tax allowance for the blind would have found the answer in the failing
sight of his father. His enthusiasm for tax relief for working mothers has
been nurtured by the struggle faced by his sister. The broad themes were
there in his maiden speech to the Commons during the 1979 Budget debate -
the need to encourage saving, to reduce taxation, to allow people to pass on
their wealth between generations.
A prudent approach to life should be rewarded with security in old age and
something to pass on to the next generation. Inflation is an evil not merely
because it wrecks economic decision-making but because it threatens this
concept of social equilibrium.
It is not, though, an outlook that excludes a role for the state. For all
his commitment to privatisation, Mr Major has shown himself to be a fiscal
interventionist. Public spending overall must meet the test of prudence, but
the government does have a role as social engineer - providing more money
for teachers, tax incentives for small investors. He is easily (too easily
for the Treasury's liking) convinced that money can be well-spent.
But there is one decision that might not sit easily with this manifesto from
and about the everyday concerns of middle England - a Budget cut in the
basic rate of tax.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties battle over women
candidates - General election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR and the Liberal Democrats vied with each other yesterday over which
party would field the most women candidates at the general election.
Mrs Ray Michie, the only Liberal Democrat woman MP, announced that her party
would have 135 female candidates. At least three, apart from herself, are in
constituencies the party hopes to win.
However, with the main parties realising that the male domination of the
Commons is becoming unattractive to voters, Labour responded by releasing a
list of 134 female candidates.
Party officials hinted strongly that two or three more would be in place
before the election. Ms Jo Richardson, shadow minister for women, said
Labour would end up fielding most female candidates and was the only party
'that will put more women in the House of Commons - not only on the
backbenches but in the cabinet'.
The Conservatives have 61 female candidates. Of those, 16 are already MPs, a
few of whom are likely to lose their seats. But six others are candidates in
seats now held by male Tories and likely to be retained by the party.
The Liberal Democrat claims coincided with a Westminster rally of 70 of the
party's women candidates addressed by Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. He
said the votes of women may determine the outcome of the election.
Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats backed child care vouchers, which
could be used at private or state nurseries or at workplace creches, to
increase employment flexibility. The party's proposals for electoral reform
would mean more women in parliament.
Liberal Democrat womens' best chances at the election are in Rochdale, where
the Liberal Democrat MP is standing down, and the Tory marginals of Richmond
and Barnes, and Falmouth and Camborne.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Move for broader auditing of results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR ACCOUNTANTS are calling for companies' preliminary announcements,
which contain basic information on full-year results, to be scrutinised by
auditors.
The move comes after questions over the reliance placed by the financial
markets on figures which have not been verified by an external source.
A paper submitted to the auditing committee of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales argues that all quoted companies' auditors
should approve the preliminary announcements before they are released.
The case is likely to be submitted in the next few weeks to the Stock
Exchange, the Cadbury Committee on Corporate Governance and the Auditing
Practices Board, which sets guidelines for auditors.
Preliminary announcements, which are often issued several days or weeks
before the audited annual reports and accounts, very often have a
substantial effect on share prices. Publication of the report generally has
far less effect on the market.
The author of the report, Mr Graham Ward, vice-chairman of the committee and
a partner with Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, said: 'There is
something slightly anomalous when the primary document governing the
communication of results doesn't have particularly stringent rules governing
it.'
The Stock Exchange said there was little evidence of companies' preliminary
figures varying from those presented in the full accounts.
The accounting treatment of depreciation requires an overhaul to remove
inconsistencies, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
said yesterday. It argues that any attempt to deal with depreciation by the
Accounting Standards Board, which drafts new standards, must first address
underlying conceptual problems.
A discussion paper prepared by the financial reporting committee of the
institute calls for clarification of the purpose and meaning of the balance
sheet; the definition and recognition of elements within financial
statements; and how these elements should be measured.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Rowntree charity calls for local income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOCAL income tax to supplement council tax and give local government
greater autonomy was recommended yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, the charitable trust.
The report, by a team of former senior civil servants and local officials,
says a local income tax (LIT) would be 'by far the most suitable means of
restoring financial freedom to local authorities'.
The administrative requirements of such a tax could need some changes to
national income tax, the authors say.
The report - whose authors include Sir George Moseley, a former permanent
secretary at the Department of the Environment - suggests that local taxes
should cover about half of local revenue. 'The institution of LIT could be
accompanied by corresponding reductions in national taxes,' it says.
The report also says most other European countries have more than one type
of local tax.
The report deplores the 'climate of stress and mistrust' in relations
between central and local government, and recommends more interchange of
officials between the two levels.
Launching the paper, Sir Charles Carter, chairman of the foundation's
local-government committee, said: 'If good relations between local and
central government are to be restored, we need lasting solutions that
command support across the political divide'.

FT  20 FEB 92 / OFT urged to reopen Eurocopy inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, yesterday called
on the Office of Fair Trading to reopen its inquiry into Eurocopy, the
photocopier distribution company which was cleared last month of allegations
that it was unsuitable to hold consumer-credit licences. An investigation
into the sales practices of some Eurocopy subsidiaries began last year.
Mr Griffiths said he had written to the OFT after receiving many complaints
about the copier group in the past 10 days. He was speaking at the launch of
the Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts, a lobby group set up to combat
what it sees as misleading contracts and selling practices in the
photocopier leasing industry.
Mr Michael Armitage, Eurocopy finance director, suggested that the OFT's
decision had, in effect, turned Eurocopy into a model for the industry. He
said the group had taken steps to reform its sales practices before the OFT
inquiry.
However, the OFT is believed to have written to Eurocopy saying that its
decision should not be seen in such a light, that several assurances about
future practices had been received from Eurocopy and that the company must
report to the OFT regularly the level of complaints it receives from
customers.
Mr Griffiths said the campaign would lobby for legislation to change the
Consumer Credit Act, which covers only agreements worth less than Pounds
15,000, and protects individuals rather than companies.

FT  20 FEB 92 / House sales hopes fading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG RISE in housing demand experienced at the beginning of the year may
already be running out of steam, according to a survey of more than 100
estate agents published today.
The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors finds that the
government's attempt to stimulate the market with a moratorium until August
on stamp duty on purchases below Pounds 250,000, has increased inquiries
while generating few sales.
Mr Peter Miller, who oversees the institution's housing survey, said: 'More
government assistance is required if the government wishes to positively
lift the housing market out of the doldrums.'
The report says: 'Action taken to date has proved insufficient to give
buyers new confidence except in isolated cases where local factors serve to
buck the trend.'
Sales in Sunderland, for example, have been boosted by an announcement by
Nissan, the carmaker, that it plans to spend Pounds 200m and create 600 jobs
at its car plant there.
Agents are said in the report to find sales depressed in spite of a big rise
in the number of people seeking viewings of properties for sale. Mr Philip
Hiatt of Halifax Property Services in East Grinstead, West Sussex, says: 'A
lot of prospective purchasers are window-shopping.'
Many agents say sales are unlikely to pick up until after the general
election. This will disappoint ministers who may have hoped that increased
activity in the housing market would encourage greater optimism among voters
about recovery prospects for the general economy.
Housebuilders which reported a big increase in reservations last month will
also be concerned that agreed sales may not be completed - particularly if
people are still finding it difficult to sell their present homes.
CJ Easterbrook of Stroud, Gloucestershire, told the institution that every
eight to 10 viewings was producing only one sale, compared with a ratio of
four to one in a healthy market.
Mr Peter Veitch of Hadleigh in Birmingham said: 'Despite recent suggestions
in much of the media that there has been a dramatic change in market
conditions there is little evidence of this on the ground.
'It is true that the levels of inquiries and viewings have improved since
before Christmas, but that is from a base of next to nothing and it has yet
to be converted into sales.'
The institution says almost half the agents questioned last month told it
that prices had continued to fall during the previous three months.
Fifty-one per cent said prices had remained static and only 1 per cent that
they had risen.
AT LEAST 100,000 new council and housing-asociation homes will be needed
each year for the next 10 years, Mr Ted Watts, president of the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said yesterday.
He said housing associations and councils were building only 40,000 units a
year. Expansion of that programme could be financed by releasing local
authorities' receipts from council house sales.
Mr Watts called at the launch of an institution report on housing needs for
a national investment bank to provide loans for low-cost homes and for a
national agency to monitor housing associations.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Car chief confident of Budget stimulus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot Talbot, said yesterday he was
confident that next month's Budget would produce a 'significant' cut in the
10 per cent special car tax on new-car sales. He said the car market had
been 'artificially depressed' by high taxation.
Mr Whalen also called for a change in the balance of power between the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury, with the DTI 'playing a
more powerful role in government and being consulted before the Treasury or
other departments adopt measures which might damage the interests of
manufacturing industry.'
Mr Whalen is the second motor-industry leader within two days to criticise
some aspects of the government's policies towards the motor industry.
On Monday, Mr George Simpson, Rover Group chairman, was severely critical of
the UK economy's volatility compared with its main rivals. He called for a
national industrial strategy - involving close consultation between
government and industry - along the lines of Germany or Japan.
However, Mr Whalen defended the government's overall record on reducing
inflation and dismissed as 'prophets of gloom' critics sceptical about the
industry's ability to recover.
Quality, productivity and industrial relations had all improved, 'and I am
convinced that when we are out of the current recession huge opportunities
will appear for those companies able to respond quickly and effectively', he
said.
Peugeot Talbot's productivity had risen 30 per cent since 1988, 'and we will
improve further'.
Most in the motor trade and industry believe that higher value added tax -
not reclaimable by companies on car purchases - and company car taxes
introduced in last year's Budget have played a significant role in the steep
decline in sales of new cars.
Like Mr Simpson, Mr Whalen emphasised his opposition to direct government
intervention in industry. 'There is a world of difference between a DTI
which is influential in creating the right operating environment for
industry and one which seeks to interfere in detail in the management of our
undertakings,' he said.
A survey by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, found that there could
be a substantial cut in the use of company cars by businesses if an
uncertainty involving VAT was resolved.
More than 90 per cent of the largest responding companies - those running
fleets of 500 cars or more - said they would offer a cash alternative to
company cars if fears of large VAT penalties on that cash sum were removed.
The survey drew responses from 335 companies operating between them more
than 90,000 cars.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNERS are to seek more information from British Nuclear Fuels about the
radiological and environ-mental implications of its proposal for storage
facilities for nuclear waste at its Sellafield reprocessing plant in
Cumbria.
BNFL has offered Copeland Borough Council the company's first 'planning
gain' deal. 'Planning gain' occurs when a developer offers to fund projects
beneficial to the local community in return for permission to build.
BNFL has told the council that, if allowed to build the stores, it would
spend about Pounds 4m in West Cumbria on training, technological and
heritage developments intended to enhance the local economy.
Approval for one store was given on Tuesday at a meeting of the council.
BNFL said the store was needed to house radioactive material from an
encapsulated waste plant which is soon to become operational.
But the meeting decided an environmental statement from BNFL did not give
adequate information on the potential radiological effect on employees and
surrounding communities of proposals to build further stores. Permission was
sought for five stores for intermediate-level waste, three stores for boxed
decommissioned waste and one store for plutonium-contaminated material.
Permission to extend a waste packing plant and the store for used graphite
rods was also sought.
Council planners are to seek the advice of the Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate and the Pollution Inspectorate before a decision is taken.
The council's approval for one store means BNFL does not face any immediate
problems. Any long delay in approving other stores would cause difficulties,
and it says at least three further stores are needed before 2005.

FT  20 FEB 92 / London health care seen as costly and flawed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH PROVISION in London is relatively expensive, but the capital's
residents are denied essential elements of an adequate service, according to
research published yesterday by the King's Fund health policy analysis
centre.
The findings will be taken into account by the government's inquiry into
London's health provision which began work in October. Future health care,
including whether all the London teaching hospitals should be kept, will be
one of the first politically sensitive health decisions for the next
government.
The King's Fund research concludes that London uses far more resources than
would be justified purely on population grounds. That is largely because of
a decline in the number of people living in the capital over the past 50
years.
The decline has been considerably offset by patients from outside districts
using the inner-London teaching hospitals. The fund says, however, that this
'pattern of provision of expensive services to non-residents is unlikely to
be sustainable in the long term'.
The King's Fund says that Pounds 2.9bn is spent on hospital and community
health services in London. That is 20 per cent of the English budget for
those services, although Londoners represent only 15 per cent of the
population.
However, it says that Londoners frequently experience problems in gaining
access to health care and there is evidence that specialist services have
developed at the expense of local ones.
During the 1980s plans were advanced to disperse some specialised medical
services away from the capital, but the report says that 'a further
expansion and concentration of most specialist services has taken place in
inner London between 1980 and 1990'.
The overall health of people living in London is found to be no worse than
those in other parts of the country, although poor health is strongly linked
to areas of deprivation in the city.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Parties agree on technology plans
</HEADLINE>

   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR and Conservative parties put forward similar proposals yesterday
to 'bridge the gap between academia and industry' by creating a national
network of technology development centres.
The government scheme was announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education
secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary. They said that
it would start in the next academic year with a Pounds 2m pilot project
involving five partnerships between higher education institutions and
industrial research organisations.
Students would acquire degrees while working on industrial research.
The scheme would expand later into a network of 'centres of excellence in
particular technologies' - probably to be called Faraday Centres - which
would play a bridging role similar to the much-admired Fraunhofer Institutes
in Germany.
Labour's plan, announced by Mr Jeremy Bray, science spokesman, and Mr Lewis
Mooney, technology spokesman, calls for the creation of a national network
of Newton Institutes, each specialising in a branch of science or
engineering.
Although their proposed names honour different scientists, the Newton
Institutes and Faraday Centres seem virtually identical in conception. Both
are based on ideas from the Working Group on Innovation chaired by Sir John
Fairclough, chairman of the Centre for Exploitation of Science and
Technology in London.
Mr Neil Johnston of the centre said: 'It is encouraging that, whoever wins
the election, action will be taken to bridge the gap between higher
education and industry.'
Labour also proposed yesterday the creation of 'a new national focus for
science, in a permanent 'expo' of what science is today, how it is being
applied and where it is going'.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Injunctions sought over Lloyd's cash calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFRONTATION at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, moved closer
yesterday as solicitors took legal action on behalf of hundreds of Names
facing financial ruin. A court hearing may take place as early as next week.
Mr Michael Freeman, a solicitor, issued motions for a number of injunctions
to prevent Lloyd's drawing down from the funds that Names - individuals
whose personal assets back underwriting - must deposit with agents when they
join the insurance market.
More than 600 Names are backing the action and the injunctions applied for
are designed to serve as test cases. Lloyd's has pledged to 'strongly
resist' them.
The Names are members of syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson
Young, Feltrim and Devonshire that participated in 'spiral' reinsurance
business, in which syndicates reinsure each others' reinsurance exposures.
The injunctions are being sought on the grounds that cash calls by syndicate
managers are legally 'improper'.
Separately, more than 175 Names who were members of the syndicate 384
formerly managed by the Aragorn agency, met to press for compensation for
insurance losses.
The syndicate's losses from reinsurance business were nearly Pounds 11m.
Names want compensation for Pounds 6m of the losses which they allege were
brought about by the mistaken decision of Mr Graham Potter, 384's
underwriter, to underwrite 30.5 per cent of a risk when he had intended to
underwrite only 2.7 per cent.
In 1990 a Lloyd's disciplinary committee ordered Mr Potter to cease
underwriting at Lloyd's.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Food and drink sector leads rise of 0.4% in retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED food and drink sales led to a modest rise in high-street sales
last month, although the volume of sales in other sectors remained flat or
fell.
Figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office showed that
retail sales volumes in January rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent
compared with December last year, following a 0.9 per cent monthly decline
in December. The latest figure gives a year-on-year increase of 0.9 per
cent.
But against a background of weak sales at the end of last year, and the
inability of any retail sector to sustain an upturn in sales, the latest
monthly improvement was greeted cautiously.
Food sales rose by 3.5 per cent on the month, but the volume of clothing and
footwear sales fell by 0.9 per cent and household goods sales, which had
improved in December, fell by 4.3 per cent.
'People should not read too much into the figures,' said Mr Gerard Lyons,
chief economist at DKB International, the Japanese-owned bank. 'If the
pick-up in household goods in December had continued into January, then I
think we could have become more confident about prospects for a recovery.'
The British Retail Consortium said the good performance of the food and
drink sector could be attributed to promotional prices during the month and
some benefit from Sunday trading.
Overall the volume of sales in the three months to January also rose 0.4 per
cent compared with the previous quarter.
Sales in November to January by food retailers rose 0.2 per cent, compared
with the previous three months, while sales by mixed-retail businesses fell
0.6 per cent. The sales of non-food retailers rose 1 per cent in the quarter
compared with the previous three-month period.
The latest slight improvement follows a report by the Confederation of
British Industry earlier this week indicating an increase in sales volumes
in the distribution industry.
Some economists believe lower mortgage rates - combined with rises in real
disposable incomes for those in employment over the past year - will help
spending recover this year.
However, stock-building figures also released yesterday showed continuing
gloom.
Stocks held by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers fell by Pounds 969m
in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a Pounds 229m reduction in
the three months to September.
Manufacturers cut stocks by Pounds 767m following the previous quarter's
Pounds 145m reduction, while wholesalers' stocks were down Pounds 80m
compared with a previous quarterly fall of Pounds 167m. Retailers' stocks
fell Pounds 122m after an increase of Pounds 83m in the third quarter.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Generators poised to award contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen, the electricity generators, and Associated British Ports are soon
to announce the award of contracts to build Britain's largest coal import
terminal, National Power confirmed yesterday.
John Brown, the engineering company, is said to be a strong candidate for
one of the two main contracts to build the jetty and coal-handling
facilities.
The Pounds 150m project at Immingham on the Humber, expected to open in
1994, will be a blow to British Coal. The new terminal would allow the
generators to replace up to 10m tonnes of British coal with imports.
That would be in addition to to the capacity of other import terminals
planned by the generators. PowerGen announced last month that it was
spending Pounds 40m on a new 5m-tonne coal terminal in Liverpool, while
National Power is building a 5m-tonne terminal in Bristol as well as two
3m-tonne terminals at Hull and on the Tees.
National Power and PowerGen are each expected to have 5m tonnes of capacity
at Immingham.
That would allow each to handle about enough imported coal there to supply a
2000MW power station for a year. The terminal will be well-placed to supply
National Power's 4,000MW station at Drax, its 2,000MW station at Eggborough
and its 1,000MW West Barton unit, all of which are in North Yorkshire. It
would also be within easy reach of PowerGen's 2,000MW stations at
Ferrybridge, West Yorkshire, and Cottam, Nottinghamshire, as well as its
1,000MW unit at High Marnham, Nottinghamshire.
Immingham will be a deep-water port which can admit large ships, so the two
generators expect to save on the cost of transferring coal to smaller
vessels for landing.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Companies 'underrated' recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY companies thought the recession would be short-lived and have found it
necessary to review costs only in the last year, according to a survey by
KPMG Management Consulting.
The study, based on a survey of 50 large companies, showed that 83 per cent
have undertaken a one-off cost-reduction exercise in the past 12 months,
compared to 30 per cent in the previous year.
Mr Mike Morrow, a partner in KPMG Management Consulting, said the survey
identified seven points to successful cost reduction:
Strong and visible commitment from senior management.
Willingness to question and challenge structure, culture and methods.
Determination to see the project through.
Understanding of what happens at the operating level and what activities and
factors drive costs.
Participation of managers and a clear communication of why cuts are needed.
Understanding of business priorities to meet customer needs.
Decisive management action combined with a fair deal for all employees.
'Without these,' Mr Morrow said, 'companies risk a failure to achieve
objectives, doing more harm than good or costs simply creeping back up
again.'
The survey also found that three quarters of respondents wanted to create a
process of continual cost competitiveness and almost 80 per cent said all
areas of the company were the subject of the most recent cost-reduction
exercise.
Four out of five companies managed the cost-reduction exercise at board
level. More than 90 per cent cut jobs as a result and 74 per cent reduced
discretionary overheads.
Almost half said they achieved a 5 per cent to 10 per cent cost reduction
and 65 per cent expected to achieve their savings within the first 12
months.
Many companies underestimated the disruption to management while the
cost-reduction programme was being implemented, and nearly one in five
companies admitted costs had crept back up.

Mr John Flaherty, senior vice-president for technology at the US media group
CBS, told the FT Television of Tomorrow conference that the European
decision to adopt a step-by-step introduction of full HDTV would confuse the
consumer. The choice of an HDTV standard compatible with the existing system
would not optimise HDTV performance.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Role of voluntary sector stressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday published a plan to encourage the voluntary sector
to play an 'increasingly important part in society' in the 1990s, Alan Pike
writes.
In the plan, the government undertakes to establish an 'appropriate
framework for partnership' between the public sector, businesses and
voluntary organisations.
It is keen to encourage the voluntary sector to take over services and other
responsibilities traditionally provided by public authorities. Voluntary
organisations, however, are concerned that the government's enthusiasm for
the plan is not backed up by adequate financial support.
The Home Office says it would be 'unhealthy and damaging to its
independence' for the voluntary sector to depend too heavily on government
money. It sees the government's role as encouraging the development of a
climate favourable to support from other sources.
Among initiatives which the government says it will take to achieve this
climate will be a drive to encourage individuals to engage in voluntary
activity and become active in the community. It also intends to promote
improved management in the voluntary sector and identify ways of encouraging
employees to give more to charity through workplace-based payroll schemes.
The document says government departments will work in partnership with
businesses and voluntary organisations. Ministers will consider ways of
increasing the number of civil servants seconded to the voluntary sector.
Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, said the sector had a vital role. 'We have
a voluntary sector of a size, energy and range which is unique in Europe,
and the pace of change and development makes it one of the most dynamic and
exciting areas of activity within our national community.'

FT  20 FEB 92 / Tory setback as warning sounded on Scots support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH Conservative party suffered a new setback last night after a
recently resigned official warned that the national party needed a radical
change in its attitude to Scotland.
Mr Brian Townsend, the former head of information who resigned last week
after only seven months in the job, said the Tories' best hope was to
capture 30 per cent of the vote by 1996.
In a leaked memo to Lord Sanderson of Bowden, the chairman of the Scottish
Conservative party, Mr Townsend was reported to have said that only a
'constructive and conciliatory' approach would revive the party's fortunes
north of the border.
Also last night Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary and MP for Edinburgh
Pentlands, condemned Scottish nationalists as 'selfish, misguided and
shortsighted'. He said at an Institute of Petroleum dinner in London that
Scotland's ties with England were a natural partnership that had brought
benefit to Scots for more than 250 years, and warned that North Sea oil
would not last for ever.
Mr Rifkind, a former Scottish secretary, said nationalists' assumption that
North Sea revenues would be there for the asking were 'selfish, misguided
and incredibly shortsighted'.
His attack came as leading Scottish financial institutions expressed strong
misgivings about the possible effects on their business of a devolved
Scottish parliament of the kind proposed by Labour and the Liberal
Democrats.
According to a survey published yesterday almost all believe it would be of
no benefit to the financial sector, and most think it would be damaging.
However, a small minority thought a Scottish parliament would bring benefits
if it adopted fiscal and legal policies that helped Scottish business.
Their views are expressed anonymously in a survey of leading members of
Scottish Financial Enterprise, the trade association to which most members
of the Scottish financial community belong. It was carried out by Professor
Andrew Bain of Glasgow University, and did not address the possibility of
Scotland becoming independent.
The Scottish financial sector makes up 15 per cent of Scottish gross
domestic product and employs 187,000 people, nine times as many as
traditional industry.
Prof Bain said the institutions surveyed feared that:
They would face higher operating costs because of the taxes a Scottish
parliament might levy.
There would be resistance to Scottish financial products aroused by
resentment about devolution among customers in England.
Devolution would be seen as a step towards Scotland becoming independent,
which would frighten customers.
A Scottish parliament would be more leftwing.
Under Labour's proposal a Scottish parliament would be able to vary the rate
of income tax levied in Scotland. If this resulted in higher taxes the
financial institutions fear staff would ask for higher pay and it would be
more difficult to recruit top staff from outside Scotland.
The political effects of devolution aroused the most concern. Scottish
financial institutions feared that English people would say the Scots were
getting a better deal by having their own parliament while still receiving
subsidies from London.
The worst fear was that devolution would be seen in England as a staging
post to independence. This would particularly affect the life-assurance
sector, which receives 90 per cent of its new business from south of the
border.
The arguments reported by Prof Bain were not fully borne out by senior
figures in the Scottish financial establishment yesterday.
Mr Malcolm Murray, chief executive of Scottish Life and chairman of the
Associated Scottish Life Offices, said that the life assurance sector's main
fear was independence.
'There are not too many fears on devolution at this stage. If (a Scottish
parliament) went too far on taxation, it would be hard to get good staff.
But if anyone was pushing for independence it would cause problems.'
The Scottish National Party said the survey was ridiculous because it had
not asked about full independence and accused it of recyling old 'fears and
smears'.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Whitehall cool on EC 'green' plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT departments have expressed doubts about whether energy-saving
measures being proposed by Brussels will be sufficient to meet the European
Commission's objectives of reducing fuel consumption and lowering harmful
emissions.
Whitehall believes that the European Community would be wrong to go ahead
with its carbon-tax proposal unless other countries take similar action.
Instead, it calls for energy-conservation at a national level.
The UK's sceptical position is outlined in a joint report by the energy and
environment departments and the Treasury to the European Communities
committee of the House of Lords, which is holding hearings on energy today.
The report contains the first detailed assessment by the leading relevant UK
departments of EC energy and environmental measures. Although it stresses
that many of the EC proposals are still too vague to permit firm judgments
to be made, it underlines Whitehall's cautious approach to Brussels
initiatives.
The UK accepts that climate change poses a threat to the world, and will
require co-ordinated international action. But it argues that isolated
action by individual nations or regional groupings would not be effective in
combating harmful emissions.
Whitehall wants a framework convention that would commit all countries to
realistic and achievable strategies for limiting greenhouse gases.
The report also criticises the EC proposal to exempt energy-intensive
industries from the carbon tax in order to protect their international
competitiveness. It says that these exemptions would only create distortions
and throw the cost of adjustment on to energy consumers and other
industries.
The report also doubts whether the carbon tax could be 'neutralised', as
Brussels proposes, by redistributing the proceeds in the form of tax cuts or
benefits.
Britain's support for the carbon tax would be 'conditional on similar action
by other countries', the report says. It believes individual countries
should draw up their own programmes.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Lautro in first move to suspend a member
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAUTRO, the self-regulating body for the life-assurance industry, has for
the first time suspended a member.
The action against Oaklife Assurance, based in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire,
relates to its sales practices. The company has been ordered to stop selling
policies until the regulators are satisfied that Oaklife is able to comply
with the rules.
The company has 20 branches and sells policies through about 100 direct
sales agents. It has Pounds 800,000 of policies in force.
Lautro said Oaklife had breached a broad range of rules ranging from failure
to train staff properly to a failure to ensure that agents were urging
consumers to purchase the best possible policy for their needs.
Lautro recently announced a steep rise in complaints alleging sharp practice
by life-assurance sales agents to more than 4,000 in the 12 months to June
last year.
However, apart from cases where members have agreed or been ordered to make
restitution to customers, Lautro has rarely taken disciplinary action.
It has issued only four public reprimands to companies in the past two years
and has never expelled a member. In October the organisation's board
authorised it to fine members for breaches of rules relating to sales
practices but Lautro has yet to use those powers.
Last December the Department of Trade and Industry prohibited Oaklife from
selling policies for several weeks after the former chief executive and
three other top officials resigned, taking complaints about the company to
the DTI.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Tax help for Names expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs BACKING a campaign for more favourable tax treatment for Lloyd's Names
are confident that changes may happen in next year's Budget.
Names face losses of Pounds 1.3bn when the insurance market reports its
annual results in June. Lloyd's, with the Association of British Insurers,
which represents insurance companies, has been lobbying for changes to rules
governing the amount of profit Names can set aside in tax-free reserves. It
argues that the stringency of regulations puts the UK industry at a
disadvantage compared with competitors overseas.
Rules governing special reserves - which allow Names to pay the lower rate
of tax on annual provisions up to Pounds 7,000 - have remained unchanged for
35 years. Mr Ian Taylor, Tory MP for Esher, said yesterday that the Inland
Revenue had agreed to 'look more sympathetically at the need to provide
adequate reserves'.
A report by Davies Arnold Cooper, the solicitors, to be published later this
week, criticises the Revenue for a lack of sympathy over the need to build
up reserves for claims from liability policies, which sometimes emerge many
years after the policies are written.
Pressure on Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, increased yesterday when
Mr Max Madden, Labour MP for Bradford West, put down an early-day motion
questioning whether he was 'the right person to lead Lloyd's'.
The motion links Mr Coleridge with Mr Ian Posgate. 'In 1982,' it states, Mr
Coleridge 'was a member of Baby Syndicate No 973 which had only six members'
including 'four legendary Lloyd's fraudsters, Mr Raven, Mr Gratton-Bellen,
Mr Parry and Mr Ian 'Goldfinger' Posgate, all of whom were repelled (sic)
from Lloyd's'

FT  20 FEB 92 / Rumours fly as N America trade talks enter critical phase:
Officials are meeting to iron out differences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS on the North American free-trade agreement (Nafta) reach a critical
stage this week, as senior trade negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the US
meet in Dallas to bridge differences symbolised by the hundreds of brackets
containing individual positions in the current negotiating texts.
Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister, said in an interview that if
this week's Dallas talks went well, he 'would not be surprised if an
agreement was initialled in March'.
Nevertheless, he insisted the natural pace of negotiations would determine
the timing of the treaty, and not the other way round.
Mr Serra seemed unruffled by the possibility that a treaty will be postponed
until after the November US congressional and presidential elections.
'Is there a big deal between having a treaty in December rather than July?'
he asked, pointing out that a deal was designed to make North America more
competitive over decades, not months.
His acceptance of political realities is fortunate in view of the message
sent to US President George Bush in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. While
it is by no means certain that the protectionism espoused by Mr Pat Buchanan
won him a 40 per cent vote in the Republican primary, it is clear that
voters are very angry. The president will have to think hard about sending
to Congress a treaty which opponents will say would cost American jobs.
Under US law, Congress is notified after a treaty is initialled, and 90 days
after notification the heads of state sign the (possibly amended) agreement.
Assuming the treaty was initialled in mid-March, it would be signed in
mid-June. Congress has another 90 working days to vote on the signed treaty;
however, this could in effect take anything up to six months to go through,
stretching the process up to December 1992.
Whether the vote on the treaty was before or after the November elections
was, said Mr Serra, largely a question for US congressional Democrat leaders
and Mr Bush. The relevant congressmen could hole the treaty up in a
committee until after elections or, alternatively, release it early.
First the three sides have to initial a treaty, and important differences
remain.
US representatives insist that concessions must be made by the Mexicans  -
in financial services, investment, energy, and agriculture - if the talks
are to reach a successful conclusion this year. Mr Serra is adamant that,
among other concessions, the US should reform its anti-dumping laws with
respect to Mexico and Canada.
Unless a substantial number of these differences are hammered out in Dallas,
there would be little chance an initialled agreement would be reached by
mid-March, says a senior Mexican business executive. Mr Serra generally
agrees with this.
With the ministers and their working groups in seclusion, opponents of the
talks have been reduced to complaining about the secrecy and passing rumours
about the status of negotiations.
'The question must be asked: what exactly are the negotiators hiding from
the public?' said Mr Pharis Harvey, director of the opposition Mobilisation
on Development Trade, Labour and Environment. 'Despite the secrecy and the
rosy scenarios painted by officials involved in the negotiations, we do have
a clear indication that the impact of a Nafta would be, in fact, quite
dire.'
In the atmosphere of paranoia it was rumoured that congressmen were being
allowed to view the famed 'bracketed text' only by entering alone  - without
any materials to take notes - into a guarded, hermetically sealed chamber in
the capital. This was disputed by others on Capitol Hill, who insisted that
no one had been given access to the negotiating text.
An environmentalist closely monitoring the talks reported rumours that the
trade representatives were making swift progress.
There are really two texts, it is also being claimed. One is for
congressional eyes and the other - a 'ministerial text' - will only be
revealed at the right moment to stun opponents and speed through the
congressional approval process.
Mr Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington
and 'a long-time treaty watcher,' said no one had seen a text. 'I've never
seen anything like this. Usually we have a verbatim text by now or enough
leaks to create a verbatim text.'
One industry source said the secrecy was designed to keep the text free of
controversy in order to get the job done quickly. However, there was no sign
of movement to comply with the two con-ditions congressional Democrats say
must be met: an environmental agreement and a workers' adjustment package.
Mexican newspapers, by contrast, are filled daily with news on the
agreement. Mr Serra has addressed the Mexican Senate seven times on the
talks' progress, and has invited almost every important Mexican businessmen
to join in the nego-tiations.
The trouble is most independent Mexican newspapers seem to take it for
granted that the US will decide when the treaty is signed, if it ever is,
and what concessions the Mexicans can afford to make.
So for them, the relative openness of Mexican officials does not count for
much. Instead the US negotiators are treated with reverence, and Mrs Carla
Hills, US trade representative, accorded star status.

RECESSION and a series of high-profile trade disputes with the US have
heightened the Canadian public's unease over the creation of a North
American free-trade area (Nafta), Bernard Simon writes from Toronto.
However, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has so far shown no sign of bowing to
pressure to withdraw from trilateral talks with the US and Mexico. Canadian
government officials say the talks give Ottawa an opportunity to clarify and
improve the rules of origin in the 1989 US-Canada free-trade agreement
(FTA).
They also contend that current disagreements over Canadian lumber and
automotive exports to the US underline the importance of the dispute
settlement mechanism, which has been one of the most successful features of
the FTA and is likely to be adapted to the Nafta.

FT  20 FEB 92 / WWF warns of threat to ecosystems posed by global warming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANT and animal life in half the world's national parks and protected areas
is at risk due to global warming, according to a World Wide Fund for Nature
report, writes John Hunt, Environment Correspondent.
The report says there is conclusive evidence that glaciers are receding
because of climate change; rising sea levels are killing mangroves; and
coral reefs are dying in warmer oceans.
Ms Tessa Robertson, WWF pollution and energy officer, said: 'Such events are
ominous indicators of the effects of climate change. If we continue to emit
greenhouse gases at the current rate, more and more ecosystems and species
will be in grave danger.'
Mountainous areas, coastal wetlands, tundra and northern and temperate
forests were particularly threatened.
Animals most at risk included the walrus, polar bear and gazelles. More than
150 species of European alpine flower, including the edelweiss, could
decline or become extinct.
The report is being considered at the World Congress on National Parks and
Protected Areas being held in Caracas, Venezuela. The congress will report
to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June.
The findings are based on the effects of a 1 degree Centigrade rise in
global temperature by the year 2025 and 3 degrees Centigrade increase by the
end of the next century.
These levels have been predicted by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate
Change, if greenhouse gases are not reduced.
They could result in a severe reduction in the overall biological
productivity of the Arctic seas. Many of Britain's coastal reserves would
risk losing plants and animals as sea levels rose. Migratory routes and
breeding and feeding grounds for fish and birds were likely to be affected.
Snow and ice-covered parts of the European alpine landscape could be reduced
by a quarter by a temperature rise of 3.8 degrees Centigrade.
Land use would be radically altered and there would be major changes to
lowland rivers and forests with risk of flooding.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S national mint has never forged banknotes, watchdogs have
concluded after a lightning investigation. Mr Jorge Pinzon, chief ombudsman,
said yesterday that 'preliminary oral and documentary investigations'
reassured him that there was 'no evidence to support claims that the mint
printed fakes.'
Last year, the central bank detected two sets of perfectly printed 'twin'
banknotes with duplicate serial numbers. The twins were traced to the mint,
which blamed faulty printing equipment, an explanation the central bank
rejected.
More sceptical observers believe mint employees may have been moonlighting
as forgers to churn out additional, authentic-looking notes.
The affair surfaced again this week after a newspaper obtained central bank
letters complaining that if massive printing of fakes occurred, it would
destroy confidence in the money supply.
Mr Pinzon now says the twin notes were not released into circulation.
They were caught and shredded on the spot.
None the less, he promised to continue with his inquiries to establish how
the duplicates, one set worth Dollars 50, the other Dollars 10, came to be
printed and 'eliminate all doubts' over the quality of Argentina's money
supply.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday sent Mr Joseph Doherty back to the UK, ending a nine-year
legal battle by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) member to escape
deportation.
Mr Doherty was convicted in 1981 of murdering a British army captain during
an ambush in Northern Ireland, but escaped from prison in Belfast before
being sentenced in his absence.
He was arrested in 1983 in New York, but the Justice Department's attempt to
extradite him to the UK as a convicted criminal failed when a federal judge
ruled that his crime was a political offence.
Mr Doherty, who entered the US under an assumed name in 1982, at first
agreed to be deported to Ireland as an illegal alien.
After the UK signed an extradition treaty with the Republic of Ireland in
1987, however, he asked to have his deportation case reopened and requested
political asylum.
This battle ended when the Supreme Court ruled in December that Mr Doherty
was not entitled to a new asylum hearing.
American supporters of the IRA have fought hard for Mr Doherty, whose case
won the backing of more than 100 members of Congress, as well as Mayor David
Dinkins and Cardinal John O'Connor of New York.
Mr Doherty was flown to the UK by the US Air Force yesterday and was
expected to reach his Belfast prison late last night.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Greenspan sees benefits of economy-wide restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday delivered a
series of upbeat economic forecasts to Congress, in prepared testimony to
support his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins monetary report.
He predicted that the US economy would grow modestly this year. Unemployment
would soon begin declining and the inflation outlook was the best for a
generation.
The report sets unchanged targets for the main monetary aggregates - a sign
that the Fed is happy with the thrust of monetary policy.
Answering questions from Congressmen, Mr Greenspan sought to clarify the
reasons for Tuesday's announcement of reduced reserve requirements for
commercial banks. He said the Fed was cutting required reserves from 12 per
cent to 10 per cent of current account deposits in order to improve bank
profitability and stimulate new lending.
He said the requirement that banks hold non-interest bearing reserves with
the Fed amounted to a tax on banks. The move was part of the Fed's
continuing efforts to ease the 'credit crunch'.
Mr Greenspan based his forecasts of economic recovery in part on evidence
that restructuring of balance sheets by households and companies was well
advanced. As a result of lower interest rates, household debt service as a
percentage of disposable income had fallen in the past year, from about 19.5
per cent to 18.5 per cent.
With corporate bond rates close to their lowest levels in more than a
decade, many companies had retired a large volume of high-cost debt. A flood
of bond and equity issues had also reduced dependence on short-term debt
instruments.
The condition of financial institutions had also markedly improved. Wider
interest margins had boosted bank profits.
Mr Greenspan, however, noted that the balance sheet adjustments in train
were without parallel in the post-war period. It was thus 'extraordinarily
difficult' to judge how much of the necessary adjustment had been completed.
Mr Greenspan drew attention to the 'especially favourable' outlook for
inflation. The consumer price index was likely to rise by 3-3.5 per cent
between the fourth quarter of last year and the last quarter of 1992,
compared with a 3 per cent rise in 1991. But this understated the
improvement because consumer prices were held down last year by sharp
declines in energy prices.
'Our outlook envisages a significant improvement in the so-called core rate
of inflation.'
Mr Greenspan confirmed targets for monetary aggregates set tentatively last
July. The target for M2, the main measure of broad money, is for growth of
2.5-6.5 per cent, unchanged from last year.
Mr Greenspan said the new targets had been chosen 'against the backdrop of
anomalous monetary behaviour during the last two years.' M2 grew by 3.8 per
cent and 3.1 per cent in 1990 and 1991, in each case well below the centre
of the target range. Mr Greenspan said the shortfalls partly reflected
restructuring, which had led to reduced reliance on bank credit. He believed
this year's monetary targets were appropriate but warned of 'sizeable
uncertainties' that could force a reassessment.
Mr Greenspan said the Fed had recently focused mainly on the short-run
outlook. However, 'as we move forward, we cannot lose sight of the crucial
importance of the longer-run performance of the economy.'
In a veiled warning that interest rate increases would eventually be
necessary, he said the Fed's main contribution to growth would come through
promoting 'progress toward price stability'.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Figures signal better economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JUMP in US housing starts and better than expected inflation figures were
yesterday seen as further evidence that the US economic outlook is gradually
improving, writes Michael Prowse.
The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 5.5 per cent last month to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17m.
The increase was about twice as large as expected in financial markets and
probably reflected the impact of recent cuts in interest rates.
Starts last month were running about 38 per cent higher than in January last
year when building activity was subdued by the Gulf war.
However, last month's better housing figure reflected a possibly erratic
surge in building activity in the mid-west, where starts rose by about a
third. Starts declined slightly in other regions, including the north-east
and the west.
The increase in starts was also concentrated in apartment buildings, a
volatile sector. Starts for single family homes rose by less than 1 per
cent.
Figures from the Labour Department showed that consumer prices rose only 0.1
per cent last month, less than expected by analysts.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation fell to 2.6 per cent in January,
having declined steadily through last year.
The low increase in prices reflected falls in the indices for both food and
energy.
Excluding these elements, the 'core' consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent
last month and by 3.9 per cent in the year to January.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Algeria's new rulers turn to Gulf states for aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's visit to the Gulf by Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, Algeria's foreign
minister, to seek financial help represented a painful admission of weakness
for a country with a proud tradition of robust independence, nurtured in a
bloody revolutionary struggle against the French.
Algeria's rulers have always tended to look rather disdainfully upon the
Gulf sheikhs and it is a measure of their deep unease over the threat of
continuing Islamic-inspired unrest that they feel obliged to join others
among their destitute Arab brothers in seeking Gulf financial support.
The question in Arab capitals is whether Algeria's desperate need for
assistance to cure the economic causes of disaffection will produce shifts
in its regional stance, perhaps toward a closer identification with the
Egypt-Syria-Saudi Arabia axis that dominates Arab councils.
Algiers once prided itself on being the national liberation movement capital
of the world ' at one stage no fewer than 75 such movements were represented
' but western officials have no doubt penury will bring about changes.
'None of these things comes free,' said one official. 'Their actions are
likely to be more circumscribed. They are joining the real world.' Algerian
officials resist this assessment. They prefer instead to emphasise the risks
for the region of a destabilised Algeria in place of one that has
traditionally performed a balancing role between militants and moderates.
'Because of our internal problems, maybe we cannot have the same stabilising
role,' said an official. 'If Arab countries want us to keep playing the same
role we need assistance.' Such pronouncements, casting Algeria in the
unaccustomed role of supplicant would have been unthinkable during the era
of President Houari Boumediene in the 1970s when Algeria was a Third World
leader.
Among the fruits of this activism was Algeria's election in 1974 to the
presidency of the United Nations General Assembly's eventful 29th session
during which Mr Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation leader,
was given the floor to deliver his 'gun and olive branch' speech, the
resolution equating Zionism with racism was passed and South Africa was
suspended.
These heady 'achievements'', tended, however, to obscure Algeria's real
problems of high population growth, an economy almost totally dependent on
hydrocarbons, growing disaffection among the young, a crumbling education
system, inadequate housing; all of which coincided with the growth of an
Islamic movement, part-funded abroad.
It is not the smallest of ironies that Mr Brahimi's first port of call in
the Gulf this week was Saudi Arabia. It was the Saudis who discreetly but
effectively helped the Islamic Salvation Front get established until FIS
support for Iraq in the Gulf crisis led to a suspension of assistance.
Algeria itself adopted a fairly ambivalent position in the crisis, neither
supporting Iraq, nor giving overt backing to the moderate Arab axis. It
sporadically sought to use its influence behind the scenes.
Severe tension between Algeria and Iran ' scarcely a day passes without
bitter criticism of Tehran in the Algerian press ' is another sign of the
distance the regime has travelled from its militant roots.
With the exception of Syria, Algeria, among Arab states, had maintained a
relatively cordial relationship with the Ayatollahs. However, one of the
points Mr Brahimi seems likely to make to his Gulf hosts is that Iran poses
a renewed threat to all Arab states.
Algeria's economic crisis must also be troubling Polisario guerrillas,
engaged in a test of wills with Morocco for control of the Western Sahara,
and the PLO which has always been able to rely on Algeria. Another prop is
perhaps in the process of being removed from the tenuous base of Mr Arafat.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Japanese earn highest motor industry pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN, the world's biggest vehicle producer, emerged for the first time last
year with the highest gross hourly wage rates in the world motor industry,
says the German motor industry federation (VDA).
Motor industry wage costs were significantly higher in Sweden and in
Germany, however, thanks to their much heavier social payroll costs, such as
payroll tax or national insurance.
By contrast France became the country with the lowest total hourly wage
costs in the developed world's motor industry for the first time, narrowly
ahead of the UK.
In the five years from 1986 to 1990 the UK had the lowest motor industry
wage costs (gross wages plus social costs such as payroll tax) in the
developed world, but the VDA study shows that it was matched last year by
France.
Japan and the US, the world's largest vehicle producing countries, ranked
mid-way between the European producers for total motor industry wage costs
at DM33.87 and DM35.05 per hour respectively.
Japan, which was second only to Spain at the beginning of the 1980s as a low
wage cost country among auto producers, has suffered an erosion of its
position in the last decade.
According to the VDA Japan had the highest gross hourly wages last year in
the whole of the world motor industry at DM26.05 per hour narrowly ahead of
Germany at DM25.87.
Japan's total wage cost competitiveness is helped, however, by much lower
social costs which at DM7.82 per hour are close to the UK level of DM7.18
per hour, which was the lowest in the ten-country comparison.
The VDA study shows that gross hourly motor industry wages are higher in the
UK than in several other European countries, namely the Netherlands,
Belgium, Italy, France and Spain.
The UK vies with France for the lowest total wage costs, however, thanks to
the very modest level of additional payroll levies.
Spain, which consistently had the lowest motor industry wage costs among the
industrial countries in the first half of the 1980s, has progressively lost
its competitive edge to the UK and France since the mid-1980s.
Spain was the main recipient in Europe of big inward investment projects by
world car makers at the end of the 1970s and in the early 1980s, but its
role was taken over by the UK in the late 1980s with a wave of investments
by Japanese car makers.
The biggest recent investments in new capacity in Europe (by Volkswagen,
General Motors and VW/Ford in a joint venture) have gone to former east
Germany and to Portugal.
German car makers are expressing grave concern about domestic wage cost
levels. Mrs Erika Emmerich, president of the VDA, warned recently that the
German motor industry's strengths in quality and technology were no longer
sufficient to compensate for the disadvantages of producing in Germany.
'However we look at it, our production costs are too high. The wage costs of
the German auto industry are almost a third higher than the Japanese, they
are two-thirds higher than the British and the French and 50 per cent higher
than the Spanish.
'High wage costs and - by international comparison - short working hours
significantly reduce the competitiveness of the German industry.'
Mrs Emmerich warned that some German companies, particularly components
suppliers, had already faced the stark choice of either moving production
abroad to lower-cost countries or of going out of business.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Israel launches new attacks in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL launched renewed air and artillery attacks on targets in southern
Lebanon yesterday after an Israeli town was hit by rockets fired across the
border by Lebanese militiamen seeking revenge for the killing of Sheikh
Abbas Musawi, leader of the Shi'ite Moslem fundamentalist organisation
Hizbollah.
The fighting, the most intense in the area for years, went on unabated for
the third day following the death of Mr Musawi in a rocket strike by Israeli
helicopters in south Lebanon on Sunday.
It prompted Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to warn that Israel was ready to
use 'all our might' to stop the rocket attacks on its territory, although he
denied suggestions that he was planning a large-scale action similar to the
1982 invasion of Lebanon.
He was speaking after visiting a bus station in an Israeli border town hit
by Katyusha rockets yesterday, the most dramatic Hizbollah strike to date.
No one was injured, but 13 people were treated for shock. Residents of
Kiryat Shemona and other border towns have spent much of the time since
Sunday in bomb shelters.
Later, Israel fired rockets from US-supplied Apache assault helicopters at
an alleged Hizbollah base in the village of Jibsheet. No one was reported
hurt.
Iranian-backed Hizbollah, which normally confines its actions to attacks on
Israeli forces and their local allies occupying a strip of Lebanese
territory, has fired dozens of Katyushas across the Lebanese-Israeli border
since Mr Musawi was killed.
'They have a lot of Katyushas, but we will overcome them and disarm them,'
Mr Shamir said.
Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister who as defence minister led the 1982
invasion, was reported by Israel Army radio as calling for a northward
extension of the 'security zone' controlled by Israeli forces to push the
Hizbollah rockets out of range of the border.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Attempt to rescue Hong Kong BCCI collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong subsidiary of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International is
almost certain to go into liquidation after the collapse of negotiations
between the receiver and a potential buyer.
Mr Noel Gleeson, the receiver, said his talks with the Hong Kong Chinese
Bank - a subsidiary of the Indonesian-owned Lippo Group leading the buy-out
team - could go no further after the discovery of previously unrecorded
claims of more than HKDollars 2bn (Dollars 145m) against Bank of Credit and
Commerce Hong Kong (BCCHK).
Most of these claims came to light in recent weeks from liquidators of BCCI
operations in Britain, the US, Japan, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands.
Although Mr Gleeson doubted if these claims would succeed in court the fact
of their registration meant they had to be considered when assessing the
financial health of BCCHK.
An undertaking by the Abu Dhabi owners of BCCI to guarantee Dollars 25m
(Pounds 14.2m) of the unrecorded claims - having previously indicated they
would underwrite all those claims - was insufficient to allow Hong Kong
Chinese Bank to continue.
Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary, said the balance had
now shifted in favour of liquidating the bank. Mr Gleeson will appear before
the Supreme Court on March 2 when he expects the court to order liquidation.
The BCCHK affair has reflected poorly on the Hong Kong government. On July
5, the day BCCI was shut down by co-ordinated action of bank regulators
around the world, Mr David Carse, the colony's banking commissioner, issued
a statement reassuring depositors that the bank was 'sound and viable'.
Mr Carse closed the bank three days later. It has since emerged that BCCHK
has a negative net worth, although the scale of this has not been revealed.
Depositors, who feel they were misled by the government, have called for an
independent inquiry.
Hong Kong Chinese Bank said that while many of the technical problems of
buying BCCHK had been resolved the emergence of the latest substantial
claims had meant negotiations could not go further. Hong Kong Chinese Bank's
takeover plans were last week dealt a blow when China Resources, a large
diversified company owned by China's ministry of foreign economic relations
and trade, withdrew from its consortium.
Mr Gleeson said BCCHK was one of the best and most honestly run arms of the
BCCI empire. It had more than HKDollars 4bn cash on deposit. However, he
declined to say whether his investigations had uncovered any wrongdoing.
Depositors of BCCHK have received a pay-out equal to 25 per cent of their
deposits, up to a limit of HKDollars 500,000. Mr Gleeson said he expected a
pay-out of a further 15 per cent this year, and eventually depositors could
expect 70 to 75 per cent of their money back.

FT  20 FEB 92 / S African voters reject ruling party in key by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   POTCHEFSTROOM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African reform process suffered a setback yesterday when the
ruling National party was thrashed by the right-wing Conservative party (CP)
in a key by-election, billed as a referendum of white opinion on the current
constitutional changes, write Philip Gawith in Potchefstroom and agencies.
Mr Andries Beyers, the Conservative candidate, easily defeated his National
party opponent, Mr Theuns Kruger, by 2,140 votes out of more than 17,000
cast in the whites-only election in the Potchefstroom constituency of rural
western Transvaal province. More than 75 per cent of those eligible voted.
The National party won the seat by 1,583 votes in 1989. The by-election was
required after the incumbent, Mr Louis le Grange, died last year.
Although the defeat will have weakened the National party by casting doubt
on the extent to which it speaks for Afrikaners, it is unlikely to halt the
reform process.
It will have reduced the chances of drawing the Conservative party into the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the constitutional
negotiating forum which it has so far refused to participate in.
Dr Andries Treurnicht, Conservative party leader, said last night the
message to the government was that the white nation demanded a general
election.
Addressing thousands of jubilant supporters, Dr Treurnicht said the National
party did not represent the white nation at Codesa and could not continue on
a path for which it did not have a mandate. The message for whites was they
should not despair: 'The future is ours.'
The defeat lends weight to the view increasingly heard in recent weeks that
the government has not done enough to explain to the white electorate
developments in the negotiating process.
This view was endorsed by Mr Kruger.
Ironically, although the Potchefstroom defeat has weakened the standing of
the National party within the white community, it may yet gain in the
context of national negotiations.
It will be able to argue at Codesa that the African National Congress and
allies should not try to drive too hard a bargain for fear of accelerating
the slide of white support to the right.
Mr Saki Macozoma, an ANC spokesman, acknowledged yesterday that his
organisation was concerned at the possible loss of support for their main
negotiating partner.
Before voting, the government mounted a big effort to retain the seat, which
it has held since 1948. Mr de Klerk and key government ministers made
campaign appearances and appealed for support.
However, it did not help its chances with the bizarre timing this week of an
announcement of big changes to the white school system.
These mean many white parents will have to pay twice as much for their
children's education.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Australians find monarchy less than majestic: The growing
republican movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S nascent republican movement was given a boost this week when
fewer than 400 flag-waving royalists turned out to welcome the Queen at the
beginning of her 12th official visit to Sydney.
The modest turnout was in stark contrast to the scenes of adulation which
greeted the Queen on her first visit in the mid-1950s, when 1m people are
estimated to have lined the city's streets.
The low-key welcome reflects the growing influence of non-Anglo-Saxon
immigrants, as well as increasing scepticism about the value of Australia's
remaining links with Britain, the former colonial power.
However, the evidence is that while republicans are gaining confidence,
falling support for the monarchy is not being translated to widespread
support for abolition.
If these trends continue, it could set the scene for a lengthy conflict on
constitutional issues which would divide Australians at a time when they
face difficult economic and social problems. Historically, republicanism has
attracted many prominent Australians, including influential writers such as
Henry Lawson, the 19th century poet, and Professor Donald Horne, author of
The Lucky Country, an ironically titled catalogue of Australian shortcomings
which appeared in 1964.
The movement made little political headway until last year, when the
governing Labor party said it favoured the establishment of a republic by
2001, the centenary of the federation of Australia's six former British
colonies. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, has since added to the
republican tide by supporting the removal of Britain's Union flag from the
upper left quarter of the Australian flag - another symbol derided by many
as a hangover of colonialism.
Abolition of the monarchy would complete Australia's gradual drift away from
Britain, which began with federation and has since led to the abolition of
formal links such as judicial appeals to the British courts and the award of
imperial honours.
In recent years Australia has also replaced the British national anthem with
its own Advance Australia Fair, and formally separated the thrones of
Britain and Australia, although the sovereign remains the same person.
However, the Australian Republican Movement, of which Mr Horne is deputy
chairman, claims Australia is demeaned by the continued existence of a head
of state who lives 12,000 miles away and is also sovereign of a foreign
country.
Sir Richard Kirby, chairman of the Ausflag campaigning organisation, puts
forward similar arguments for the removal of the Union symbol from the
Australian flag, although he says a redesigned national flag need not lead
to a republic. Ausflag also claims that the existing flag confuses
Australia's Asian trading partners by casting doubt on Australian
sovereignty.
The anecdotal evidence of newspaper letters columns and radio phone-in
programmes indicates that many of these ideas have taken root, especially
among Labor voters. They are also beginning to prompt republican
demonstrations by a minority of public figures. For example, five Labor MPs
have said they will not attend social functions during the Queen's visit,
and a few will also boycott the ceremonial opening of the New South Wales
parliament.
However, both republicanism and changes to the flag are strongly opposed by
conservative organisations such as the Returned Services League, a veterans'
support group which complains loudly that republicans are traitors to
Australia's military dead.
The proposed changes are opposed equally strongly, if less stridently, by
the conservative Liberal/National party coalition, which is widely expected
to win the next federal general election, due by mid-1993.
Opinion polls suggest that the conservatives are correct in claiming to
represent the majority. A recent survey by the Australian National
University (ANU) found 58 per cent backing for the monarchy, down from 64
per cent in 1984. Only 22 per cent supported a republic, up from 19 per
cent.
There are also doubts about Labor's commitment to republicanism, and its
ability to deliver. The resolution passed by the party's biannual conference
in June contained no proposals for legislation, and is not binding on the
government, which has taken no steps to implement it.
Even if it wished to do so, such a major constitutional change could be
achieved only with the consent of the Upper House of the federal parliament,
which Labor does not control. The change would also require approval in a
referendum by a majority of voters in a majority of states - a
constitutional formula which has previously proved an insurmountable barrier
to proposed amendments lacking the support of major political parties.
Before reaching that stage, Labor would have to develop detailed proposals
to replace the present system, which could prove difficult and divisive. No
thought has yet been given, for example, to the relative merits of executive
and ceremonial presidencies, or to whether the president should be directly
elected.
Nor has Labor considered how to counter the argument that Australia is
already a republic in all but name because the Queen's powers are in
practice exercised by the governor-general, who is appointed for a fixed
term on the advice of the federal government.
Dr Clive Bean, the academic who compiled the ANU's recent survey on public
attitudes, says that in the face of these difficulties, the medium-term
prospects for Australia's republicans are bleak unless a more decisive shift
of opinion occurs.
'The Labor party will need to launch a very strong public education campaign
promoting what would after all be a major constitutional change if it is to
have any hope at all of succeeding with a referendum,' he says.
