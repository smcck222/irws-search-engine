FT  14 FEB 92 / SFO may get civil action powers: Government opens door to
fundamental review of prosecution of fraud cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT would consider any request from the Serious Fraud Office to
allow it to opt for civil instead of criminal proceedings in prosecuting
large fraud cases, Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, said
yesterday.
He also agreed to 'look at' any SFO request for greater investigative
powers, but said that in previous discussions Mrs Barbara Mills, the
out-going SFO director, had expressed satisfaction with the powers at her
disposal.
It was more important to examine how effectively existing powers were used,
he suggested.
Mr Redwood's comments, in an interview with the Financial Times, come at the
culmination of the Barlow Clowes, Blue Arrow and Guinness fraud trials. They
leave open the possibility of a fundamental review of the way fraud cases
are handled in the UK.
In civil cases, prosecuting authorities need to establish their case only on
a 'balance of probabilities', rather than the more stringent 'beyond
reasonable doubt' criterion required in criminal cases.
Mr Redwood's remarks followed a statement from the Labour party that it
would consider allowing authorities to choose between civil and criminal
proceedings.
Mrs Mills is known to hold that fraud should remain a criminal offence and
continue to be prosecuted in criminal courts. She is thought unlikely to
request that the SFO be given civil powers. That position could change under
her as yet unnamed successor.
Mr Redwood also revealed he was conducting a review of 'styles of
regulation' in the City and was 'about to talk' to the relevant bodies about
how regulation could be improved.
Regulators needed to be more 'pro-active', he argued, focusing on areas that
were giving cause for concern.
One subject understood to be under review is the sharing of information
between City regulators and the DTI. Within the City, there has been concern
that information gathered by the DTI's companies investigation division has
not been shared with City regulators. One regulator commented: 'We have a
close relationship with the Takeover Panel and the Bank of England, so it
would follow naturally if there was a rather closer relationship with those
in government departments responsible for prosecuting corporate
malpractice.'
Mr Redwood disputed Labour's claim that there was duplication of effort
among bodies with fraud-related responsibilities. 'If the SFO goes in, we do
not then send in DTI inspectors.' He said Labour encouraged the wasting of
resources by demanding a parallel DTI investigation to every SFO case being
pursued.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Former Bestwood chairman accused of theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY COLE, former chair-man of Bestwood, the industrial and property
holding company, appeared at City of London Magistrates' Court yesterday
charged with false accounting, perjury and thefts totalling more than Pounds
1.1m.
Mr Cole was arrested on Tuesday by City of London Police working in
conjunction with the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO has been investigating
the affairs of Bestwood since 1990, when the case was referred to it by
inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry.
The DTI began investigating the company and Atlanta Fund Managers, one of
its former subsidiaries, in June 1989.
Mr Cole faces 13 charges, including five of theft. One charge involves
Pounds 212,305 allegedly taken from Atlanta Fund Managers, and routed to the
Swiss account of a Jersey company, Mamro Ltd, with which he was connected.
Two allege the theft of Pounds 300,000 from the trustees of the pension fund
of British Drilling and Freezing, another Bestwood subsidiary, and two
allege the theft of Pounds 602,500 from Bestwood itself.
He is also charged with stealing share certificates for 450,000 shares in
Aitken Hume International, the financial services group, belonging to
Atlanta Fund Managers.
He faces other charges that he concealed his connection with Mamro from
Bestwood's auditors, and committed perjury by concealing the connection both
during a High Court hearing and while giving evidence to DTI inspectors.
Mr Cole was remanded on bail of Pounds 150,000 until March 19 on condition
that he surrendered his passport, did not apply for travel documents, did
not travel outside Essex or Greater London, and reported to a police station
twice a day.
Four other people were charged last year as a result of the SFO
investigation into Bestwood and are awaiting trial at a Crown Court.
They are Mr Charles Wilkinson, of London, a senior partner in solicitors
Lawrence Graham, charged with offences under section 395 of the Companies
Act 1985; Mr Jeremy Colson, a financial director, of Nadderwater, Devon, on
similar charges; Mr Peter Southgate, an accountant, of Colchester, Essex, on
charges of theft, aiding and abetting an unauthorised loan, and false
accounting; and Mr William Collins, a stockbroker, of Egham, Surrey, charged
with theft and false accounting. Mr Southgate and Mr Collins face joint
charges with Mr Cole.
Mr Cole bought into Best-wood, which then had little more to its name than a
printing subsidiary and a stake in a drilling company, in early 1985 and
became chairman soon afterwards.
Between 1985 and 1988, he built it up by acquiring substantial stakes in a
number of companies. He created a mini-conglomerate with interests ranging
from drilling, contracting and property development to motor bike financing.
Bestwood, which suffered heavy losses after the 1987 stock market crash,
went into receivership in April 1990.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Governor plays down Emu fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN economic and monetary union need not lead to federalism in the
European Community, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of
England, said last night.
He underlined, however, that Emu would only work if all sectors of society
in participating countries accepted 'the key objective of price stability
allied to open, flexible and competitive markets'.
Speaking in Oxford, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said monetary union did not have to
involve such features as a sizeable EC budget, a European parliament with
powers of taxation and the development of more and larger spending
departments in Brussels. Such demands - reflected in the latest Commission
plans to expand the Community budget by more than a third over the next five
years - ignored the benefits of the economic convergence that would have to
be achieved in the move towards Emu, he said.
Poorer EC members could gain as much from Emu as richer countries, he
declared. They would, for example, be able to attract inward investment and
benefit from lower interest rates so that 'there should not be inexorable
economic pressures making for a federal budget'.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said Britain's policy of delaying its decision on whether
to join Emu fully did not put it at a disadvantage in preparing for union.
Britain was as well placed as other EC states to qualify for Emu, he said.
He warned Euro-sceptics against expecting that Emu would fail to be
achieved, as planned, by 1999 at the latest.
But he also made clear many problems had to be solved before Emu could
function satisfactorily.
He warned of possible conflict between the planned independent European
Central Bank and governments if they reverted to policies inconsistent with
price stability.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Nervousness north of the border: Scotland's business
community is worried about possible political upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility of constitutional change after the British general election
 -whether devolution or outright independence - is sending shivers through
Scotland's business community.
The unmistakeably urgent tones in which the possibility of political reform
is being discussed suggest that proposals from the Scottish Nationalist
party and the Labour party are being taken seriously for the first time by
businessmen. Both parties have put it firmly on their agenda. The former
endorses outright independence, the latter a devolved parliament with the
power to raise some taxes. Even the Conservative party, faced with opinion
polls that indicate most Scottish people favour independence, may have to
consider some form of devolution if it is returned to power.
'Independence would be a disaster and a tax-raising assembly almost as bad,
as it would take us well down the road to independence,' says Lord Weir,
chairman of the Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company.
He fears the political uncertainty which would arise from a period of
transition to a new system of government, and higher taxes. He believes
Scottish-based companies which do not depend on the Scottish market might
move their headquarters, probably to England, if they were taxed more
heavily in a separate Scotland.
Lord Weir's reaction is typical of the anxiety of businessmen about the
consequences they fear for Scotland and for their companies if
constitutional changes are enacted.
Such radical political upheaval has crucial implications for how Scotland
would be financed. Mr Ian Begg, an economist at Cambridge University and an
expert on the Scottish economy, estimates that Scotland receives between
10.5 per cent and 11 per cent of all UK public spending but only provides
between 8 and 8.25 per cent of UK tax revenues and duties. The resulting gap
is estimated by most economists to be just under Pounds 4bn.
Labour and the SNP have different proposals for filling this shortfall.
Under Labour's plan, a Scottish parliament would receive all income tax and
value-added tax raised in Scotland, and the gap would be made up with a
grant from Westminster.
In addition, Labour intends that a Scottish parliament would be able, as the
party puts it in policy statements to 'vary' the rate of income tax in
Scotland by up to 3p in the pound. Labour politicians believe that Scots
would agree to pay higher taxes for greater services - such as better
health, education and housing provision. A recent Mori poll gave support to
this claim, showing that 49 per cent of respondents were willing to pay
higher taxes compared with 43 per cent who opposed an increase.
Under the SNP's independence proposal, the gap would be filled by oil
revenues. The SNP argues that Scotland is entitled to 90 per cent of the oil
and gas reserves in the North Sea. It says that although the tax revenues
from the North Sea this year are likely to be only Pounds 1.2bn, increased
production arising from new oil fields and higher oil prices could raise
revenues to about Pounds 5bn in the last half of the 1990s.
Opponents of independence say this strategy begs many questions. Much
depends on where England and Scotland would agree to locate the line between
their sectors of the North Sea.
If the line of the land border between the two countries, which runs in a
northeasterly direction up to Berwick-upon-Tweed, were projected into the
North Sea, a big part of the oil and gas fields would end up in the English
sector, and Scotland might have less than 70 per cent of the revenues.
Oil revenues seem, however, to be an uncertain basis for filling Scotland's
revenue gap, and are volatile, varying greatly from year to year depending
on the oil price, production levels and tax write-offs by the oil companies.
Mr Begg believes that even if Scotland obtained all North Sea oil, it would
still have a substantial borrowing requirement because of the gap between
tax revenues and expenditure. 'It would be laughed out of the financial
markets,' he says, and higher taxes might be necessary.
Nevertheless, an independent Scotland would have a reasonably well-balanced
economy, not only with considerable oil and gas production but a relatively
large, export-oriented manufacturing base and a big financial services
industry. It might have a gross domestic product of about Pounds 55bn,
putting it below Denmark and Norway in western Europe but above Greece,
Portugal and Ireland.
For businessmen bewildered by the speed with which the issue of independence
has come to the fore, the main problem is making business decisions in an
uncertain political climate. A senior executive of a Scottish company
explains: 'We don't know what's going to happen in the election, the
economic issues don't get discussed enough and the whole debate is conducted
in a vacuum so that hard facts are never established.'
The finance director of a quoted Scottish manufacturing company says he
knows of two Scottish companies which have established subsidiaries in
England through which to pay their Scottish workforce, as a precaution
against the higher income tax which an Edinburgh parliament might impose on
them.
Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the drinks and
leisure group which operates in both England and Scotland, fears that
independence or devolution may reduce the access of Scottish companies to
the English market.
The planned single European market is not regarded as an adequate solution
either, because it will for many years be much less integrated than the UK
market.
That concern is shared by Mr Malcolm Murray, chief executive of Scottish
Life, the life assurer. He says that even if there were no tax differential
between an independent Scotland and England, there might be consumer
resistance or even discrimination in England against buying life policies
from a Scottish company. England is the biggest market for most of
Scotland's life companies and banks.
"My personal preference is for the status quo, but that's not an option any
more,' he says.
For the companies that do support constitutional change, devolution is
preferred to independence. One businessman running an engineering concern in
Glasgow argues that Scottish business would receive a better hearing in a
Scottish assembly than it does at Westminster, and that a Scottish assembly
would be more likely to tackle the problems of the region's transport
infrastructure.
Other supporters of devolution argue that higher taxes would be an
acceptable price to pay for improved services such as health and education.
This is the view of Tom McGregor, an engineering consultant, who will soon
launch an organisation of businesspeople called Scotland Says Yes] (to
devolution).
While the idea of devolution gathers some support, few senior members of the
Scottish business community approve of outright independence. But there are
some singular voices of support. Mr Robin Angus, an investment analyst with
County Natwest Woodmac in Edinburgh, believes an independent Scotland could
give its financial services industry favourable tax treatment, particularly
for one of its specialities, investment trusts.
Sir Iain Noble, who chairs the Edinburgh issuing house Noble &amp; Co, and is a
pillar of the Scottish establishment, says he would be content with either a
Scottish parliament inside Britain but dealing direct with Brussels, or an
independent Scotland within the EC.
'It is axiomatic,' Sir Iain says, 'that taxes in Scotland would be lower
than those in England, otherwise there would be a brain drain and a flight
of capital. We would establish the simplest company law in the EC, attract
corporate head offices and thrive on our financial and legal services.
Whether independence was a success would depend entirely on our ability to
be entrepreneurial and innovative.'

On this, St Valentine's day, Observer is happy to pass on some hints from
'Snogging - a beginner's guide to the art of kissing'.
For a start, amateurs should realise that a kiss which speaks volumes is
seldom a first edition, and a flirt is a woman who thinks it's every man for
herself. And if you tell your lover 'I love you terribly' you run the risk
that he/she may agree with you. Moreover, those of a certain age should
remember they can keep their teeth out of the way by slipping them in a
pocket.
The book, which lists the pros and cons of inviting your first date to share
a pew with you in church, is published by HarperCollins Religious
Publishing. Observer is gob-smacked.

Nice to see Francis Maude, the minister in charge of the citizen's charter,
wearing his name-badge at a meeting fixed by London Electricity to report on
its customer charter. As he observed, the charter requires increasing
numbers of faceless bureaucrats to wear badges on the assumption that
they'll behave differently if they can be identified by name.
However, departing from his usual anonymity didn't seem to prompt Maude to
behave differently from the ministerial norm. Not only did his speech begin
20 minutes later than scheduled, but he failed to offer financial recompense
to the audience.
Perhaps he'd forgotten that the citizen's charter encourages the swift
dispensation of Pounds 10 notes to customers kept waiting by meter readers,
repair men and suchlike.

For golden disc, read 'Red Sun'. Sales of a cassette album with that name
have soared to 1.7m copies in China, to the pique of the reformists vying
with conservatives in the country' leadership.
The album, which might be subtitled 'Hits of the Cultural Revolution',
consists of 30 songs deifying Mao Tse-tung which were popular when his
devotees were burning books, smashing temples and purging intellectuals in
the late 1960s and early 70s.
The cassette is produced by China Record's Shanghai branch whose manager,
Zhou Jianchao, says his company decided to 'dig up' the old songs as a
welcome change from the Taiwanese and Hong Kong pop at present dominating
China's music industry. They are popular simply because they're familiar, he
explains.
But they jar the ears of Shanghai's Liberation Daily paper. Calling on
China's music writers to come up with new songs more suited to the times, it
declared: 'We cannot again create a god and a personality cult.'

It may be called the New York Metals Exchange (Nymex), but don't expect it
to deal in metal. Such at least is the impression just gained by Impala
Platinum.
The beleaguered South African producer has had to buy a total of 70,000
ounces of platinum in the market because of production shortfalls caused by
labour unrest. A proportion of this was obtained by taking physical delivery
on outstanding futures contracts.
Impala's chairman, Brian Gilbertson, now reports that the company has
received a 'snotty' letter from the chairman of Nymex. If Impala continued
to insist on taking delivery of metal, it said, Nymex would have to consider
blacklisting the company.
Apparently the Nymex argument is that the exchange is merely in the business
of supplying a price. But Gilbertson reckons it is very frustrating to have
the price set by someone who will not take or deliver metal.
'If ever there's an argument for producer pricing, this is it,' he
maintains.

The contrast between the management styles of BP and Royal Dutch Shell can
rarely have been sharper than now.
Yesterday saw Royal Dutch Shell quietly reshuffle its top management team,
with Sir Peter Holmes being annointed to take over from Lo van Wachem as top
dog. Meanwhile over at BP a terrible set of figures underlines the questions
already being asked about the performance of chairman Bob Horton.
Horton gave a slick presentation, and if there are political machinations
going on, they can only be guessed at. Since he has only been in the job a
couple of years there is no need for there to be a clear successor yet. On
the other hand, his apparent unpopularity with segments of his own staff and
with a swatch of the investment community, does raise the doubt.
The problem is that unlike Shell, where Cornelius Herkstroter is already
being groomed to take over from Sir Peter, BP has no obvious successor to
Horton. But while Royal Dutch Shell's conservative and bureaucratic
management style has its attractions, it also has its disadvantages.
Sadly for Holmes, who hasn't much time to make his mark on what is one of
the fatter of the old seven sisters, even the strongest punches can be
smothered by red tape.

<TEXT>
Gwen John was the sister of Augustus, perhaps the best known British painter
of his time around the First World War; she was attracted to women, but was
also a mistress and inspiration of the sculptor, Rodin. Born in Wales and
disliking London, she spent most of her adult life in France. She became a
Catholic in 1912, was remarkably attached to cats, some of which feature in
her paintings and drawings. She died in 1939, a strange and haunting woman.
Her brother remarked presciently that her work would be remembered long
after his own fame had declined. Augustus was right: it is Gwen John's
painting, not his, that is prominent in the major galleries today, though it
took an American patron, John Quinn, to persuade her that her work was worth
buying.
Even oversimplified like that, this is a big and complex story, perhaps too
much so to be put successfully on stage. But it certainly has its
attractions, especially to women. The main question is whether it can be
adapted in a way comprehensible to people unfamiliar with the background.
Sheila Yeger has had a shot at it, encouraged by the director Annie
Castledine.
The first performance was in 1987 at Theatr Clwyd, which commissioned it.
The production at the excellent Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond is new, but
is again directed by Ms Castledine. Undoubtedly it has its charms. The
conventional criticism of Gwen John's work when she was alive was that the
scale was too small. Here a score or so of her canvasses are shown from the
ceiling; others appear periodically on slides. There can be few questions
now about the quality: it is outstanding.
Rather than simply try to tell the Gwen John story, however, Ms Yeger has
sought to draw a moral. The setting is a contemporary exhibition of her
work. The gallery is run, and the private view attended, by some pretty
stock characters: all-purpose arts journalist; neurotic female trying to
write a novel; and a TV arts producer. Their quarrels alternate with Gwen
John's drama, her scenes with Rodin and so on, enacted on the gallery floor.
The moral is that unhappy women today can draw encouragement from her
example.
That seems to be pushing it a bit. Gwen John was an extraordinary character
by any standards; the contemporary characters in Ms Yeger's play are made
out of cardboard. Thus there is no parallel between past and present. The
complexity of the plot is also made hard to follow by multi-part playing.
Richard Howard plays the TV producer, Edwin John - Gwen's father; Augustus
John; and Rodin. He is at his best as Rodin.
Barbara Marten plays only Gwen John and at times does it remarkably well,
never more so than when she is modelling for Rodin. This is a splendid part
slightly bogged down in more mundane material. The gallery where the action
takes place is designed with some flair by Steven Richardson. But in the end
it is an intriguing rather than a compelling evening.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Arts: Eric Clapton - Albert Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Eric Clapton's annual residency at the Albert Hall long ago ceased to be a
string of concerts, let alone rock concerts. Like Horovitz with his piano
and Stern with his violin, Clapton is the total guitar master, the genius of
his generation. Even more than Horovitz and Stern, he makes it look easy as
he bends his guitar to strike out cries of human anguish and pleasure. I
doubt if he even practices: you feel that if he could force his fingers on
to bum notes the sounds would somehow come right.
No, the concerts are now just as opportunity to assess Eric's health, mental
rather than musical. And the good news is that the man is just fine. Dressed
darkly by Versace, his hair trimmed and his beard glinting grizzly in the
spotlights, he could be a Mayfair art dealer, or perhaps a night club
manager.
He is as cool and undemonstrative as ever, driving home the contrast between
the man and the tingling, manic, sounds that come from his guitar.
He has been accepted as God by his fans since the 1960s and none of the
disciples in the audience would want to forget the real trauma he suffered
in the past year: the loss, through a tragic accident, of his young son. But
Clapton has used the experience musically, not cashing in but apparently
expiating his grief through songs like 'Tears in Heaven' and 'The Circus
left Town', performed seated and acoustically in line with his bass man
Nathan East and guitar support Andy Fairweather-Lowe.
The songs sounded maudlin rather than elegiac but it was a sensitive moment
and earned Clapton a bouquet of red roses.
Around this subdued heart there was the anticipated ritual. There is no way
he can escape from 'Layla' however much he changes the intro, and the lovers
in the audience (vastly outnumbered by parents giving their children a sight
of stardom) would have expired if he had not played 'Wonderful Tonight'. It
is done so tastefully, with such craftsmanship, that the banality almost
becomes a human truth.
There was Cream for encores - 'Crossroads' and 'Sunshine of Your Love'.
Clapton is using a slightly larger band this year and, with Fairweather-Lowe
offering a spikey sound against Clapton's gold-chipped playing, the music
was funkier, more rousing, than in the past.
It might have nothing to do with contemporary art but it is a marvellous
expression of communal worship.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Technology: Machine replaces milkmaid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the last three years Professor Jim Hewit's team in the Department of
Mechanical Engineering at the Loughborough University of Technology has been
looking at cows' udders with more than a passing interest.
Talking to colleagues at the Agricultural and Food Research Council they
discovered that if cows could be milked as often as the cows themselves
wanted, milk production would increase.
The stress on the cows of being rounded up for milking would also be
reduced, which could improve milk quality. And farmers would need less
equipment, as milking would be spread throughout the day, not compressed
into the traditional early and late shifts.
The Loughborough team has developed a robotic machine to milk the cows
automatically. The system incorporates a thermal imaging system attached to
a contraption of booms and telescopic tubing.
The solution appeared by accident. Hewit discovered a thermal imaging system
in the lab from a previous project. Wondering whether this might distinguish
cold teats from hot udders, the team tested it on cows on an Oxfordshire
farm.
Not only did it pick out the teats on the cow when the animal entered the
milking stall, without the need for human guidance, it also picked out a
teat diseased with mastitis, which appeared black to the imaging system. The
cow's owner was shocked, but grateful, and so were the Loughborough
engineers: in a surprise spin-off the robot had become a dual milking and
diagnostic imaging system.
Work will begin in May on the remaining hurdle: making the imaging systems
rugged enough and cheap enough for life on the farm. At present an effective
imaging system costs around Pounds 30,000, says Hewit, and he is worried
that a roaring trade in robot rustling might develop.
Eventually he believes unattended milking stalls will appear on the farm.
Cows will wander in as they please or be called in by the tape-recorded
lowings of suckling calves.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers move to prevent register
 -Council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POWER of local author-ities to canvass residents will be restricted by
the government in amendments to the council tax bill to be published today.
The move reflects government concern that the council tax should not be
accompanied by a register as the poll tax was.
Though some local authorities have warned that a register will be needed to
enable them to administer the largely property-based tax, the decision to
limit the ability to question residents was taken after consultation with
the local authority associations.
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said the amendment would
stop authorities setting up a council-tax register by using their existing
powers under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, which
enables them to survey owners and occupiers in their areas.
Instead, they would be able to seek information only about who in each
household was the person liable to pay the tax and ask households to say if
they qualify for discounts.
Ministers emphasised that local authorities would not necessarily need to
make both inquiries of every household, since they would already have a good
deal of information. They suggested that many councils might wish to make
the inquiries only where they had to pursue non-payment.
Proposed changes in the bill will also enable the government to make
regulations putting beyond doubt the use of computer evidence in cases of
non-payment of the poll tax.
The bill will be discussed by the Lords at the beginning of next week and is
expected to become law early in March.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, brushed aside protests from
opposition MPs yesterday at the government's decision to impose a guillotine
on the local government bill which extends compulsory competitive tendering
and sets up a commission to review the structure of local government. The
move will ensure that the bill can become law within the next few weeks.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown supports 'green' accounts -
News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats yes-terday highlighted their 'green' credentials by
backing proposals, under consideration by the Department of the Environment,
for an alternative system of national accounts, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the Treasury was blocking a
change to gross national product statistics which took into account the
environmental impact of economic growth.
He endorsed a report by the Dutch central bureau of statistics showing how
the alternative indicators could be compiled at little extra expense.
The Environment Department and Central Statistical Office are thought to be
interested in the project but are still calculating the costs.
HEALTH: Tory backbenchers last night demanded the resignation of Mr Robin
Cook, shadow health secretary, for using confidential information leaked by
an official of the Department of Health to attack the government.
VOTERS: About 1.4m people eligible to vote are missing from electoral
registers, according to estimates produced yesterday by Mr Harry Barnes,
Labour MP for North East Derbyshire. He blamed the poll tax for much of the
shortfall he found by comparing electoral registers for last year with
official estimates of those old enough to vote.
UDR: Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, clashed with angry Ulster
Unionist MPs in the Commons yesterday as he opened the second reading on the
Army Bill.
The measure paves the way for the merger of the Ulster Defence Regiment with
the Royal Irish Rangers to form the Royal Irish Regiment. The government was
accused of betraying the UDR's 6,000 members.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Membership limited to 50 - Greater
London authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SLIMLINE strategic author-ity for London, elected by some form of
proportional representation and made up of equal numbers of men and women,
was promised by Labour yesterday.
Stepping up the party's campaign to win marginal seats in the capital Mr
Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said the planned Greater London
Authority (GLA) would have no more than 50 members, representing large,
multi-member constituencies.
Mr Gould's stress on the streamlined nature of the GLA follows Tory
criticism of Labour's plans as simply an additional layer of bureaucracy.
Mr Gould said the new body would have some wider powers than the Greater
London Council, the former strategic body for the capital which was
abolished in 1986. For example it would act as a police authority. However,
Mr Gould promised that the GLA would have only a fraction of the GLC's
22,000 staff.
He also emphasised that many services delivered by the GLA could be 'bought
in' rather than provided by the authority itself.
Under the plans the City of London would lose its local authority functions,
but would continue to exist as a ceremonial or symbolic body.
Labour plans a bill to establish the GLA in the first year of a new
parliament if it wins the general election. The first elections in London
would take place the following year. In the meantime an environment minister
would be given special responsibility for the capital.
The cost of the GLA could be met from rationalising the network of residuary
bodies currently carrying out some of the functions of the former strategic
authority.
Mr Gould poured scorn on what he said would be Tory manifesto plans for an
unelected agency to promote London internationally, and a minister for
London transport. They were, he said, 'mere PR gimmicks which concede that
the Tories have lost the argument'.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scotch mist clouds regional policy
 -The devolution dilemma facing Labour frontbenchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE intriguing if somewhat arcane question of the rights and powers of Scots
MPs in Westminster once a legislating, tax-raising Scottish parliament is up
and running is hardly likely to dominate the general election.
But neither is it merely a sideshow for the Caledonian fringe. To several
cynical Labour MPs - though party officials would fiercely dispute the claim
 -it is the issue upon which Labour's complex, and still largely unmapped,
regional policy is built.
This week the so-called 'West Lothian question' elbowed its way back into
the newspaper columns after Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, highlighted
Mr Robin Cook's recent assertion that he could not serve as health secretary
for England once Labour's Scottish parliament was set up.
Yesterday the point was taken up by the prime minister in reply to a
question from his back benches. Provocatively, Mr John Major suggested that
Mr Cook's self-denying ordinance should apply to other Labour frontbenchers
like Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and
industry secretary - and even to Mr Neil Kinnock as a Welsh MP.
Labour's answer to the taunt is that Mr Cook was speaking out of turn. Party
officials say Mr Kinnock does not share his views and that this
constitutional wrangle will be best examined when it is reached.
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman responsible for regional
policy, bravely tried to explain the issue to Mr Brian Walden on television
on Sunday.
He said 'a very substantial answer' to the question lay in Labour's plan to
create elected assemblies for the English regions. As these assemblies would
also receive devolved powers, Mr Gould implied they would to some extent
'balance' the new political entities in Scotland and later, Wales.
If this sounds somewhat vague, then that is the overriding characteristic of
Labour's regional policy - and for good reason.
Mr Gould's task has been to satisfy the pressure for assemblies from
northern MPs, long fearful of the ability of a Scottish parliament to
attract investment across the border. At the same time, he has had to calm
the anxieties of Labour councillors that their powers will be eroded, while
winning round the sceptics about devolution - not least Mr Kinnock.
In consequence, the delicately-worded pledges in Labour's latest policy
document need to be read with care. They commit the party to setting up a
Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers within a year of taking office.
However, on the English regions and, it appears, a Welsh assembly, Labour
promises only to set up regional 'administrations' within a first term.
Elected bodies, empowered and charged with a strategic role in such areas as
planning and transport, would come only in a second parliament.
The repeated emphasis on the slimline nature of the bodies is evidence of
Labour's sensitivity to Tory charges that the assemblies represent more
unnecessary, unwanted and costly bureaucracy. Labour replies that regional
sentiment is growing and that the proposal meets a general desire to see
power devolved from Whitehall. The assemblies will also provide a forum for
planning decisions and the administration needed to link in with Brussels'
soon-to-be-formed committee for the regions.
Yet large questions on the exact nature and powers of the assemblies, how
regional boundaries will be drawn up and how representatives will be elected
remain unanswered. Some keen regionalists like Mr Richard Caborn, the MP for
Sheffield Central, want the regions ready for election within the lifetime
of a Labour government.
Others, more dubious, hope the lack of a fully-defined blueprint means lead
times can be indefinitely extended. As several delegates to Labour's local
government conference in Blackpool last weekend discreetly suggested, the
proposals look alarmingly like a classic example of the leadership's
fondness for institutional solutions to political problems.
Mr Gould insists: 'The regional assemblies will happen.' But for the moment,
many Labour campaigners hope that beyond being 'a very substantial answer'
to the West Lothian question, prior to the election this particular sleeping
dog will be left to lie.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock savages PM over jobless
figures - Recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK yesterday seized on the sharp rise in unemployment and home
repossessions to tear into the government's failure to take measures to
counteract the recession.
In a ferocious attack on the Tory leadership the Labour leader used Commons
questions to add his voice to a concerted onslaught by his frontbench team
aimed at charging Mr John Major and his government with complacency.
When the prime minister conceded that the new unemployment figures were
'disappointing', Mr Kinnock replied that for the 2.6m people now out of work
the figures were not disappointing but 'absolutely devastating'.
Gesturing at Mr Major across the despatch box, he accused the prime minister
of crossing his fingers and closing his eyes to the effects of the slowdown.
'Why does he just sit there and do absolutely nothing to combat the
devastation?' he asked.
His criticism was echoed by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who
said the government, paralysed by the election, 'dodges the issues and does
nothing'.
Countering the attacks, Mr Major said that worthwhile training schemes were
now helping 250,000 unemployed people.
He emphasised that 300,000 people were 'leaving unemployment' every month
and condemned Labour's proposals for a minimum wage, a payroll tax and a
general increase in taxation. Their introduction would 'spell disaster for
this economy, disaster for companies and permanent unemployment for millions
of people'.
The clash came after Labour campaign organisers confirmed that the party now
plans to concentrate its pre-election fire on what it sees as the
government's dogged refusal to take steps to relieve the impact of the
recession.
One said: 'First, we must ram home the point again and again that the
recession is not letting up, then we will turn to the point that the
government is doing nothing about it.'
Earlier, senior Labour frontbenchers used a news conference to highlight the
continuing rise in unemployment and the mortgage crisis. Mr Bryan Gould,
shadow environment secretary, said independent analysts now believed home
repossessions for mortgage arrears were likely to hit 80,000 this year.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, seized on the new unemployment
figures to claim that 'the colossal incompetence of Tory economic
management' meant almost 1m people had been added to the dole queues since
the recession had begun.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, listed predictions by
business associations ranging from the Confederation of British Industry to
the Building Employers Confederation forecasting further job losses.
Demanding pre-budget measures to boost investment and training, he said the
CBI had forecast the loss of about 200,000 manufacturing jobs alone.
Indignation at the continued economic gloom could not disguise Labour's
conviction that the recession might prove the key factor in the general
election. Labour has tabled a debate on the recession for next Wednesday -
the second in a month. The Tories look set to concentrate on Labour's links
with the unions with a debate on Tuesday.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: County spending set to rise 7.8% -
Local authority budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING by county councils looks set to rise by almost 8 per cent in
1992-93, close to twice the projected inflation rate, and contributing more
to poll tax bills likely to be well above the government's target figure of
Pounds 257.
According to a survey in today's Local Government Chronicle the average
increase in spending in English counties - with figures in from 35 of the 39
counties - is about 7.8 per cent. This is in spite of the fact that the
proposed budgets are generally in line with the government's standard
spending assessments (SSAs).
Under government rules to limit local spending, that means their precepts
are tied to being no more than 6.5 per cent above last year's, roughly the
figure settled on by 18 of the authorities.
In almost all cases the figures reflect budget plans that have yet to be
ratified by the full council.
The figures fuelled Labour's claims that headline poll tax bills were likely
to be closer to Pounds 300 than the government's target. As district
councils take final decisions on the levels of bills over the next few weeks
the issue will become more sensitive in pre-election campaigning.
According to the local authority associations actual local authority
spending this year is likely to come out at about Pounds 39.9bn. This means
the government's figure for planned spending of Pounds 41.8bn next year
represents an increase of only about 4.8 per cent.
Some county budgets may rise further, however, as a result of the 7.8 per
cent teachers' pay award announced by the government earlier this week.
Teachers' pay is the largest single component of county budgets, and most
counties budgeted for an increase of only 5 per cent to 6 per cent.
Nonetheless, Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, insisted yesterday:
'Any competent and well-run authority can afford not only to pay for the
teachers' pay rise but increased expenditure on education.'
Speaking on BBC radio he added: 'I don't think there will be any
redundancies on any significant scale, certainly none caused by the pay
rise.'
Labour points out that the overshoot on county spending does not take
account of any addition to poll tax bills as a result of the non-payment
surcharge, which will be assessed only when the districts set their budgets.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, said: 'Since counties
account for most of the community charge bill in the shire areas, I see no
reason to doubt that community charges will be quite close to government
target.'
He added that the recent review of non-payment by Cipfa, the public sector
accountancy body, showed that nearly half the councils surveyed would not
have to levy a non-payment surcharge.
The Department of the Environment said that the projected spending levels
from the counties would add only about Pounds 5 to each poll tax bill in
shire areas.
But Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said that these
figures confirmed 'the total fairytale of the government's Pounds 257 target
poll tax'. He added: 'Most of these councils are making cuts in essential
services yet still bills are bound to increase. For the poll tax payer this
will truly be the worst of both worlds, with reduced services and a new wave
of poll tax hardship. Blame should and will rest firmly at the government's
door.'
Widespread cuts in services seem likely. All but four counties - Essex,
Hampshire, North Yorkshire and West Sussex, all Tory-controlled - are likely
to spend at or very close to their capping level.
Among the four counties not included in the survey it is expected that
Warwickshire is likely to set a budget well above the cap on spending.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Big drop in days lost from strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER DAYS were lost through strikes last year than in any year since
records began 100 years ago, according to figures published yesterday by the
Department of Employment.
Provisional estimates put the loss at 800,000 days - the first time the
figure has fallen below 1m since 1940 - compared with annual averages of
12.9m days in the 1970s and 7.2m days for the 1980s.
The government is likely to use the figures during the election campaign as
evidence of the effectiveness of its reform of union law and to support its
claim that Labour would be unable to control the unions.
In 1991, 177,000 workers were involved in a total of 354 stoppages compared
with 298,000 engaged in 630 disputes in 1990.
The provisional figure for stoppages in December, the latest monthly figure
available, was 25 - the lowest for that month since 1932, when there were 21
stoppages.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Minister announces Pounds 500m warship work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday confirmed plans worth some Pounds 500m to replace
and update ships required for amphibious military operations.
The announcement in the Commons by Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement
minister, was seen as a move to offset the impact of recent job cuts in the
defence industry, including those at British Aerospace and the shipyards
VSEL and Vosper Thornycroft.
It was welcomed by warship builders struggling for new orders, and by the
Navy because it secures the role of the Royal Marines.
Ministers have authorised the opening of a competition to design and build a
helicopter carrier to take on the role previously assigned to HMS Hermes
before the Navy sold it to India in 1986.
Invitations to tender are due to be issued this month, with an order
expected in the second half of next year. Fierce competition is expected
between Swan Hunter of Tyneside and Yarrow Shipbuilders of Glasgow, a
subsidiary of GEC.
The ship will be designed to be able to lift ashore a commando of 500
marines. Tenders for a new ship were invited in 1988, but the Ministry of
Defence put a limit of Pounds 104m on the project at the time and was not
satisfied with the proposals it received.
The MoD is also pressing ahead with 'project definition' work on two new
assault ships to carry troops, their equipment and landing craft. They will
replace the Navy's ageing vessels Intrepid and Fearless, which played a
vital part in the Falklands campaign.
Mr Clark said contracts for these studies had been awarded to YARD, part of
a joint venture between British Aerospace and Sema, to VSEL and to
Dowty-Sema.
The first ship is expected to be ordered in 1994.
Three logistic support ships, Sir Bedivere, Sir Geraint and Sir Percivale,
belonging to the civilian-manned Royal Fleet Auxiliary, are to be overhauled
and re-equipped. A sister vessel, Sir Tristram, has already been rebuilt
after being badly damaged in the Falklands. All were built in the 1960s.
The Navy has one more modern ship in this category, Sir Galahad, a
replacement for the vessel of the same name which was sunk as a war grave
after suffering an Argentinian air attack.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Commuter travel subsidy to remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO eliminate the heavy annual subsidy received by British Rail's
Network SouthEast division have been abandoned for the foreseeable future,
the Department of Transport's annual report showed yesterday.
The figures highlight the difficulty the government faces in finding a way
to privatise the network's loss-making commuter services, as it has
undertaken to do if the Conservatives win the general election.
The last corporate plan agreed between the government and British Rail,
published in December 1989, set a target of reducing Network SouthEast's
subsidy from Pounds 141m in 1989-90 to nothing in the financial year
beginning this April.
But the combination of recession, additional spending on safety and
lower-than-expected improvements in productivity caused the figure to remain
at the same level in the following two years.
The department's report, published yesterday, forecasts that the subsidy
will more than double, rising to Pounds 330m this financial year. Far from
being eliminated next year, the subsidy is expected to climb to Pounds 400m.
Only then is the subsidy expected to start falling back. It is forecast to
be Pounds 300m in 1993-94 and Pounds 100m in 1994-95 - the last year for
which forecasts are made.
British Rail's other subsidised division, Regional Railways, is also
expected to remain a heavy burden on the taxpayer.
That division's subsidy had been forecast to fall to Pounds 345m next year
at 1989-90 prices. Instead, the annual report estimates that the subsidy
will be Pounds 600m at current prices, with the figure falling only slightly
to Pounds 500m a year in the following two years.

FT  14 FEB 92 / No respite in wave of redundancies: The recession in
manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS BRITAIN'S manufacturing industry undergoing a second wave of job cuts
after the retrenchment of last year? Are companies which have fought to hang
on to skilled labour now reluctantly biting the bullet again?
Yesterday's unemployment figures, and the spate of redundancies which have
yet to be reflected in official statistics, suggest that the answer to
questions which are becoming increasingly sensitive as the election
approaches is an unequivocal 'Yes.'
In fact, the answer is a qualified 'No.' As the Engineering Employers'
Federation put it yesterday: 'There isn't a second wave, but the first wave
is continuing as we have always forecast.'
Last December the federation predicted a further fall of 70,000 jobs in the
year from the fourth quarter of last year, reducing the total to 1.82m.
Recent events in industries as diverse as aerospace and machine tools
suggest that could be a conservative estimate.
On one hand, some companies are planning no further job cuts even though
they see no immediate prospect of an improvement in business conditions.
Vickers, the defence, medical equipment and luxury car group, has cut 1,300
jobs at its Rolls-Royce car plant in Crewe, but says 'the pain was last
year'.
In contrast, a second wave of job cuts is visible in chemicals. The Chemical
Industries Association said: 'Companies are having to bring forward
redundancies they were hoping to put off.'
Individual companies were reluctant to concede they had miscalculated the
length of the recession.
Laporte, the specialist chemicals maker, said it was in the middle of a
three-year job reduction programme. Bulk chemicals supplier Albright &amp;
Wilson, part of Tenneco, the US conglomerate, said it 'started to wield the
axe in June 1991. We are now turning our focus to other areas of cost
savings.'
ICI shed 7,000 workers last year, but said the losses were spread evenly
through the year.
It is in petrochemicals, the heaviest end of the industry, where a new round
of jobs cuts is most apparent. Only yesterday BP Chemicals announced the
loss of 180 jobs at two sites.
Late last year BP Chemicals told each manufacturing site to look for ways of
reducing costs. Only three sites have so far revealed job cuts but the
exercise is continuing.
The construction equipment industry is suffering a 'second wavelet' with a
number of small redundancies in the past few weeks after heavy cuts last
year.
Mr David Barrell, director-general of the Federation of Manufacturers of
Construction Equipment and Cranes, said many companies were 'holding their
breath and hoping they do not have to make any more cuts. All it does is
weaken the industry'.
In aerospace, the recent job cuts at British Aerospace are part of a longer
process, but are contributing to lay-offs in subcontractor companies which
had until now avoided retrenchment. Ricardo International, the Bristol-based
design engineer group, came through the year to June with no cuts in its
aerospace side, but is now temporarily laying off 20 to 30 employees.
In other sectors, the current round of job cuts is the 'first wave' of this
recession. The machine-tool industry fought off heavy redundancies last year
in the hope that conditions would improve this year.
Over the past few weeks, however, some 600 job cuts have been announced in
machine-tool factories from Brighton to Bridlington, threatening the
permanent loss of highly skilled engineers from the workforce.
The textile industry has played only a small role in recent rises in
unemployment. 'There is no new wave of job cuts in textiles', said Mr Colin
Purvis of the British Textile Federation.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, confirms this
view. 'We did the maximum up-front on pessimistic assumptions.'
The long-term decline of the industry in the UK remains a fact of life,
however. 'Redundancies are continuing at 4,000 to 5,000 a quarter out of a
workforce of 420,000,' said Mr Purvis. 'This is related to companies' own
performances. Most people are fairly sceptical about economic forecasts.'

FT  14 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BP to derecognise two unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP CHEMICALS is to end collective pay bargaining at its Baglan Bay plant in
south Wales in a rare example of a large UK company derecognising
blue-collar unions.
The company's plan, announced yesterday with proposals to cut 130 jobs and
change working practices at the 900-strong plant, sparked fears among unions
that other BP plants would follow.
Many companies have withdrawn collective bargaining from white-collar
employees, but it is unusual for manual-worker unions to be derecognised.
BP Chemicals yesterday gave 90 days' notice to the TGWU general workers'
union and the AEU engineering workers of its intention to end their role in
pay bargaining at Baglan Bay. The two unions said that about 700 of the 900
workers on the site were their members. BP Chemicals said terms and
conditions of all employees would be harmonised, and each would be asked to
sign a personal contract.
Pay would depend in part on individual performance, although initially
workers would receive basic pay rises of up to Pounds 1,300 a year and
improved allowances.
Mr Fred Higgs, TGWU national secretary, said: 'It is extremely cynical for
the company to try to end collective bargaining at the same time as
announcing job losses. It is an attempt to intimidate people into giving up
their fundamental trade union rights. If they get away with it at Baglan
Bay, they may try it at other sites.'
The TGWU said it was seeking legal advice on the company's move. A meeting
of union officials throughout BP Chemicals has been called for Monday to
discuss industrial action.
Baglan Bay is one of three large chemicals plants owned by BP in the UK, the
other two are at Grangemouth near Falkirk and Hull. It owns a further dozen
smaller plants. The company proposes to alter shift patterns, increase team
working and train workers to take on a greater variety of jobs.
Mr Alan Bilsland, works general manager, said the changes were essential to
improve the plant's competitive position.

FT  14 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Resistance to training is shown by
survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prediction that almost all those in the 16-18 age bracket will be in
education or training by the end of the decade will be proved wrong because
of young people's desire to leave school and earn money, according to a
survey, David Goodhart writes.
Covering 4,800 young people in Liverpool, Swindon, Kirkcaldy and Sheffield,
it shows that in spite of efforts to establish a training culture, young
people want to take the quickest possible route into employment 'possibly at
the expense of investment in their own training'.
The survey was carried out by the Economic and Social Research Council. It
shows that Youth Training is much more likely to lead to employment in
Swindon because of the buoyancy of the local economy.
In Sheffield 38 per cent found themselves unemployed after being on a Youth
Training scheme. In Liverpool the proportion was 37 per cent and in
Kirkcaldy 36 per cent. In Swindon it was only 11 per cent.
More young people stayed in education after 16 in Scotland than in England.
'This could have been influenced by the fact that while it takes two years
to take A-levels, a Scottish Higher can be completed in a year,' the ESRC
said.

LONDON Electricity will pay compensation to customers if staff are more than
two hours late for home visits, the company announced yesterday.
It already makes automatic compensation payments ranging from Pounds 10 to
Pounds 50 for service failures under a customer charter launched last July.
These include a payment of Pounds 10 for failing to turn up on the agreed
day to read the meter or to do work requested by London Electricity.
From February 24 the company will make appointments which specify visits in
the morning or afternoon - with the same compensation if the appointment is
not kept. From November appointments will be guaranteed within a two-hour
time band.

</HEADLINE>

ALMOST 10 per cent of consumers are delaying making significant purchases
because of uncertainty about the general election, according to a survey
published by Barclaycard yesterday.
The proportion of those intending to postpone decisions such as moving
house, buying furniture or booking holidays, rises to 12 per cent among
people aged 35 to 64.
Barclaycard gives no explanation for this reluctance to spend, but it does
not appear to be related to Labour's plans to increase taxes on the higher
paid. Those in social classes A and B are less likely to delay decisions
than other people.
The survey finds no sign of a revival in the housing market, with only 4 per
cent of those questioned planning to take out a mortgage in the next six
months.

Spending on vehicles suffered the biggest decline, down by 39 per cent from
the previous year. Spending on plant and machinery fell 15 per cent and
investment on new buildings fell 9 per cent.
In the fourth quarter of last year capital expenditure was down 0.6 per cent
compared with the previous three-month period.
the value of investment in the fourth quarter of last year was Pounds 2.54bn
at seasonally adjusted 1985 prices, compared with Pounds 2.96bn in the
fourth quarter of 1990. Total capital expenditure last year was Pounds
10.27bn compared with Pounds 12.14bn in 1990.

A WOMAN'S decision to open a personal pension plan will in most cases
improve her retirement income only marginally, according to a study
published today by the Equal Opportunities Commission, Norma Cohen writes.
'The great bulk of women are on low earnings, and the prospect of them
making a significant contribution to a personal pension is almost nil,' said
Mr Bryn Davies, an actuary who carried out the EOC research.
The study concludes that many women face poverty after retirement because
much public and private pensions provision is earnings-related. The top 10
per cent of women's salaries are earned by 50 per cent of all male workers.
The EOC calls on the government to increase the state pension, now Pounds 52
per week. It says the basic pension offers the best hope for women in
low-paid or part-time employment. At the moment, the basic state pension is
the only retirement income earned by most women.

FT  14 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Theft of computer data reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRISON Officers Association suggested yesterday that four thefts of
sensitive computer information from its north London headquarters fitted the
pattern of break-ins suffered by the three main political parties.
The union said it believed the thefts, which started last August, could not
be dismissed as coincidence.
Stolen information included details of staff arrangements at prisons in
Northern Ireland and at Brixton in south London, procedures for handling top
security prisoners, and addresses of those sympathetic to the union,
including MPs.
Mr John Bartell, the union's chairman, has written to Mr Kenneth Baker, home
secretary, drawing his attention to the burglaries and the 'lack of police
coverage' which made further incidents 'a distinct possibility'.
Mr Barry Sheerman, a Labour home affairs spokesman, has tabled three Commons
questions to the home secretary urging an inquiry into the thefts.
'The thefts coincide with an extraordinary series of attacks on the POA
including the forthcoming opening of Britain's first private prison,' said
Mr Sheerman.
Mr David Evans, the association's general secretary, suffered a burglary at
his home in August. Family memorabilia were stolen, but the association said
it viewed the break-in as suspicious.
The disclosures follow revelations that MPs have suffered a spate of thefts,
some apparently aimed at sensitive computer information.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, was forced to make a
public statement about his private life after the theft of a confidential
document from his solicitor.
The 37-strong ruling general executive council of the TGWU general union has
moved slightly further to the left after the latest elections.
The left-right balance is now thought to be 23-14. Two of the territorial
seats have been abolished, taking out a right-winger in the northern region
and the leftwing dockers' leader Mr Walter Greendale from the Hull area.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Unemployment increase largest in the south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of job losses appears to be increasing, according to unemployment
figures released yesterday.
Last month more than half the people losing their jobs were in the
south-east, the south-west and East Anglia - the regions hardest hit by
unemployment in the past two years. That has largely been due to cuts in
service industries - the dominant employers in the three regions.
Seasonally adjusted un-employment last month stood at 2,604,000, a rise of
53,000 from December. That followed a revised unemployment rise in December
of 36,200, and came after several months in which job losses appeared to
have slowed.
In the three months to January the average monthly rise in the jobless total
was 43,300, the highest figure since September last year. In the three
months to December the comparable number was 31,300.
The headline, or unadjusted, figure in January was 2,673,864, which is
122,000 above the previous month. Since March 1990, when unemployment
started rising at around the start of the recession, 1,027,299 people have
lost their jobs. Adjusted for seasonal variations, the figure is 997,500.
The south-east including London suffered 20,700 job losses in December. That
increased the unemployment rate, measured as a proportion of the workforce,
by 0.2 of a percentage point to 8.3 per cent. The rates in the south-west
and East Anglia both rose by 0.3 of a percentage point, to 8.7 per cent and
7.0 per cent respectively. Since March 1990 unemployment in the south-east
has increased by 128 per cent. The other two regions have each seen jobless
totals more than double.
Over the same period other parts of Britain - which suffered big increases
in un-employment in the early 1980s and have relatively large concentrations
of manufacturing industry - have suffered less from unemployment. Northern
Ireland, which has 14.3 per cent of its workforce unemployed, has seen its
unemployment total increase by just 5 per cent since March 1990.
Over the 22 months the difference between the unemployment rates in the
south-east and Northern Ireland has narrowed from 10.5 percentage points to
6 percentage points.
In line with the reduction in inflationary pressures across the economy, the
index of average earnings for manufacturing rose in the 12 months to
December by 7 3/4 per cent on an underlying basis.
In November the rise was 8 per cent. The comparable increase for service
industries was 7 per cent, down from 7 1/4 per cent in November.
Last month's large increase in joblessness appears to have been partly due
to a slackening in recruitment. That may have been reflected by the 229,800
people leaving the government's unemployment register in January, the lowest
monthly figure for a year.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Repossessions of homes climb 72% to record: Slackening in
recruitment sustains unemployment - Fewer mortgage defaulters likely to be
evicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders because their owners
could not keep up with monthly payments reached 75,540 last year.
The total, by far the highest recorded, was 72 per cent up on 1990. It was
slightly below forecasts of 80,000, however, and the rate of increase in
repossessions slowed in the second half of last year. The Council for
Mortgage Lenders indicated yesterday that the worst might be over.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the council, said it was impossible to
predict how many people would lose their homes this year. He added ,
however: 'We expect a declining trend during the course of the year.'
The council believes the decline in eviction rates reflects the fall in
mortgage interest rates and an increase in the provision of advice from
lenders.
In spite of the slowing in the rate of repossessions the number of borrowers
more than six months in arrears was 275,350 at the end of the year. There
were 91,740 borrowers more than 12 months in arrears, compared with 59,690
half way through 1991. There were also 183,610 borrowers between six and 12
months in arrears, up from 162,210 in the middle of the year.
These borrowers are all at risk of having their homes repossessed,
suggesting that repossessions will remain at very high levels this year and
next.
Woolwich Building Society, one of the largest mortgage lenders, said
yesterday, however, that the number of its customers less than six months in
arrears was now the lowest for four years. Its more serious arrears cases
had also stabilised.
The council expects about 40,000 homes to be saved as a result of a package
of measures agreed between lenders and the government just before Christmas.
These measures include the direct payment to lenders of social security
payments for mortgage interest and the provision of Pounds 1bn for mortgage
rescue schemes by lenders.
Leeds Permanent, the sixth-largest building society, yesterday became the
latest lender to launch a rescue package. It will spend Pounds 100m on a
scheme under which the society will take a share in the value of a house and
provide the borrower with a reduced mortgage payment. The interest rate for
such borrowers will be capped at 9.9 per cent for five years.
Mr Mike Blackburn, Leeds Permanent chief executive, warned that there could
be no quick cure for the repossessions problem. 'A full recovery will take
at least two years to achieve and will depend on factors beyond our
control,' he said. He added that the decline in the number of new arrears
cases was by far the most important development.
National Westminster Bank, the only high-street clearing bank to put up
funds for a mortgage rescue scheme, launched a Pounds 30m mortgage rescue
scheme yesterday. The number of repossessed homes for sale will continue to
depress the housing market for some months. At the end of last year lenders
still had 67,370 repossessed homes on their books after selling more than
47,000 properties in the year.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Midlands air route to US urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLANDS MPS yesterday pressed Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, to
give American Airlines special permission to operate daily services between
Birmingham and Chicago.
The politicians, led by Mrs Maureen Hicks, Conservative MP for Wolverhampton
North East, said the Midlands business community was anxious to see daily
transatlantic services from Birmingham. These are ruled out in the existing
UK-US bilateral air agreement. The MPs want Mr Rifkind to relax the rules.
Talks between UK and US officials start in Washington on Monday to review
the agreement.
British Airways has rights to operate a service from Birmingham to the US
but does not believe such flights would be profitable.
American Airlines is also seeking a licence to operate transatlantic flights
from Nashville, Tennessee, to London Stansted.
BA said yesterday it did not object to the UK granting rights to US carriers
to operate provincial services in Britain, provided UK airlines were offered
'something worthwhile' in return.
BA has urged that future air agreements with the US should be negotiated at
a European level, rather than on a bilateral basis.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, warned in Dallas this
week that the recession was prompting increasingly protectionist moves by
governments to shield their national carriers.
'I fear there will be more protectionism from governments over the next
year,' he said, singling out the UK government for preventing his airline
from flying between Chicago and Birmingham and between Nashville and
Stansted.
US carriers have also become concerned by the tougher attitude being adopted
by France and Germany to their bilateral agreements with the US.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Redwood challenges critics of Lloyd's structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER, DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, corp-orate affairs minister, yesterday hit out at Labour
calls to bring the Lloyd's of London insurance market under an independent
regulatory regime.
Speaking in response to allegations that Lloyd's syndicates had been
favouring working Names within the market by offloading bad risks on to
outside Names, Mr Redwoood said that advocates of change would first have to
demonstrate there had been 'failings' under the present structure. Names are
the individuals whose assets provide Lloyd's capital.
Mr Redwood accused Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City affairs spokeswoman, of
'jumping too many hurdles all at the same time' when calling for Lloyd's to
be brought within the terms of something similar to the Act which regulates
the rest of the City.
He suggested that if concerns about the malpractices were serious enough the
Names should take them to the Serious Fraud Office. But he added that there
was not enough evidence to suggest that a change in the market's regulatory
regime was needed.
The claims had been made by a group of Names, including Conservative MPs,
and prompted calls for an investigation in four parliamentary early day
motions by two Labour MPs, Mr Brian Sedgemore and Mr Dennis Skinner.
Earlier a delegation of Names, including Mr Paul Marland, Conservative MP
for Gloucester West, met Mr Redwood. It included the chairmen of three
action groups for syndicates suffering heavy losses as a result of
catastrophe claims, as well as Mr Marland, who was a member of syndicates
managed by Rose Thomson Young and Gooda Walker until his resignation from
Lloyd's early this year.
One member said Names on the catastrophe syndicates were facing losses of
more than Pounds 500m. The suggestions in the early-day motions that working
Names were being given preferential access to some better-performing
syndicates were dismissed as an 'unwarranted slur' by Mr David Coleridge,
chairman of Lloyd's.
Mr Coleridge said a recent report on Lloyd's by a market task force had
shown that in two of the last three underwriting years external members had
enjoyed higher re-turns than working members.
Insider syndicates - those on which working Names predominate - listed in
the the Labour motions were 45 (managed by the Bankside agency), 138
(Bailey), 179 (Anton), 183 (Ashley), 372 (Claremount), 431 (Wren), 960
(Sturge), 990 (Morgan), 994 (Kellett) and 1028 (Wellington). Four of these,
(179, 183, 990 and 1028) returned losses in 1988 (the last year for which
final figures are available).
According to Chatset, the group that provides independent analysis of
Lloyd's syndicates, over the most recently available six years only two of
the named syndicates (45 and 960) were among the top performers.
Mr Anthony Cooper, managing director of Wellington Underwriting, which
manages Syndicate 1028, said he was 'mystified and shocked' that one of the
his agency's syndicates was included on the list.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Surge in car-part investment reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VEHICLE components industry is being revitalised by a surge of inward
investment 'the like of which has not been seen for 40 years', according to
an Economist Intelligence Unit report.
The report identifies Japanese vehicle makers as leading the wave of
investment. They will have the capacity to produce more than 700,000 units a
year by 1995.
The report forecasts that the effect will be felt throughout Europe as
indigenous manufacturers are forced to adopt Japanese 'lean production'
methods to remain competitive.
Component makers will benefit as Japanese-style partnerships develop between
vehicle makers and suppliers, in contrast to the adversarial relationship
which has existed in Europe and north America.
The report warns that any component supplier which is only looking to Europe
is 'already behind in the race'.
It goes on: 'It is essential that the component manufacturers of the future
must be able to supply vehicle manufacturers on a global scale, wherever
their plants are situated.'
Highlighting the rationalisation which has taken place in the UK components
industry over the past decade, the report identifies the emergence of 'a
core of successful international players with a lean and efficient
manufacturing base and a global perspective'.
Among such groups 'breakeven is being steadily reined back, new partnerships
are spreading the spiralling burden of R&amp;D costs and a renewed drive for
quality is evident', the report says.
It warns that a number of other suppliers have yet to respond effectively to
the need for increased investment in research and development and other
resources, or make the changes in attitude necessary for survival.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Colliery accident investigation opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATIONS began yesterday into an accident 1,000ft underground at
Wearmouth Colliery, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear (above), in which two men died
and three were seriously injured, Chris Tighe writes.
The accident brings to three the death toll at the colliery since September.
Mr Davy Guy, north-east region president of the National Union of
Mineworkers, said that the union believed serious accidents in the coalfield
were increasing as the number of miners was cut and working hours
lengthened.
The accident happened as a train carrying 70 men to the coalface was
derailed and the locomotive and first carriage became wedged against the
tunnel roof.
Production at the 160-year-old pit was suspended as the Health and Safety
Executive's Mines Inspectorate, British Coal safety officials and the mining
unions started investigations into the accident.
Mr Guy said: 'There appears at the moment to be a greater emphasis on
productivity and profitability than on the health and safety of the people
who work in the industry.'
British Coal said the drive for increased productivity at pits had not led
to falling safety standards. The number of fatal accidents in the industry
had declined from 28 in 1985-86 to 11 in 1990-91. 'Modern mining is not only
more productive but far safer than it used to be,' British Coal said.
Wearmouth, the only colliery in the north-east with long-term prospects, is
undergoing a Pounds 17.5m investment to open up a seam under the sea. It is
loss-making at present because productivity has dropped due to geological
difficulties.
The dead men, both transport workers, were named as Mr Eric Evans, 36, of
Penshaw, Tyne and Wear, and Mr Gerard Sumby, 39, of Sunderland.
Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, said safety was paramount in the coal
industry. 'We need to know what lessons can be learnt from this dreadful
incident,' he added.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Prestwick Airport to be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airports operator, has agreed to sell Prestwick Airport in
south-west Scotland. The airport will be ultimately owned largely by a
consortium of local authorities and businessmen chaired by Mr George
Younger, the Conservative MP for Ayr.
Under a deal completed yesterday BAA will sell the airport to British
Aerospace, which manufactures civilian aircraft at Prestwick. BAe will sell
the airport facilities to Ayrshire Community Airport Project (Acap) but
retain the freehold of the runways, which it will lease to Acap.
BAA has wanted to sell Prestwick ever since the government removed its
monopoly on long-haul passenger flights from Scotland. Airlines using
Prestwick immediately moved their operations to Glasgow. Last year Prestwick
lost Pounds 4.8m on revenue of Pounds 5.1m.
Mr Younger said staff would have to be cut from 80 to 55. Employees of PIK,
the operating company to be formed by Acap, would be expected to accept
job-sharing, multi-skilling and flexibility. Former BAA staff would be given
priority in the allocation of posts.
Mr Younger said Prestwick would build on its airfreight business. It would
then hope to re-establish its charter business. He said he expected PIK to
make a profit in its first year.
BAe became involved in the transaction because it needed to safeguard
Prestwick's runway to maintain its manufacturing operation making the
Jetstream passenger aircraft. It also operates a flying school at Prestwick.
Under the deal it will acquire the freehold to its own plant at the airport.
If BAe ended manufacturing at Prestwick, Acap would have first refusal on
the sale of runway.
The cost is not being disclosed, although Acap said it was paying a
'substantial seven-figure sum'. Kyle and Carrick district council, the local
authority, is providing Pounds 1.5m for the purchase of the airport and
taking a stake in Acap.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Bush sacks Nasa chief over policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has been left
leaderless after President George Bush fired the former astronaut who had
headed it for the last three years.
Admiral Richard Truly commanded two space shuttle missions and then took
over the reeling shuttle programme after the explosion of the Challenger
rocket in 1986. He stepped into Nasa's top job in 1989.
He was asked to resign because of a widening rift with the Bush
administration over the space agency's role and aims.
Adm Truly has clashed repeatedly with the National Space Council, an
advisory committee headed by vice-president Dan Quayle which has overruled
Nasa decisions.
The sacking of Adm Truly will leave Nasa doubly bereft, in that the post of
Nasa deputy administrator has been empty since Mr James Thompson resigned in
November.
As a former astronaut, Adm Truly has been viewed as a staunch defender of
manned space flight in general, and of the shuttle programme in particular,
against those who Nasa's money to scientific programmes launched by cheaper,
throwaway rockets.
Nasa's budget is under increasing pressure. After years of double digit
increases, Congress authorised only a 3.5 per cent increase last year to
Dollars 14.3bn. The administration has asked for a 4.7 per cent increase to
Dollars 14.99bn this year.
Outside commissions have been critical of the agency's concentration on the
shuttle - which costs more per launch than a lower technology rocket and
cannot carry such large payloads.
Mr Quayle's council has now decreed that Nasa will order no more shuttles
after Endeavour, which is due to start flying this year as the fourth vessel
in Nasa's space fleet.
Instead, Nasa has been ordered to develop a new generation of unmanned space
launch vehicles.
However, Nasa and the Quayle council have teamed up to fight off outside
criticism, notably on the Dollars 40bn Freedom space station project.
Widely derided by the US scientific community for draining funds from other
more immediately useful scientific research, the space station has also been
attacked by a commission headed by Mr Thomas Stafford, a former Apollo
astronaut, which said it would be scarcely more advanced than Skylab,
launched in 1973 at a fraction of the cost.
Another commission headed by Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin
Marietta - one of the prime contractors for the shuttle and the space
station - also recommended downsizing the space station and shifting funds
to scientific projects.
Nasa claimed the Augustine report as an endorsement of the space station,
however, because it did not recommend its outright cancellation.

FT  14 FEB 92 / SEC rules on executive pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR executives' pay packets will come under tighter control from their
shareholders as a result of new rulings announced yesterday by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US capital markets regulator,
writes George Graham.
Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC chairman, said the new rulings would compel
companies to publish more and clearer information on the salaries and share
incentives paid to executives, and would prevent the barring of shareholder
resolutions on this subject.
Ten companies, including IBM, Bell Atlantic and Aetna Life and Casualty,
have been ordered to include shareholders' resolutions criticising
executives' pay or stock option packages on the ballots for their annual
general meetings this year.
The SEC has until now allowed companies to suppress such resolutions, taking
the view that executive compensation was a matter of 'ordinary business'. It
has now decided that the subject is a 'significant policy issue'.
The decision follows a wave of criticism of the bloated salaries many US
executives receive even when their companies are losing money. However, Mr
Breeden said resolutions may still only be advisory, since the law in many
states requires pay to be decided by the board of directors.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Rise in US retail sales gives hint of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US RETAIL sales jumped 0.6 per cent in January while previous months'
figures were revised sharply upwards, providing tentative evidence that the
economy is in better shape than some analysts feared.
At the same time sales figures from the leading car manufacturers for the
first 10 days of February were stronger than expected, suggesting a recovery
of demand in the car industry. Preliminary figures showed domestic car sales
running at a 6.4m annual rate, compared with the consensus forecast of 5.8m
and a 6.1m rate of sales in late January.
The revised sales figures - which do not allow for inflation - indicate that
retail sales were flat in November and December. That is a big improvement
on previous estimates, which pointed to declines of 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per
cent, suggesting the Christmas season was not quite as bleak as previously
portrayed.
On Wall Street, the stronger than expected sales figures dashed hopes of an
imminent cut in interest rates. Bond prices fell sharply and the dollar
gained ground against leading currencies. Shares price also fell sharply,
from record highs, on fears that monetary policy would not be eased in the
near future.
Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York said the
latest figures could lead to a significant upward revision to estimates of
growth in the fourth quarter.
Many analysts, however, will hesitate to place too much emphasis on the
retail figures. Figures for January can give a misleading signal of
underlying trends because retailers strive to clear surplus stocks after the
Christmas period.
Other statistics remain gloomy. Figures for industrial production in
January, due out tomorrow, are likely to show a sharp decline.
The January sales figures, however, showed evidence of a rebound in most
sectors. Car sales rose 0.4 per cent. Overall sales were 3.9 per cent higher
than in January last year, which was artificially depressed by the Gulf war.

Mr Peter Kalikow, the millionaire property developer and owner of the Post

INDIAN police yesterday used tear-gas in Srinagar, summer capital of the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, to disperse several thousand Kashmiris
defying a curfew to support a pro-independence march from the Pakistani side
of the disputed Himalayan region.
Police said 4,000 demonstrators stoned security forces trying to enforce the
indefinite curfew, imposed on Monday before the march started.
Pakistani troops this week thwarted volunteers of the Jammu and Kashmir
Liberation Front (JKLF) from crossing from the Pakistan-ruled part of
Kashmir into the region controlled by India.
In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, Mr Amanullah Khan, the JKLF leader, said he had
called off the march to avoid further loss of life. At least three people
were killed by police shooting on Wednesday amid pitched battles between
militants and Pakistani security forces. 'They told us frankly that anybody
who today, tomorrow or the day after tries to cross their barrier would be
shot,' Mr Khan said.
Pakistan banned the march because it feared an incursion along the United
Nations-monitored ceasefire line could lead to another conflict with India,
which had ordered troops guarding the line to let no one across.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Banks seek support for Algerian debt refinancing: A European
Community loan guarantee is at risk if there is no accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT international banks meet in Paris today to decide whether they have
sufficient support from 130 or so of their peers to proceed with a Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 840m) loan intended to refinance Algeria's principal
commercial bank debt between October 1 1991 and March 31 1993.
A total of Dollars 1.4bn out of Dollars 1.5bn was committed before the first
round on December 26 of Algeria's now cancelled elections and still
apparently is. But continuing reluctance of some lenders might delay the
completion of the package. Failure to reach agreement would endanger the
second and smaller disbursement of an Ecu400m (Pounds 287m) loan guarantee
agreed by the European Community last autumn. The guarantee was provided on
the understanding that commercial bank debt would be refinanced.
Under normal circumstances places could be taken by other private
institutions, but some banks made their commitment conditional on the deal
gaining support of all Algeria's commercial bank creditors. However, most
key banks are determined to ensure final success of the package.
The immediate consequence of the agreement to launch the refinancing reached
four months ago between the Algerian banks led by Credit Populaire d'Algerie
and the eight 'core group' of international banks led by Credit Lyonnais was
to allow Algeria to defer about Dollars 350m worth of principal repayments
which were owed to commercial banks in the last quarter of 1991.
But Algeria will need more than an agreement with its bankers if it is to
succeed in reducing what has been for four years a crippling repayment
burden. The ratio of debt service to exports was 74 per cent last year, 57
per cent of which was accounted for by repayments of principal.
Algeria can be likened to an oil company with a cash flow problem. The debt
is not large if related to export earnings of just over Dollars 12bn last
year and a projected Dollars 11.3bn in 1992, a figure due to rise as Algeria
opens its existing wells to foreign oil companies and increases its exports
of natural gas to European buyers such as Italy.
Rescheduling, which Algerian rulers are adamant they want to avoid, would
not only entail a loss of good credit standing but would be strongly opposed
by Japanese banks which are owed two-thirds of the country's bank debt.
Japan has also extended a balance of payments loan to Algeria and supported
co-financing with the World Bank. Altogether Japanese institutions probably
hold nearly as much Algerian paper as French ones.
The high debt service ratio is slowly but surely throttling private and
state industry. It has forced a sharp cut in imports. Many factories are
running at one-third of their capacity, laying off workers and running up
huge debts with Algerian banks as they are increasingly starved of raw
materials, semi-processed goods and spare parts.
Unemployment is nearly 50 per cent among the 16-24 age group, thus providing
fertile ground for the Islamic Salvation Front.
Roughly Dollars 5bn of Algeria's Dollars 23.9bn foreign debt is owed to
commercial banks, Dollars 3.5bn in the form of medium- terms loans, the
balance made up of 12-month trade finance. Credits from international
financial institutions account for Dollars 3.6bn, bond issues and lease
financings for Dollars 1.3bn each, with the remaining Dollars 15.3bn made up
of bilateral and supplier credits.
Nearly half this figure is accounted for by French government guaranteed
credits which France has, to date, insisted it will not consider
refinancing. This reluctance has proved a major obstacle to the policy of
refinancing its debt doggedly pursued by the Algerian authorities.
Whereas Italy offered Algeria Dollars 2.7bn to refinance state guaranteed
loans falling due between January 1991 and January 1993, France has been
adamant that it will do no such thing.
Senior officials acknowledge that a lender can easily refinance bilateral
military debt - hence France's agreement initialled with Iraq on the eve of
the invasion of Kuwait to refinance an estimated FFr50bn (Pounds 5.11bn)
worth of military credits guaranteed by the state credit guarantee
organisation, Coface. Unfortunately Algeria's estimated FFr36bn debt with
Coface is civilian and according to senior French Treasury officials not
susceptible to such treatment.
Senior members of the Ministry of Finance in Paris have been unconvinced of
the policy of refinancing, not least because they are fearful of creating a
precedent while their Ministry of Foreign Affairs colleagues are mindful of
extending a helping hand to a country that they feel is key to future French
interests at a time when it desperately needs support.
France will have to decide whether it considers Algeria's financial
stability to be one of its strategic interests, as the US did with Mexico
during the latter's 1982 debt crisis.
A move to support Algeria taken in Paris would undoubtedly strike a positive
response in other capitals, such as Brussels and Tokyo.

scandal. Investigators raided company offices and gangster haunts, and
hinted that they were following a trail of alleged bribery likely to lead to
the upper ranks of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Details of the Sagawa Kyubin Scandal have been common knowledge for several
months, and the first whispers were heard a year ago. But a scandal doesn't
become a Scandal in Japan until police and prosecutors, in the presence of
television cameras, go through the motions of a large-scale raid, signifying
to the nation that the game has begun.
For the moment, the targets of police questioning are two former executives
of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the country's second largest parcel delivery
company, and members of Inagawakai, the gangster group also entangled in the
securities industry scandals last year.
Prosecutors allege that the former Tokyo Sagawa executives, Mr Hiroyasu
Watanabe and Mr Jun Saotome, had abused their authority by organising Y528bn
(Pounds 2.32bn) in loans and guarantees, much of it for land and stock
speculation. And, the prosecutors suggest, some of the funds eventually came
to rest in the bank accounts of leading MPs, both government and opposition.
While prosecutors furnished showing the complex route followed by the parcel
company's money, Japanese were left wondering last night whether they would
eventually see another spate of political resignations or whether
prosecutors will be content to put a few allegedly corrupt executives in the
stocks.
The case resembles the Recruit Scandal of three years ago, when Recruit, a
business information company, was shown to have provided politicians and
executives with cut-price shares in return for assistance to the ambitious
and fast-expanding company.
Mr Noboru Takeshita was forced to resign as prime minister and the LDP was
badly bruised in an upper house election. Yet only two minor politicians
were indicted on bribery charges, and many implicated MPs have returned to
high office, including the present prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa.
The very public investigation is now focused on whether the two Tokyo Sagawa
executives violated the commercial code by allegedly raising the Y528bn in
funds between 1987 and mid-1991. Prosecutors say that more than Y100bn went
to companies associated with Inagawakai, the gangster group, which
apparently used the money for stock and property speculation in its shift
towards 'respectable' activities.
Whatever the investigation's outcome, the Sagawa Kyubin scandal again
emphasises to Japanese that the structure of the country's political system
makes corruption inevitable. The cost of being a politician, with
gift-giving and palm-greasing part of the daily routine, prompts unholy
alliances with shady executives and ambitious companies.
LDP officials hope the complexity of the case will keep prosecutors
preoccupied until after upper house elections due in July. Mr Miyazawa
announced he was 'aware that raids have taken place,' while the chief
cabinet secretary, Mr Koichi Kato, hoped that the investigation would be
'strict and fair' and that the opposition parties would not use the scandal
to delay the passing of budget bills.

FT  14 FEB 92 / January trade surplus rises four-fold to Dollars 3.84bn

JAPAN'S trade surplus for January recorded a four-fold year-on-year increase
to Dollars 3.84bn (Pounds 2.15bn), heightening government fears that world
trade tensions will rise in tandem with the surging surplus.
Customs-cleared figures released yesterday by the ministry of finance showed
rises in the politically-sensitive surpluses with the US and European
Community, and an overall 9.7 per cent rise to Dollars 23.94bn in exports
and a 3.8 per cent fall in imports to Dollars 20.10bn.
The seasonally-adjusted surplus for January was Dollars 8.37bn, up from
Dollars 7.95bn in December, with exports for the month rising 6.9 per cent
to Dollars 28.57bn, with imports 7.6 per cent higher at Dollars 20.20bn.
Japanese officials were particularly concerned by a 33 per cent increase in
the surplus with the EC, with exports to the region rising 12.4 per cent to
Dollars 5.1bn and imports only 0.2 per cent higher at Dollars 2.9bn.
Automobile exports to the EC rose 24 per cent on the same month last year,
while purchases of EC luxury goods continued to plunge, with imports of art
works down 84.6 per cent. Meanwhile, Japanese car exports to the US fell
12.3 per cent on a year earlier.
Japan's total exports to the US rose 1 per cent to Dollars 6.7bn, while
imports from the US were 0.3 per cent higher at Dollars 4.3bn. Imports of
aircraft were sharply higher and imports of cars rose 15 per cent, providing
some evidence for Tokyo that demand for US-made cars is on the rise.
Ms Chiharu Shima, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the slowing of
domestic demand has encouraged Japanese companies to increase their exports,
and the threat of US criticism has prompted some companies to target the
European market.
'Some of the large increase in January can be explained by currency
fluctations and lower energy prices, but you shouldn't underestimate the
longer-term effects of weak domestic demand,' Ms Sumita said.
The largest increases in Japanese exports were seen in transport machinery
(up 13.5 per cent), electric machines (up 10.2 per cent), and precision
instruments (up 10.2 per cent). Japan's imports of textiles rose 16.6 per
cent and of foodstuffs by 14 per cent.
Trade with the newly-industrialised economies (NIEs) of Asia expanded
modestly during the period after strong growth for much of last year.
However, exports to China were 39.4 per cent higher than the same month last
year, and imports from China rose 14.9 per cent.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Gap grows between US and Israel over loan guarantees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDE gap has opened between Israel and the US over Washington's terms for
granting Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan guarantees to fund immigration
absorption. This has deflated government optimism that it could win the
assistance without compromising its commitment to expand Jewish settlements
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Tough positions taken by Washington on the issue in recent days have led
officials in Mr Yitzhak Shamir's government to suspect that the US is
deliberately holding back to undermine the ruling Likud party in the
approach to the June 23 general election.
The Likud badly wants to secure the loan guarantees to help it cope with the
severe economic strains caused by mass Jewish immigration from the former
Soviet Union. They are the key to securing more than Dollars 20bn in foreign
borrowing over the next five years needed to cover the costs of immigration.
Winning the guarantees would blunt damaging opposition attacks on the
government's handling of the economy. But Mr Shamir is extremely reluctant
to back down on the Likud's refusal to freeze settlement building as the US
is demanding.
The US is prepared to accept the completion of houses already under
construction in the settlements. But in the last week it has dropped to
6,000 from 9,000 the number it believes to be under construction, less than
half the number Israel has claimed.
It intends in addition to deduct a sum from the loan guarantees equivalent
to sums spent by Israel on the settlements and has also signalled that it
will include in a freeze Jewish construction in Arab East Jerusalem which
Israel treats as part of Israel proper.
These conditions have forced Mr Shamir to restate publicly his rejection of
a freeze, but it is clear he still wants to do a deal. His office said
yesterday he still believed a compromise was possible.
Israel's police minister, Mr Ronni Milo, said yesterday a police
investigation had cleared interrogators of wrongdoing in the case of a
Palestinian detainee whose death in custody last week was said by a US
pathologist to have been brought on by maltreatment in jail. Mr Mustafa
Abdullah Awaki died of a heart attack, but Dr Michael Baden, a New York
police pathologist who attended the autopsy, said his death was triggered by
beatings, sleep deprivation, being held hooded and shackled for long spells
in freezing temperatures and inadequate medical attention.

AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate dropped in January to 10.3 per cent from a
record 10.6 per cent in December, and the ruling Labor government yesterday
suggested that the recession may have bottomed-out.
The official Statistics Bureau reported that the number of unemployed fell
to 886,100 in January from 910,300 in December. Full-time employment rose by
almost 47,000 in January, the second consecutive month it has increased.
Mr Kim Beazley, the employment minister, said the figures were supported by
leading indicators suggesting steady employment levels. 'These probably
indicate that the recession has bottomed-out.'
However, Mr Beazley warned of some factors that might substantially change
the trend in the coming months. He said the shift in strong retail sales
from pre-Christmas to the January stocktaking season may not have been
picked-up by the seasonal adjustment procedures used by the Statistics
Bureau. There were also the thousands of school-leavers in December who were
expected to enter the labour market.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, is committed to defend the gains
achieved so far through fiscal expansion, and the top priority in his
economic statement set for February 26 will be employment-creating growth.

ALGERIANS were warned last night the security forces would show no mercy if

The Interior Ministry warning, broadcast on Algiers Radio, came on the eve
of a threatened mass demonstration in Algiers by followers of the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), which is outlawed under a state of emergency
proclaimed last week.
The broadcast said the security forces were determined to 'find and
neutralise all terrorists and authors of unrest and subversive acts'.
This latest warning followed an attack yesterday on a guard post at a naval
repair yard in Algiers in which one guard died and two others were wounded.
Algiers Radio reported that two of the assailants were killed in an exchange

FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Heavyweights of power slug it out -
Winning is everything for three giants in generating equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW power struggle is developing in a business where the global battle for
contracts has never been one for the faint-hearted, and where victory is
always a heavy blow for the losers.
Europe's big three suppliers of power generating equipment - GEC Alsthom,
Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri - are slugging it out, with the help of
powerful allies, for leadership of the world market for combined-cycle gas
turbine power stations, the fastest-growing sector of the thermal power
generation market.
Widespread availability of natural gas, environmental pressures, and the
need for greater efficiency and shorter lead-times have turned
combined-cycle generation into the preferred system of power supply for many
utilities in the 1990s.
Spurred indirectly by heavy spending on aerospace gas turbines, the
combined-cycle process uses the waste gases from a heavy-duty gas turbine to
power a secondary steam turbine, raising thermal efficiency well above 50
per cent.
For the first time, therefore, large power stations are producing more power
than they lose - the best coal-fired plants typically have a thermal
efficiency of about 40 per cent.
All three companies are spending heavily to remain competitive in a market
with big growth potential. Mr Klaus Riedle, head of Siemens' KWU power
generation business, says worldwide orders for combined cycle could reach
250 gigawatts this decade - around four times the power output of the
electricity companies in England and Wales.
So far this year there has been a spate of combined-cycle orders for power
stations from North Wales to Jakarta, and most of the laurels have gone to
GEC Alsthom.
Last week, the Anglo-French group announced it had been chosen as main
contractor for PowerGen's 1,360MW station at Connah's Quay in North Wales.
That followed closely on another big UK order in east London, and a contract
for a 1,700MW station in the north of the Netherlands, one of the largest
outside Japan. The fourth big order this year, for a 1,170MW combined cycle
oil/gas fired plant near Jakarta, went to ABB.
Executives of GEC Alsthom and their 90 per cent-owned European Gas Turbines
(EGT) unit are cock-a-hoop about their run of victories, claiming they are
establishing a clear lead with the help of the world's largest turbine, a
212-226MW machine developed jointly with General Electric of the US. Mr
Kelvin Bray, EGT's chairman and chief executive, believes the company has a
technology lead of some two years over its rivals, and says the GE-GEC
Alsthom 9F turbine is the most efficient in the world with a 54 per cent
rating.
Rivals agree that the odd 1 per cent of thermal efficiency could make a
difference in markets where orders are decided on technology rather than
availability of finance, but neither Siemens and ABB are willing to accept
GEC Alsthom has established a lead.
At Siemens, Mr Riedle shrugs off the loss of the Connah's Quay order as
'merely technical.'
The German company had snapped up two large contracts from PowerGen over the
past two years, but all utilities, he says, like to spread their orders.
Mr Goran Lundberg, head of ABB's power plants business, says the
Swiss-Swedish group is at the same level as GEC Alsthom in thermal
efficiency. 'We will be up to 55 per cent in a while,' he says. 'We remain
rather confident.'
The arguments over efficiency might yet turn into a sterile propaganda war
with few returns for any of the three players. None of them, after all,
expect it to be easy to push efficiency much beyond 55 per cent. Even so,
utilities which are particularly responsive to technology arguments could
still be persuaded by a small thermal efficiency advantage, says Mr Riedle.
The three European rivals cannot, perhaps, be blamed for trying to establish
technology leadership when there is little to chose between them otherwise.
'I don't think anybody's going to be dominant,' says Mr Robert McCoy of
McCoy Power Reports in the US. 'Their technologies are fairly close, and
nobody has leapfrogged. They all have a solid base of experience, modern
manufacturing capability, and about the same delivery times.'
All three, too, have plenty of experience in turnkey contracting, which is
becoming increasingly important for customers who no longer want the
responsibility and financial risk of such a role. And they all have links,
to a greater or lesser extent, with aerospace turbine research, which some
believe gives them an advantage over the other big world player, the
Mitsubishi/Westinghouse partnership. If the forecasts prove correct, there
will be plenty of opportunities for all four rivals to score some points
over each other.
But GE and GEC Alsthom are emerging as the team that the others have to
beat.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Premier aims to shape a new model for Sweden: David Marsh
and Robert Taylor interview the Swedish prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARL BILDT, Sweden's Conservative prime minister, is a 42-year-old
intellectual who combines the looks of a technocratic college boy with the
zeal of a revolutionary.
The 'Swedish model' forged through 60 years of Social Democrat-dominated
social welfare and state corporatism is dead. Mr Bildt, in office since
October, is presiding over a free-market programme of economic and social
reform designed to restore the country's lost dynamism.
He is trying to break the mould in foreign policy, too. On his way to the US
for an official visit next week, he observes drily that Americans have grown
used to Swedish government leaders 'aligning themselves with revolutionary
tendencies in the third world'.
But Mr Bildt wants to end Sweden's semi-isolation from the rest of Europe
and even talks of his country becoming an 'active player' in collective
European security.
During an interview this week, Mr Bildt did not hide the size of the
challenges. Weathering its second successive year of economic contraction,
Sweden is undergoing its worst recession since the 1920s. Traditionally-low
Swedish unemployment is set to rise sharply this year from 3 to 5 per cent.
He insists there can be no turning back on his ambitious plans for cutting
taxes, privatising state industry and restoring incentives for wealth
creation. After two decades in the economic doldrums, his objective is to
put Sweden on track for a 3 per cent-plus growth rate from the mid-1990s
onwards.
Mr Bildt likes to quote a phrase made famous in Britain during the rule of
Mrs Margaret Thatcher - a politician he admires far less than German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 'There is no alternative,' he expounds. 'Look at the
other possible ways. Subsidising industry - no-one thinks it works. We tried
devaluation - that was wrong. The Social Democrats now are proposing more
taxes and more spending. They don't seriously believe in it themselves.'
Heading a four-party government without a parliamentary majority, Mr Bildt
has surprised even his friends by his skill in easing coalition strains and
giving his administration a sense of purpose. He has so far lived up to his
election promises to promote budgetary austerity. And he plans to confront
the power of Sweden's huge public service sector with radical plans to curb
spending and improve efficiency.
Most striking of all, he is on a collision course with Volvo, Sweden's
largest company, over its plan to take over Procordia, the diversified
conglomerate jointly owned by the state and the Gothenburg-based carmaker.
Sweden's industrialists have welcomed Mr Bildt. But by rejecting Volvo's bid
for a company which is high on the government's list of privatisation
candidates, Mr Bildt has sent a signal to the boardrooms that the old style
of doing business is no longer acceptable.
Chastising Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, for trying to push the
deal through without full consultation, Mr Bildt remarks: 'We do things
somewhat differently under this government.'
Mr Bildt's missionary enthusiasm extends to the goal of European
integration. He envisages Sweden eventually leading a 'Nordic revival' -
both by entering the European Community and strengthening ties to the
emerging democracies of the east, particularly the Baltic states and the St
Petersburg region of Russia.
Sweden's change of heart on Europe was signalled by the previous Social
Democrat administration, which applied to join last July. Mr Bildt has kept
up the momentum to make Sweden a full member by January 1 1995. This
involves a painful period of adjustment - and the tightest of timetables.
Constitutional requirements mean that the country needs an agreement on
accession by December 1993, nine months before the next general election.
Otherwise, the earliest date for EC membership would be delayed until 1998.
The government wants early membership of the European Monetary System -
perhaps as soon as the end of 1993.
Mr Bildt brushes aside the suggestion that Swedish voters will see his
pro-Europe policies as the basic cause of rising unemployment - an outcome
which could cause rejection of EC membership in the referendum planned for
1994. 'I don't see the risk they will blame Europe. They will blame the
government,' he declares. Staying true to his European convictions, he adds:
'And that will be a relief.'

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government was accused yesterday of presiding over the
de-industrialisation of former East Germany, and failing to develop a
coherent industrial policy to protect it. The charge was made by opposition
speakers, who blamed the government for over-optimism about recovery in the
east, and for underestimating the cost of its collapse for the western
economy.
Members of the government insisted recovery was on the way, and accused the
opposition of blocking tax reforms to gain electoral advantage, although all
the benefit would go to the east.
The angry exchanges dominated the parliamentary debate on the government's
annual economic report, and on the parallel debate about tax reforms,
currently deadlocked between the two houses of parliament.
The increasingly bitter German economic debate takes place against a
background of conflicting conclusions about the east German economy, with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his colleagues talking about recovery within five
years, while economists say it will take 20 years or more to catch up with
the west. The latest study by the Prognos institute in Basle (for the
federal Economics Ministry) predicts that by 2010, per capita GNP in the
east will be about 87 per cent that in the west.
Mr Wolfgang Roth, economics spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats
(SPD), said east Germany was threatened with 'broad stretches of
de-industrialisation'. The government was presiding over a 'catastrophic
development' in eastern industry, because it refused to draw up a coherent
industrial policy.
He called for a coherent, and legally-based, rehabilitation policy for the
Treuhand agency, which has hitherto concentrated overwhelmingly on
privatisation of east German industry.
He also called for a specific policy of public support for
'structurally-essential' industries, to prevent entire industrial areas from
closing. And he proposed a 'co-operation policy' to bring together central
government, the state governments, employers, unions and the Treuhand, to
agree on common policies.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, repeated his plea to unions and
employers to show restraint in the current wage round to bring inflation
back below 4 per cent.

manufactured goods and plant utilisation in factories back to mid-1988
levels, according to figures from the Ifo economics institute in Frankfurt.
Industrialists expect stagnation 'at best' for the coming months, the
institute says, and they are increasingly doubtful that use of existing
capacity will reach 'satisfactory' levels in the year ahead. Investment
goods makers, for example, which are now working at 84.8 per cent capacity,
expect continuing contraction.
The new data and opinions, assembled by Ifo from its regular business
surveys, suggest that hopes of improvement depend more on increased overseas
demand than any domestic upswing.
The delicacy of the economic balance is underscored by a claim from the DIW
institute in Berlin that west Germany's real gross national product fell by
half a percentage point in the last quarter of 1991. If confirmed, this
would be the third decline in succession.
'The latest industrial orders figures show that the western economy is going
through a difficult phase,' DIW says in a report today. The institute, a
recognised authority on east Germany, also claims that real GNP in the east
fell 30 per cent last year, compared with the hitherto accepted estimate of
20 per cent.
The correction stems partly, it says, from the discovery that increases in
construction industry output have been 'clearly over-estimated'.
Construction is one of the main motors driving the eastern economy towards
officially forecast growth of 10 per cent this year.
The DIW also accused the Treuhand privatisation agency of increasing
liquidity loans to its ailing east German companies this year instead of
using the money to modernise and restructure them.
The institute said the Treuhand should stop guaranteeing liquidity loans to
companies which were using them for 'uncontrollable purposes'. Instead,
investment loans and company capitalisation should be increased - up to a
fixed limit - and be tied to the level of non-guaranteed bank loans obtained
by companies. They should also have to achieve profitability by a set date.
According to the DIW, DM9.9bn, nearly a third of the Treuhand's budget, went
toward restructuring its companies last year, while DM4.5bn was spent on
guaranteed liquidity loans. These were largely used to pay wages, salaries
and other running costs. This year the Treuhand plans to guarantee DM8bn in
liquidity loans while boosting restructuring funds to only DM11.5bn, said
DIW.
It proposed that, instead of subsidising wages, the Treuhand should give
decreasing wage subsidies for a limited period to companies which are to be
restructured. It also suggested that old debts of companies be cancelled and
transferred to the federal budget. Both Bonn and the Treuhand recently
suggested that the east German state governments might want to invest in
large companies which could not otherwise be rescued. But the governments
themselves almost totally depend on funds from Bonn which faces a myriad of
financial demands from east Germany.
IG Metall union officials yesterday dropped a threat of mass protests
against a merger of Fried. Krupp and Hoesch after a last-minute deal with
Krupp giving workers 10 seats on the 20-seat supervisory board of the
enlarged steel group, Reuter reports from Bonn. The board will not have a
further 'neutral' member as other steel concerns do.

FT  14 FEB 92 / UN troops set to march to different tunes: Conflicting
Yugoslav views about the forces' role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRING a complete breakdown of the ceasefire, more than 10,000 United
Nations peacekeeping troops will soon be on their way to the former Yugoslav
republic of Croatia.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, has managed to secure agreement for their
deployment from Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, Croatia's President
Franjo Tudjman, and the federal army. Mr Milan Babic, head of the
self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in south-western Croatia, has
yet to fully commit himself.
Under terms proposed last December, it was suggested that the UN force would
consist of about 10 infantry battalions, 100 military observers, 500 police
monitors, and necessary civilian and military support. These would be
deployed in three areas in Croatia to be designated as UN Protected Areas
(UNPAs).
It is in these regions - eastern and western Slavonia, eastern and central
Croatia, and the Serb enclave of Krajina - where Serbs form either a
majority or a substantial minority, and where tensions between Serbs and
Croats have led to local civil wars.
As a means of stabilising the areas, the UN wants to demilitarise them
rapidly; withdraw, disband, or demobilise all armed forces; and protect
people living there from attack.
The UN is insisting that Croatia's territorial defence units, and other
units in the UNPAs, must hand over all weapons to the federal army,
Croatia's National Guard, or to UN forces; that all units of the federal
army be relocated outside Croatia; and that all Serbian territorial,
paramilitary, irregular and volunteer units not from the region withdraw
from Croatia.
Finally, the maintenance of public order in the UNPAs will be the
responsibility of local police forces who would reflect the national
composition of the local population, and who lived in the region before the
conflict broke out on June 25.
Having learned from the 14 ceasefires brokered by the European Community, UN
negotiators have ironed out all possible ambiguities in the text for
deploying troops. Nevertheless, all sides in the conflict hold different
views about the UN's goals.
The Croatian government wants the troops in the republic for a minimum
period to restore stability which would facilitate local, parliamentary and
presidential elections. The UN has said its mandate will be reviewed every
six months.
Croat officials also believe that any extended UN presence would cement the
gains of Serb militants and Serbia at the expense of regaining for Croatia
that third of its territory held by the federal army.
For this reason, Zagreb wants the UN mandate to include helping Croatia
regain all its territory. The UN has repeatedly stated that any deployment
of troops 'would not prejudge the outcome of political negotiations for a
comprehensive settlement of the Yugoslav crisis'. That remains the EC's
task.
Serbia wants the UN troops deployed not only because maintaining the federal
army has become too expensive, but also because Mr Milosevic believes the UN
will consolidate some Serbian gains. However, the growing consensus among
Croat and Serb liberals is that Serb militants in certain regions in Croatia
will quit once the federal army, their supporter, withdraws.
As for Mr Babic, he fears for the safety of Serbs in Krajina if local Serbs
disarm. In a letter yesterday to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, he warned that the safety of UN troops could not be
guaranteed.
Western diplomats in Belgrade believe the longer the delay in deploying the
troops the greater the chance of the ceasefire collapsing, and all sides
hardening.

FT  14 FEB 92 / CIS bobs on the nationalist tide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin arrives in Minsk today laden with political baggage.
The meeting of Commonwealth of Independent States leaders brings together
men who will ostensibly seek ways of furthering CIS interests, but who are
actually immersed in the inevitably divisive process of building nations.
Mr Yeltsin is well aware of the nationalist voices in the CIS. He has
recently heard them on his own doorstep in Moscow. But Russia, as heir
apparent to most of the central structures and foreign policy of the former
Soviet Union, has an inherent interest in sustaining the Commonwealth. The
Minsk meetings are essential for maintaining some form of collective command
system and also to keep the CIS together - without momentum, the parts may
separate.
This means that little can be expected from the Commonwealth and that
everything depends on the political forces which succeed in articulating
national concerns.
At the centre is Russia. Mr Yeltsin has promised that Russia has ceased to
be imperial in its thinking; but he is hard pressed by politicians with a
different aim.
Last weekend, two kinds of opposition forces held gatherings in Moscow. The
first were the reconstituted Communists, demanding the end of a government
which had brought ruin to the people. They attracted large numbers but are
hampered by their ideology: the leaders are nostalgic for Soviet communism,
yet marching with them were various Russian nationalists waving the old
Imperial standard and the St Andrew's Cross. There is little doubt that it
is the nation, not the Union or communism, to which most people now look.
More coherent was a two-day conference of 'patriotic' organisations, led by
the small Christian Democrat and Constitutional Democrat (Cadet) parties.
Delegates met to express their frustration with the disintegration of the
Russian Federation into ethnic and territorial entities claiming
independence, and to point to the isolation of the Russians in other
republics.
Though he was not invited, Mr Dmitri Vasiliev emerged as a dominating
personality. He is leader of Pamyat (Memory), an overtly racist organisation
which claims to be the leader of the patriotic movement by its early
articulation of the theme of a Russia threatened by cosmopolitan culture and
capital - dominated of course by international Jewry.
Other speakers inveighed against those radicals who have proposed that
Russia must allow its separate national groupings a national statehood
within the federation - as Mr Yeltsin once did, in his period of opposition
to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev.
A FURTHER dilution of the economic reform programme was signalled yesterday
by Mr Boris Yeltsin, writes John Lloyd. He told parliament: 'It's clear we
need a range of measures, which cannot be delayed, to stimulate our economic
programme.'
Ministers believe the changes so far decreed - by a cut in the 28 per cent
rate of VAT to nil on canteen meals and to 15 per cent on a range of food
and other products, coupled with profit limits - are regrettable but will
not fundamentally affect their ability to cut the vast budget deficit.
However, any further decisions to increase wages and state benefits, coupled
with further reductions of taxes, would, they believe, break the budget and
destroy reform.
Mr Yeltsin also announced, to deputies' laughter, that his conservative vice
president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, had been 'entrusted with the task of
overseeing agricultural reform'. Agriculture is the portfolio used to bury
political opponents in a morass of problems incapable of solution.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Labour will keep personal equity plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party has given an explicit commitment that it will not abolish
personal equity plans if it wins the election. Peps allow individuals to
shelter a limited amount of equity investments from capital gains tax and
income tax.
Mr Chris Smith, a Labour treasury spokesman, told the Financial Times: 'We
believe Peps do have a role to play within the savings and investment
market.
'We don't necessarily share the present government's view that they are the
best thing since sliced bread, but nonetheless they have their uses, and we
don't have any intention of sweeping them away.'
Another Labour spokesman said: 'We have no plans to abolish Peps or
substantially change the way in which they operate.'
Labour has maintained the option of abolishing Peps since they were
introduced without making any direct commitment.
It had always said, however, that tax reliefs on existing Peps would be
honoured and that no changes would be made retrospectively.
However, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokesman, told a trade newspaper
last year 'we would not continue the tax relief to Peps'. She now supports
the policy suggested by Mr Smith.
Mr Smith has signalled the evolution in Labour's attitude in recent
interviews and has told fund managers involved in marketing Peps that he did
not want to abolish them.
Peps, introduced by the then chancellor Mr Nigel Lawson in his 1986 Budget,
have been available since January 1987.
The maximum investment in a standard Pep in any one tax year is Pounds
6,000, and an additional Pounds 3,000 can be put into a Pep which holds
shares in only one company. A maximum of Pounds 3,000 of the Pep allowance
can be held in unit and investment trusts.
Mr Smith remains critical of how Peps operate, because they act as a strong
incentive for direct equity investment.
He said: 'What we might wish to consider, and this obviously depends on the
economic circumstances at the time, is bringing up other forms of savings to
match the kind of benefits that Peps have at the moment.'
He said this could be similar to the extended Pep or 'XPep' advocated by the
Institute of Fiscal Studies. These could include cash deposits, bonds or
collective funds.
By the end of the 1990-91 tax year, 1.47m plans had been taken out, in which
Pounds 3.88bn had been invested since 1987.
Heavy demand this year, fuelled by the widespread belief that Labour would
abolish Peps, is expected to lead to a strong increase over the Pounds 1.6bn
invested in them in 1990-91.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Recession drives Ford to record Pounds 920m loss in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, suffered a record Pounds 920m loss on its ordinary
activities in the UK last year.
The figure, before extraordinary gains, includes losses of Pounds 450m
associated with Ford's takeover two years ago of Jaguar, the UK luxury car
producer, and compares with a loss of Pounds 274m a year earlier.
Hit by the recession and steep fall in new car sales in the UK, Ford of
Britain's net loss for the year was Pounds 590m after taking account of
Pounds 330m of extraordinary gains.
Of this, Pounds 290m came from the transfer of ownership of Jaguar to its US
parent company last November and Pounds 40m from the sale of its loss-making
Ford New Holland tractor operations to Fiat of Italy.
The heavy losses announced yesterday have forced Ford of the US to pump
Pounds 390m into Ford of Britain to shore up the UK company's balance sheet.
Ford of the US has injected Pounds 100m in new equity capital, with the
remainder coming through the Jaguar transfer.
Excluding Jaguar, Ford of Britain fell to a loss on ordinary activities of
Pounds 470m last year from a Pounds 61m profit in 1990.
The scale of the losses by Ford, the UK new car market leader, will
intensify the pressure from UK carmakers on the government to take urgent
action in next month's Budget to stimulate car sales.
Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman and managing director, insisted
yesterday that the company was not 'playing politics' by bringing forward
publication of its results from the normal date of mid-May. However, he said
that 'we do think that the government should take action to stimulate the
market'.
New car sales in the UK have plummeted by 31 per cent in the past two years,
while commercial vehicle sales have fallen by 43.7 per cent.
The speed of the decline in UK new vehicle demand and the depth of the
recession took Ford by surprise. Ford vehicle stocks climbed to unacceptable
levels last year, forcing it into an expensive price war.
Worldwide, Ford plunged into a net loss of Dollars 2.258bn last year from a
net profit a year earlier of Dollars 860m, according to results announced
yesterday.
The US recession and competition from Japanese carmakers have hit American
producers hard. Chrysler last week announced a net loss for 1991 of Dollars
795m, compared with a net profit of Dollars 68m in 1990. General Motors, the
world's biggest vehicle maker, is expected to announce losses of several
billion dollars later this month.
Ford of Europe's automotive operations, including Jaguar, slumped to a
Dollars 1.079bn net loss last year from a Dollars 145m net profit in 1990
and a Dollars 1.19bn profit in 1989.

FT  14 FEB 92 / BP ruffles the City with an unchanged final dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Horton, chairman of British Petroleum, disappointed the company's
shareholders yesterday by declaring an unchanged final dividend for 1991.
The move, after weeks of speculation about BP's dividend policy, pushed the
share price 10p lower to 274p.
The final payment of 4.2p a share brought the 1991 total to 16.8p, a 4.7 per
cent increase, which Mr Horton argued was roughly in line with inflation.
Some institutional shareholders plan to take up the issue of the company's
dividend policy with Mr Horton (pictured above) in coming weeks.
Mr Horton said he wanted to 'knock firmly on the head' any suggestion that
there was a board split over the dividend decision. There was no division,
he said.
The unchanged dividend was coupled with results BP called 'extremely
disappointing.' Pre-tax profits for the fourth quarter, hit by plunging oil
prices, dived on a replacement cost basis from Pounds 456m to Pounds 72m.
Full-year profits were Pounds 1.04bn, down 14 per cent from Pounds 1.2bn.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Unemployment shows sharp rise: Accumulation of poor economic
figures increases pressure for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in un-employment last month delivered a blow yesterday to
Conservative confidence about the economy.
The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose to 2.6m, the highest for four
years.
Together with news of record house repossessions and a big fall in
manufacturing investment last year, the unemployment figures increased the
pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to respond to the severity of
the 18-month recession with an early cut in interest rates and action to
help the economy in next month's Budget.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in January by 53,000, nearly twice the
figure expected in the City and the biggest monthly increase since August.
The increase brought to just over 1m the headline count of job losses since
unemployment started rising in March 1990.
Repossession of homes by mortgage lenders reached more than 75,000 in 1991,
while factories cut their capital spending by 15 per cent compared with the
previous 12 months.
There were angry exchanges in the Commons, where Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour
leader, said the unemployment figures were 'devastating' and accused the
government of having caused the recession.
He made clear that Labour would keep the government's economic record at the
heart of the general election campaign.
While Mr John Major, the prime minister, acknowledged that the unemployment
figures were 'disappointing', other government ministers hinted that the
March 10 Budget, as well as cutting income tax, would include measures to
help the unemployed. The 22nd consecutive monthly rise in unemployment means
that 9.2 per cent of the workforce were without jobs last month, up from 9
per cent in December, and marks an apparent quickening in the pace of
unemployment.
The figures follow announcements of big job losses across industry, and
indications of a decline in business confidence - which some believe may put
back an upturn until well into this year.
Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, a US securities
house, said: 'A lot of companies are giving up the ghost on any early
recovery, and are moving to cut costs by shedding labour.'
One piece of good news for Mr Lamont was that the index of underlying
earnings across the economy rose in the 12 months to December by 7 1/4 per
cent, compared with the November figure of 7 1/2 per cent. The rise, the
smallest since the late 1960s, underlines the decline in inflationary
pressures, which the government believes will lead on to a sustained
recovery.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said he had 'no doubt at all' that
the Budget measures would help boost employment. Mr John Maples, a Treasury
minister, said the tax burden would continue to fall 'this year and next',
as it had done since 1981.
But the prime minister faced strong attacks from both Mr Kinnock and Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, over his refusal to introduce an
emergency package of measures to stimulate the economy.
As Mr Major insisted that the government's strategy had laid the foundations
for sustained economic recovery, some ministers joined a growing chorus of
calls from backbench Conservative MPs for an immediate cut in interest
rates.
Senior ministers said that the cabinet was determined to 'keep its nerve',
predicting that the Conservatives would return to the campaign offensive
with an attack next week on Labour's plans to overturn its trade union
reforms.

Andrew Bogle has joined British Gas as head of supply and demand management,
from Cookson, the industrial materials group, where he was strategic

Bogle's role of monitoring short-term gas supply and planning for the longer
term is even more pressing in today's climate of tight gas supplies. British
Gas recently warned of severe shortages by 1994, although the government's
decision last month to allow gas imports could alleviate that problem.

Sir Peter has been vice-chairman of the committee since 1985, and his
appointment to the most senior executive position follows the group's
tradition of picking its senior executive alternately from its Dutch and
British companies.
However, since Sir Peter will be 60 later this year, his tenure at the top
will be much shorter than in the case of van Wachem who will have been
chairman for seven years when he steps down on June 30. Cornelius
Herkstroter, 55, will succeed van Wachem as president of Royal Dutch
Petroleum, and will also become vice-chairman of the committee of group
managing directors, making him Sir Peter's heir apparent.
On his retirement, van Wachem will become chairman of the supervisory board
of Royal Dutch Petroleum. The British and Dutch arms of Royal Dutch/Shell
each provide three group managing directors and van Wachem will be replaced
on the joint committee by Martin van den Bergh, 50, who also becomes a
managing director of Royal Dutch Petroleum from July 1 1992.
An economics graduate, van den Bergh joined Shell International Petroleum in
London in 1968 as a finance trainee and between 1969 and 1979 worked in
Japan, Venezuela and Indonesia. Since 1989 he has been based in London as
regional co-ordinator Western Hemisphere and Africa and a director of Shell
International. He will be the youngest group managing director on the joint
committee. Mark Moody-Stuart, the most recent British addition to the
committee, is 52.

FT  14 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt preoccupied with
Bayer's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUAL situations took the lead on a number of bourses yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT heard talk that Bayer might cut its DM13 dividend for 1991 and the
shares dropped DM6.10, or 2 per cent, to DM294.20. Hoechst and BASF followed
with falls of DM3 to DM248, and DM1.60 to DM245 respectively.
Mr Edgar Bennischeck, head of equity dealing at Bank Julius Bar in
Frankfurt, said that Bayer had been dealer-led this week, moving from hopes
of a scrip issue on Monday, through Tuesday's shift from overweight to
underweight by Deutsche Bank Research.
Julius Bar likes Bayer for its pharmaceuticals content, sees a rise in
earnings per share this year, and has it on an estimated DVFA p/e of just
over 10, compared with over 12 for BASF and over 11 for Hoechst.
The DAX index closed 2.47 higher at 1,681.39 after a 3.15 rise to 687.24 for
the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose from DM5.8bn to DM6bn, Thyssen figuring
among active stocks as it rose DM4.10 to DM226.40 on Thyssen Stahl's first
product price rise since April 1990.
Elsewhere Metallgesellschaft's DM6.30 drop to DM399 left it DM27.80 down
this week. On Tuesday, it reported an earnings drop from DM23.50 to DM10.30
a share, a shock in spite of progressively bearish indications over the past
12 months.
MILAN had a patchy day as traders completed their position squaring ahead of
the close of the account today. Residual selling linked to the previous
day's options expiry also had a depressing effect. The Comit index fell 4.38
to 533.95 in turnover estimated at around L110bn, unchanged from Thursday's
higher-than-expected level.
Banks fell 1.25 per cent as investors started to raise cash ahead of the
large Dollars 1.5bn San Paolo share offering, details of which emerged
yesterday. The offering of 125m ordinary shares in San Paolo, 20 per cent of
its capital, is to take place between March 16 and March 20, lead managed by
Mediobanca, with SG Warburg and Hambros joint leads in the UK. The shares
are expected to be attractively priced between L12,000 and L14,000.
Dealers expected the sector to weaken further. Among the larger stocks,
Banca Commerciale Italiana lost L55 to L3,973 and Credito Italiano fell L33
to L2,115. Credito Varesino closed L420 or 7.6 per cent down at L5,080
following the previous day's news that it would be incorporated by its
parent Banca Popolare di Bergamo.
The insurance sector was also weak, with the exception of Alleanza, which
rose L10 to L13,000 in good volume in anticipation of good results for 1991.
Elsewhere, the retailer Rinascente eased L153 to L6,245 as the recent upward
revisions of its investment plans made investors nervous.
PARIS ended near the top of its recent trading range, the CAC-40 index
closing 14.87 up at 1,876.47 in spite of the early fall on Wall Street.
Turnover was reasonable at FFr2.3bn.
L'Air Liquide was in demand on rumours of big buyers ranging from a UK
broker to a Scottish institution wanting 1 per cent of the company. However,
some dealers attributed the share's FFr25 or 3.6 per cent rise to FFr724 to
the covering of a large short position.
The day's biggest gainer was Worms et Cie which gained FFr20 or 5.6 per cent
to FFr378 as several large blocs were put through the market.
AMSTERDAM was supported by a stronger dollar although early gains were lost
when Wall Street opened lower. The CBS Tendency Index closed up 0.2 at
122.10.
Unilever's decision to move out of animal feeds took the shares up by Fl
1.70 to Fl 187.20. Food companies showed year highs, although Wessanen's Fl
1.50 rise to Fl 88.20 was partly attributable to the strong dollar.
Hagemeyer, the trading group, rose Fl 2.80 or 2 per cent, to Fl 141.00 on
expectations of good full-year results due next Thursday. DSM, the chemicals
group, declined Fl 2.50 or 2.3 per cent to Fl 103.60.
MADRID had already discounted January's CPI figure of 1.5 per cent when
trading opened and there was little follow-through later in the day. The
general index closed down 0.76 at 258.75. Volume was generally more active
with a large put-through of 5m shares in Telefonica coming in the last
minutes of trading: it closed up Pta5 at Pta1,240. Tabacalera was well
traded, and popular with foreign investors: it climbed Pta90 to Pta6,080.
Utilities enjoyed generally strong volume, while selling of bank shares late
in the day depressed the sector.
STOCKHOLM continued its slide in thin trade, led by Ericsson and Astra.
Ericsson B slipped another SKr3 to SKr111 following Tuesday's results from
the telecommunications group, which pointed to a gloomy outlook for 1992.
Astra B fell SKr5 to SKr590, following talk in London that it might, after
all, be a potential bidder for Fisons.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.1 to 948.5. Aga B closed unchanged at
SKr308, and Gullspang B by SKr4 to SKr80 on Wednesday's news of a merger
between Gullspang, an electricity producer, and the Aga's power generation
subsidiary, Uddeholm.
ISTANBUL rallied after the government raised the witholding tax on treasury
bills by 5 percentage points to 15 per cent. The 75-share index closed up
127.03, or 3 per cent, to 4,393.65.

FT  14 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls for third
day on political scandal fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for a cut in the discount rate by a leading politician briefly lifted
share prices, but worries about a potential political scandal sent the
Nikkei average lower for the third consecutive trading day, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 150.62 at 21,391.02 after a day's low of 21,349.33 and high
of 21,596.65. A call for a half-point reduction in the discount rate by Mr
Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
boosted the index in the afternoon, but share prices later fell on
profit-taking and index-related selling.
Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 170m. Declines led advances by 606
to 300, with 196 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 8.73 to 1,586.08, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
2.15 to 1,214.73.
News of a raid by prosecutors on Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery company
entangled in a new political corruption scandal, depressed the market. Miss
Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Market sentiment is already
bad, and people are just looking for excuses not to trade.'
Meanwhile, the big four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi -
presented proposals to revive the stock market to the Japan Securities
Dealers Association. They included an increase in profit distribution to
shareholders, reducing the minimum trading unit for stocks and reviewing the
securities tax system.
The brokers also recommended that steps should be taken to ensure fairness
and transparency in the stock market, including the relationship between
cash stocks and the derivative markets. However, the proposals failed to
have much effect on the market.
The lack of fresh news prompted some issues to be swayed by rumours. Daito
Trust Construction fell Y570 to Y8,780 on a string of earnings and
scandal-related rumours denied by the company.
Non-life insurance companies weakened on selling by foreign brokers. Tokio
Marine and Fire Insurance declined Y30 to Y1,140 and Mitsui Marine and Fire
Y8 to Y840.
A total of 37 stocks fell to new lows since the start of last year,
including Fujitsu, down Y2 to Y768, and Minolta Camera, retreating Y11 to
Y459.
Oji Paper dipped Y8 to Y854. The issue gained ground on Wednesday after Mr
Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, suggested a possible redenomination
of the yen.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 113.97 to 23,103.18 in volume of 80.4m
shares. The index fell for the fourth consecutive day as construction,
pharmaceutical and electric power issues declined.
Roundup
SENTIMENT stayed mixed in the region yesterday, with Hong Kong at yet
another peak, Seoul still on a downtrend and Bangkok setting another
turnover record.
HONG KONG closed sharply higher in heavy trading, registering its fourth
record high in the last six sessions. The Hang Seng index advanced 31.07 to
4,763.50 as turnover swelled to HKDollars 2.74bn (HKDollars 1.99bn). Dealers
expect the local banks to reduce their key rate by half a point to 8 per
cent at the weekly meeting today.
Trading in HSBC Holdings, parent company of Hongkong Bank, was heavy, with
more than HKDollars 300m worth of shares traded as the stock rose 75 cents
to HKDollars 39.75 on speculation of good 1991 earnings.
New World Development moved ahead 40 cents to HKDollars 14.30 in heavy
trading, amid rumours of an impending issue of covered warrants.
AUSTRALIA had a volatile day, climbing initially on News Corp's strength but
falling back as better than expected unemployment data reduced hopes of an
interest rate cut. The All Ordinaries index ended 5.7 up at 1,622.9 after a
day's high of 1,634.7, in turnover of ADollars 304.8m.
News Corp surged ADollars 1.50 to ADollars 17.20 after its well-received 38
per cent increase in first-half profits on Wednesday.
BANGKOK chalked up the highest daily turnover in its history, Bt14.83bn
against Bt11bn on Wednesday, as the SET index rose 1.76 to 803.20. Three top
property issues advanced, offsetting declines in major banks and other
stocks.
Bangkok Land and Bangkok Bank topped the active stocks list in turnover of
Bt2.15bn each, Land gaining Bt5 to Bt198 and the bank closing Bt8 lower at
Bt608.
SEOUL weakened for the fourth day in a row, the composite stock index
finishing 7.74 lower at 656.49 as turnover rose from Won341.5bn to
Won349.5bn. Rumours of a lack of cash at Hyundai Group dampened sentiment.
NEW ZEALAND was mixed as a lack of support for blue chip issues was partly
offset by modest buying interest in small export-related shares. The NZSE-40
index eased 6.71 to 1,470.93 in turnover of NZDollars 14.4m (NZDollars
23.5m).
Telecom, due to report its fiscal third-quarter results next Tuesday,
slipped 3 cents to NZDollars 2.36, while Fletcher Challenge, with fiscal
first-half earnings expected on the same day, softened 2 cents to NZDollars
3.44.
TAIWAN rebounded in thin trading, snapping a streak of five losing sessions.
The weighted index recovered 26.50 to 5,088.10 as turnover contracted to
TDollars 29.7bn, the lowest level in a month.

FT  14 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: European volume reflects Wall St's
climb - German turnover doubled last month as investors buried their fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European equity markets were active last month after the holiday shutdown,
carried along generally by a buoyant Wall Street. With the exception of
Spain, volume trends were positive throughout the Continent.
Germany, still nervous about mounting wage demands, threatened industrial
disputes and high interest rates, buried its fears and looked ahead. Volume
doubled, and the DAX index gained 7 per cent as it began to look as if wage
settlements might be restrained.
By the middle of the month, says Mr James Cornish, a strategist at County
NatWest, rumours that German interest rates would soon be cut also helped to
stimulate demand. 'Germany was really the market that pulled the others
along,' he says. However, escalation of the dispute in the steel industry
depressed the market at the end of the month.
On the surface Milan performed well but, according to Mr Enrico Ponzone, a
director at Kleinwort Benson, the rise in volumes was mainly attributable to
one-off factors: the introduction of continuous trading, now taking place in
ten stocks, and the recording of orders. Previously much of the volume was
taking place off-market.
The beginning of the year saw Italy's long awaited deregulation as the
Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (SIM) - a new type of stockbroker, fund
manager and corporate finance institution - was introduced.
This followed a debilitating year for the Milan bourse, with investor
sentiment buffeted by a string of stockbroker bankruptcies and dismal
performances from Fiat, Olivetti and Pirelli. The last mentioned was
unsuccessful in its takeover bid for German rival Continental and this has
left it with a huge loss, and a commensurate equity funding requirement.
The market is on the upward trend, says Mr Ponzone, although it has come
back a little in February. Turnover is likely to show an increase in the
months ahead as more companies come on to the continuous trading system.
France, which needs to reduce interest rates, held up well, says Mr Cornish,
and the market remains cheap. Volume was seen to decline during the month
but rose again respectably at the end. Similarly, the Netherlands peaked at
the end of January.
Belgium's turnover remained strong, largely due to high volume in the
banking and retailing sectors. A stronger bond market also helped to make
equities more attractive and last year's rally in cyclicals was seen to be
continuing.
Spain's was the only turnover figure to slip back in January, in spite of a
5 per cent rise on the general index. The previous month's figures, however,
had been boosted by year-end window dressing as fund managers came into the
market to buy blue chips.
Observers said most of last month's dealing was done in a narrow range, with
little trading in industrials. Investors appear to be waiting for a real
stimulus to the economy, and definite news of a reduction in interest rates.
'For there to be an upturn in investor confidence, there needs to be a cut
of between one and two points,' an analyst said.
Mr Cornish has also calculated the January volumes compared with a
three-month average between September/November. This calculation excludes
December because of that month's exceptional year-end factors. On this basis
Germany's turnover rose 55 per cent, Belgium's 56 per cent and the
Netherlands' 46 per cent. The laggards were Spain and the UK, with 26 per
cent and 17 per cent respectively.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian supply fears lift metal
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVOUSNESS ABOUT the impact of new Russian export regulations on aluminium
and nickel supplies caused prices to rise sharply on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday.
Management at Krasnoyarsk, the world's second-largest aluminium smelter,
have warned the Russian government that it will start to shut down the
export sector of the plant - which accounts for about one third of the
800,000 tonnes annual output - from February 25 unless the regulations are
revised.
'We are on the brink of bankruptcy,' Mr Vladimir Krutko told Reuter. He said
the new regulations had added 3m roubles in export duties to the 1.4m rouble
cost of transportation. In addition, half the hard currency earned had to be
converted into roubles.
Analysts suggested the Krasnoyarsk management was putting political pressure
on the Russian government but was unlikely to make production cuts. 'I would
be very surprised to see this followed through. This is one of the few ways
Russia can earn foreign currency,' said Mr William Adams, analyst at the
Rudolf Wolff commodities group.
Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez
group, said: 'This is posturing to get the export tax reduced. The Russian
civil servants are new to the job and need educating about what is
reasonable in a market environment. They will back off.'
Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel producer, is also complaining that its
ability to finance essential technical improvements is being handicapped by
the new regulations which involve Russian companies having to convert 50 per
cent of any foreign exchange earnings into roubles.
At risk is the USDollars 600m plan submitted by Outokumpu, the state-owned
Finnish group, to renovate Norilsk's Pechenganikel smelter on the Kola
Peninsula. Mr Pekka Hynynen, project director, told Reuter Norilsk hoped to
pay by selling aluminium abroad but the new regulations would cut its
income. 'We understand that Norilsk will ask the government to make some
exceptions to the rules so that it can pay for the project,' he added.
The LME's three-month nickel price jumped by Dollars 55 a tonne to Dollars
7,892.50 yesterday after the market absorbed this news. Aluminium, which
rose strongly on Wednesday because of rumours about the Krasnoyarsk
problems, closed up another Dollars 20.25 yesterday at Dollars 1,293.75 a
tonne.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: South African farmers pray for
rain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE TRANSVAAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'Only God can help us through this crisis,' said the Afrikaner preacher
called to provide spiritual guidance to South Africa's farmers, who have
been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory.
Indeed, in the eastern Transvaal town of Bethal, where Dominee Nel was
delivering his sermon at a farmers' meeting earlier this week, elderly
residents say this drought is the worst since 1933. Mr JG Wilson of the
local agricultural co-operative says maize farmers in the area - one of the
largest maize producing regions - have already lost 80 to 100 per cent of
their crops.
Agricultural economists point out that drought years are more the norm in
South Africa than the exception. But Mr Koos du Toit, chief economist of the
South African Agricultural Union, says it is the worst drought he has ever
seen, and the most widespread. Farmers who produce maize, South Africa's
staple food, will be the hardest hit, with stock farmers also at risk. Mr du
Toit endorses comparisons with 1933, a highly emotive year for Afrikaners
because of the numbers forced off the land by drought.
The Maize Board, the state marketing board, expects a crop of 4m tonnes,
though Mr du Toit believes it could be closer to 3m or 3.5m, which would
make it the worst harvest in 50 years. The board expects to import 2m to 3m
tonnes of maize for local consumption, at a cost of R1.5bn. Mr du Toit
believes imports could hit 3.5m.
Government, for its part, has said that it will act to prevent farmers
leaving the land this time - although it has little room for manoeuvre,
given the fragility of the country's political transition, the depressed
economy and the demands of blacks for a fairer share of government spending.
None the less, Pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial
drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much
as R1bn (Pounds 200m) over two to three years. Without such aid, the Maize
Board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could
be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input
costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de
grace.
Given the ruling National Party's current unpopularity among whites -
especially farmers, who are traditionally ultra-conservative - this could
prove a serious political blow to the reform process.
But the alternative - numerous bankruptcies - could have a serious knock-on
effect in several areas. Farm labourers, most of them black, could lose
their jobs; with about 1m employed in farming overall, this could be a
severe problem. Businesses in rural towns are already suffering and more
could fold because of drought.
Millions of black subsistence farmers will also be victims of drought, with
the charity Operation Hunger warning that hunger could turn to starvation
soon in many rural areas.
Farmers say abnormally low rainfall and unusually high daytime temperatures
have just compounded the already precarious financial situation of many.
They complain of deteriorating terms of trade, noting that an imported
tractor which cost the equivalent of 191 tonnes of maize in 1985, had risen
to cost the equivalent of 347 tonnes by 1989-90.
Farm debt is another serious problem, with farmers struggling to repay debts
of nearly R16bn at interest rates of over 20 per cent. Low agricultural
output will depress overall economic activity, slowing South Africa's
recovery from a three-year recession. Real gross domestic product has been
forecast to rise by 1.5 per cent this year, though that figure could prove
much too optimistic if the worst drought predictions are borne out.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rise brightens outlook
for New Zealand dairy farmers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THINGS ARE looking up for New Zealand's dairy farmers, thanks to currency
changes and firmer international demand.
Yesterday the New Zealand Dairy Board announced they are to receive an
unexpected 60 NZcents (18p) a kilogram for milk fat equivalent in their
latest seasonal quarterly adjustment. This brings the pay out so far this
season to NZDollars 4.70 a kilogram. Mr Dryden Spring, the board chairman,
said that the probable final price for the season was be between NZDollars
5.10 and NZDollars 5.20 a kilogram.
The extra payment represents an NZDollars 8,000 boost to the average dairy
farmer when the money is paid out on February 20, on top of an average
NZDollars 10,000 monthly payment for the 10 month season, out of which they
have to pay farm costs, tax and interest charges.
The change has come relatively quickly. Last season was disastrous for the
industry, with returns at historic lows. Most farmers, who receive no state
assistance or subsidies, operated at a loss, and there was real concern that
many would abandon their farms. The total board payout was NZDollars 3.50 a
kilogram and the board was compelled to inject NZDollars 50m of its reserves
to bring the payout to NZDollars 3.70.
The 15 companies who form the New Zealand Dairy Board, which is a national
co-operative, are likely to make additional payments from their own profits.
This has averaged 55 cents a kilogram and a similar figure is predicted for
this season, suggesting that the average farmer will receive a total payout
of about NZDollars 5.60 a kilogram.
Even at this level, returns will not have regained the levels of the late
1980s. In 1989 the payout was NZDollars 5.80 a kilogram, falling to
NZDollars 3.70 in 1990 and Dollars 3.50 last season.
The new season began on a somewhat happier note in July, and the board said
in October that it hoped to raise its payout to about NZDollars 3.90. In
November it announced a payout of NZDollars 4.10 for that quarter, and said
that if present trends continued the end of season payment might reach
NZDollars 4.25. The change means that the dairy industry will earn New
Zealand more than NZDollars 3bn this season, compared with NZDollars 2.4bn
last year.
The devaluation of the New Zealand dollar, of about four per cent since the
end of November, made a significant contribution to the improvement in
returns.
Exchange movements of the US dollar, in which the international trade is
conducted, against European currencies have also been to New Zealand's
advantage, as they have raised the price of European exports, leading to a
strengthening of international prices.
This was helped by a drop in supplies coming on the market, because of a
fall of about 2 per cent in European production. The flood of supplies from
the former communist states in eastern Europe, which had helped disrupt the
market last season, also ebbed.
Mr Spring said New Zealand had also benefitted from continuing growth in
consumption in the developing Asian markets, and Latin America. Growing
wealth is seeing a steady rise in consumer interest in dairy products in
these regions.
These favourable factors allowed the board to reduce its stocks during the
season. They had been high when the season began. The board does not
announce its stock levels for commercial reasons, but Mr Spring said he was
'comfortable' with the present situation.
Board staff say, however, that the improving situation will be monitored
closely. The world is still producing much more milk than it needs, mostly
because of subsidies, and the potential this has to disrupt the market
remains a matter for concern.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile angers its fruit
exporters

<TEXT>
FRUIT EXPORTERS in Chile are up in arms over government plans to allow
Argentine rivals to ship their produce through Chilean ports.
As the world's leading suppliers of fresh fruit during the northern
hemisphere's winter months, Chilean producers fear they will lose hard-won
markets in Japan and elsewhere in Asia if Argentina gains access to a
Pacific outlet for its fruit exports. They also fear that the transit of
fresh Argentine produce through Chile might bring pests such as the
Mediterranean fruit fly, despite promises of stringent sanitary controls.
'We cannot understand why the government is willing to put our exports at
risk,' Mr Ricardo Ariztia, president of Fedefruta, the fruit producers
federation, said this week. 'We are strongly urging the authorities to
reconsider this decision.'
The opening of nine Chilean ports to Argentine trade by 1993 forms part of
an economic integration accord signed between both nations in 1990. Mr Ivan
Nazif, the deputy minister of agriculture, said yesterday that there were
economic benefits for Chile in the accord, including charges for port
services. He said Argentine fruit would have to be pest-free before crossing
the Andes.
But fruit producers are not convinced by the official guarantees. They are
particularly worried about the transit of Argentine fruit through the
northern Copiapo valley, an oasis of orchards reclaimed from the Atacama
desert. Copiapo produces the first grapes of the season, which fetch the
best prices in the US and Japan. Chilean producers do not want competition
from northern Argentina, which harvests in the same months.
The proposed measures could not come at a worse time for the Chilean fruit
trade. The US recession has depressed demand and prices. The Americans are
complaining about the quality of Chilean fruit this year, which was hampered
by frosts and heavy rains in October. A revaluation of the Chilean peso last
month is also squeezing profit margins.
Fresh fruit exports earned Dollars 948m last year, a 35 per cent increase
over 1990. But the exponential growth of the past decade is unlikely to be
repeated in the 1990s.

BOOKER TATE, a subsidiary of Booker, the UK food group, is to take over the
management of the troubled Barbados sugar industry for six months. The
island's heavily indebted industry is to be placed in receivership at the
end of this year's harvest.
The contract for Booker Tate's temporary management follows increasing
financial problems which saw a shutdown of the Barbados sugar industry late
last year. It has been restarted with the assistance of a loan from a
British bank.
The sugar industry owes a local bank the equivalent of USDollars 87m, and
has been troubled by falling production in recent years. The 1991 harvest
yielded 65,774 tonnes, the lowest in 60 years, and the industry has been
having difficulty meeting its quota commitments to the European Community
and the US, and satisfying domestic demand.

Copper prices on the LME continued to derive support from technical factors
following Wednesday's chart advance. But stiff resistance was seen around
Dollars 2,230 a tonne for three-month metal. Fresh consumer interest is
needed to maintain the recent rally, dealers said, otherwise prices may
drift back below Dollars 2,220. On Comex prices were also ahead at midday.
'The rally seems more technical in nature than fundamental but there is a
continued and growing optimism the market will see some strong Chinese
demand. The key in near term is for March to hold above Dollars 1,' said one
observer. Meanwhile, Codelco said its Chuquicamata mine produced less fine
copper than it was expected to in January because it had to process harder
ore rocks, lowering its milling capacity. Lead matched the general trend in
LME base metals and edged higher as the technical picture started to look
constructive. Tin lost further ground on profit taking prompted by recent
six-month highs. But tightness around April and a shortage of quality metal
continues to support underlying sentiment. Weak New York arabica coffee
futures put pressure on London, where plentiful supplies of robustas were
already keeping a lid on the market.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa touches 6-month lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRICES touched six-month lows in both London and New York yesterday.
The London May contract closed at Pounds 694 a tonne, down Pounds 8 on the
day and Pounds 14 on the week.
The market's continuing decline (last week May fell Pounds 48) has taken
traders by surprise. Prices had been expected to advance on forecasts of the
first production deficit for eight years. However, arrivals at ports in the
Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, have continued to be higher than
expected. In addition, market talk suggests that manufacturers are selling
nearby positions to force prices down ahead of West African price fixing for
the 1992-93 season. Under an IMF agreement the Ivory Coast has to sell
two-thirds of next year's crop before summer.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said large
numbers of speculative and fund 'longs' who were anticipating a price rise
had been forced out of the market, further increasing the downward pressure.
This week's meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation's working party
on a new agreement finishes today but little progress is expected. The ICCO
Council meets next week, but the market is likely largely to ignore the
proceedings. 'The most important decision taken at one these meetings now is
to fix the date of the next meeting,' said one observer.

FT  14 FEB 92 / The Property Market: More talk than action in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Berlin is like London in the 1960s; the opportunities are enormous . . .
companies wishing to invest can expect generous profits . . . .Berlin is an
investor's paradise.'
'There has been a huge speculator-driven bubble that in the last month has
started to burst. Banks are refusing to lend money on land because it is
overpriced.'
These contrasting views - from two of the many UK advisers who have flocked
to Berlin in recent months - illustrate the uncertainties that exist in
Europe's most unusual property market.
The uncertainties are reflected in the differing levels of interest and
investment attracted by the market. Berlin agents are besieged by visitors
demanding information. Yet to date, there has been more talk than action. In
the past 18 months, there have been barely 20 investment deals.
The doubts over Berlin focus more on short-term rather than long term
prospects.
In the long term, Berlin's role as the seat of government will guarantee its
future as Germany's most important city. Moreover, Berlin's growth will be
powered by one of the strongest economies in the world.
Berlin's expansion will create a huge demand for new commercial buildings.
Office space in the city will increase from 13.5m square metres to 29m sq m
by 2010; over the same period population is forecast to grow from 3.4m to
5m, according to the Institut fur Stadtforschung und Strukturpolitik, a
planning institute. The opportunities, therefore, for developers over the
next 15 years are enormous, particularly as 70 per cent of the existing
office stock is obsolete.
It is Berlin's short term prospects that are unclear. Already, one of the
most sluggish markets in Germany has been transformed into one of the most
expensive. Buildings that stood half empty two years ago have seen their
rents quadruple.
And while the worldwide property recession has restricted the funds
available for investment, the grim forecasts on the future growth in
property prices has made Berlin's landowners reluctant to sell their
buildings. The shortage of high quality buildings on the market have forced
yields down to 5 per cent, even where there is little prospect of continued
rental growth.
The reasons for the caution, however, go beyond the short term fluctuations
in prices. There is extraordinary uncertainty about the future pattern of
demand and supply.
In the time since the Berlin wall was torn down in 1989, demand from tenants
has vastly outstripped supply. Companies wanting to be represented in Berlin
have clamoured for a share of the inadequate stock of office space.
But it is unclear whether this pressure for space will be sustained over the
next few years. Berlin's poor infrastructure, the lack of trained workers
and the high cost of accommodation may deter companies from moving to
Berlin.
There is additional uncertainty as to when and how long it will take to
transfer the seat of government from Bonn to Berlin - a move which will also
see embassies, international agencies, employers' federations, trades union
headquarters and the media follow suit. Anything from between five and 15
years has been mentioned.
Yet there are other problems which will bog down developers. For instance,
disputes about the ownership of sites that were expropriated by the former
communist regime will slowdown virtually every developer on the eastern side
of the city. Although a recent court case found that the claims of a
previous owner should not be allowed to hold up development, nobody expects
the arguments to be resolved swiftly.
So it is unclear when the first new building will be erected on the eastern
side of the city. The favourite is the 120,000 sq m complex in
Friedrichstrasse, to be built by a consortium including the US property
company Tishman Speyer Properties, Bouygues, the French construction
company, and the French Galleries Lafayette department store. Work will
probably start at the end of this year, although the consortium is facing
the inevitable legal challenge on its ownership of part of the land.
Even when questions of ownership have been clarified, developers can still
expect to be held up by the planning process. No scheme on the eastern side
of the city has yet received planning permission, according to Mr Stuart
Reid of Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the chartered surveyors.
It is hardly surprising that dealing with the planning authorities is a
drawn out process. The city is determined to do justice to the historical
and symbolic importance of the land that has been cleared by the destruction
of the wall.
Potsdamer Platz, the huge area of wasteland near the Brandenburg Gate, which
was once packed with glitzy hotels, cafes and stores, and where Adolf Hitler
committed suicide in his bunker, is the most controversial site of all.
First, the European Commission is investigating whether Daimler Benz and
Sony, which bought much of the site relatively cheaply, received illegal
subsidies from the city authorities. Second, the design of the square is the
subject of heated debate. Daimler Benz claims that the planners' decision to
restrict the height of buildings to 35m will produce monolithic facades,
while Sony has called the planners' model unimaginative.
Another planning debate is likely to be opened up in the next few weeks when
Berlin unveils its master plan for the eastern side of the city. This will
go some way to moulding the future shape of the city.
Agents believe that prime areas in the western side (such as Kurfurstenmann)
and the eastern side (such as Unter den Linden, the majestic avenue
stretching out from the Brandenburg Gate) will ultimately resemble the west
end of London and the City of London respectively.
The problems of determing future rents lie in assessing the importance of
the areas that fall outside the core city areas. 'It is really a guessing
game,' says Mr Harry Gross of Zadelhoff Deutschland, real estate
consultants. He believes that a significant oversupply of office space may
develop over the next five to six years outside the core areas of the city.
The western side of the city will, on average, command higher values than
the eastern side, thanks to the higher quality of its infrastructure, shops
and residential areas. The task of bringing the east of the city up to the
same standards as the west is formidable.
'There is just too much to do there,' says Mr Gross. 'In some parts it looks
like the Russian tanks have just moved out,' he adds. The future pattern of
rents in the city may also be affected by developments in the hinterland of
Berlin. One such project which has already won planning approval is a DM
1.5m business park at Beelitz by the UK's Carroll Group.
So how well will the increase in demand match the increase in supply? In the
face of so many difficult questions, it is no surprise that analysts
disagree.
According to Mr Guy Duckworth of Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors, prime
rents of DM 90 per sq m, may fall to DM 70-DM 75 in three years, as new
buildings come on stream. 'If you bought in the last year, you have a good
chance of getting your fingers burned,' he says.
Mr Stuart Reid of Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, however, thinks demand will rise
to match supply. In any case, the fundamental strengths of Berlin and its
place in history will sustain continued interest from property companies.
'Every long term investor will want real estate here,' he says.

FT  14 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Battle looms over Italy's new
securities law - The controversy surrounding the so-called SIM requirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of foreign jibes about their 'cowboy' financial markets, Italy's
lawmakers have reacted angrily to demands from abroad for urgent changes to
securities legislation which has just taken effect.
Named after the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (SIM) - the novel type
of securities trading house it creates - the legislation has been vilified
by foreign bankers who claim it is anti-competitive and breaches the Treaty
of Rome.
The problem lies in a section of the law obliging foreign securities houses
operating in Italy to set up a SIM. The requirement covers both equity
trading on the domestic market and even the sales of securities, of any
type, to Italian investors other than SIMs and banks.
Foreign criticisms have been taken up by the European Commission. Following
a meeting of senior EC officials in Brussels last Friday, the dispute could
lead to a fight in the European Court if a solution is not found soon. A
letter to the Commission this week from Mr Gianni De Michelis, the Italian
foreign minister, hinted at some possibility of relaxing the rules for
companies providing financial services from abroad, but that may not be
enough for the Commission.
The outcry has been led by big City of London-based UK and US investment
banks. Rather than covering the continent with separate trading operations,
many have centralised their securities trading activities in London.
For Mr Neil Matthewson, a director of the British Merchant Banking and
Securities Houses Association, the Italian requirement to set up a SIM
infringes the Treaty of Rome. 'The point has been raised by many of our
members, which are mainly major investment banks and securities houses doing
cross-border business, and they are concerned about the costs involved in
being obliged to set up new Italian operations,' he said.
Similar misgivings are voiced by the International Securities Market
Association (formerly called the Association of International Bond Dealers)
as well as individual banks. A lawyer at one London-based house says the
SIMs law puts foreigners at a huge disadvantage. 'So far, it hasn't been
enforced by the Italian authorities. Nor has a counter-party said it won't
trade with us because we're not a SIM. But it could happen soon'.
Even more of a nightmare for the banks is the possibility that
counter-parties might try to use the law to repudiate a long-term
transaction such as a swap.
Last September the UK government complained formally to the European
Commission. Mr John Redwood, the minister of state for corporate affairs,
said the local incorporation requirement of the SIMs law was an
'unacceptable' barrier to the freedom of establishment and the free
provision of services under the Treaty of Rome.
'I hope the Commission will take the necessary action to encourage the
Italian government to take steps to repeal this bad law,' he added.
Last December, the Commission issued a formal warning. It argued that the
law's provision requiring companies to incorporate in Italy appeared to
violate Articles 52 and 59 of the Treaty of Rome, and the relevant sections
should be suspended. The SIMs law took effect unchanged in January.
With deadlines for an Italian response slipping past, the SIMs law was one
of the top items on the agenda at a regular Commission meeting last Friday
to examine possible infringements of EC rules.
However, the matter was postponed for a month. Officials in Brussels stress
the stay of execution implies no softening in their position. Mr De
Michelis's letter is now being examined. But if no real progress is made,
the Commission will issue a 'reasoned opinion', setting out why it believes
EC rules had been breached. Failing remedial action, a referral to the
European Court could follow.
The response in Italian financial circles has been chilly so far. After
spending years reforming their securities markets, the calls for change have
not gone down well. With competition from London a growing threat
domestically, many brokers have preferred to attack the UK market rather
defend the new Italian rules.
Mr Attilio Ventura, the chairman of the stockbrokers' committee at the Milan
bourse, said: 'The initiative reveals above all the internal weakness of the
UK market, which no longer feels dominant and takes increasing note instead
of competition from other financial centres.'
Reactions at Consob, Italy's companies and stock market watchdog, have been
more measured. According to a top official, no foreign governments objected
to the SIMs law during its three-year gestation period. 'The UK authorities
knew about the draft rules from the start. The article they object to was in
from the outset and was never changed.'
The rush to the law's defence is understandable. The legislation is the
central part of a series of long-awaited measures to reform of Italy's
securities markets, including banning insider trading and protection for
minorities in takeover bids.
'The SIMs law is designed to create transparency and order,' says Consob.
That could only be done by requiring securities trading to be concentrated
through a SIM.
'Until the Community's Investment Services Directive - which allows for
national supervision of all financial intermediaries by the AUTHOrites in
their home country - comes into effect, we have no choice but to demand
trading be carried out through a SIM,' Consob continues.
Some foreigners reject the transparency argument as a cover for
protectionism. 'The Italians know London is Europe's securities trading
centre and that Italian banks are still minnows there. This way, they hope
to win back some securities business and gain time until a few domestic
institutions grow strong enough to take a bigger role in international
markets,' claims one London-based dealer
Consob disagrees. 'We didn't even know there were so many operators selling
to Italians from abroad,' says the official, somewhat disingenuously. 'Our
priority was greater transparency better supervision, not protectionism'.
Italians' bitterness that they are being singled out is backed by claims
that incorporation rules in France and Spain are tougher than the SIMs law.
However, the Commission believes the SIMs law is more restrictive than
others.
Neither side looks ready to back down. With general elections due in April,
the Italians would find it difficult to change the law quickly, even if they
wanted to. Mr De Michelis's letter may represent a step forward. But failing
a compromise, the battle looks set to intensify.

THE SINGAPORE Interna-tional Monetary Exchange (Simex) said yesterday it
would launch an option contract on Nikkei stock index futures on March 19,
Reuter reports from Singapore.
Simex said the new contract would be based on the Simex Nikkei 225 futures
contract launched in 1986.
'The sheer size of the underlying Nikkei futures clearly suggests the market
has a good appetite for an options contract written on futures,' said Mr
Pierre Essig, chief executive officer of Fimat Futures Asia.
Simex statistics show that over the past two months the Simex Nikkei futures
contract traded an average daily volume of 6,000 contracts, or an underlying
average value of Y66bn of Japanese stocks.
The Simex Nikkei options contract will be US-style options and may be
exercised by the buyer on any day when the options are traded.

FT  14 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank of Ireland boosts core
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of Ireland yesterday raised a total of Pounds 110m core capital,
boosting its capacity to lend through simultaneous preference share issues
in London and Dublin.
The irredeemable preference shares, denominated in both sterling and Irish
punts, were placed with institutional investors in the UK and Ireland.
The Pounds 50m UK tranche was the first issue of sterling preference shares
by an overseas bank. The paper carries a coupon of 12 5/8 per cent and was
priced to yield 350 basis points more than UK government long-dated bonds.
The IPounds 65 tranche carries a coupon of 12 per cent and was priced to
yield 325 basis points over long maturity Irish government bonds.
The transaction, lead-managed by Salomon Brothers, boosts Bank of Ireland's
core capital  - allowing it to increase lending activity. The bank's ratio
of core capital to assets rises from 5.6 per cent to 7.2 per cent, against a
4 per cent ratio demanded by the Basle accord on international bank capital
adequacy.
As an overseas institution, however, dividend payments from Bank of
Ireland's sterling preference shares do not count as franked investment
income under UK law. Instead, tax is payable on gross income received from
the shares.
In this respect, the shares are comparable to permanent interest bearing
shares (Pibs), the undated, deeply subordinated capital instruments issued
by UK building societies.

FT  14 FEB 92 / International Bonds: 3i shrugs off uncertainty with Pounds
125m paper issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite continuing uncertainty over its future ownership, 3i, the venture
capital group controlled by the UK clearing banks, yesterday launched a
Pounds 125m five-year floating-rate note issue in the international bond
market.
The group plans to float on the stock exchange, with the current owners,
including the Bank of England which holds a 14.67 per cent stake,
relinquishing control.
This could affect the amount of capital which banks, the main buyers of
floating rate note issues, have to set aside against holdings of 3i bonds.
The group is currently recognised under UK banking law, which means that its
bonds carry a low 20 per cent risk weighting. Banks must set aside only
one-fifth the amount of capital required against holdings of bonds issued by
companies, which carry a full 100 per cent risk weighting.
If the change in ownership also entailed a loss of banking status, 3i's
bonds will be more expensive for banks to hold.
The company argued that the change in ownership will not affect its status
as a bank, but the residual uncertainty was reflected in the pricing of the
deal.
Yesterday's deal pays a margin of 37.5 basis points over the three-month
London interbank offered rate but was launched at a discount to par for an
effective margin of 47 basis points. Having been re-offered to investors at
a fixed price 99.61, the paper traded up to 99.70 bid by the close.
When 3i made its last floating-rate note issue four years ago, the margin
was little more than 12.5 basis points.
Elsewhere, Credit Foncier priced its Ecu750m 12-year deal launched on
Wednesday at a fixed reoffered price of 98.70, for a yield 7 basis points
more than French government Ecu bonds.
Most syndicate officials were satisfied with the progress of the deal,
although market conditions remain poor. The deal closed at 98.55 bid, with
the yield spread steady.
Caisse Central Desjardins du Quebec, the Canadian co-operative bank,
launched a well-received CDollars 100m offering of five-year bonds. The
paper carries a coupon of 8 3/4 per cent and was priced to yield 76 basis
points more than Canadian government bonds - a more generous spread than
other Canadian dollar bond issues this week.

INVESCO MIM Asset Manage-ment, the Japanese arm of the UK asset management
group, has been named by Nagasakiya, a leading Japanese retail company, to
manage a portion of its pension funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Invesco MIM will become the first foreign-based company to manage the
pension funds of a single private Japanese company. The move comes at a time
when the Japanese pension fund market is expected to grow quickly because of
the country's rapidly-ageing population.
Nagasakiya said it respected Invesco MIM's investment philosophy and
management ability. It added that the appointment would diversify its
investments internationally since foreign asset management companies were
permitted to invest up to 70 per cent of assets overseas, compared with 50
per cent for domestic asset managers.
Nagasakiya's move reflects the company's performance-conscious investment
stance. Nagasakiya's pension assets, expected to total Y23.7bn by the end of
this March, are currently managed by three Japanese trust banks and two
domestic life insurance companies.
Nagasakiya said the returns on investments by the trust banks were
unsatisfactory, and it had decided to alot Y1bn of its fund to Invesco MIM.

FT  14 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Investment innovations on
horizon in Japan - The new products to be introduced after Tokyo's markets
are liberalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERALISATION of Japan's financial markets, currently being reviewed by the
Ministry of Finance, will result in the gradual removal of legal barriers
which have restricted the introduction of new investment products.
Revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, expected to be submitted to
parliament next month, would pave the way for further deregulated interest
rates, easing of barriers between the securities and banking industries, and
widening of the definition of security.
Rule changes are expected to be completed next year. While new vehicles are
expected to be introduced gradually, it will mean more liquid secondary
markets and more attractive instruments, increasing fee-generating
activities for financial institutions.
Liberalisation will also activate Japan's dwindling asset-backed securities
market, allowing banks and corporations to minimise balance sheets.
New instruments expected to be introduced in the near future include:
Asset-backed securities: Growth of Japan's asset-backed securities market
has been stunted by Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, the
Japanese version of the US Glass Steagall Act, which defines negotiable
securities as equity shares, or public and corporate bond certificates.
Since asset-backed securities were not categorised as a security,
institutional investors have been reluctant to actively invest in the
products, and the market has remained at the Y1,000bn level, compared with
the Dollars 1,000bn market in the US.
The new definition of what constitutes a security is expected to be similar
to that in the US, including promissory notes, loan trust certificates and
monetary claims. Disclosure requirements are likely to focus on informing
investors of the risks of the underlying assets.
Brokerage officials believe that with legislative changes and new disclosure
rules, institutional investors should feel more comfortable with investments
in products such as corporate loans and housing loans.
Securitisation of credit card loans and car loans are also viewed as
potential new products for the individual.
However, legal restructuring will involve other ministries, such as the
Construction Ministry in the case of housing loans and the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry in the case of corporate loan
securitisation, and a battle over legislative turf may hamper new
developments.
Money market funds: As an alternative to bank deposits, the securities
industry plans to introduce a Japanese version of the US money market fund
for individual investors.
As with the chukoku fund, the currently-available medium-term government
bond fund, the new product will be invested in medium-term Treasury bills,
certificates of deposit and commercial paper. However, dividends will be
closer to market rates, and the penalty fee for early withdrawal is expected
to be reduced.
Along with full-fledged deregulation in the future, a significant portion of
the money market fund is expected to be invested into money market
instruments, increasing product liquidity.
New money trusts: Trust banks are expected to launch a new money trust
product with dividend payments directly reflecting investment performance.
Loan trusts, currently offered by trust banks, reflect the long-term prime
rate. However, the investment trust industry is strongly opposed to the
launch, as the funds will be invested in securities, including equity
stocks.
Bank deposits: Interest rate deregulation of large-lot time deposits over
Y10m was completed in 1989, and deposits with a minimum balance of over
Y500,000 now reflect market interest rates. Banks are now considering the
creation of shorter term products, such as one-week deposits, in order to
compete with the securities industry's money market fund.
Interest-rate deregulation will force banks to raise rates on demand
deposits, which account for a third of total deposits at Japanese banks. In
order to cope with rising costs, the banks expect to introduce maintenance
fees or minimum balance requirements for savings accounts.

FT  14 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Ship's last voyage is illegitimate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREGOS
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court):
Mr Justice Evans:
January 31 1992
THE ILLEGITIMACY of a last voyage ordered by time charterers is established
at or before the time for compliance, and not when the order is given, in
that the breach of charter lies in the failure to give a lawful order; and
accordingly, shipowners are entitled to treat the charterparty as repudiated
if, before compliance is due, the order, though reasonable when given, is
rendered unreasonable by unforeseen circumstances and is not replaced by a
further order for a legitimate voyage.
Mr Justice Evans so held when dismissing an appeal by Arni Torvald Klaveness
A/S Maritime Corporation, time charterers of the Gregos, from an arbitration
award by Mr Mark Hamsher that they were liable to the owners, Arni Maritime
Corporation, for breach of charter arising out of overrun of the charter
period.
HIS LORDSHIP said that a time charter on the New York Produce Exchange form
dated December 30 1987, provided for delivery off Antwerp, and for the
vessel to be employed as charterers should direct for 'about 50 to maximum
70 days'.
Redelivery was to take place at a port in the Gibraltar/Hamburg range.
The vessel was delivered on January 8 1988. The arbitrator held that
redelivery became due at expiry of 70 days, on March 18, with no further
tolerance or margin. Both parties accepted that finding.
After proceeding to South America in ballast, the vessel performed two
voyages from Trombetas in Brazil, carrying bauxite cargoes to Matansaz on
the River Orinoco in Venezuela. She completed discharge of the second voyage
on February 25.
The charterers had instructed the master to proceed from Matansaz to Palua,
another port on the Orinoco nearer the river mouth, and to load a cargo of
iron ore for delivery at Fos in Italy.
On February 9 when the instructions were given they were reasonable. They
allowed for discharge at Fos and redelivery off Gibraltar on or before March
18.
But by February 25 when the vessel completed discharge at Matansaz, the
timetable had become unworkable, because another vessel had grounded in the
river and was obstructing the navigable channel between Palua and the river
mouth.
The vessel proceeded to Palua and gave notice of readiness to load there on
February 25. But the owners were unwilling to proceed with the laden voyage
to Fos.
The charterers insisted that the orders were legitimate. The owners said
that unless legitimate orders were given they would treat the charterers as
being in repudiatory breach of charter and withdraw the vessel.
A without-prejudice agreement was made on February 29. The vessel then
performed the voyage under reserve of rights and was redelivered eight days
late on March 26.
On the present appeal, the first issue was as to the date on which the
legitimacy of the voyage had to be established. The charterers contended it
was the date when the order was given. The owners contended, and the
arbitrator awarded, that it was the date when the order became effective and
the vessel was required to comply with it.
The owners' alternative submission was that if a voyage which was legitimate
when the order was given became illegitimate due to change of circumstances
before the time for compliance arrived, then the charterers were under a
secondary obligation to replace it with a further order for legitimate
voyage which the owner was bound to perform.
The arbitrator held that the Court of Appeal decision in The Democritos
(1976) 2 Lloyd's Rep 149 was binding authority that the time for evaluation
of the charterers' orders was when the vessel was about to commence her last
full voyage, that being the time when she became free of her previous
commitments.
In The Democritos, the principal issue was whether a charter for the period
of a trip should be treated as a time or voyage charter.
Mr Justice Kerr held it was subject to the same redelivery rules as a time
charter, and as to whether the charterers were in breach, he said it was
clear that when sending or ordering the vessel on her last voyage 'there
could be no expectation' that she would be redelivered in time.
In the Court of Appeal, with regard to application of the 'legitimate
voyage' test, Lord Denning doubted that it was correct to look to see
whether the charterer had been planning the ship's voyages reasonably,
instead of at the last voyage itself.
He said 'the right way . . . is to look at the last full voyage and see
whether it is a legitimate last voyage or not'.
Mr Young submitted that that comment was obiter and the case did not involve
a decision whether the date of the order or of the last voyage was the
correct time for applying the legitimacy test.
That submission was technically correct. But the judgments of both Mr
Justice Kerr and the Court of Appeal carried much weight in their own right.
Moreover, the clearest statement of the law in any of the authorities came
from the case where the issue most nearly arose for decision.
The charterers' contention must be rejected. It would mean, if correct, that
a charterer could choose a time well in advance of the last voyage and the
instructions, if reasonable at that time, would remain binding on the vessel
regardless of subsequent events, unless he chose to issue further
instructions at any time until shortly before the last voyage began.
The weight of authority and the balance of practical considerations
supported that conclusion.
Mr Young's submission that a reasonable estimate could not be made until the
time for the last voyage was close seemed fallacious. A reasonable estimate
could often be made a very long time in advance. Its firmness would depend
on the circumstances and tend to increase as the time approached, but no way
of measuring firmness was suggested.
Nor was the court persuaded that the owners' primary submission was correct,
namely that the lawfulness of the order could never be determined until, or
shortly before, the time for performance arrived.
The charterers' obligation was to give a lawful order before the last voyage
began.
Whenever the order was given its lawfulness could be tested, and then the
shipowner might accept it in circumstances where he could not subsequently
refuse to perform it when the time for performance came.
Subject to such advance acceptance the owner's obligation was to perform
whatever orders the charterers gave or had given, when the time for
performance arrived.
That view of the law was closer to the owners' alternative submission than
to their first.
It also meant that charterers' obligation to give voyage instructions was
similar to their obligation to order the vessel only to safe ports. If a
port, safe when ordered, became unsafe, then a secondary obligation to
change the order arose. There was no distinction in principle between the
two cases, save that the charterer remained at risk of a port becoming
unsafe after the vessel had proceeded to it.
The second issue was whether the charterers committed a repudiatory breach.
Mr Young submitted they did not, because the arbitrator found that the
estimated overrun was not repudiatory in nature from a commercial point of
view.
The charterers contended that their obligation to give legitimate orders
must be distinguished from their obligation to redeliver at the end of the
charter period; and that the owners might refuse to obey an illegitimate
order, but could only refuse further performance if there was an
anticipatory and therefore repudiatory breach.
The court accepted that there were two separate obligations. But the
charterers' breach, when an illegitimate voyage was ordered and insisted on,
was in failing to give a lawful order with which the vessel could comply.
The legitimate voyage test did not permit of any overrun once the last date
for redelivery had been determined, and if the charterer persisted in
ordering a non-contractual last voyage, then the owner was entitled to
accept that as a repudiatory breach.
The owners succeeded on both issues. The appeal was dismissed.
For the charterers: Timothy Young (Sinclair Roche &amp; Temperley).
For the shipowners: Peter Gross (Ince &amp; Co).

FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Western Mining dives into the
red

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN MINING Corpora-tion, the Melbourne-based nickel, gold and aluminium
group, dived into the red in the first half to December following a ADollars
20m (USDollars 14.9m) write-down of its mining assets.
The company yesterday reported an interim turnround to a ADollars 60.5m net
loss from a ADollars 141.9m net profit on a 15 per cent slide in revenue to
ADollars 799.4m from ADollars 956.5m. The interim dividend has been cut to 6
cents a share from 13 cents.
In line with revised accounting standards, Western Mining directors have
reviewed the value of all non-current assets. They represent the second
leading Australian board to do so in as many weeks, following the ADollars
558m write-down by CSR, the sugar and building products group.
'Directors have adopted a conservative attitude in reducing the value of
mining properties, primarily gold operations, by ADollars 180m pre-tax,' the
board said. 'In addition, directors have decided to add ADollars 20m pre-tax
to the existing provision for environmental rehabilitation.'
Even excluding the write-downs, which were treated as abnormal items,
Western Mining's earnings were well down in the half. Operating earnings
fell 34.3 per cent to ADollars 114.3m from ADollars 173.9m before a tax
credit of ADollars 24.7m compared with a ADollars 29.6m payment previously.
The fall was even bigger on an equity-accounted basis, with the group's
associates contributing a ADollars 18.4m deficit against a ADollars 81.5m
premium. This produced a 57.4 per cent fall to ADollars 95.2m in equity
accounted net earnings from ADollars 223.4m.
The equity decline largely reflected a fall in contribution from the
company's 48.08 per cent-owned aluminium offshoot, Alcoa of Australia, to
ADollars 77.8m from ADollars 177.7m.
Gold was Western Mining's biggest profit earner in the half, with a ADollars
40.8m contribution, followed by ADollars 31.2m from oil and gas and ADollars
19.5m from nickel. Canadian operations lost ADollars 8.7m.
Directors said that although gold production fell 14.4 per cent in the half,
tonnage treated rose by 11.3 per cent, while unit costs rose 5.9 per cent.
Nickel prices fell by 17 per cent while exploration expenditure was cut from
ADollars 81.4m to ADollars 45.4m. Depreciation charges rose to ADollars
135.6m from ADollars 115.8m.
TNT, the diversified Australian transport group, has executed its
previously-announced flotation of stock in its US arm, TNT Freightways
Corporation, with a public offering on Nasdaq, the over-the-counter market.
The company is offering 12.5m shares in TNT Freightways at USDollars 19.50
each. Directors said the issue, with dividends payable, would raise about
ADollars 400m and TNT would retain a 20 per cent to 25 per cent interest in
the offshoot on completion.

SUMITOMO Chemical, the Japanese chemical company which belongs to the
Sumitomo group, yesterday reported a 32.8 per cent decline in pre-tax
profits last year to Y24.5bn (Dollars 193m).
Sumitomo said the steep fall in profits resulted from high depreciation
costs, increased distribution expenses, as well as a rise in net financial
expenses.
Sales for the year came to Y701.2bn, a decline of 2.2 per cent. Sales of
speciality chemicals, including dyes, agricultural chemicals and advanced
materials, grew by 2.2 per cent to Y210bn. Aluminium sales were hit hard by
the decline in ingot prices, with sales falling 20 per cent to Y63.7bn.
Basic chemicals sales were off by 1 per cent to Y427.5bn.
Sumitomo said that, given the sluggishness of the Japanese economy, it was
unable to expand sales to offset the increase in costs during the year.
Non-operating financial income fell marginally to Y27.3bn, while financial
costs rose by Y4.6bn to Y30.4bn.
Net income per share declined by 9.7 per cent to Y9.39. The dividend for the
year came to Y6 per share, unchanged from 1990.

SUN International Bophutatswana (Sunbop), the South African hotel and
leisure group, overcame recessionary economic conditions to record a 19 per
cent rise in attributable earnings to R106m (Dollars 38.2m) in the six
months to December.
Turnover rose by 24 per cent to R483.4m and operating profit was 25 per cent
higher at R140.5m. Interest received fell substantially due to internal
funding of its Carousel and Lost City projects.
The group, whose hotels are all situated in the homeland of Bophutatswana,
recorded an average occupancy of 78 per cent for the six months. This was in
line with its 1990 performance, but well ahead of industry averages with
most hotels suffering badly from the recession.
Sunbop is spending R1.1bn in developing Carousel and Lost City, an extension
of its Sun City resort. Carousel, a gambling resort, opened in November and
the R750m Lost City project will open by December.
Sunbop has raised more than R300m for the funding of these projects through
a R178m rights issue and by offering scrip dividends which were heavily
taken up.
Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, said the group's good performance through the
recession was testimony to its policy of building quality resorts which were
'exciting and unique'. He said the group had adhered strictly to a
value-for-money policy.
Explaining the large capital expenditure programme, Mr Kerzner said that the
changes in South Africa had led to a 'very significant enhancement of its
tourism potential'. He expected 'extraordinary growth' in local tourism.
The Lost City project will double the size of conference facilities at the
Sun City resort, which are the largest in the region.

COLES MYER, Australia's biggest retailer, is considering publicly floating
Progressive Enterprises, its New Zealand subsidiary.
Mr Brian Quinn, chief executive, said yesterday the company had retained C.
S. First Boston as adviser for the sell-off, but Coles planned to remain the
largest shareholder in Progressive.
Coles acquired Progressive in 1988, and foreshadowed a public flotation at
that time. The New Zealand company operates 58 supermarkets and controls
about 30 per cent of that market segment in New Zealand's north island.

<TEXT>
GLOBE BANK, a small Lebanese privately-owned bank has closed for business
and put all of its assets at the disposal of the Banque du Liban (BDL),
Lebanon's central bank. BDL welcomed the move and promised to reimburse
depositors as quickly as possible.
Globe Bank is the third Lebanese bank this year to opt for
'self-liquidation', a process encouraged by BDL to reduce the number of
banks competing in a market reduced by the 1975-90 civil war.
The Libano-Bresilienne and Tohme banks closed last month. Four other small
Lebanese banks declared bankruptcy late last year.
Globe Bank and the BDL stressed the closure was by mutual agreement. A new
Lebanese law enables banks to reimburse depositors through the Institut
National de Garantie des Depots.
Over the years, Lebanon's more than 80 banking establishments saw their
capital base severely reduced by the fall in value of the Lebanese pound
from LPounds 2.5 to the dollar before the war to a low of LPounds 1,200 to
the dollar in the autumn of 1990.
The Lebanese pound has for the past eight months stabilised at a rate of
around LPounds 880 to the dollar. But the stabilisation of the pound
eliminated currency speculation, which had become an important source of
profit for some of the smaller banks.
The bank closures have coincided with a dismal economic mood, provoked by
Lebanon's failure to attract substantial foreign reconstruction aid and
investment.
The political atmosphere remains uncertain due to Israel's continued
occupation of southern Lebanon, the unresolved question of parliamentary
elections and doubts about the consequences of a scheduled withdrawal of
Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon next September.
Cabinet members continue to debate an austerity budget which would impose a
60 per cent ceiling on deficit spending.
The original 1992 budget of LPounds 2,500bn (USDollars 2.84bn) is to be cut
by nearly one-third - at a time when Lebanese trade unions are demanding a
60 per cent increase in the LPounds 75,000 monthly minimum wage.
Proposed measures include the cancellation of transportation allowances for
government and private sector employees and a higher tax on property sales
and transfers.

<TEXT>
PIONEER ELECTRONIC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday reported a
5.8 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits in the third quarter,
which ended in December, as a modest rise in sales was offset by the higher
value of the yen.
Sales advanced by 6 per cent to Y185.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn), while pre-tax
profits declined 5.8 per cent to Y24.7bn. Net income after tax dropped by
5.5 per cent to Y12.5bn.
Although audio product sales were strong in Japan, European sales were hit
by the high value of the yen.
Video product sales were strong because of the success of compact stereo
systems which incorporate laser disc players. Sales of laser disc equipment,
used for karaoke sing-along systems, rose overseas.
Car electronics products were lifted by sales of car navigation systems
installed in new vehicles.
Although sales of car stereo equipment were weak in Japan, overseas sales
were helped by a new anti-theft system.
For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, pre-tax profits were down
by 15.8 per cent to Y53.4bn, while sales rose by 2.4 per cent to Y466.4bn.

ZENITH Electronics, the US consumer electronics group, yesterday unveiled
improved fourth-quarter results. The company registered a small profit of
Dollars 500,000, or 2 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1991, a
turnround from a loss a year ago of Dollars 27.4m, or Dollars 1.01, a share.
The quarter's results benefited from cost-reductions and the absence of
Dollars 7m of charges taken in the final quarter of 1990.
The improved performance pleased Mr Jerry Pearlman, Zenith chairman, but he
warned that 'continuing, deep recessionary conditions mean that more
difficult times are ahead'.
For all 1991, the company posted a net loss of Dollars 51.6m, or Dollars
1.79, compared with losses of Dollars 54.2m, or Dollars 2.02, in 1990. Sales
in 1991 were Dollars 1.32bn, down from Dollars 1.41bn.
Consumer electronic sales fell slightly last year to Dollars 1.21bn, from
Dollars 1.22bn in 1990, but components - mainly electronic assemblies and
displays for the depressed automobile industry - slid to Dollars 111m from
Dollars 181 in 1990.
Colour television sales were down 13 per cent in the first five weeks of
1992.
A weak television market and the start-up costs of its new 'flat tension
mask' colour displays were expected to contribute to a loss to Zenith during
the the first half of 1992, Mr Pearlman said.

THE ALUMINUM Company of America (Alcoa), the world's largest aluminium
company, is to spend about Dollars 50m to take a controlling interest in and
upgrade facilities at Kofem, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the state-owned
Hungarian Aluminium Industrial Corporation (Hungalu).
Kofem, located at Szekesfehervar, 35 miles south-west of Budapest, employs
3,000 and produces 110,000 tonnes a year of flat-rolled aluminium products
and 30,000 tonnes of aluminium extrusions for the building, construction,
food and agricultural markets in Hungary, central and western Europe.
The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding which enables
Alcoa to look more closely at what needs to be done to upgrade at Kofem.
Kofem now uses aluminium from Russian smelters and the issue of future
supplies will be part of discussions before a final agreement is signed,
probably in the middle of this year.
Alcoa said its investment would be used to upgrade quality and safety at
Kofem and that it would provide the management, technology, and systems
needed to make the venture a successful competitor throughout Europe.
However, it did not intend to expand capacity or to introduce can sheet
production at Kofem.

<TEXT>
CBS, the US media group, has posted a net loss of Dollars 85.8m, or Dollars
5.32 a share, for 1991 after an after-tax loss of Dollars 195.5m from its
baseball and football television coverage. In 1990, CBS had net earnings of
Dollars 110.8m, or Dollars 4.30 a share, including an after-tax loss of
Dollars 171.2m, or Dollars 6.65, on its sports contracts.
Sales in the year fell 7 per cent to Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 3.26bn.
Earnings in 1991 were also depressed by what Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and
chief executive, called a 'stubborn' recession, expanding cable competition
and rising programming costs. For the fourth quarter, CBS had net income of
Dollars 9.4m, or 61 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 937.4m, against a
loss of Dollars 156m, or Dollars 6.06, on sales of Dollars 919.7m.
Fourth-quarter operating earnings were Dollars 9.4m against an operating
loss of Dollars 175.3m a year earlier. CBS's loss from continuing operations
for all 1991 was Dollars 98.7m against profits of Dollars 91.5m.
CBS, which paid Dollars 1.06bn for its four-year baseball contracts has had
pre-tax losses of Dollars 604m for its sports coverage. CBS said these
contracts had been reduced to net realisation value and no further
write-offs were expected.
Mr David Londoner, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said the results roughly
met his expectations. 'I'm happy the third-quarter charge is done with. CBS
has good ratings now and 1992 is starting to look better.' Mr Londoner
expects CBS to earn Dollars 9 a share in 1992.
Mr Tisch expected to return to profitability in 1992 in spite of reduced
advertiser demand for broadcast commercial time in the first quarter.

A REORGANISATION plan put forward by Revco, the US drugstore retailer which
has been in bankruptcy since 1988, looks set to go forward without
opposition from Jack Eckerd, the rival chain that had wanted to acquire
Revco.
The two companies announced yesterday that Eckerd has agreed to 'postpone
indefinitely' its own plan of reorganisation for Revco, which would
essentially have involved Eckerd in taking over the bankrupt chain.
As part of the deal, Revco is paying Eckerd Dollars 7.5m for its
plan-related expenses.
Mr Boake Sells, Revco's chairman, claimed the agreement should result in 'an
uncontested Revco plan' and allow it to emerge from bankruptcy 'at an early
date'.

suit against Lorenzo
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier and one in
bankruptcy since late 1990, have filed a suit against Mr Frank Lorenzo, the
airline's former chairman and chief executive. The suit, brought by the
official creditors' committee, claims Dollars 180m in damages.
Mr Lorenzo, known as a pugnacious union-buster and wily deal-maker, quit as
Continental's boss in August 1990, although he remained a director. At that
stage, he also sold the privately-owned Jet Capital company - in which he
and other Jet Capital directors had an 80 per cent stake - to Scandinavian
Airlines System.
Jet Capital, in turn, held a big stake in Continental, and SAS ended up with
18.4 per cent of Continental's voting rights.
However, before the end of 1990, Continental had sought protection under
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code - a situation which still exists,
although the airline has now filed a reorganisation scheme with the courts.
Under this proposed plan, ordinary shareholders in the airline would get
nothing - rendering SAS's equity stake worthless.
The creditors' lawsuit alleges that Mr Lorenzo, Jet Capital and Mr Robert
Snedeker, another Continental director, received Dollars 41.6m as a result
of the series of transactions with SAS in August 1990. It suggests that the
payments were made when Continental was already insolvent, breaching Mr
Lorenzo's and Mr Snedeker's duties as directors of the company. It also
argues that Mr Lorenzo and Mr Snedeker benefited from a preferential
transfer which preceded the SAS deal.
The creditors' committee stressed that SAS was not a defendant in the suit.
Lawyers said the suit alleged a mixture of fraudulent conveyance, breaches
of fiduciary duty and preferential transfer.
Mr Lorenzo's Houston-based investment company said the businessman believed
the actions cited in the creditors' complaint were 'perfectly appropriate
and in the best interests of Continental'. It added that Mr Lorenzo and Mr
Snedeker has been advised by lawyers that the suit was 'totally without
merit'.

FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM plans computers based on MPP
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) is developing powerful supercomputers
based upon massively parallel processing (MPP) technology.
The company said yesterday it had established a new laboratory dedicated to
bringing rapidly the new technology to market.
Cray Research, the leading supercomputer manufacturer, also revealed this
week that it was developing MPP computers, based upon a powerful new
microprocessor chip designed by Digital Equipment.
Unlike traditional supercomputers which are based upon one or a few
custom-designed powerful processors, MPP computers share complex computing
tasks among hundreds or even thousands of the same microprocessor chips that
are used in computer workstations.
Until recently, this approach to achieving very high speed computing was
largely experimental. Worldwide sales of MPP supercomputers totalled only
about Dollars 100m last year, less than one-tenth of the total
supercomputers market, according to industry estimates.
However, massively parallel machines are widely expected to eventually
achieve speeds of almost 1,000bn calculations per second, outpacing
traditional 'vector' supercomputers.
The endorsement of IBM and Cray Research will bring MPP into the mainstream
of computing. Some industry analysts predict that MPP sales could reach 50
per cent of the total supercomputer market by the late 1990s.
The challenge that MPP technology poses to traditional supercomputing
technology was demonstrated this week when Mr Seymore Cray, the best-known
designer of supercomputers, announced that his company, Cray Computer
(unrelated to Cray Research), must scale back plans to develop Cray-3 , a
machine that would rival MPP performance, after losing its lone customer.
IBM will base its MMP systems upon the reduced instruction set computing
(Risc) microprocessors that it employs in desktop workstations. The company
said it planned to build 'scalable' paralled machines capable of performance
in the range of hundreds of gigaflops (billions of floating point
calculations per second).
Ultimately, IBM aims to achieve teraflops (1,000bn of floating-point
calculations per second) performance.
'Our key customers have told us that they need 'scalable' systems that
enable them to build up performance on an incremental basis - as their
individual needs allow,' said Mr Irving Wladawsky-Berger, assistant general
manager for IBM's supercomputing, Enterprise Systems line of business.
'We plan to get these machines to market as quickly as possible.'
Cray Research said that its first MPP systems would be introduced next year
and that they would be based upon Digital Equipment's 'Alpha' microprocessor
chip.
The device is twice as fast as any other microprocessor in the world, Cray
officials said. Digital engineers are scheduled to reveal details of the
Alpha chip at a technical conference later this month.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITAS, one of Finland's largest banking groups, yesterday announced a
FM128m (Dollars 29.3m) profit for 1991, compared with FM480m for the
previous 12 months.
The deterioration was mainly due to a 44 per cent increase in credit
write-offs, which rose from FM759m to FM1.09bn last year, to represent 0.77
per cent of total claims. Non-performing loans totalled FM5.72bn at the end
of 1991.
The bank emphasised, however, that it had maintained its capital adequacy
ratio at 10.3 per cent. It plans to pay a total dividend of FM94m.
Group equity and reserves amounted to FM10.2bn at the end of last year, and
the balance sheet rose to FM151bn. Net income from financing operations was
FM2.32bn, down FM252m on the 1990 figure.
Despite the weak earnings performance, Mr Ahti Hirvonen, chairman, said
Unitas was 'well poised to face the coming upturn', though he believed a
recovery was unlikely before late autumn.
'Credit write-offs will remain heavy this year and non-performing loans will
continue to increase,' he said. He emphasised that the group's credit
write-offs/claims ratio remained 'considerably lower than those of the major
Swedish banks'.
Mr Hirvonen said the 'major problem facing Finnish banks is the excessively
low interest margin'. The group's broad interest margin was only 1.4 per
cent last year.
He said the bank faced 'no serious international exposure' and that its
cost-cutting programme made FM40m savings last year. Staff had fallen by
1,500 to 8,807 over the past three years.

<TEXT>
COLGATE-PALMOLIVE, the large US household products company, is to buy Mennen
Company, a privately-owned personal care products manufacturer, for around
Dollars 670m.
News of the deal came as Colgate unveiled after-tax profits of Dollars
124.9m for the year. This compares with Dollars 321m in 1990, but the 1991
total was struck after a Dollars 243m restructuring charge in the third
quarter.
Mennen is based in New Jersey and involved in the US deodorant and
anti-perspirant market, where its sells under the Mennen Speed Stick, Mennen
Lady Speedstick and Mennen Teen Spirit brand names. It also makes baby
products - under the Baby Magic name - and men's toiletries.
In addition, the company sells in the Latin American and European markets,
and its total annual turnover is said to be in excess of Dollars 550m. No
profit figures were disclosed.
Colgate, which maintains that the Mennen product lines should complete its
personal care products - which range from toothpaste to soaps - will meet
around 80 per cent of the purchase price in stock and the remainder in cash.
In the final quarter of 1991, Colgate saw sales rise from Dollars 1.48bn to
Dollars 1.57bn, with after-tax earnings advancing from Dollars 73.5m to
Dollars 86.9m.
Colgate said Mennen's share of the US deodorant market was about 16 per
cent, making it a market leader. Of the total Dollars 550m-plus sales,
around Dollars 275m derived from the US.
However, the purchaser stressed that it was Mennen's exposure to less
developed markets outside the US, particularly in Latin America, that made
it especially attractive.
For the year overall, Colgate sales rose from Dollars 5.69bn to Dollars
6.06bn, with annual volume growth reaching 5 per cent. The company said
that, with the third-quarter restructuring charge omitted, profits showed a
15 per cent increase. Colgate shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 48.

FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Investment study shows gap
between US and UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STUDY of how institutional investors in the UK and US invest in
continental equities reveals marked differences between the two centres.
The survey was carried out late last year by Makinson Cowell, the investor
relations consultancy, and the Financial Times. It covered 96
internationally-minded fund management firms, with an average portfolio size
of about Dollars 10bn.
To judge a company, UK fund managers rely more heavily on personal meetings
with its senior managers, research by brokerage firms, and contacts with
brokers' analysts than do US ones. For US investors, personal meetings tie
for first place with annual reports.
Active investment management styles are much more popular in both centres
than passive ones: in all, 14 per cent of UK and US-owned continental
equities are passively managed or indexed, according to the survey. Among
those institutions that use passive management for continental equities, US
firms are far more committed to the technique.
Investing in a company's shares was twice as popular among US fund managers
as buying its American Depositary Receipts. Similarly, among UK fund
managers, only 11 per cent said a London listing would make them more likely
to buy the shares.
A continuous on-line price quote (as provided by the London Stock Exchange's
Seaq International system) would make 53 per cent of US investors more
likely to buy but would have the same effect on only 28 per cent of UK
investors.
One common theme was concern about information on corporate activities and
potential barriers to ownership. In Germany, for example, 72 per cent of US
investors and 50 per cent of UK investors said availability of information
was an obstacle.

FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Shareholders return to court BBL
 -Changing roles for the Belgian bank's owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIAN banks are beginning to look exciting again. On Tuesday, Banque
Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the country's second largest bank, confirmed it was
being courted by three of its largest shareholders - all financial services
companies - with a view to linking their simpler personal insurance products
to BBL's extensive retail banking network.
BBL has been at pains to emphasise that such commercial links will not
necessarily mean shifts in its shareholder register, but analysts and
investors are not so sure. 'You can come up with all sorts of scenarios,'
says one. 'The shareholder structure of BBL is very disparate and very
unstable.'
The widespread ownership of BBL's shares dates back to the 1980s, when
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), the sprawling Belgian holding company
chaired by Mr Albert Frere, redistributed its 40 per cent stake in the bank
among a number of institutional shareholders.
Many of those were insurance companies making portfolio investments. To
preserve the stability of the structure, the largest investors, including
GBL, agreed to notify each other about purchases and potential sales of
their shares. That syndicate's shareholdings now represent more than half of
the bank's capital.
However, the accelerating liberalisation of the EC financial services sector
means European insurers are no longer mere passive investors in banks.
The trend is towards so-called 'bancassurance' links between the two
financial sectors. Germany is criss-crossed by national and regional
alliances; French banks now write more than 50 per cent of their new life
insurance business; and many British building societies have linked with
life assurance companies.
At the same time, Belgium's banking supervisors have recently agreed to
relax rules which restrict the role of shareholders in banks. Now they can
have a greater hand in shaping policy. Board changes announced at Tuesday's
annual meeting of BBL reflected the new regime: two GBL executives -
including Mr Gerald Frere, son of Albert - were elected to the board, as was
a director of the Belgian unit of Winterthur, the Swiss insurer which owns a
4.78 per cent stake.
Another large player - Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING) - is also
agitating for more power in the group. The Dutch financial services company
was formed last year through one of Europe's most spectacular bancassurance
mergers, between the largest Dutch insurer, National Nederlanden, and NMB
Postbank, its third largest bank.
ING, which owns 5.86 per cent of BBL's shares, was already a focus for
speculation about the bank's future because of press reports last year
indicating it wanted to bid for the group.
It never commented then, but on Tuesday it said it certainly wanted a seat
on the board and confirmed that it was discussing various forms of banking
and insurance co-operation with BBL.
ING is not a lone suitor, a fact which could create friction. BBL is much
deeper into talks with the Belgian group, Royale Belge - most of which is
controlled by Union des Assurances de Paris - and Winterthur.
Details of the deals under discussion are sketchy. Mr Jacques Thierry, BBL's
chairman, said on Tuesday the position would be clearer by the time of the
next board meeting in March. 'There'll be no revolution in the bank's
shareholder structure,' he added.
Keeping commercial and investment collaboration separate may be difficult,
however. BBL already sells insurance products linked to savings or loans,
and reinsures these through its insurer-shareholders, in line with the size
of their holdings.
Winterthur has suggested it would be logical to raise its stake - perhaps to
the same level as Royale Belge's 9.35 per cent holding - as it increases its
influence over management of the company.
As one Brussels analyst pointed out yesterday, insurers spurned in any
bancassurance deal might just decide to sell out, upsetting the balance of
power within the share register.
This is all potentially good news for simple investors in BBL, shares in
which have risen nearly 14 per cent since speculation about an ING bid
began. They may well be advised to hold on.
GBL said before Christmas the bank's main shareholders had no intention of
selling their BBL shares to ING 'in the current circumstances'. Those
circumstances are gradually changing.

Caldwell Investments, the USM-quoted textile company, has announced a

The issue is being underwritten by Harris Allday Lea &amp; Brooks and it is

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Triton Europe, the independent oil and gas exploration and production group,
reported after-tax profits of Pounds 2.61m for the six months to November
30.
The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 28m in the corresponding period
of 1990 although this figure reflected the benefit of higher oil prices
resulting from the Gulf war and exceptional profits from the sale of the
group's North Sea assets and an exchange gain on the subsequent reduction in
bank debt.
Net production over the interim period amounted to 949,700 barrels - an
average of 5,200 barrels per day - which represented a decline of 6 per
cent. Some 88 per cent of the output stemmed from the Villeperdue field in
France where another four horizontal wells are scheduled later this year.
Directors said they were undertaking a re-evaluation of the group's current
licence interests and exploration commitments. Several licences would be
farmed out or relinquished and some applications for new exploration acreage
would be withdrawn.
Earnings per share emerged at 3.17p (33.96p). No interim dividend is
declared (1p).

TOTTENHAM Hotspur, the company which owns the north London football club and
which earlier this week announced a pre-tax profit for the first time in two
years, has been served with a writ by Brown Shipley, the merchant bank,
claiming some Pounds 408,000.
The dispute stems from last year's battle to take over the club, eventually
won by Mr Alan Sugar, head of Amstrad and chairman of Tottenham, and Mr
Terry Venables, chief executive.
Brown Shipley advised the old Tottenham board on the various takeover
proposals and is demanding payment for work undertaken.
Mr Sugar said Tottenham was 'strenuously objecting' to payment because the
bank's fees were 'exorbitant'. He added that Tottenham had already made
provisions to cover the dispute

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEITH Clarke is expected to step down as managing director at Budgens,
the small food retailer whose institutional shareholders last year installed
new management.
Mr Clarke, a former trading and marketing director at Asda Stores, was
brought into Budgens in 1990 by Mr John Fletcher, who became chairman and
chief executive of the group in 1985 after three years as managing director
of Asda.
Last April institutions forced the resignation of Mr Fletcher as chairman,
injected Pounds 21.7m into the loss-making group and appointed Mr John von
Spreckelsen as chief executive.
Last month Mr Derek Pretty resigned as finance director, to be replaced by
Mr Graham Rigby, one of the management troika brought in by the institutions
last April.
Mr von Spreckelsen, Mr Rigby and Mr Christian Williams joined Budgens after
turning round Kafu Wasmund, the Bremen-based supermarket chain.
Budgens recently reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m for the six months
to November 28, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 33,000 for the same
period in 1990.
Mr von Spreckelsen described the results as a 'significant first step on the
road to recovery', and said his three-year plan to revitalise the group was
on course.
He last night declined to discuss Mr Clarke's position, saying any changes
in senior management would be announced in an official statement. Mr Clarke
was not available for comment.

<TEXT>
BURTON GROUP, the UK fashion company which this week sacked Mr Laurence
Cooklin as chief executive, has swiftly moved to create a management board
consisting of the directors of its various chains to develop a more cohesive
group-wide strategy.
'The company is trying to develop a more collegiate structure than has
recently been normal at Burton,' the company said.
Mr John Hoerner, who succeeded Mr Cooklin as chief executive, will chair the
management board which will meet every fortnight.
'I am a great believer in syndicating responsibility so that managers run
with the ideas that they help shape,' Mr Hoerner said after assuming the
post.
While chief executive at Debenhams, Mr Hoerner was renowned for a more
participatory style of management than was usual at Burton's other retail
divisions.
Burton also announced yesterday that Mr Terry Green, formerly womenswear
buying director at Debenhams, would succeed Mr Hoerner as chief executive of
the department store group.
Two Debenhams directors, Mr Keith Cameron, personnel director, and Mr Steven
Sharp, marketing director, will now broaden their areas of responsibility on
a group-wide basis.

FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Tesco plans job cuts but continues store
openings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO, the supermarket chain, is seeking about 100 job cuts among its head
office and distribution staff by means of voluntary redundancy and early
retirement.
The company is also planning to reduce staff numbers in some of its 394
stores by means of voluntary redundancies and a reduction of working hours.
The precise number of staff affected is not yet known.
The company has also launched a restructuring of its retail management
operations in consultation with Usdaw, the shopworkers' union.
In spite of the possible job losses associated with these programmes, Tesco
will still be a net recruiter of staff this year.
By the end of the month, the company will have opened five new stores in
February, including its 200th superstore at Maldon, Essex.
Over the next year, a further 28 stores will open providing 8,500 jobs.
About 5,000 of these will represent new job opportunities; the remaining
positions will be filled through a redeployment of existing staff.
In total, the company employs more than 80,000 full and part-time staff
including 2,000 at its head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.
Co-operative Retail Services, which runs 118 Leo's supermarkets, will launch
a promotion on Monday 'guaranteeing' the lowest price shopping basket on a
range of about 20 basic shopping items. The company promises that if the
basket can be bought cheaper elsewhere it will give the shopper twice the
difference in price back in cash.

FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester advances by 27% to
Pounds 184m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society, yesterday
confirmed its reputation as the industry's star performer by reporting a 27
per cent increase, from Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 183.8m, in pre-tax profits
for 1991.
It was the fifth year in succession that C&amp;G's profits have grown by more
than 25 per cent. However, the balance sheet was dented by provisions of
Pounds 108.4m against bad debts, up from Pounds 20.5m in 1990.
More than half of the provisions were made against lending by Portsmouth,
the troubled small society which C&amp;G took over in January last year.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, admitted yesterday that its bad debts
had turned out to be much worse than expected. Other small societies which
C&amp;G absorbed in 1990 accounted for 17 per cent of the provisions.
Total assets rose by 28 per cent to Pounds 14.8bn, while mortgage lending
was up by 22 per cent to Pounds 3.6bn.
The return on assets was 1.39 per cent, well above the industry average.
C&amp;G, already the lowest-cost producer in the mortgage industry, reduced its
cost-income ratio from 27.6 per cent to 25.9 per cent.
Mr Longhurst said that the performance showed resilience in a very difficult
market.
He issued a veiled warning to the government that unless it changes the
legal limits on the amount of their funding which building societies can
raise on the wholesale money markets, he may follow Abbey National and
convert C&amp;G into a company.
At present societies have an absolute ceiling of 40 per cent on their
wholesale funding.
The Building Societies Commission, the industry regulator, opposes raising
the limit since if most of their funding came from the money markets rather
than their members, building societies would effectively cease being mutual
organisations.
'We do not subscribe to the view that mutuality is the only way forward for
our industry,' Mr Longhurst said.

FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Holmes Protection Dollars 35.5m in the red
and seeking new funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security group that is restructuring under new
management following a shareholders' revolt last year, yesterday reported a
Dollars 35.5m (Pounds 19.8m) pre-tax loss for 1991 after exceptional costs.
Last December, new management under the chairmanship of Sir Ian MacGregor,
former chairman of British Steel and the National Coal Board, secured a
restructuring of group debt that would write-off half the Dollars 69m
figure.
Holmes said yesterday that its ability to continue as a going concern was
dependent on it raising sufficient funds in a proposed new share issue to
pay the lenders Dollars 33m within the 'next few months'.
The loss for 1991 compared with previous profits of Dollars 5.29m.
Exceptional provisions of Dollars 30.7m mostly related to the write-down of
acquired subscriber contracts. Interest charges rose from Dollars 7.29m to
Dollars 8.23m.
Operating profits fell from Dollars 6.6m to Dollars 3.4m on sales down 7 per
cent at Dollars 59m from an operational base reduced by the previous board's
sale of activities to repay debt.
Losses per share totalled 52 cents (earnings of 7 cents)
After consultation with Arthur Andersen, its new auditors, Holmes has
adopted more conservative accounting standards.
The useful life and carrying value of acquired subscriber contracts has been
reviewed, leading to the Dollars 21m write down, and fixed assets have also
been reduced by Dollars 3.6m, also taken as an exceptional charge.
Holmes said its strategy was to increase the recurring revenue base in order
to cover the high proportion of fixed costs of running its moni- toring and
servicing installations.
The group would pursue a vigorous sales effort and seek to acquire
subscriber contracts from third parties.
Orders for new installations in January had already surpassed the previous
year's level by 20 per cent and there had been a substantial drop in
cancellation rates.

FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Babcock issue to fund Pounds 21m Swedish
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BABCOCK INTERNATIONAL, the UK engineering contractor, yesterday announced an
expansion of its European operations with the acquisition of the materials
handling division of Consilium, a privately-owned Swedish company.
It is paying Pounds 21.4m for Consilium CMH, the world's biggest producer of
enclosed continuous ship loading and unloading systems, and the Consilium
Bulk group of companies, which make bulk handling systems for the wood
processing, energy, cement, minerals and grain industries.
The deal will turn Babcock into a significant force in the world bulk
materials handling market, with sales of Pounds 150m and 1,100 employees in
a planned new materials handling division.
Babcock shares rose 2 1/2 p to 58p following the deal, which is to be funded
by the issue of 42.8m shares. A further 23.5m shares, raising Pounds 9.5m,
will be issued to fund the development of the new division and further
strengthen the group's capital base.
The 66.3m new shares will be offered first to Babcock shareholders on the
basis of one new share for every 7.10713 held. Shares not taken up are being
placed by NM Rothschild with clients of Panmure Gordon, but it is believed
that the offer has already been heavily oversubscribed.
Mr Oliver Whitehead, chief executive, said the creation of the materials
handling division would give the company more influence in a big market with
long-term growth potential - even if some customer sectors such as the pulp
and paper industry were currently hit badly by the recession.
The division will comprise the new companies, the Claudius Peters materials
handling interests in Germany and the smaller Babcock Materials Handling in
the UK. The companies will not be merged, but Babcock will seek to remove
overlaps in sales and marketing and encourage the companies to help each
other win more business.
Mr Whitehead said Consilium's mechanically-based handling equipment
complemented Claudius Peters' existing range of pneumatic ship-loaders and
unloaders. Consequently, the combination would allow the new division to
offer customers more complete systems.
The businesses being acquired had combined turnover last year of Pounds
42.8m, down from Pounds 52.3m in 1990 and Pounds 59.5m in 1989. Pre-tax
profits slumped to Pounds 632,000 in 1990 before recovering last year to
Pounds 3.6m.
Mr Whitehead said the exit multiple for the acquisitions was 9.5, based on a
normal tax charge, and there would be no dilution in earnings. Over the next
12 months the deal would be broadly neutral for profits, but would lead to a
'definite enhancement' in the second year.

Pounds 80m

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC GROUP, the UK industrial gases and healthcare concern, yesterday
reported a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the three months to
December 31, thereby beating market expectations.
The group nevertheless cautioned that it had 'seen no improvement in any of
the key economies in which it operates' and that the Far East, where it has
been investing, was now experiencing a downturn in economic growth.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 70.8m to Pounds 80.1m on sales up 9 per
cent at Pounds 711.4m. However, after removing the favourable impact of
currency movements, the underlying improvement in taxable profits was 9 per
cent. Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 10.5p.
Volumes in the gases division had levelled off but prices and margins
remained stable. Operating profits rose from Pounds 67.7m to Pounds 73.4m.
In the healthcare division, which was encountering difficulties after
expansion in the US, medical equipment continued to experience difficult
trading conditions and profits fell. The pharmaceuticals division performed
well and the home healthcare business, which was slimmed down in the
quarter, was profitable.
Profits in this division as a whole rose from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 23.3m.
By geographical region, operating profits in the Americas almost doubled to
Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 10.5m); in Europe they fell to Pounds 29.4m (Pounds
33.7m); Africa showed a Pounds 1m advance to Pounds 11.7m and Asia/Pacific
profits increased to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 15.9m).

FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Study shows tolerance of dividend cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST INSTITUTIONAL inv-estors will tolerate cuts in corporate dividends in
instances where the entire sector is under pressure, although such cuts
could jeopardise their long-term relationship with the company, a new study
shows.
Warwick Corporate, an investor relations firm, has surveyed 12 of the UK's
largest fund managers - with a total of Pounds 250bn under management -
about their views towards corporate dividends.
Of the 12 surveyed, 10 said that cutting a dividend was not automatic
grounds for selling a company's shares. However, when the company returned
to the market to seek cash from its shareholders, the surveyed said it would
take them a long time to forget that it had happened.
The maintenance of dividend payments in the face of the current recession
has proved a contentious issue for institutions.
Last year, Mr Paddy Linaker, M&amp;G Group's chief executive, provoked a storm
by writing to the heads of some of the UK's largest companies urging them to
maintain dividends despite the recession.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, responded
that cutting dividends under adverse trading conditions was a sign of
strength.
Warwick's survey showed that while further dividend cuts are expected in
1992, they are likely to occur among smaller companies so that the overall
effect on yields will be small.
Most fund managers surveyed believe that dividend cuts are already factored
into share prices and that most fund managers have sufficient cash flow to
ride out any reductions in dividends.
Overall, institutions expect the dividend cuts to be concentrated in the
contracting and construction, composite insurance, engineering, building
materials and metals industries.
Those regarded as least likely to cut dividends are companies in the health
and household sectors, utilities, food retailers and manufacturers, and
telecommunications industries.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Ford pulled into Dollars 2.3bn loss as UK turns sour: US
carmaker hit by falls in its two leading markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUGE Dollars 2.26bn (Pounds 1.27bn) net losses incurred last year by
Ford, the world's second largest vehicle maker, derived mainly from the US
and the UK.
The long recession in the US has sapped the big three US carmakers, General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler, but only Ford has seen its main European profit
source, the UK, turn sour at the same time.
Traditionally, Ford of Britain has been the mainstay of Ford's profits in
Europe and helped out its US parent company during periodic crises.
Ford is the dominant market leader in the UK with 24.2 per cent of the new
car market and a share approaching 50 per cent in some segments of the UK
light commercial vehicle market. Now it is the parent company that is having
to shell out additional capital to rescue its British subsidiary.
Ford's traditional operations collapsed into loss in the UK last year and
its woes were compounded by the performance of Jaguar, the UK luxury
carmaker, which it took over for Pounds 1.6bn at the end of 1989. Jaguar
made a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 226m compared with a Pounds 66.2m
loss in 1990, reflecting a severe reduction in sales volume coupled with
large restructuring costs.
Worldwide Jaguar retail sales fell to 25,661 last year from 42,753 a year
earlier, under the impact of recession in its two main markets, the UK and
the US. It was also burdened last year with the heavy costs of cutting its
workforce by around a third to only 8,000.
Ford claimed yesterday that it had made money last year in its other main
European markets - Germany, France, Italy and Spain - but the huge deficit
in the UK forced the overall European operations into loss.
Ford of Europe's automotive operations, including Jaguar, slumped to a net
loss last year of Dollars 1.08bn from a net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990
and a profit of Dollars 1.19bn in 1989.
Ford's worldwide automotive operations lost Dollars 3.2bn in 1991 compared
with earnings of Dollars 99m in 1990. Automotive losses were Dollars 2.2bn
in the US (a loss of Dollars 17m in 1990) and Dollars 970m outside the US,
compared with profits of Dollars 116m in 1990.
The profits made in continental Europe last year and in some other overseas
markets were more than offset by losses of Dollars 761m at Ford of Britain
and Dollars 354m at Jaguar.
Mr Harold Poling, chairman of Ford, held out little hope for an early
improvement this year. 'Many of the problems that affected us in 1991 are
continuing into 1992 - soft economies, intense competition and excess
industry capacity.' He claimed that Ford's operating results worldwide would
show a 'substantial improvement' because of the company's 'relentless'
cost-cutting programme coupled with a gradual economic recovery during the
year.
The same main factors hit Ford's automotive profits in the US and UK, namely
lower vehicle production, much higher marketing costs in the form of
discounts and other financial incentives to push sales, and heavy costs for
the development of products.
Marketing costs last year jumped in the US to 16 per cent of its revenues
from 12 per cent in 1990 and only 6 per cent in the mid-1980s.
In the UK, Ford's total costs for 'liquidating' the stocks that it allowed
to mount up escalated to 24 per cent of revenues from 14 per cent in 1990.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford of Britain,
insisted yesterday that the UK operations were now in better balance, but
declined to indicate when the company might emerge into the black.
'We have a better balance in our business because we have got our production
and stocks under control and have got our marketing expenses down because of
that,' he said.
Ford of Britain, excluding Jaguar, used only about 70 per cent of its plant
capacity last year with its Halewood, Merseyside, Escort/Orion production
plant suffering 110 'down days' with no output, and the Southampton Transit
van plant suffering 50 'down days'.
In January, overall UK car and commercial vehicle sales slumped, but Ford of
Britain is forecasting some modest recovery in the second half of the year.
In the first two months of this year, the Southampton van plant has been
working virtually half-time, however, with output stopped on 24 production
days to the end of February.
At the same time, the Dagenham and Halewood plants are becoming more
dependent on export markets in Europe just as new car demand in Germany in
particular is set to slide from last year's record level.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Fujisankei may sell Virgin Music stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUJISANKEI Communications, the Tokyo media group which holds 25 per cent of
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Music Group, is likely to sell its stake if
negotiations to bring in a new majority shareholder for the business are
successful.
Discussions, which could be concluded by the end of the month, are
continuing with German media group Bertelsmann and UK-based electrical and
entertainment group Thorn EMI. A third US-based company is understood to
have entered the bidding in the past week.
Mr Branson is attempting to negotiate a joint venture or phased reduction of
his stake. He is keen to retain some investment for what one observer of the
deal described as 'sentimental reasons' - he created the division 20 years
ago, and built his airline and retailing empire around it.
Fujisankei, which paid Dollars 150m (Pounds 96m) in 1989 for its 25 per cent
stake, is not a bidder for the music division. Prices under discussion -
understood to be more than Dollars 1bn - would represent a considerable
profit over the Japanese group's initial investment.
The division's turnover has risen in that period - to around Pounds 350m -
and so have valuations of cashflow from libraries of copyrights.
The division is the world's largest remaining independent label, but it has
lacked manufacturing or distribution, which the interested bidders could
contribute.
Fujisankei is believed to be reluctant to remain a minority partner if a new
company takes majority control.
Last night Fujisankei was unavailable for comment.

FT  14 FEB 92 / 'Draft-dodging' row opens up Democrat race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL US congressional Democrats are taking a second look at entering the
1992 presidential campaign because of fears that Governor Bill Clinton's
chances have been irreparably damaged by charges of draft-dodging.
The leading contenders include Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Congressman
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House Majority leader, and Senator Jay
Rockefeller of West Virginia. None has shown his hand, but none has cut off
speculation about a future candidacy.
Much will depend on the outcome of next Tuesday's primary election in New
Hampshire, where Mr Clinton, once the overwhelming favourite, has seen his
lead vanish in the wake of allegations of adultery and renewed controversy
over draft evasion 23 years ago.
A prominent Democratic strategist on Capitol Hill said yesterday: 'Clinton
is finished. Electability is the issue and Clinton cannot make that case any
more.'
Another Democrat speculated that if Mr Clinton, governor of Arkansas, fared
poorly in New Hampshire, a group of southern senators and congressmen and
regional officials would press for a national figure such as Mr Bentsen, Mr
Gephardt or Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee to enter the race.
These arguments are propelled by general dissatisfaction with the quality of
the current Democratic candidates, generally viewed as 'second tier'. Mr
Clinton, a centrist southerner with broad appeal among liberals and
conservatives, was seen as the best candidate to beat President George Bush
in November.
The problem for new contenders is that filing deadlines for 27 states will
have passed after the New Hampshire primary, covering almost 60 per cent of
the delegates to the national convention which will select the presidential
nominee. This makes a late entry hard, but not impossible.
Pressure for a southern candidate will increase if former Senator Paul
Tsongas of Massachusetts scores a big victory next Tuesday, because his
appeal outside the north-east is rated as limited.
Equally, Mr Clinton's southern supporters are nervous about Governor Mario
Cuomo of New York stepping in, since he is viewed as too liberal to win next
November. Cuomo supporters are urging voters to write his name on to the
ballot paper in New Hampshire. This campaign, if moderately successful,
would highlight the weakness of the current Democratic crop.
Mr Clinton has blamed a Republican smear campaign for the controversy over
his actions during the Vietnam war. On Wednesday, he was forced to release a
1969 letter in which he acknowledged misleading an Arkansas reserve officer
about his opposition to the war and thanked the officer for 'saving me from
the draft'.
The three-page letter - filled with anti-war sentiment - could be
particularly damaging in his native south, which has a strong military
tradition.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Governor plays down fears of EC federalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN economic and monetary union need not lead to federalism in the
European Community, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of
England, said last night.
He underlined, however, that Emu would only work if all sectors of society
in participating countries accepted 'the key objective of price stability
allied to open, flexible and competitive markets'.
Speaking in Oxford, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said monetary union did not have to
involve such features as a sizeable EC budget, a European parliament with
powers of taxation and the development of more and larger spending
departments in Brussels.
Such demands - reflected in the latest Commission plans to expand the
Community budget by more than a third over the next five years - ignored the
benefits of the economic convergence that would have to be achieved in the
move towards Emu, he said.
Poorer EC members could gain as much from Emu as richer countries, he
claimed. They would, for example, be able to attract inward investment and
benefit from lower interest rates so that 'there should not be inexorable
economic pressures making for a federal budget'.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said Britain's policy of delaying its decision on whether
to join Emu fully did not put it at a disadvantage in preparing for union.
Britain was as well placed as other EC states to qualify for Emu, he said.
He warned Euro-sceptics against expecting that Emu would fail to be
achieved, as planned, by 1999 at the latest.
But he also made clear that many detailed problems had to be solved before
Emu could function satisfactorily.
In particular, he warned of possible conflict between the planned
independent European Central Bank, which will be responsible for monetary
policy, and governments if they revert to policies inconsistent with price
stability.
Another issue was whether the projected European bank should practise
monetary targeting. Also looming was a debate on whether to have minimum
reserve requirements for banks as part of the EC's monetary control
mechanism.

FT  14 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcement by Unilever that its heavily loss-making animal
feed and fish farming businesses are for sale is further evidence of what
the recession is doing to UK food and agriculture. Recent weeks have brought
mergers and consolidation in sectors as diverse as dairy, chickens and ice
cream. The news will not sweeten tempers at BP, which put its own animal
feed business up for sale only 10 days ago. But unlike BP, Unilever has no
urgent need for cash. More likely, its patience has finally snapped with
businesses which have absorbed management resources for decades.
The sale will bring to virtual completion Unilever's objective of
dismantling its historic structure of vertical integration. With oil
milling, packaging and animal feed out of the way, the company has
simplified its portfolio down to higher-margin consumer goods and speciality
chemicals. Unilever would probably not deny that the process has taken
longer than it should have. From the investor's viewpoint, however, it
confirms the impression of long-term strategy patiently pursued.

FT  14 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are times when Hanson seems gripped by an imp of perversity. As
London's analysts and fund managers gather today to hear the company expound
its grand strategy, they will be distracted by confusion over what on earth
the company is up to with its dividend policy. Until yesterday, buyers of
the shares could expect 11p per share of dividends  - assuming an unchanged
payment - by next February. They will now have to wait until April, with the
amount being doled out in four parts instead of two. In terms of present
value, the difference is probably immaterial. It is also claimed to make no
real difference to the group's tax payments in terms of cash flow. So what
is Hanson up to?
The answer seems a little depressing. Because the changeover to the new
system means that only half the annual payment will be declared in Hanson's
current financial year, it will have the cosmetic effect of reducing the
group's huge and doubtless growing ACT liability. This means the tax charge
gives the appearance of dropping this year, to some 18 per cent, before
reverting to some 24 per cent next year. As a result of this, earnings per
share in this year's first quarter were unchanged despite an unprecedented
and embarrassing 6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits.
Without this kind of fancy footwork, Hanson could put up a reasonable case
for its investment attractions. As Hoare Govett argues this week, the
company's solid portfolio in natural resources and low gearing means there
is simply no need for a break-up or final blockbusting takeover. Looking
ahead to the millennium, Hanson could present a combination of modest
organic growth and occasional acquisitions on the Beazer model. It is the
kind of strategy which could plausibly be entrusted to the next generation
of professional managers. But if Lords Hanson and White wish to present
their creation as transformed into a boring and stable investment, they are
going the wrong way about it.

<TEXT>
Government ministers rarely go so far as to admit that unemployment figures
are horrible. But the employment secretary was unusually muted in his
response to yesterday's heavy increase. If the trend continues, the
forthcoming general election may prove even more finely balanced than the
opinion polls suggest. The notion that the regional pattern of unemployment
might actually benefit the government in marginal constituencies looks
slightly weakened by the widespread nature of the most recent job losses.
The political equation is further complicated by the welcome news that the
annual increase in average earnings has fallen below 7 1/2 per cent for the
first time in 25 years. Moreover, it will doubtless fall again as large pay
increases from a year ago fall out of the equation: the three-month rate of
increase is already touching 5 per cent and heading lower. The benefits to
come from inflation are obvious. The question is whether the voters will
care more about stable prices than unstable jobs.

FT  14 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: BP turns the tap off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,522.6 (-1.1)
A few years from now, investors may well look back on yesterday's results
from BP as a critical point in the group's development. The traditional case
for investing in BP shares was that a stated policy of at least maintaining
the dividend in real terms protected shareholders from their exposure to
volatile oil prices. After yesterday's announcement of an increase just
below the headline rate of inflation, that policy is in question. More
fundamentally, the company is shrinking. As that message sinks in, the
remorseless underperformance of the shares may well continue.
It is not easy to see where BP goes from here. Last year's capital spending
of Pounds 4.5bn produced a net cash outflow of Pounds 1.1bn, bringing
gearing to just under 80 per cent. In the second half, replacement cost
profit was a mere Pounds 200m. Given that the immediate trading outlook is
unchanged, it seems fair to conclude that earnings can no longer support the
cost of the Pounds 227m quarterly dividend. Failing a rise in the oil price,
a further cut in the real dividend seems only a matter of time.
Granted, the group will be doing its utmost to stem the cash outflow this
year. The capital budget has been slashed for all but the exploration and
downstream operations. The assumption must be that further disposals will be
needed to close the funding gap. As a strategy, it smacks of damage control
rather than forward planning.
BP could conceivably be rescued by the oil price. But like the US oil
companies, it must be close to giving up hope on this score. After all, the
entire industry is suffering from the past assumption that price rises would
justify investment. If BP's difficulties are worse than most, it is because
its balance sheet was weakened by the 1987 buy-back of the Kuwaiti holding
at precisely the wrong point in the cycle. There seems little point in
berating Mr Robert Horton, BP's hapless chairman. The wider issue is whether
that single miscalculation will in the end bring the company's long-term
future into question.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Letter: Consultant says no conflicts in MMC research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From K E LUDVIGSEN

<TEXT>
Sir, You will be aware that some motor vehicle producers alleged conflict of
interest in the comparative car price research that we as consultants
carried out for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission study of the UK car
market. The allegation was made in a letter from Vauxhall published by you
(October 11 1991) and repeated in your article about the MMC report
(February 6 1992).
Our consultants carried out highly technical research, analysis and
reconciliation of car prices in a rigorous manner, strictly in accordance
with the methodology agreed in advance with the MMC. Had conflicts of
interest led their work to be biased in any way this would surely have
become evident with the publication of the report, to the detriment of our
professional reputation. The MMC report provides ample and convincing
evidence that Ludvigsen Associates was impartial and objective in all
respects in its work for the MMC.
In its report the MMC stated its satisfaction that our work 'in providing
specification-adjusted list prices was not undermined by any bias or
potential bias or by any suggested conflict of interest and can be relied on
for the further detailed work we ourselves carried out in order to establish
the extent of price differences'.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Letter: Insurance industry should tackle issues, says author
of SIB report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICK ANDERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate in your pages about insurance office 'early' termination
rates has focused the concern this creates within the insurance industry.
Perhaps, as the person commissioned to produce the report for the Securities
and Investments Board, I can try to isolate what I feel are the underlying
problems that the industry should be concentrating on.
A long term insurance contract incurs the majority of the expense associated
with it at outset. This covers the cost of providing consumers, those who
buy as well as those who do not, with information and advice about the
products available.
Consequently early termination of a policy is a matter of concern to the
issuing company, because it represents a considerable investment on which
the anticipated return will not be obtained either by the company, or
policyholder.
Any shortfall in the company's expectations will largely fall on other
policyholders (in with profit funds), and shareholders. Therefore the level
of terminations of policies, and their impact, is a matter of concern to
advisers offering best advice.
For these reasons we were prepared to tackle an issue which had been
consigned to the 'too difficult' pile, despite the shortcomings in the
generally available data as the report made clear.
I would like to suggest that this debate could serve a useful purpose if it
led to better information being available on an office by office basis.
Clearly, from Mr Scurfield's letter (February 1), at least one office is in
such a position and therefore could take a leading initiative.
However, information is not enough on its own and it needs to be translated
in action. Examination of the practices and selling methods of the better
performing offices would help everyone within the industry to be more
effective, and the regulators to see what practices they should be
encouraging in the interests of the consumer.
The industry needs to take a positive attitude towards the value of
insurance and the professionalism of the large majority of advisers. Too
often criticism engenders negative reactions like trying to shoot the
messenger.

<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Cross's article, 'Japan sidles towards a nuclear future'
(January 25), in our view contains a number of misconceptions. However, I
will confine myself to setting the record straight on just three items of
direct relevance to our agency.
First, the IAEA already inspects all the nuclear power plants in Japan. In
addition, the agency inspects all other types of Japanese nuclear
facilities, including research reactors and fuel fabrication plants.
Second, there is no evidence that these inspections alarm the public, as
implied by Mr Cross. Quite the reverse.
Third, Japan - one of the big contributors to the IAEA's budget - has always
co-operated fully with the agency in the safeguards field.

Sir, The arguments made by the Credit Protection Association (CPA) against
interest on overdue commercial debts ('Interest on late debts attacked',
February 5) are ill-informed and fundamentally flawed. Such a statute would
not give customers extended credit but where unauthorised credit was taken
would impose the costs incurred on the late payer.
Businesses which pay late already use their suppliers as unpaid bankers;
statutory interest would make them pay for the privilege.
Efficient collection of debts will, of course, still be important. But by
deterring the cynical and calculating late payer, it will be easier to
identify and pursue high-risk debts at an early stage.

promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PARVIZ DABIR-ALAI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The promotion of trade and good environmental policies need not be
competing objectives as your leader (February 12) implies. Further, your
underlying assumption encapsulated in your very last sentence ('. . .this
concern should not pollute world trade and therefore deny the poor what the
rich take for granted'), is that enhanced world trade necessarily benefits
the poor.
This assumption is certainly contestable in the short term. In many
developing countries poverty is the single most important cause of
disrespect for the environment as the well-documented cases involving
tree-felling demonstrate. Enhancement of world trade would be achieved more
effectively in the long run if the developing world had more of the world's
spending power. More trade per se does not guarantee this.

<TEXT>
If you wonder what will happen if we wake up 56 mornings from now under a
La-bour government, here is the answer in executive-summary shorthand:
Britain will become a regulatory state. If he gets the chance, Mr Neil
Kinnock will try to achieve by means of regulation and tax incentives or
penalties what his party could not deliver when it tried nationalisation,
demand management and the perpetual expansion of the public sector. Labour
has abandoned socialism, but it means to civilise capitalism.
This is evident from a close study of the several policy documents published
by the party over the past two years, but there is no need to consult them
again. Reading through all that boilerplate is anyway not worth doing for
less than Dollars 1,000 an hour, and it would take the seller of the service
many long hours. We can turn instead to Next Left, a slim pamphlet about to
be published by the Institute for Public Policy Research*. It is not a party
document, but in its general thrust it might as well be.
The IPPR is Labour's think-tank in the same way as the Centre for Policy
Studies, the Institute for Economic Affairs and the Adam Smith Institute are
the Conservatives'. Two of the four authors of Next Left are confidantes of
Mr Kinnock. I fancy I detect the voice of Dr John Eatwell, the Labour
leader's economic adviser, in some of the arguments. So while it would be
wrong to pin details of its proposals on the Labour party, we may safely
ascribe the pamphlet's tentative theorising to some of Mr Kinnock's favoured
thinkers.
Do not get too excited. This is no Das Kapital. It is not even a viable
synopsis for a 1990s equivalent of Tony Crosland's The Future of Socialism,
which famously sought to modernise Labour thinking in the 1950s. But it is
probably the best that British socialists can do at this stage of picking up
the pieces left by the collapse of the command economies. A small thing, but
Labour's own.
The essence of it is that the kind of capitalism nurtured by the
Conservatives 'badly needs reform'. It suffers from what the authors call
the two 'fallacies' of laisser faire. The first is that markets come first
and social intervention thereafter. On the contrary, they argue, the state
creates and sustains markets, 'the important point being that it should do
so in such a way that the individual energies released lead to socially
desirable results'.
The second so-called fallacy is that the pursuit of individual self-interest
will, by the magic of the hidden hand, produce the greatest good of the
greatest number. Not so, say our Kinnockites, 'markets have to be designed
to maximise social good . . . markets are created by political rules . . .
and different rules produce different results.'
This is in tune with the writings of David Marquand, a Liberal Democrat and
professor of politics at Sheffield University, whose centrist volume, The
Unprincipled If Labour is
elected it means
to civilise
capitalism
Society (Jonathan Cape, 1988), is as serious a work as Crosland's. Professor
Marquand asserted in a recent article in the New Statesman that 'the
capitalisms of Britain and the United States are hopelessly unproductive and
inefficient'. What he favours is 'a developmental or social capitalism,
which has been hammered out, without benefit of theory, in the solidaristic,
consensual political economies of central Europe and in the similarly
solidaristic political economy of Japan'. All this was a prelude to a
warning to Mr Paddy Ashdown not to take the Liberal Democrats too far down
the road leading to Anglo-American capitalism. Mr Ashdown should stick to
his guns.
If Next Left is any guide, a Labour government would travel in the central
European - that is, German - direction. The key Thatcherite liberalisations
of the past decade would be reversed. 'In our view,' the authors state,
'these changes have been little short of disastrous; collective
re-regulation of the economy is essential.' Re-regulation of the credit
market could be attempted by introducing a two-tier lending rate, a reserve
asset regime for banks and constraints on consumer credit growth. Industrial
regulation would, in takeover cases, include the transfer of the onus of
'public interest' proof from target to predator.
That apart, Labour's industrial interventions would not be outstandingly
different from what we would get if, say, Mr Michael Heseltine were to be
rewarded for his past 14 months of virtue by being enabled to realise his
dreams as super-secretary for industry in a Major administration.
This is not true of the broad sweep of Next Left thinking. It is far away
from contemporary Tory orthodoxy. Pension fund trust law would be
'overhauled', in the interest of combatting short-termism. The regulatory
approach is proposed for the labour market, which means the minimum wage and
much else, and - three cheers - for environmental protection. Let me stress
that the details I have alluded to will not necessarily become formal Labour
policies. The most likely outcome under a Kinnock government would be the
dilution of the extensive regulatory regime implied by following Labour's
current thinking to a logical conclusion. It would be milk-and-water
regulation by a party that throughout most of its career in government
practised milk-and-water socialism. But nobody can say that the voters
wouldn't have a choice.
In spite of yesterday's dour news on unemployment and house repossessions
that choice is still - just - more likely to be Tory than Labour. As one
minister commented: 'Look at the 91 per cent in work. For them, average
earnings are still running about 3 percentage points ahead of inflation.
When election day comes, those are the figures that will count.'

FT  14 FEB 92 / Japan's Mr Talkman: Akio Morito, chairman of Sony, outlines
his views to Charles Leadbeater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, stood on the trading floor of a Wall
Street stockbroking company, filled with bright young men watching computer
screens displaying flickering share prices. He turned to one of them and
posed his question about the nature of American capitalism: 'How far ahead
do you look when you make decisions?'
The young man shrugged: 'Ten minutes.'
The revelation shook the questioner: 'It was a big shock for me because
usually we look 10 years ahead.'
What the stockbroker's remark revealed - however facetiously - was the
extent of the clash between the cultures and values of Japanese and American
capitalism. It is a conflict that increasingly preoccupies Mr Morita, Sony's
co-founder.
He has good reason to be concerned that relations between Japan and America
are becoming more strained and distant. Sony's business depends upon a
cultural bridge between the two countries.
The consumer electronic hardware for which Sony is famous - stereo systems,
tape recorders, video-cassette players, televisions - largely entertain
people by playing American films, programmes and music made in the US:
entertainment software, in the industry jargon.
Sony's financial power is founded upon the success of its manufacturing base
in Japan. This has funded its recent acquisitions in the US entertainment
software business, most notably the Dollars 6.5bn it paid for Columbia
Pictures in 1989 and the Dollars 2bn acquisition of CBS records the year
before. By buying these businesses, Sony is seeking control over both
software and hardware.
As the company stands on legs spread between Japan and the US, it is not
suprising that Mr Morita believes it imperative that trade conflict should
not pull them apart.
The career of the 70-year-old Mr Morita was in part devoted to increasing
exports of consumer electronics, the very products that have come to form a
large part of the trade surplus which trading partners complain so loudly
about. Now in the twilight of his career, he sees his role as soothing the
tensions generated by the surplus.
Mr Morita founded the Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation with
his partner, Mr Masaru Ibuka, in 1946, two years after graduating from Osaka
Imperial University's physics department. The company's name was changed to
Sony in 1958.
He is widely admired by fellow engineers and senior executives in the west
and Japan for his combination of technological prowess and business acumen.
He has turned the company into a multinational group with 1990 sales of
Y2,880bn (Pounds 12.6bn) and pre-tax profits of Y267bn. His ingenuity in
inventing the Walkman portable personal cassette player has made him a more
public figure than almost any other Japanese industrialist.
A glint in his shiny blue eyes marks his passion for bright ideas and
unconventional thinking. But that is only one side of him. He can also fix
people with the steely gaze of a highly determined and driven individual.
In the west he is widely acknowledged as the epitome of Japanese business
success. Inside Japan, however, he is more often seen as a maverick, a
self-appointed apostle of radical reform in debates about Japan's future
economic and political role in the world, a subject most executives
discreetly steer clear of.
He entered the fray last month with a controversial article in the Bungei
Shunju, the monthly business and cultural magazine which called on Japan to
're-invent itself to blend with the prevailing attitudes and practices of
international business', or face mounting attacks from the US and Europe for
being closed to foreign competition.
Mr Morita believes that government agreements to manage trade frictions do
not attack the heart of the issue. What will resolve tension in the long run
is a deeper cultural reconciliation of the values and customs of Japan,
Europe and the US, particularly in their attitudes towards work.
Mr Morita's idea is what he calls a long-term harmonisation of social
structures and customs to establish a fair basis for international
competition.
He explained: 'Japan must change. We are doing business all over the world,
society is becoming borderless. The concept of competition must be
considered in that light. The social costs of Japanese companies might be
less than those US and European companies pay. It may be that difference
which makes it difficult for them to compete. So in the long run we have to
harmonise social conditions.'
Over time, Mr Morita says, Japan should develop some of the characteristics
of the European and US economies: instead of wealth accumulating in the
hands of companies, more of it should pass into the hands of workers and
consumers in the form of longer holidays, better pay, a shorter working
life, a better environment and quality of life, particularly improved
housing.
That adjustment will be needed in the long run if Japan is to overcome with
the foreign perception that its economy's competitiveness is based upon
delivering poor rewards to workers who nevertheless give unswerving loyalty
to their employers. Though he does not say it outright, Mr Morita hints that
he believes Japan would be competitive even were it to adopt western
approaches to work.
For Mr Morita believes Europe and the US have to change a lot, too. His
implication is that they are still too slow to learn from what has made
Japanese companies successful. Western companies pay top management far too
much and those executives often have the wrong attitudes. 'Top management
must regard employees as humans not tools,' he says.
Indeed, he suggests that many of the difficulties of western companies stem
from the shortcomings of senior executives. Although he found his experience
on the Wall Street trading floor shocking, he does not accept that
short-termism is simply the fault of financiers. Companies are also to
blame, he says.
He explains how he coped as a fledgeling entrepreneur in the late 1940s,
seeking finance to become the first Japanese producer of the tape recorder.
'We had already spent too much money. Our financial officer said we should
not spend more money. So we got the engineer running our manufacturing
plant, and bought the financial officer dinner, with a lot of beer. The head
of manufacturing convinced him the idea seemed promising. That is the first
step, to persaude financiers that production plans are realistic.
'If your industry wants to rebuild its strength I hope that top management
will pay great attention to persauding the financiers and banks to be
patient.'
While Mr Morita believes Japan should rethink aspects of its work culture,
he does not believe Sony's business strategy is in need of a similarly
far-reaching reassessment, despite the sense that growth is slowing in the
consumer electronics industry.
Sony's pre-tax profits fell by 25.7 per cent in the six months to last
September and it warned that business conditions in the second half would be
even more severe. Along with its competitors, Sony is pumping huge sums into
new products, such as high-definition television, which are still a long way
from earning adequate returns. Mr Ken Iwaki, Sony's deputy president for
corporate strategy, recently warned the company would have to cut capital
spending as the first half of the decade would be marked by unstable, slower
growth its largest markets.
Mr Morita faces down this gloom with a bullish account of the outlook.
'Consumer electronics will continue to grow because we have many, many new
applications of electronic technology for consumers, not just for
entertainment but for household uses and in communications.' He is confident
on several fronts.
The technology inside consumer products will become increasingly
sophisticated to make them easier to use, he says. Simple devices like video
recorders and televisions already contain small computers which control
them. Those computers will become increasingly powerful, making the products
they run ever more flexible and intelligent. People will be increasingly
using computers without realising it because they will not look like
computers.
Computers as such account for very little of Sony's sales. But it has set
itself the goal of making 10 per cent of sales from computers in the late
1990s, partly through forging alliances with groups such as Apple Computer,
the US personal computer maker. However Mr Morita reacts sharply to any
suggestion that Sony is only just entering the computer business: 'We are
already deeply involved in computers. Computers are not a separate business,
they are integral to consumer electronics. Consumer products run on
computers.'
The integration of computers and consumer electronics will be matched by the
growing integration of software and hardware, he believes.
Mr Morita identifies three further factors which should feed the industry's
growth - the extension, mobility and interconnection of electronic products.
Electronics will spread, to transform products which as yet it has only just
touched: notebooks and diaries will be replaced by small computers, while
ordinary kitchen appliances will be controlled by them. Products such as
specialised computers will become increasingly consumerised for a mass
market.
Products will also become increasingly mobile; they will be linked to people
rather than places. Mr Morita believes the portable telephone will be an
important product for the future. Televisions will not just deliver
entertainment, they will become tools of communication as well, he says.
This profusion of more mobile products will only be possible if they are
connected to one another by an infrastructure of telecommunications and
satellite links. The growth of consumer products will rest upon these
infrastructures being extended internationally.
Mr Morita has been like a powerful micro-processor, pumping away inside his
company, turning ideas into technology, technology into products and
products into money. But is it now time for a younger generation of
management to take over? The response is clipped: 'There will be no changes
in our administration this year.'
Having called the Japanese to consider working fewer hours, some might
suggest he should take a lead by retiring. At that kind of remark the glint
in the Morita eye dims and the determined gaze descends.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S sharp rise in UK unemployment should not have come as a surprise
either to the government or to City economists. Changes in unemployment
always lag the economic cycle, as the chancellor was wont to observe last
year while sniffing for shoots of economic recovery. But these shoots, if
they ever really existed, have browned and died over the last few months, as
the renewed acceleration in unemployment belatedly confirms. The result is
that it is the Labour party, not the economy or the government, that now has
a spring in its step.
Talking up the recovery was always going to to be a risky strategy for the
government. Last autumn's pick-up in confidence was neither reflected in
higher spending nor rising output. The patience of businesses, their bank
managers, and perhaps voters too, cannot last indefinitely.
Little wonder that confidence has dived, to be followed by a new wave of
redundancies. Unemployment has now risen by a hair short of a million since
the recession began, similar in sum to the last recession but at a faster
pace in its early stages.
Why was the rise in unemployment unusually rapid early on? Hiring and firing
is certainly easier in deregulated post-Thatcherite Britain, especially in
the non-unionised service sector. But unemployment also rose more quickly in
manufacturing. Perhaps exporters have taken on board the need to remain cost
competitive within the European exchange rate mechanism. Manufacturing unit
labour costs may still be growing faster than in other European countries;
but they are growing at half their rate of June last year.
Job-shedding
Sadly, this adjustment to the ERM has so far occurred predominantly through
job-shedding rather than lower pay inflation. Wage inflation remains stuck
above 7 per cent, higher than in pre-recession Germany. Manufacturing
(though not service) pay settlements do appear to have fallen further,
though not far enough. Manufacturers, needing to reduce unit costs and
apparently unable to reduce pay awards, have resorted to the only other
means available: cutting jobs. Output per head has been on a rising trend
since March of last year, a full quarter earlier than at the same stage of
the cycle in 1980-81. It has risen, despite falling output, because
employment has fallen faster. Nowhere is this Neanderthal approach to
reducing pay costs more stark than at high paying, low productivity,
loss-making, job-shedding, Ford UK.
Squeezed margins
Yet despite the pain, the adjustment to the ERM is not yet half complete. UK
wage inflation remains twice as high as it must be if what remains of
British industry is to hold its ground in Europe. Producer price inflation
has fallen, but only at the expense of squeezed profit margins.
Only when wage inflation has fallen below 4 per cent will full adjustment be
in sight. Tragically for the long-run health of the economy, as well as the
short-run health of many of its citizens, unemployment is the only mechanism
that anyone is willing to use to get there. More rational solutions
involving more co-ordination, synchronisation and discussion about
sustainable rates of wage inflation have simply, and shamefully, been
ignored.
At least the current, southern-biased recession means that manufacturers of
traded goods, and their ex-employees, are not bearing the full adjustment
cost. The wider and deeper the recession, the swifter the adjustment to
European rates of inflation and the better the prospects for sustained
recovery.
Yet this prolonged, and maybe even deepening, recession will damage the
government's confidence in its election prospects. Recovery will not begin
until affluent, southern consumers start feeling confident about borrowing
again, something that Mr Lamont will no longer be willing to count on. That
the Department of Employment felt the need, yesterday, to issue a new
booklet entitled Jobhunting - A Guide for Managers, Executives and
Professionals suggests the recovery may still be some way off.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Long road to an Emu
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MAASTRICHT represented the end of the beginning in the European Community's
progress towards economic and monetary union. The heads of government of the
European Community there agreed on an apparently final deadline of 1999.
But, as perusal of yesterday's speech by the governor of the Bank of
England, Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, makes clear, much that will determine
Emu's workings and much that will prove politically challenging remain
obscure.
Emu raises many questions, some technical; but the most important are
political. As the governor stresses, the Emu now agreed has become feasible
only because of the prevailing consensus on free markets and price
stability. Emu will come about only if that consensus is acted upon.
The governor believes it will be. In view of the loss of credibility that
would now follow failure, one must hope he is right that 'assuming no really
major disruptions, the relevant question is perhaps not whether Stage 3 will
start in this century, but how many countries it will involve, and which
they will be'.
Yet even if Emu will happen, it remains unclear how it will work. Will there
be monetary targets and, if so, how will they be determined? Should there be
reserve requirements? And where might the European central bank be located?
(In lovely, liquid London, pleads the governor).
Fundamental questions
These matters, important though they are, pale next to the fundamental
political questions raised by Emu. Above all, the workability of Emu depends
on acceptance of the German approach to economic policy. This does not mean
that monetary policy becomes a technical matter, like cleaning the drains.
It means that political decisions can be legitimately taken by a non-elected
body.
The Bundesbank does not pursue a precise objective labelled 'price
stability'. On the contrary, the D-Mark has lost more than two-thirds of its
value since 1948. What the Bundesbank tries to do, instead, is to hold down
the rate of change of prices. This policy involves large doses of judgment,
not merely about policy means, but about ends; about, for example, how much
disinflation may be appropriate to achieve how rapid a reduction in
inflation.
German consensus
What permits the Bundesbank to make such judgments is the German consensus
on what policies should be like, not merely monetary policies, but fiscal
and exchange rate policies as well. The governor is right to stress that
consensus, not any treaty, is what will make Emu workable. If the German
consensus were shared by all main participants, they would not force
inflationary exchange rate policies upon the ECB; nor would they pursue
irresponsible fiscal policies. But there can be no guarantee that the German
consensus - some might say the erstwhile German consensus - will operate
throughout the EC, a worry that has now seized a German polity already
shaken by German economic and monetary union. If the consensus were to
disappear, so would Emu.
Emu will also have large implications for fiscal policy. It is almost
inconceivable, for example, that greater efforts would not be made to
prevent a country from adopting a fiscal policy as anti-communautaire as the
one the Germans are pursuing today.
Contrary to the governor's view, fiscal transfers will also increase - not
merely because the poor countries want them. It is not that transfers are
needed to achieve convergence and integration (though they would be if the
EC were to implement the more nonsensical parts of its proposed social
charter). It is rather that larger transfers will be needed to deal with
regionally differentiated shocks in the absence of exchange rate
flexibility.
At Maastricht the EC agreed on a long and difficult journey. But this is not
just an economic journey. Emu demands political commitment and requires
political consensus. Greater political integration will be the outcome of a
successful Emu; but a deep consensus is the principal precondition for its
success.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Waiting in the wings: The Hanson succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Lord Hanson, chairman of the acquisitive conglomerate that bears his
name, rises to address fund managers in London today, they will be keeping a
close eye on his shirt cuffs to see what he has hidden up his sleeve.
Something is hiding there. At Hanson's annual meeting last month, the
70-year-old chairman told shareholders that successors had been identified
to take over from him and the 69-year-old co-founder of the group, Lord
White. But he declined to name them.
Their identity is unlikely to be revealed at today's first full presentation
to British institutional shareholders since 1988. Yet the question will
increasingly be asked: who are the mystery men?
The lords have tried to defuse the issue since they announced last year that
they would stay on until 1997.
The briefing today is the latest step. Lord Hanson will parade a clutch of
his top managers, including Mr Irl Englehardt, president of Peabody mining,
Mr Donald Borst, chairman of SCM Chemicals from the US, Mr Ronald Fulford,
chairman of Imperial Tobacco, and Mr David Snowdon, managing director of the
London Brick Company.
But they will not be presented as potential successors. The point is to show
that there is strength in depth. As one adviser to Hanson put it: 'James
(Hanson) has been stung by criticism surrounding his management style. He is
anxious to show the world today that there is a lot of talent in his company
that will continue with or without him. So there is no need to name a
successor.'
It is unlikely to allay the concerns of some institutional shareholders, who
are growing restive. They are particularly concerned about the role of Lord
White, following the controversy over the use of company funds to make
failed investments in bloodstock.
Lord Hanson's loyalty to his partner is unconditional. The two have
complementary skills: Hanson is the operator and administrator, White the
deal maker. Having risen together, they will probably step down together. So
the task is not just to find a couple of able executives but a partnership
which provides that combination.
They could reach deep into the organisation to bring up a young
entrepreneurial executive with the energy and flair they exhibited when they
started out in business together in 1963. The problem is that because the
two lords play such a central role in the company, people with
entrepreneurial ambitions have tended to leave.
Former Hanson executives are flowering in British industry, most notably Mr
Greg Hutchings at the conglomerate Tomkins. One option would be to bring
back someone like Mr Hutchings, possibly through a takeover. The drawback
might be Lord Hanson's sense of loyalty to those around him, which might
prevent him installing an outsider.
It is unlikely that Lord Hanson would appoint a pair of senior divisional
operating executives to the top posts. While such managers are highly
skilled at running individual parts of the business, they have no record of
identifying and masterminding the type of big acquisitions that fuelled
Hanson's growth in the 1980s. The appointment of operating chiefs would
signal to shareholders that Hanson was shifting strategy.
The main candidates are thus likely to be a group of long-serving Hanson
senior executives who are responsible for broader aspects of the overall
business.
Mr Derek Bonham, the 48-year-old finance director is a prime contender, the
architect of Hanson's sophisticated tax and financial systems which have
played a vital role in maintaining the group's financial performance despite
recent poor trading results. A former colleague says of him: 'He is very
bright, has a grasp of the whole business, a formidable character.'
Mr Tony Alexander, Hanson's 53-year-old chief operating officer in the UK,
is described by one Hanson financial adviser as 'clinically ruthless and
extremely able'. Mr Alexander is the man who often goes into acquired
companies to start rationalisation. A conglomerates analyst says: 'There is
something of the grim reaper about him.'
His counterpart in the US, Mr David Clark - described by Lord White as a
brilliant manager - is also a candidate.
Yet Hanson still has the feel of an old-fashioned family business and there
are two family options. Mr Christopher Collins, director of corporate
development, is a former jockey married to Lord Hanson's niece. He is a
chartered accountant, reputed to be personally wealthy after selling his
family's Goya perfume business. He played a central role in deciding that
Hanson should buy its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI.
The other is Lord Hanson's 30-year-old son Mr Robert Hanson, who trained as
a merchant banker. The row over Hanson's personalised management style in
the past year must make it less likely that the top seat will be handed down
to the family heir.
However, a former Hanson executive warns against expecting the lords to do
anything obvious. 'They will be thinking how best to serve the
shareholders,' he says. 'That could involve something really dramatic, like
selling most of the businesses and giving the money back to shareholders.'

The BBC continues its coverage of the Winter Olympics. Four titles are due
to be decided today: women's 1000m speed skating, team ski-jumping (what
wonderful mental pictures), luge doubles (two up, or perhaps down, on a
toboggan), and women's biathlon relay. There is also the first chance to see
the French ice dance couple, Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay, in whom the
British are being encouraged to take an interest since they are trained by
our very own Christopher Dean, who is also married to Isabelle. There is, of
course, desperately little British interest in these games. But there is 100
minutes coverage on BBC2 at 6.00 and 50 minutes on BBC1 at 11.55.
ITV brings back Surgical Spirit with Nichola McAuliffe again playing the
bossy but oh so feminine surgeon, a character which I find about as
believable as all those macho child-minding men which wishful feminist
writers keep inventing (8.00). The third anniversary of the death sentence
on Salman Rushdie is taken by Arena as an occasion to consider the value of
freedom of expression (9.30 BBC2). What a pity the book at the centre of
this controversy is so indefensibly turgid.

<TEXT>
If you pass near Trafalgar Square any time between now and March 29, this is
your chance to see the 'Madonna and Child with the Pinks' by Raphael. This
lovely masterpiece was painted when Raphael was in his mid-twenties. It was
rediscovered only last year, hanging in Alnwick Castle, home of the dukes of
Northumberland.
The 'Madonna with the Pinks' was bought in Rome by Algernon the 4th Duke in
1853. The duke savoured the pleasure of owning a superb work by Raphael, who
enjoyed the status of a minor deity in the eyes of 19th-century art lovers.
But within a few years scholars had started to question whether it really
was by Raphael. Then in 1897, the painting's fate appeared sealed when
Bernard Berenson pronounced it a copy by Giulio Romano.
It was too much to bear; the painting was banished to a corridor. Here it
was spotted last spring by the sharp eye of Nicholas Penny, the Clore
curator of Renaissance painting at the National Gallery. After technical
examination in London, the 'Madonna and Child with Pinks' was found to be
the celebrated lost original. Now cleaned and restored, this lovely picture
can be compared with the Gallery's own two paintings of the Madonna and
Child by the young Raphael.
Perhaps it has been a year or two, or longer still since you last visited
the National Gallery. Perhaps you have done the Sainsbury Wing and not
realised that the 'old' Gallery is undergoing profound changes. The latest
stage is a new display of the early 19th-century collection recently opened
in three handsomely restored rooms in the east wing. (The galleries were
paid for by Hazlett, Gooden &amp; Fox, with matching funds from the Wolfson
Foundation.)
Roughly speaking, the first two rooms exhibit what used to be called the
'French School', artists such as Delacroix, Ingres, Corot, Courbet,
Fantin-Latour and Moreau. The walls are clad in a deep red-pink fabric,
almost the shade of the executioner's tights in Delaroche's 'Execution of
Lady Jane Grey'. For good or ill, this huge history painting dominates the
room. Rather comically, on the adjacent wall there is Puvis de Chavanne's
'Beheading of St John the Baptist'.
The third room is the first devoted to Impressionism. The others, which
reopened last year, have incorporated the riches of the Berggruen
Collection. False ceilings and hessian wall-covering have gone, the carpets
have been taken off the wooden floors. There is now air-conditioning in
these rooms - although by no means everywhere else. Impressionists and
Post-Impressionists hang against a grey fabric which my eye tends to
register as denim blue.
A chronological walk now takes you from young Ingres in Rome in 1811,
painting the portrait of Napoleon's Chief of Police to the spectacular
Picasso portraits from the Berggruen collection. The Sainsbury Wing has
taken pressure off space so that many paintings will be coming up from the
reserve collection where they have been visible, although relatively few
visitors penetrate so far.
There is one striking oddity about the new hang. Why are the Goyas
interspersed with Ingres? It is hardly an illuminating point that the two
artists are so different. Compare and contrast, as they say, Goya's 'Dona
Isabel de Porcelor', a romantic portrait of an animated and sensual young
woman, with 'Madame Moitessier', close by. Ingres presented his wealthy
sitter less as a flesh and blood woman than as a kind of salon Sphinx or a
piece of gorgeously upholstered Second Empire furniture.
The Spanish interloper's presence in this otherwise resolutely French room
is because the National Gallery is now taking a bolder, freer line with its
hanging. Neil McGregor, the National Gallery's Director, feels transplanting
Goya is understandable because of the intense interest artists in early
19th-century France showed in many foreign artists - Italian, of course, but
also English and Spanish. Delacroix, for example, visited Spain and noted
the Goyas he saw in his diary.
'There is a huge disjunction between art history as taught and as it is
hung', McGregor points out. He speaks of the 'enfeebling notion' of national
schools which dominated museum display from the 19th century; the Gallery's
new plan will 'undo the nationalist thrust'. In this respect, as in so many
others, London and Paris grow ever further apart. McGregor rejoices in the
fact when 'le grand Louvre' is rehung, it will be along rigidly
nationalistic lines.
At Trafalgar Square, the very word 'Schools' has been banished from the
labelling. The curators believe that to the unsophisticated public it
conveys nothing at all - except occasional puzzlement as to precisely where
these mysterious schools could have been located. The grand plan is that
when the entire Gallery is completed - and that relies on sponsors coming
forward - it will have a firm chronological backbone.
However, conservative readers need not feel unduly alarmed. A 'no frontiers'
policy has so far been only timidly applied. One example is a small room
where Tintoretto, Elsheimer and El Greco hang together. Another is an
international room grouping 17th-century full-length portraits including
famous paintings by Velasquez, Van Dyck and Rembrandt. The 'new' National
Gallery which is slowly emerging may well have its oddities. Yet we can be
confident that it will also be better labelled, better for the pictures, and
a setting which visually will be vastly more in keeping with a great
national collection.

It is difficult to understand just what the Cholmondeleys (Lea Anderson's
all-girl troupe) and the Featherstonehaughs (their male companions) seek to
do as dance and theatre. Maybe the clue lies in a belief that the jokey
titles of the ensembles are sufficient guarantee of style, and that
supposedly humorous mime, thinly armatured with dance, is justification for
professional existence. What I have seen with these two ensembles in the
past amounts to strip-cartoon theatre of the flimsiest kind, and Lea
Anderson's new Birthday, unveiled this week as part of the Spring Loaded
season at The Place, is as anaemic theatrically as it is uncertain in dance
terms.
The six dancers of each troupe are involved in what I take to be satiric
comments upon the idea of celebration - from putting on one's glad-rags to
not being wildly happy with the presents that one is given. The cast nip in
and out of various outfits, groom each other (a not wildly appealing sight),
and spend far too much time playing with silver balloons. The creative
process amounts to scenes of laboured dramatics interspersed with dance of
minimal interest and curiously repetitive form. 'If three people do it, it
must be choreography' seems Miss Anderson's motto, and we see again those
massed stamping and wheelings, those fraught trudgings, that I associate
with her earlier work. The dancers potter about with a dead-pan air, and
fulfil tiny tasks, whose most vivacious moment comes when three couples
wrestle in their dressing-gowns.
Nowhere did I detect choreography as a valid means of exploring situation or
character, nor a concern for dance as an art self-sufficient and powerful.
Miss Anderson's sense of movement and her theatrical vocabulary provide an
evening ineffably heavy-handed, with gesture as a emphatic decoration to
dull steps. An accompanying score by Steve Blake was played by a jazz trio -
The Victims of Death - and sounded muddy and rebarbative. It reflected
exactly the quality of the evening. Birthday is the fruit of a Barclays New
Stages Award.

The heading above is not accidental. Although the Academy of St.
Martin-in-the-Fields Chorus and Orchestra have recently returned from giving
performances of Haydn's oratorio in Germany, they performed it there in
English, which may have surprised audiences accustomed to hearing the piece
as Die Schopfung.
There are no great claims for authenticity to be made on this matter. A text
in English was the spur for the oratorio's composition, but it was the
German version, adapted and translated by Baron Gottfried van Swieten, that
Haydn set to music. Performances in English (a re-translation back from van
Swieten's German) are an inessential by-product of the work's history.
Unless the singers' use of the language gives new insights. At Tuesday's
performance we had the tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson, an artist one is always
glad to see on stage, but not often as welcome as he was here. For not only
did the make the English text come alive; he was the only participant who
really wanted to put across the character of Haydn's score. Every phrase
added something, down to the little aside 'He made the stars also', sung
with a twinkle in the eye that was delicious humour and wonderment, all in
one.
The other two soloists were Amanda Roocroft and Michael George, a mostly
appealing duo in this music, especially Miss Roocroft, whose youthfully
radiant voice makes her one of the brightest hopes among British singers of
the younger generation. But they did not take the opportunity to impart any
new or deeper meaning through the words.
Unfortunately it was not that kind of evening. Neville Marriner has long ago
settled what the classical style generally means to him and draws from his
ASMF Chorus and Orchestra performances of high technical quality according
to those precepts. Put in front of him a score which goes beyond the basic
classical gestures, as The Creation does with its musical pictures, its
humour, its reaching-out towards real profundity, and almost everything that
matters about the work passes him by.
The warning signs came early on. When the choir intoned those magical words
'And there was light', the effect was neat, clipped - and absolutely trite.
Haydn's unique masterpiece was about to be despatched, with verve and
marvellous accuracy and unfailing tonal beauty. But despatched it was all
the same.

Room

Such is the demand for major artists that musical events are often planned a
year or two in advance. It has taken that long for the economic slowdown to
catch up with musical life in London, but the period since Christmas has
been ominously quiet and there seems little doubt that recession has now
arrived.
In the circumstances one is even more grateful than usual for groups such as
the Nash Ensemble and the younger Ondine, who rely upon a certain degree of
adventure to keep up their momentum. At St John's, Smith Square the Nash
presented two Russian programmes during the past week. According to a
favourite recipe each was leavened with vocal items at its centre, but the
real purpose was to provide a showcase for a pair of new Russian works.
The first of these was a Nash Ensemble commission, Dedicase for flute,
clarinet and string quartet by Edison Denisov. This was receiving its first
performance. A single note is intoned and then the other instruments cluster
around, pressing first above in pitch and then below, until gradually the
scope is widened. A clear academic idea is at work here, but the music's
most beguiling aspect is the way it combines string and wind sonorities,
often in the same register, to produce some strange and beautiful sounds. At
under 20 minutes, not a major premiere, but a pleasing one.
Wherever Denisov is heard, the music of Elena Firsova is not usually far
behind. Unlike her compatriot, Firsova has chosen to remain in Russia and
yet her style admits even more of the cosmopolitan, often French influences
than does his.
At the second Nash Ensemble recital on Wednesday that was certainly the case
with her Odyssey Op. 44, for mixed wind and string sextet with percussion. A
delicately Gallic appreciation of sound was always to the fore, but there is
a greater, more personal expressive content with Firsova and the music moved
quickly through different phases.
In this respect it was a journey, as its title implies, culminating in a
visionary final section, where the music disappeared up and away into a
mysterious ether of string harmonics, harp and bells. Like the strange
traveller who commissioned the work, claiming it would be taken on a unique
voyage by a lone rower from Russia to the US, and then went off never to be
seen again.
By crossing the river smartly from St John's I was able to follow the
Firsova work (a first UK performance) with the second half of Ondine's
French programme at the Purcell Room. This included a rare performance of
Faure's song-cycle La Bonne Chanson in the arrangement which the composer
made for string quartet and piano, only to regret the idea fairly soon
afterwards. In fact, it worked well in this venue, the voice fairly easily
audible, the strings (including the optional double-bass) adding an
attractive depth of resonance.
The soloist was the soprano Patricia Rozario, who has a nice mix of purity
and heartwarming grace in her voice. As long as a stream of relaxed tone was
called for, her singing was indeed wholly lovely, but there was not enough
bite to the sound or a sufficient grip on the words to dig much deeper. An
attractive programme nonetheless, decently well played, worth seeking out.

THE compact disc revolution has taken the music industry by storm, but music
lovers are still waiting for the day when they will be able to record their
favourite tunes on their own, in digital sound, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
Plasmon, a Cambridge-based manufacturer of optical discs such as CDs, is
entering the market for recordable CDs in a joint development agreement with
Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss chemical company.
The UK-Swiss team believes it has a more stable chemical which can be used
to coat CDs and make them recordable as well as give them a life expectancy
of up to 50 years. Each disc would be recordable only once.
Ciba-Geigy will provide the chemical know-how while Plasmon will be the
engineering and production vehicle. The two companies expect to start
shipping samples in June and to go into production by the end of this year.
Apart from recording music, recordable CDs have a range of applications from
photo-CD to data storage.

A MEDICAL system which could enable doctors to test for illnesses in their
surgery - without sending blood or urine samples off to the laboratory - won
a team of scientists at the Wolfson research laboratories at Birmingham
University the top prize in the UK's Toshiba year of invention competition.
The printed liquidic circuit system - resembling a large electronic circuit
 -uses standard chemistry tests, but carries them out automatically in a
single device - unlike previous more complicated methods.
The device consists of a single layer of filter paper on to which a pattern
of wax tracks is printed, defining the channels through which the body fluid
flows. The device contains a layer of antibodies to which the antigens in
the blood or urine, if present, bind. At the end of the test a colourmetric
device shows whether antigens are present.
A FIFTEEN-year-old schoolboy won the schools category of the awards with an
energy-saving device which could cut the electricity bills of schools and
factories.
After noticing that the lights at a local school were often left switched on
at night, Richard Mead, of Cheltenham College, set about designing a series
of clips which can be attached over the lighting circuits in the fuse boxes.
Attached on top of the wiring insulation the clips detect the magnetic field
when power passes through the wiring. The clips in turn are wired to a
central electronic box with a series of red lights on the top. When the
lights are left on, corresponding ones on the box light up too.
A HAND-HELD instrument which helps owners of oil rigs or power stations to
cut their repair bills won two divers the individual award category.
The device, sold by Instrument and Inspection Services, of London, is used
by repair workers carrying out remedial grinding on huge metal joints - a
process in which the sharp edges of the cracked surface are smoothed away to
help prevent further deterioration. The gauge accurately calculates the
thickness of the metal left by subtracting the depth of the grinding from
the metal remaining.
THE small business category of the Toshiba awards was won by London
architect Brian Perry for developing a fire escape system using
non-incandescent light. Intended for use in public places, the continuous
luminescent beams can be used to identify escape routes and can be activated
automatically by fire or smoke detectors.
The non-incandescent light becomes highly visible when the minute particles
present in smoke and dust from the fire act as a diffuser.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Technology: A smear campaign - Lipstick is becoming more of
a science and less of an art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading cosmetics companies are now battling for the mouths and minds of
some of the world's most discerning consumers - wearers of lipstick.
Gone are the days when wax, oil and a splash of colour was the order of the
day. Now those with the pennies as well as the pout are being offered
'performance' lipsticks - which colour, moisturise, heal and caress.
In Europe alone the wholesale market for lipstick is worth more than Ecu150m
(Pounds 107m), and a successful lipstick can increase a company's sales in
the colour sector (lipstick and nail varnish) by more than 50 per cent in
the year of the launch, says Patricia Fuchs, director of Geneva-based
European Forecasts.
Since Lancome, a leading French manufacturer, introduced its Rouge Absolu in
the UK in September 1990, for example, the lipstick has outsold, in unit
terms, any other product Lancome has introduced into the UK market.
For the up-market cosmetics companies the test has been how to differentiate
themselves from the cheaper brands, which have 'cannibalised' the market,
according to Fuchs, because of the large range of colours and finishes that
the more popular suppliers offer.
The easiest route for the likes of Elizabeth Arden, Lancome and Helena
Rubinstein has been to incorporate a moisturising element in their products.
Traditionally lipstick has had one of two drawbacks: if the colour endured
then the formula was harsh on the skin; if the lipstick was gentle on the
lips the colour faded rapidly.
So the test for the lipstick makers has been to produce a stick which
combines the best of both worlds. 'Customers want to have a treatment
lipstick. They want a colour guarantee and protection,' says a spokesperson
for Helena Rubinstein, now part of the French L'Oreal group, about its Rouge
Forever lipstick.
To do this the largest cosmetic companies have turned to their
pharmaceutical and even their food divisions to enliven their traditional
potions. Edith Clar, director of scientific communications at Lancome, in
Paris, says there is now a two-way flow of ideas between research
laboratories in the L'Oreal group (which owns Lancome). The organisation
includes shampoo and perfume companies as well as the more traditional
cosmetic makers.
This move has been facilitated by the acquisition of the big brand name
cosmetics companies by multinational consumer products organisations.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch company, famous for Persil soap powder and Oxo
stock cubes, has acquired Elizabeth Arden, Calvin Klein Cosmetics,
Chesebrough-Ponds and Faberge.
At Elizabeth Arden, the skills of 18 multinational chemists were taxed to
produce Lip Spa, a lipstick already available in the US and to be launched
in the UK in early March. The more conventional lipstick could be formulated
by a single chemist.
Lip Spa incorporates water - a task which is inherently difficult because
the oils and waxes in lipstick are incompatible with water. The technology
for emulsification came from the Unilever food division where it has been
well-tested in the production of margarines such as Flora, Stork, Delight
and Krona.
Also included in the potion are liposomes, which are being investigated by
pharmaceutical companies as a way of transporting drugs into the body. In
cosmetics they wrap themselves around the active substances to make it
easier for those constituents to penetrate the skin.
Lancome's Rouge Absolu, on the other hand, uses a technique called active
gel network, which took three years of specific research to develop, says
Clar. The stick incorporates a gel-like network of ultra-fine links. As
pressure is applied when the lipstick is put on, the colour and the active
ingredients - vitamin E, ultra-violet filters, musk rose oil, et al - adhere
to the lips. As the pressure is removed the gel-like network reforms,
trapping the pigments and oils on the surface of the lips.
Helena Rubinstein uses a similar approach with its Rouge Forever. The
pigment is encased in polymeric micro-particles which double up as a
moisturiser. As the lipstick is applied the micro-particles release the
colour on to the lips.
Fuchs does not believe that the recession will reduce the demand for
up-market lipsticks, which generally sell in the Pounds 10 to Pounds 15
price range.
'In an economic recession if women can't take themselves on a skiing holiday
at least they can buy themselves a luxury product,' she believes. 'A
lipstick is really an entry product to a consumer that is aspiring to an
up-market brand.'
However, the traditional up-market European and US cosmetics companies are
coming under increasing pressure in their home markets from Japanese
manufacturers, such as Shiseido and Kao.
Shiseido has been selling lipstick in its Le Marquillage range for the past
three years which combines colour and moisturising properties, developed by
its skincare division.
The colour elements are immersed in a waterproof and oil-proof coating, says
the company, so the colour remains on the lips and does not change, however
acidic or alkaline the skin. A second component is an oil which binds water
from the atmosphere to it, so moisturising the lips.
Shiseido's low profile in Europe - unlike its European and US counterparts
it does not have multi-million pound advertising campaigns  - serves to
emphasise its up-market image. Its products are only available in 10 outlets
in the UK, including Harrods in London.
Helena Rubinstein is now following a similar strategy in trying to
consolidate its sophisticated image. Where once its products were sold
through 270 stores in the UK, that figure has been reduced to 23.
The big cosmetics companies are also under increasing pressure as product
strategies change. 'The rhythm of launches is getting faster and faster, as
we've already seen in the fragrance market,' says Fuchs. 'You can be
successful for 18 months but then a rival product comes along.'

FT  14 FEB 92 / Management: When honesty pays off in the boardroom - How
executives can avoid criticism when their salaries rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big boardroom pay rises in Britain nearly always provoke public criticism
and sometimes anger among shareholders.
But companies often have only themselves to blame when the large salary
rises of their senior executives hit the headlines, according to Monks
Partnership, the company remuneration advisers.
Monks' latest publication* details good and bad practice in company annual
reports, and points out that getting the section on directors' remuneration
right plainly causes some companies difficulty.
Simon Rodwell, Monks' associate director, argues that much of the media
criticism over the past year has arisen from misunderstandings by
commentators armed with insufficient information about the components of a
chairman's or highest paid director's pay. The common misconception that an
increase results from a rise in base salary - rather than, say, a maturing
performance-related bonus - is a case in point.
'Those companies which make full and informative disclosure of their
directors' earnings generally receive a better hearing, for the simple
reason that they are taking the trouble to explain actions which, in most
cases, are reasonable and defensible,' says Rodwell.
But he warns that 'those who choose to withhold information and surprise
public and shareholders alike with a sudden, unexplained increase in their
chairman's earnings, should not feel aggrieved if they get a rough ride at
the AGM or in the financial columns'. Based on a survey of about 1,100
annual reports, Monks says that a growing number of companies, particularly
the largest, are beginning to disclose more than the legally required
minimum about boardroom pay.
Full disclosure in itself is no guarantee of escaping the headlines, witness
the outcry over this week's Pounds 750,000 pay-off for Laurence Cooklin, the
head of Burton.
Indeed, Burton is among the 40 companies whose annual reports are used by
Monks as examples of good practice in the way they handle aspects of
boardroom pay. The others include Boots, W H Smith, Marks &amp; Spencer and
Tesco, BOC, Courtaulds, Glaxo, British Gas and Welsh Water.
However many companies are still failing to provide more than 'minimal
disclosure' - sufficient only to meet company law, stock exchange and other
requirements. Based on its survey, Monks says that while more than 80 per
cent of directors are entitled to bonuses, only about one in 10 company
annual reports makes even scant mention of bonus earnings.
Companies like BET, British Steel and Lucas Industries provide more than the
minimum legal requirement and 'are ahead of practice in the overwhelming
majority of accounts,' says Monks, but are criticised for not conforming to
best practice and for falling short of the recommendations of the
Institutional Shareholders' Committee. The Monks report does not single out
individual companies for criticism, but does contain several examples of bad
practice, based on company annual reports but with altered figures to show
how misunderstandings occur.
Monks' report suggests guidelines for good disclosure practice designed to
give shareholders and other annual report readers a clear picture of how and
why directors' emoluments have changed.
Total board emoluments should be divided under five headings: fees, fixed
remuneration, annual bonus, longer-term bonus where applicable and pension
contributions, the report says.
The emoluments of the chairman or the highest paid director should also be
subdivided between fixed and variable amounts and footnotes to the
emoluments tables should include details of changes in board composition and
explanations of performance measures used to determine bonuses. Each tranche
of share options should be shown separately.

pale apricot sofa in his double-fronted private mansion in Holland Park.
From here, the founder of Britain's best known private company does deals
and makes sure that his personal image is coming across right. The phone
placed in front of him on a large, low coffee table rings incessantly.
'Look Trevor, I like these people, and I think they want to do a deal. But
we shouldn't sign anything, unless we can live with it.' Replacing the
receiver, he explains that he has always worked from home ever since a
teenager because it is 'snug, cosy and friendly'.
Until two years ago he worked and lived on a houseboat on the Thames, 'but
the meetings got bigger and so did the kids'.
Now he lives in splendour in Notting Hill Gate in a house bought at the peak
of the market. He works at one end of a 40 foot sitting room, while his
children have piano lessons at the other.
'It's really Joan my wife who put it together. She used to work in a
bric-a-brac shop,' he says, casting an eye over the festooning curtains, art
deco lamps and the overbearing rococo mirrors with naked cherubs carved into
the frames. The room is dotted with family photographs, including wedding
shots of Branson and his wife with their two children on a beach, everyone
in white satin, and everyone blond and very beautiful.
Branson draws attention to the heavy, ornate mantelpiece, which is groaning
with airline trophies. 'We have a lot of people coming here to lunches. We
try to get across that Virgin is the best airline in the world,' he says.
Branson is trying to turn the conversation his way and later admits as much.
'The only interview that Will (his press man) will let me do are ones that
will help the airline. I always try and direct the conversation towards it,'
he says, letting his smooth mask drop for one minute.
The approach apparently works: a recent appearance on a lightweight TV chat
show brought a record 38,000 calls to the airline the following week, which
he believes was directly linked to his personal performance.
What message does Branson think his office gets across about him, or his
company? He hesitates, seems unable to answer. The phone goes again. 'Hi,
look, how much will I be in the film? Do you think we are going to get some
nasty feedback? Right. Right. Right.'
Despite his reticence, the answer screams at the visitor. Judging from the
surroundings, Branson wants to remain an unconventional guy, and refuses to
enter the corporate mainstream. He holds no board meetings, does not go out
unless he wants to, and puts up visiting businessmen in his house, chatting
to them over breakfast with the family.
This style did not go well with being a public company and was part of the
reason for his retreat from the stockmarket. He also did not enjoy the
public scrutiny - and criticism - that comes from being a public company.
Indeed even now, Branson reacts angrily to any adverse publicity, however
slight - something which is apparently not just a matter of personal vanity.
'If someone doesn't like my sweater, that's a potential negative against the
airline,' he says.
A slightly scruffy young woman brings in a cup of tea. She is one of a team
of four personal helpers who work in the house. 'There's a girl called
Penny, a girl called Emma, a girl called Clodagh and a guy called John,' he
says. The guy and the girls spend a big part of their time dealing with the
200 letters which arrive every day, turning the relevant ones into a two
line summary, so that Branson has time to read them.
Despite the Pounds 1bn-odd turnover of his companies, Branson clings to his
distrust of the big organisation. 'I believe in 'small is beautiful', and
that companies should be run from the bottom up, rather than the top down.'
The Virgin companies are dotted around a dozen buildings in Notting Hill,
none employing more than 50 or 60 people. 'We've got 30 different
switchboards in the area - it might be more expensive, but it's much more
personal.'
His most important business aid is a large, black-lined notebook. This sits
in front of him on the table, with a proof copy of his 1993 Who's Who entry
sticking out of it. In this book he writes down 'all my meetings and all my
ideas. I have numbers 1 to 50 every day. If something comes up, I jot it
down'.
The book goes with him around the world. 'At any excuse I jump on a plane to
New York, LA or Tokyo,' he says. He then goes out of his way to chat to the
400 passengers and the 20 or so crew, which also yields 50 different
'thoughts, ideas and suggestions' which he writes down in his book. He talks
about the importance of dealing with complaints and striving to improve the
service.
It all sounds as if Branson is becoming a convert to fashionable management
notions. 'Total Quality Management? I've never heard of it,' he says. 'No,
I've never read any books with suggestions of how to run a business,' he
adds. The strong implication is that he doesn't need to.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Management: Such an elusive quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a company tells you it has a Total Quality Management programme, it is
trying to prove that it is a go-ahead organisation striving to do as well as
possible all the time.
Don't be fooled. It seems that all but a few quality programmes fail,
usually because the management failed to set realistic goals or look for
measurable benefits at the outset.
According to a survey by A T Kearney, the international management
consultants, and TQM magazine, 80 per cent of such programmes do not produce
any tangible benefit.
The findings are significant because TQM has become one of the main
techniques being used in Britain to improve corporate performance. Earlier
research by A T Kearney showed that the notion of TQM had become so
fashionable that nine out of 10 chief executives said they planned to
introduce it.
However the latest study reveals that only 20 per cent of companies which
have introduced a TQM programme report tangible results in the last 12
months.
Among the findings are:
Successful TQM programmes typically have a greater focus on the customer and
aim to give employees more authority to make decisions.
Companies which have successfully introduced TQM are twice as likely to have
made an objective study of their competitors through 'benchmarking'.
Where TQM has failed to generate tangible results the quality manager,
rather than a director, was often responsible for the programme.
Companies which practise TQM successfully share four common characteristics;
an emphasis on tangible results, insistence on performance measurement, an
integrated programme and a clear commitment from top management. In addition
they ensure that they 'retain ownership of the programme' instead of relying
upon outside consultants.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Days lost by strikes in 1991 lowest on record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER DAYS were lost through strikes last year than in any year since
records began 100 years ago, according to figures published yesterday by the
Department of Employment.
Provisional estimates put the loss at 800,000 days - the first time the
figure has fallen below 1m since 1940 - compared with annual averages of
12.9m days in the 1970s and 7.2m days for the 1980s.
The government is likely to use the figures during the election campaign as
evidence of the effectiveness of its reform of union law and to support its
claim that Labour would be unable to control the unions.
In 1991, 177,000 workers were involved in a total of 354 stoppages compared
with 298,000 engaged in 630 disputes in 1990.
The provisional figure for stoppages in December, the latest monthly figure
available, was 25 - the lowest for that month since 1932, when there were 21
stoppages.
INVESTMENT by manufacturing industries in capital goods fell by 15 per cent
last year compared with 1990, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
Spending on vehicles suffered the biggest decline, down by 39 per cent from
the previous year. Spending on plant and machinery fell 15 per cent and
investment on new buildings fell 9 per cent.
In the last quarter of last year capital expenditure was down 0.6 per cent
compared with the previous three-month period.
the value of investment in the fourth quarter of last year was Pounds 2.54bn
at seasonally adjusted 1985 prices, compared with Pounds 2.96bn in the
fourth quarter of 1990. Total capital expenditure last year was Pounds
10.27bn, compared with Pounds 12.14bn in 1990.

FT  14 FEB 92 / BP Chemicals to derecognise blue-collar unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP CHEMICALS is to end collective pay bargaining at its Baglan Bay plant in
South Wales in a rare example of a large UK company derecognising
blue-collar unions.
The company's plan, announced yesterday with proposals to cut 130 jobs and
change working practices at the 900-strong plant, sparked fears among unions
that other BP plants would follow.
Many companies have withdrawn collective bargaining from white-collar
employees, but it is unusual for manual-worker unions to be derecognised.
BP Chemicals yesterday gave 90 days' notice to the TGWU general workers'
union and the AEU engineers of its intention to end their role in pay
bargaining at Baglan Bay. The two unions said about 700 of the 900 workers
on the site are members.
BP Chemicals said terms and conditions of all employees would be harmonised
and each would be asked to sign a personal contract.
Pay would depend in part on individual performance, although initially
workers would receive basic pay rises of up to Pounds 1,300 a year and
improved allowances.
Mr Fred Higgs, TGWU national secretary, said: 'It is extremely cynical for
the company to try to end collective bargaining at the same time as
announcing job losses. It is an attempt to intimidate people into giving up
their fundamental trade union rights.
'If they get away with it at Baglan Bay, they may try it at other sites.'
The TGWU said it was seeking legal advice on the company's move. A meeting
of union officials from throughout BP Chemicals has been called for Monday
to discuss industrial action.
Baglan Bay is one of three large chemical plants owned by BP in the UK, the
other two are at Hull and Grangemouth, near Falkirk. It owns a further dozen
smaller plants.
The company proposes to alter shift patterns, increase team working and
train workers to take on a greater variety of jobs. To reflect the changes,
most employees will be called technicians rather than process operators.
Mr Alan Bilsland, works general manager, said the job losses and other
changes were essential to improve the plant's competitive position.
The company planned to use voluntary redundancy to shed the jobs over the
next 18 months but it was likely some enforced redundancies would be
necessary.
The company added that workers could still be represented by unions on an
individual basis.
BP Chemicals said that it would cut 50 jobs from its workforce of 464 at its
advanced materials division at Baglan Bay. The company blamed the cuts on
losing business with Canadair, the regional aircraft maker owned by Canada's
Bombadier.
BP said Canadair was bringing production of aircraft parts made of
lightweight composite materials in-house.
The 37-strong ruling general executive council of the TGWU has moved
slightly further to the left after the latest elections.
The left-right balance is now thought to be 23-14. Two of the territorial
seats have been abolished, taking out a rightwinger in the northern region
and the leftwing dockers leader Mr Walter Greendale from the Hull area. Mr
Chris Green, a leftwinger, has taken over the civil air transport trade
group.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALMOST one in 10 consumers are delaying making significant purchases because
of uncertainty about the general election, according to a survey published
by Barclaycard yesterday, Philip Coggan writes.
The proportion of those intending to postpone decisions such as moving
house, buying furniture or booking holidays, rises to 12 per cent among
people aged 35 to 64.
Barclaycard gives no explanation for this reluctance to spend, but it does
not appear to be related to Labour's plans to increase taxes on the higher
paid. Those in social classes AB are less likely to delay decisions than the
rest of the population.
The survey also shows that in spite of a rise in the official savings ratio,
the number of people who say they are saving has fallen to 33 per cent from
36 per cent in October 1991. At the same time, 18 per cent of those surveyed
were still running into debt, or using up savings.
The survey finds no sign of a revival in the housing market, with only 4 per
cent of those questioned planning to take out a mortgage in the next six
months.
Gallup interviewed 1,000 consumers on behalf of Barclaycard on January 28
and 29.

The force has the country's highest crime rate per 1,000 population and per

Home Office for additional policing measures, Northumbria, Merseyside and
West Yorkshire forces have each been allocated Pounds 3.6m for 1992-93. The
Northumbria Police Authority is also contributing Pounds 1.2m to the force.
Proposals being submitted today to the Home Office, detailing how it plans
to use its allocation, include closed-circuit television networks on
industrial estates and in urban centres.
Mr Stevens said earlier this week that he had been told by local
industrialists that 'the only blight to this area is crime'.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Financing a green future in a planet without borders: A
review of the World Bank and United Nations' Global Environment Facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN about environmental threats seems to mount almost daily. But
industrial and developing countries have so far made little progress in
creating an institutional framework for tackling these shared problems. In
Geneva, today, representatives from 24 countries will discuss the future of
the Global Environment Facility (GEF) - a pilot project that could
eventually form the foundation for effective global action.
The GEF was established in November 1990 for a three-year experimental
period. It is jointly managed by the World Bank and the United Nations
Development and Environment Programmes and, in principle, can commit up to
SDR1bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in grants and technical assistance to help developing
countries tackle environmental problems. It focuses on four areas: global
warming; pollution of international waters; destruction of biological
diversity through degradation of natural habitats; and depletion of the
ozone layer.
GEF funding is reserved for countries with a per capita income of less than
Dollars 4,000 a year. To qualify for funding projects must be deemed to
benefit the global environment, not just the country in question. The aim,
therefore, is to give developing countries a financial incentive to pay
attention to externalities - costs that are borne by the world as a whole.
For example, the World Bank might provide a loan for a coal-fired power
station. For an additional sum - say an extra 20 per cent - the energy could
be provided by natural gas. But the country is not prepared to pay the extra
for what is seen as a global benefit - lower carbon emissions. The GEF's
role is to cover the difference between what the country will pay and the
cost of a globally benign technology.
The GEF has Dollars 450m of projects under consideration. Projects already
approved include investments to limit greenhouse emissions in China and to
encourage biodiversity in Polish forests.
Most of the impetus behind the GEF has been supplied by European countries,
particularly France and Germany where environmental movements are strong.
But its strength today lies in the breadth of international support: 24
countries (nine from the developing world) have already pledged a total of
Dollars 800m to its core fund. A further 11 have expressed interest in
joining. Additional cash has been pledged through co-financing arrangements.
The US, however, is conspicuous for failing to support the core fund.
In Geneva, participants will review ways of developing the GEF beyond the
initial three-year pilot phase which expires in 1994. Three options have
been proposed:
Prolongation of the facility along existing lines with no increase in
funding.
Incremental development of functions with enhanced funding.
Creation of a permanent, independent institution to manage global
environment policies.
Most participating governments agree that a mere extension of present
arrangements would not be a sufficient response to environmental challenges.
Negotiations on international conventions governing climate change and
biodiversity are well advanced.
There is near unanimity that the GEF would provide an ideal umbrella
organisation for disbursing funds agreed under different conventions. It
already serves as a conduit for the Dollars 200m provided by the Montreal
Protocol on ozone-depleting emissions. A proliferation of funding mechanisms
for different aspects of the environmental challenge is widely regarded as
undesirable.
Participants are reluctant to talk about future funding levels for an
expanded GEF. But some observers believe that funding levels could
profitably be doubled or tripled once the pilot phase is completed. Much
depends on the remit of an expanded GEF: whether it should intervene only to
prevent national policies having adverse spill-over effects on other
countries, or whether it should seek to influence the development of
coherent domestic policies on the environment.
In practice, say experts, it is often difficult to draw a clear dividing
line between policies that do, and policies that do not, have international
ramifications.
The third option - the creation of a free-standing global agency - is widely
regarded as premature and will receive scant attention in Geneva.
In the long run, the GEF - or a successor body - will not be able to operate
effectively submerged within the bureaucracy of three separate agencies.
Ironically, the environment is one of relatively few areas where global
co-operation is genuinely unavoidable: there is only the one planet.
The case for a free standing agency capable of providing global leadership -
an IMF of the environment - is thus quite strong.
Developing countries will need as much as Dollars 125bn a year to introduce
the measures likely to be approved at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro in June, according to Mr Maurice Strong, secretary-general of the
summit, writes David Lascelles. Some of this would come from existing aid
programmes, but new money of Dollars 75bn a year would also be required.
Mr Strong said in London yesterday these figures assumed that all aid
programmes would start at once, which was unlikely. The figures were likely
to be confirmed by the World Bank's forthcoming World Development Report, he
said, and could be achieved if industrial countries merely fulfilled their
proclaimed aid targets.

<TEXT>
MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
has praised the success of Peru's 18-month-old structural adjustment
programme as 'an example for many countries around the world'. However, he
warned that continuing international support for Peru's efforts would depend
on substantial improvements in tax collection levels.
The tax system was 'a weakness that Peru still has to confront', said Mr
Camdessus on Wednesday during a two-day visit to Lima. Collections, while
twice the level of a year ago, are still equivalent to only 8 per cent of
gross domestic product. This figure needs to double again, and quickly, he
warned.
Mr Camdessus also stressed the dangers of 'adjustment fatigue', both for
Peruvians suffering the direct consequences of economic stabilisation and
for those abroad supporting it.
Peruvian businessmen, increasingly impatient with ongoing recession, are
demanding government intervention to cut internationally uncompetitive
interest charges and to fix an export-promoting exchange rate.
Congress, meanwhile, has rejected government proposals for raising direct
taxes on income and company assets. It has also passed an emergency law to
restore subsidies to beleaguered farmers. The combination could unbalance
Peru's budget for this year, carefully agreed with the IMF.
The past week in Lima has seen terrorist violence escalate, while the Maoist
Sendero Luminoso guerrilla group has called an 'armed strike' in the capital
today to intimidate workers into staying at home.

CONGRESSMAN Ted Weiss, chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the US
Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), is urging a criminal investigation into
whether Dow Corning misled plastic surgeons and the government on the safety
of its devices, writes Karen Zagor from New York.
This week Dow Corning, the biggest maker of silicone breast implants,
published company memos and documents dating back to 1971 which included
some reservations about their safety.
Mr Weiss also attacked the FDA over its decision to revoke the voting powers
of a member of its advisory panel on silicone implants.
Mr Norman Anderson, associate professor of medicine and surgery at Johns
Hopkins University medical, was stripped of his vote after he told Time
magazine the implants should be removed from the market. Mr Anderson is
credited with bringing safety problems with the implants to the FDA's
attention. Mr Weiss warned that the change might undermine the credibility
of the advisory panel.
The FDA said Dr Anderson's voting powers were removed because he appeared to
have already made up his mind about the devices. The advisory panel will
meet next week to consider new information about implants and decide whether
they should remain on the market.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Kenyan banking authorities caught by the political fallout:
A complex rescue operation designed to reassure a sector hit by bad debts
and questionable business ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S political reforms, coupled with western donor demands for better
economic management, have exposed the fact that at least two of the
country's banks have serious liquidity problems.
Evidence of the difficulties, stemming from a long history of bad lending
and an insecure deposit base, emerged this week, when the Kenyan Central
Bank began an operation to rescue the two worst affected local banks.
It amounts to a complex restructuring of the liabilities of Trade Bank and
Pan African Bank, both registered in Kenya. A Central Bank document sent to
the Financial Times said the banks had been experiencing a 'liquidity
crisis' following a 'loss of public confidence'.
In a press statement on Wednesday, the Central Bank reassured the market,
saying that any problems in the banking sector 'will be eliminated without
causing instability to the industry or loss to depositors'. It added that
sufficient measures were in place to ensure that 'no bank should suffer on
account of liquidity shortfall'.
The Bank's intervention follows the fall from power last November of Mr
Nicholas Biwott, the disgraced ex-minister and former confidant of President
Daniel arap Moi. Mr Biwott's liabilities were estimated by bankers last week
at Ksh1.2bn-Ksh1.4bn (Pounds 23m-Pounds 27m). Trade Bank and Pan African
Bank, the fifth largest in Kenya, are among the main creditors.
Unease in the business community deepened following the departure from Kenya
in the same month of Mr Ketan Somaia, a Kenyan Asian tycoon with large
banking and commercial interests in Kenya. Mr Somaia made a brief visit to
Nairobi last weekend.
The development highlights a weakness in the Kenyan banking system. Some of
the indigenously owned banks were created in the 1980s with the backing of
politicians. Several of these banks obtained much of their funds through
large deposits from state owned companies, acting under directions from the
political elite.
The deposits would then be lent on to politicians, government officials, or
business surrogates, often without adequate security, and used to develop
their commercial interests. Many of these banks also have a large portfolio
of non-performing loans. The accounts of state owned companies are now
coming under scrutiny as western donors urge faster implementation of the
privatisation programme.
At least four banks, apart from Trade Bank and Pan African Bank, are
struggling to deal with the combined pressures of large outstanding loans,
many of them non-performing.
In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this week, Professor George
Saitoti, vice-president and minister of finance, acknowledged that 'there
have been major withdrawals of money from the small banks in the last two
months. The era of multi-party politics has brought insecurity and there was
a kind of a panic.'
In the Central Bank document outlining the rescue package, Trade Bank and
Pan African Bank were described as having 'experienced a liquidity crisis'.
Among the reasons cited were loss of deposits following bad publicity
surrounding Mr Biwott's HZ Group, described as Trade Bank's main client, and
large non-performing loans both banks provided to Mr Biwott's group of
companies.
In the document, the official stressed that 'the resources of the Deposit
Protection Fund now amount to more than Ksh1.5bn and are adequate to meet
any liquidity crisis'.
Trade Bank, which was 75 per cent owned by Mr Biwott and his business
associate Mr Gad Zeevi until 1989, is owed Ksh450m by Mr Biwott's HZ Group,
according to the document.
It says the bank was undercapitalised and suffering from diversion of funds
worth Ksh200m to construct Trade Bank Centre, a business block in Nairobi,
and Ksh300m to finance an associated company. A Trade Bank executive said
the correct amounts were Ksh170m and Ksh108m respectively.
Pan African Bank forged close ties with Mr Biwott during his nine-year stint
as energy minister and handles the banking business for the Kenya National
Oil Company, the state owned oil importer. It is owed Ksh250-Ksh300m,
secured against Mr Biwott's Yaya Centre - a Nairobi commercial complex.
The Central Bank document said Pan African had suffered an erosion of
confidence after the death last December of its executive chairman. The bank
was also struggling to cope with the diversion of depositors' funds to
construct the Meridien Hotel, which Pan African owns. The total cost of the
project is Ksh1.27bn, as is due for completion in June. Other insider loans,
though secured, are said to exceed permitted limits.
An official at Pan African said last week that borrowings from the Central
Bank were 'in the course of normal business for a bank which finances the
country's oil imports'. Loans to Mr Biwott were performing and well secured,
he said.
In a bid to stabilise the market, the Central Bank has intervened. According
to Prof Saitoti, a deal was signed on Monday which would enable Mr Biwott to
pay off some of his heavy debts to the banks.
Prof Saitoti said a consortium of banks led by the Kenya Commercial Bank, a
majority state-owned company, would lend the Deposit Protection Fund
Ksh600m, which in turn would lend Trade Bank Ksh600m to buy Yaya Centre. The
loan will be for one year.
Of the Ksh600m, Ksh200m-300m will be paid to Pan African Bank and
Ksh300m-400m to Trade Bank.
This deal, combined with the Central Bank waiving penalties on the banks'
overdrafts, will provide substantial relief to the two banks affected, said
Prof Saitoti.
He said Trade Bank had agreed to sell Diners Club, an associate company, to
inject Ksh150m of new capital into the bank by February 29 and was closing a
Ksh200m sale of its Trade Bank Centre. Trade Bank puts the sale price of the
building at Ksh270m.
A Trade Bank executive said of the restructuring exercise: 'The Trade Bank
since 1989 has been professionally managed and we have taken dynamic
measures to deal with the situation we inherited. We have now corrected the
HZ debt problem by the assignment of Yaya Centre to Trade Bank thus
eliminating any loans to any of Mr Biwott's companies from Trade Bank.'
Trade Bank 'now have a very small proportion of parastatal deposits,' he
said: 'We have restored confidence in the bank and its management.'
The Central Bank has confirmed that Pan African bank is trying to sell
assets including Pan African Building Society, Corporate Insurance and the
Meridien project. The bank document disclosed that the government had
appointed a manager 'to assume control of the affairs of the bank until such
a time that irregularities have been eliminated'.
However several senior Nairobi bankers say the package arranged by the
Central Bank will still leave significant sums owed by Mr Biwott to be
collected or written off.
Yet to be tackled is a possible link between state owned companies and some
of the smaller banks. As an editorial in Nairobi's Daily Nation this week
put it: 'Why are some institutions enjoying unlimited access to deposits
from the National Social Security Fund  .. while most of the rest are not?'

FT  14 FEB 92 / Kashmiri militants thwarted on both sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K K SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN police yesterday used tear-gas in Srinagar, summer capital of the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, to disperse several thousand Kashmiris
who defied a curfew to support a pro-independence march from the Pakistani
side of the disputed Himalayan region.
Police said some 4,000 demonstrators stoned security forces trying to
enforce the indefinite curfew, imposed on Monday before the march started.
Pakistani troops this week thwarted volunteers of the Jammu and Kashmir
Liberation Front (JKLF) from crossing from the Pakistan-ruled part of
Kashmir into the region controlled by India, the front's Indian wing was
equally busy.
In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, Mr Amanullah Khan, the JKLF leader, said he had
called off the march to avoid further loss of life. At least three people
were killed in police shooting on Wednesday amid pitched battles between
militants and Pakistani security forces.
'They told us frankly that anybody who today, tomorrow or the day after
tries to cross their barrier would be shot,' Mr Khan said.
Pakistan banned the march because it feared an incursion along the United
Nations-monitored ceasefire line could lead to another conflict with India,
which had ordered troops guarding the line to let no one across and mined
likely crossing points.
The line which the militants attempted to cross is known officially as 'line
of actual control', drawn at positions held at the end of the 1971
India-Pakistan war over Bangladesh, which was also the third time since
independence from Britain in 1947 that they had fought over Kashmir. The two
armies still face each other across the line.
It was set by the Simla agreement of 1972, which laid down the process of
normalisation of relations between the two countries. The accord stipulated
a step-by-step approach with Kashmir as the last step to be settled
bilaterally and peacefully.
However, the two countries have failed to take steps to encourage
confidence-building measures despite repeated bilateral meetings. India
refuses to take part in substantial bilateral discussions on Kashmir,
accusing Pakistan of trying to internationalise the dispute.
Indian leaders and all prominent political parties treat Kashmir as a closed
issue, regarding the area east of the 'line of actual control' as an
integral part of India whose accession to the union is an issue they are not
willing to discuss.
However, the current tension bears testimony to the fact that three years of
effort by the authorities have failed to wean the population from militants.
If anything, the liberation movement has gained strength in the valley, the
heart of Kashmir, whose population is kept under control by armed troops.
Pakistan strongly supports the 'freedom fighters' of Indian Kashmir but
denies New Delhi's charges that it is directly arming and training the
militants.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, said: 'We feel regret when we
have to use force against freedom fighters. Pakistan holds the cause of
Kashmiri people dear to its heart but we cannot let Amanullah Khan lead
innocent people before the Indian firing squads.'

The military-backed ruling council imposed a 12-month state of emergency

MR Hans-Dietrich Genscher (right), the German foreign minister, warned

trade negotiations, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
In an apparent hint to Japanese leaders that they should open the rice
market, Mr Genscher said that Japan and Germany have a competitive edge in
industrial exports, but that international markets for those products would
be threatened by protectionism if the Uruguay Round collapses over the
agriculture issue. Tokyo indicated this week that it may not put rice on a
list of food items and suggested tariffs due to be submitted by March 1
under a proposal to replace existing trade barriers with a tariff regime. Mr
Genscher, ending a three-day visit, said the Uruguay Round 'must not be

<TEXT>
CHINA's longstanding application to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt) appears to be making headway after more than two years of
delay - a development that may be linked to a possible go-ahead for Taiwan's
application.
At yesterday's opening session of a two-day meeting of the working party
considering China's application, both the US and the EC welcomed the
progress made in reforming the country's state-dominated economy, while
arguing that China still had a long way to go before its trade regime
complied with Gatt rules.
China has recently pushed hard to reactivate negotiations on its 1986
request to rejoin. Talks have been stalled since 1989 and Beijing's
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and signs of a slowdown in economic
reforms. A founding member, China left Gatt in 1950 after the Communist
takeover; Taiwan was obliged to leave when China replaced it in the UN in
1971.
Next month Gatt's governing council could well approve the establishment of
a working party to consider Taiwan's membership application.

FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Ottawa tries to help hard-pressed
retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN government is extending a helping hand to hard-pressed
retailers by eliminating import duties on two dozen key consumer items and
imposing measures to discourage Canadians from shopping in the US.
Canadian retailers have singled out cross-border shopping as an important
factor in their difficulties, manifested in the recent collapse of several
well-known clothing chains.
Thousands of Canadians clog border crossings each weekend to take advantage
of lower prices and wider variety in US shopping malls. Canadian households
are also bombarded with catalogues from low-cost US mail-order companies,
many of which accept telephone orders 24 hours a day. In an attempt to
improve the price competitiveness of Canadian stores, the revenue minister,
Mr Otto Jelinek, said that duties of up to 12.6 per cent will be removed
immediately from a number of consumer durables, including microwave ovens
and video recorders.
Duties on these items, none of which is produced locally, total about
CDollars 60m (Pounds 28.7m) a year. As a disincentive to mail-order, the
government is halving, to CDollars 20, the duty-free ceiling on packages
from the US. Canada Post will also in future collect a CDollars 5 'handling
fee' on every dutiable parcel.
The measures come amid indications that the cross-border phenomenon may have
passed its peak with the weakening of the Canadian dollar.

FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Honda criticises US over ruling on Canada
plant
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA, the Japanese car maker, has angrily protested against a US government
ruling that cars assembled at its Ontario plant fail to comply with the
duty-free threshold of the US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA).
A Honda Canada official said yesterday the plant was currently operating at
full capacity and would not be affected by the ruling for the moment. The
decision could result in a 2.5 per cent duty being imposed on Honda Civics
shipped to the US, which accounts for about three-quarters of its annual
output of 100,000 vehicles.
The dispute, involving the application of the FTA's complex rules of origin
to the Civic, is becoming one of the most vehement trade rows between
Washington and Ottawa in recent years.
Besides concern that the ruling could discourage future Japanese automotive
investment in Canada, it is also likely to increase public pressure on the
government to reconsider its participation in the current round of talks
with Mexico on a North American free trade area (Nafta).
A Canadian official indicated yesterday that the Honda dispute had
emphasised the need for tighter and clearer rules of origin in the Nafta
pact. Canada is likely to refer the Honda ruling to a bilateral dispute
settlement panel.
Honda's US subsidiary concludes in a letter sent to US Customs Commissioner,
Mrs Carol Hallett, earlier this week that it 'is only the first of many
Canadian manufacturers who will face irrational and absurd interpretations
of the FTA by Customs, essentially nullifying much of the benefits of that
treaty for Canada'.
The FTA allows cars built in Canada to be imported duty-free to the US
provided they have a minimum North American content of 50 per cent. The
dispute centres on what constitutes local content. While Canada issued
rules-of-origin guidelines to the automotive industry in 1988, the US only
produced guidelines last month. According to Honda, most of the US
guidelines 'take the opposite position from those adopted by Canada,
although both are interpreting the same FTA language'.
For instance, the Customs Service has disallowed spending on worker health
and safety as well as environmental protection on the grounds that they are
not 'directly incurred' in producing cars.

THE TOP executives of the bankrupt Soviet Vnesheconombank (Bank for Foreign
Economic Affairs) have been suspended and replaced by Mr Yuri Ponomaryev,
former vice-president of the Paris-based, Soviet-owned Eurobank and former
head of the monetary department of the Soviet State Bank, writes John Lloyd.
Mr Ponomaryev's main task wll be to divide the bank into three parts: one to
merge with the Vneshtorgbank, or Russian trade bank; the second to launch
itself as an independent commercial bank; the third to strive to continue
acting as a conduit for the repayment of Soviet debt.
No principal on the debt - estimated at Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn - is being
paid, by agreement with creditors, and interest payments have slipped in
recent weeks for 'technical' reasons. Vnesheconombank has refused to issue
cash to its customers and appears to have used hard currency deposits of its
Soviet customers to pay off debt. Its inability to guarantee deposits has
helped stimulate a massive flight of capital to foreign bank accounts.

FT  14 FEB 92 / OECD sees gains for Portugal in ERM entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY Portuguese membership of the European Monetary System would help bring
down inflation and curb the country's growing economic imbalances, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggests today.
In its latest report on the Portuguese economy, the OECD pinpoints the
failure to meet inflation targets as a principal weak point in its generally
good economic performance since joining the EC in 1986.
The Paris-based secretariat suggested that the discipline of entry into the
EC's system of exchange rate management 'could help to ease the costs of
lowering inflation'. It would prepare Portugal for the eventual goal of
European Monetary Union. However, the OECD recognised the difficulties of
bringing the escudo into the ERM during a period of high inflation.
Consumer price inflation stood at 11.4 per cent last year - compared with an
EC average of 4.8 per cent. It is likely to fall only slowly to 10.5 per
cent this year and 9.9 per cent in 1993, well above the government's target
of 8 per cent.
Steady growth of gross domestic product is expected over the next two years
 -2.6 per cent this year, and 2.7 per cent in 1993. Last year's growth of
2.7 per cent represented a sharp fall compared with the average growth of
4.5 per cent in the preceding five years.
Although the OECD praised Portugal's 'excellent output performance' since EC
membership, it pointed to increasing imbalances as a result of high wage
growth and booming private consumption. Real wages rose 5 per cent in 1991
and would continue to outstrip productivity in the short term, the OECD
said.
The visible trade deficit, already 11.5 per cent of GDP in 1991, is likely
to widen further, leading to a growing shortfall on current account -
forecast at 2.5 per cent of GDP next year.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Commission fends off attacks on spending plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday defended its proposal to increase EC
spending by a third by 1997 as 'balanced and coherent', and suggested a
special summit in April to approve the plan, if the British election was
over by then.
These confident claims from the Commission contrasted with the reaction from
most member states, particularly the biggest actual or potential net
contributors to the EC budget.
German diplomats in Brussels noted that Bonn's finances were now under
greater pressure than in 1988 when it agreed to shoulder the lion's share of
the current EC five-year financing plan.
Britain and France, the other two net contributors, would see their
contributions rise - by around Ecu1bn (Pounds 710m) for Britain, say UK
officials. Italy, hitherto a net beneficiary from the EC, is set for 'a
bitter awakening', according to Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, one of Italy's EC
commissioners.
Mr John Major,the UK prime minister, yesterday added to criticism of the
proposed increases, saying there was already scope for raising further money
under existing arrangements.
The prime minister told parliament: 'There is already scope for
significantly increased expenditure within the existing 'own resources'
ceiling.'
The fate of the Commission plan to increase spending from Ecu66.6bn to
Ecu87.5bn over the next five years will become clearer when EC foreign
ministers discuss it on March 2. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president, wants the Portuguese presidency of the EC to call a special
'budget' summit in April.
Lisbon has baulked at this, reckoning so early a summit would fail.
Commission officials do not privately contest this prediction, but say EC
leaders need a first stab at the problem to achieve final success at the
Lisbon summit in June.
In place of the periodic rows over how much to give the Community, Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, France's finance minister, yesterday suggested an EC tax, whose
receipts would go automatically to Brussels. But no state backed this idea
when the Commission raised it last year.
Current EC spending is skewed towards agriculture, while revenue is drawn
disproportionately from countries where consumption is high in relation to
wealth. Britain, with a relatively small farm sector but high consumption
(as measured by its value added tax base), is doubly hit.
Its net contribution would be Ecu5bn this year (more than half Germany's)
were it not for its rebate, negotiated in 1984 and reconfirmed in 1988. This
rebate, which returns to London two-thirds of the difference between most of
the UK's EC payments and receipts, brings the UK net contribution down to
Ecu3bn in 1992.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Solchaga claims inflation success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE past two weeks Spain's veteran finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga,
has been telling the country that inflation for January of anything less
than 2 per cent would be a great success.
Yesterday, he seemed to have engineered himself a victory with a figure of
1.5 per cent, even though it was still one of the strongest monthly rises in
the past three years, taking year-on-year inflation to 5.9 per cent and
clearly breaking with the downward trend since last summer. Spain ended 1991
with inflation of 5.5 per cent.
The Madrid stock market reacted happily to the news, rising slightly, and
the government, naturally, trumpetedits success. January's inflation figure
was always going to be bad since average VAT rates have risen from 12 per
cent to 13 per cent this year.
The January inflation figure did not include an annual revision of house
price increase. Analysts say this implies the figures are understated by 0.4
percentage points.
The inflation figurefollows interest rate cuts of half a point by Spain's
two most aggressive commercial banks, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banco
Santander, and a sharp rise in car sales in January, putting the country in
a quietly confident mood.
It also seems clear that the spring wage round, which is getting into its
stride with a series of predictable public transport strikes in Madrid and
Barcelona, will see salary rises of about one percentage point less than
last year. For the moment, Mr Solchaga is sticking to an inflation 'target'
of around 5 per cent for the year.
It is assumed that February and March price rises could take inflation to
close to 7 per cent a year, but the government is obviously having some
success in slowing down the economy.
Mr Solchaga is also preparing to present Spain's Convergence Plan to his
European Community colleagues next month and it promises rigorously to
attack public spending. His problem is in implementation, and whether he can
win support from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, and the socialist
party hierarchy.
Mr Jorge Hay, chief economist at Banco Central Hispanoamericano, insists
that 1992 inflation of between 5.5 and 6.0 per cent is probable and that the
commercial bank interest rate cuts are not necessarily based on healthy
projections for domestic inflation.
Rather, he and other analysts agree that the strains being placed on the
peseta by the weakness of the pound sterling in the exchange rate mechanism
of the the European Monetary System could force cuts in official Spanish
rates.
Certainly, if UK interest rates are cut before a general election, the
Spanish are unlikely to try to resist a corresponding cut themselves.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Peru receives IMF's praise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
has praised the success of Peru's 18-month-old structural adjustment
programme as 'an example for many countries around the world'. However, he
warned that continuing international support for Peru's efforts would depend
on substantial improvements in tax collection levels.
The tax system was 'a weakness that Peru still has to confront', said Mr
Camdessus on Wednesday during a two-day visit to Lima. Collections, while
twice the level of a year ago, are still equivalent to only 8 per cent of
gross domestic product. This figure needs to double again, and quickly, he
warned.
Mr Camdessus also stressed the dangers of 'adjustment fatigue', both for
Peruvians suffering the direct consequences of economic stabilisation and
for those abroad supporting it.
Peruvian businessmen, increasingly impatient with ongoing recession, are
demanding government intervention to cut internationally uncompetitive
interest charges and to fix an export-promoting exchange rate.
Congress, meanwhile, has rejected government proposals for raising direct
taxes on income and company assets. It has also passed an emergency law to
restore subsidies to beleaguered farmers. The combination could unbalance
Peru's budget for this year, carefully agreed with the IMF.
When President Alberto Fujimori took office in July 1990, he inherited 60
per cent monthly inflation, a bankrupt treasury and a massive fiscal
deficit. After meeting Mr Camdessus in New York, Mr Fujimori imposed harsh
austerity measures to control inflation, eliminated subsidies and floated
the exchange rate.
Peru has been paying Dollars 50m a month to the IMF, World Bank and
International Development Bank since Mr Fujimori took office. The IMF
approved Peru's economic programme last September. The same month Peru
reached a rescheduling agreement on its Dollars 6.5bn debt to the Paris Club
of creditor nations.
Earlier this month Mr Fujimori signed a Dollars 115m loan agreement with the
Andean Reserve Fund.

FT  14 FEB 92 / Militants in Kashmir are thwarted on both sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K K SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN police yesterday used teargas in Srinagar, summer capital of the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, to disperse several thousand Kashmiri
militants. The militants were defying a curfew to support a pro-independence
march from the Pakistani side of the disputed Himalayan kingdom.
Earlier this week Pakistani troops had thwarted volunteers of the Jammu and
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) from crossing from the Pakistan-ruled part
of Kashmir into the region controlled by India.
Police in India said some 4,000 demonstrators stoned security forces trying
to enforce the indefinite curfew, imposed on Monday before the march
started.
In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, Mr Amanullah Khan, the JKLF leader, said he had
called off the march to avoid further loss of life. At least three people
were killed in police shooting on Wednesday amid pitched battles between
militants and Pakistani security forces.
Pakistan banned the march because it feared an incursion along the United
Nations-monitored ceasefire line could lead to another conflict with India,
which ordered troops guarding the line to let no one across and mined likely
crossing points.
The line which the militants attempted to cross is known officially as the
'line of actual control', drawn at positions held at the end of the 1971
India-Pakistan war over Bangladesh. The two armies still face each other
across the line.
The demarcation line was set by the Simla agreement of 1972, which laid down
the process of normalisation of relations between the two countries. The
accord stipulated a step-by-step approach with Kashmir as the last issue to
be settled.
However, the two countries have failed to take steps to encourage
confidence-building measures despite repeated bilateral meetings. India
refuses to take part in substantial discussions on Kashmir, accusing
Pakistan of trying to internationalise the dispute.
New Delhi regards the area east of the 'line of actual control' as an
integral part of India whose accession to the union is not up for
discussion. But the current tension bears testimony to the fact that three
years of effort by New Delhi has failed to wean the population from
supporting the militants.
If anything, the liberation movement has gained strength in the valley, the
heart of Kashmir, whose population is kept under control by armed troops.
Pakistan strongly supports the 'freedom fighters' but denies charges it is
directly arming and training them.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Privatisation free-for-all worries Czechoslovaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAK bankers are becoming increasingly worried that lack of
regulation is threatening the country's mass privatisation programme,
launched last month.
Last autumn, government officials reckoned only 4m citizens would be
interested in the privatisation scheme - which involves distributing
state-owned enterprises to the public through equity vouchers. However, the
number of participants soared to nearly 8m after private investment funds
offered tenfold cash guarantees in a year's time to those prepared to assign
their vouchers to them.
These investment funds, unregulated by any investment law, have prompted
worries that failure to live up to such promises will endanger the workings
of the future private economy. The pressure to sell assets to meet
guaranteed returns as well as operational costs could lead to a liquidity
crisis and a capital market collapse, say bankers.
Reacting to such criticism, the federal government is drafting a law which
would force investment funds to diversify their portfolios. But officials
are not tackling the problem of guarantees.
The need for regulation is all the more urgent because of the political
wrangles dominating the federal parliament. For months, Czech and Slovak
deputies have been debating the future of the political structure which
binds them in one country. Slovak deputies, in particular, have regularly
opposed the passage of federal laws. Many politicians, also, do not want to
push through legislation before next June's general election.
At the moment, investment funds are regulated only by a few paragraphs on
joint-stock companies in the business code. Czechoslovakia also does not yet
have an investment companies law or a securities trading law. The stock
exchange law is in the making and should allow for the creation of a trading
floor this autumn when the first tranche of vouchers are expected to become
shares.
Under the privatisation programme, an estimated Kcs200bn (Pounds 4bn)-worth
of equity from state-owned enterprises will be distributed next month to the
public in the form of vouchers.

FT  13 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in stock index futures fell as traders contemplated the poor
economic outlook, and uncertainty over the prospect of a fall in the UK
interest rates remained.
The cautious opening of the March contract briefly gave way to buying,
mainly by US houses, leaving independent traders short and sending the
contract advancing to 2,556.
That momentum was not sustained and Wall Street's sensitive opening sent
March down once again, although a brief rally was noted towards the market
close as Wall Street steadied.
Turnover had reached only 4,687 contracts by the close as March closed at
2,539, down 11 on the previous session and just ahead of its estimated fair
value premium to cash of around 10.
In traded options, turnover, though poor at 22,487 contracts, was ahead of
Tuesday's 17,173. The FT-SE 100 Index option had 7,256 lots dealt.
BT was the busiest stock option with 2,419 lots. The May 330 calls and May
330 puts were the busiest series, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to have done
a cross in the stock options. This was followed by Barclays, which traded
1,250 contracts, with a call spread said to have been part of the day's
trades.

FT  13 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares weak as base rate hopes fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's dis-couragement of optimism for early cuts in domestic
interest rates left UK stocks to drift lower in thin trading yesterday.
Investors were also cautious ahead of news from the opening day of the
meeting of Opec ministers. Rumours of another Soviet coup, while not taken
too seriously and soon denied, helped unsettle a market already lacking
confidence.
Turnover in UK equities remained depressingly low, although there was no
lack of specific features to keep traders on the alert. Increasing signs of
stakebuilding in Lonrho, the mining and industrial group, brought
suggestions that Charter Consolidated might be the interested party.
Lacklustre performances from Tokyo and from Wall Street, where the Dow
managed a gain of a mere 2 points early in its new trading session,
undermined London throughout the day, and helped prompt a minor sell-off
towards the close.
After rallying at first from a loss of 12 points on the Footsie scale, the
market turned down again to finish at the day's lowest levels. The final
read-ing put the FT-SE Index at 2,523.7 for a decline of 13.4.
Once again, however, the more revealing picture of the market came from a
Seaq volume total of only 448.1m shares; Tuesday's 432.7m shares reflected
retail business of only Pounds 768.7m, still well below the Pounds 1bn
benchmark of a financially healthy stock market session.
Revived concern over the fortunes of the property sector, both in the UK and
in Japan, helped to dampen investment confidence. P &amp; O suffered a renewed
selling bout on new worries over its property interests and there were
losses in most of the leading property stocks.
The fall in trading volume is ascribed by market strategists to the prospect
of a general election in the UK this spring, probably at the beginning of
April. The equity market appears to have settled into a trading range which
may not be challenged unless the outcome of the election becomes more
clearly predictable.
The lack of genuine investment interest left the market open to speculative
excitement in a few selected areas, but traders admitted that the big
investment institutions largely refused to play. Some building shares
advanced, in spite of the discouragement of interest rate optimism, which
received a further twist when similar hopes in Spain were also damped down.
The international leaders showed a mixed pattern, drawing little solid
benefit from the firmness of the US dollar, in which many of their profits
are received. ICI stood out firmly but Wellcome, Glaxo and BAT Industries
all gave ground.
The stock market became more cautious at the close as some traders backed
away in front of the announcement today of the December average earnings
data for the UK. Pay proposals this week for some public sector workers,
including teachers and the armed forces, have revived fears that wage
inflation may continue to hinder recovery from the economic recession still
bearing down on domestic industry.
The market also faces statistics today on UK employment and mortgage
repossessions, while tomorrow brings the domestic inflation numbers for
January. Equity analysts expect inflation to have levelled out, or at best
fallen only very slightly.

FT  13 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling bout in P &amp; O
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE
THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in P &amp; O fell sharply, losing 22 early in the session on market talk
of developments at Chelsfield, the private company with which P &amp; O jointly
owns the Pall Mall Properties venture.
P &amp; O, now in its closed reporting season ahead of the next profits
statement, would say only that it did not 'comment on market rumours'.
However, a leading agency service appeared to quote a P &amp; O source as
saying: 'There is no truth in the rumours.' This helped to steady nerves in
the stock market, and the shares came off the bottom to finish 12 down at
398p on turnover of 5.6m.
After the market closed, Mr Elliot Bernard, chairman of Chelsfield, said:
'All we are doing is raising funds to complete the demerger of Pall Mall
Properties, as already publicly stated.'
Reuters busy
The announcement of full-year results by Reuters Holdings, the international
news and information organisation, prompted a highly volatile trading
session for the stock. The shares were 34 down at one stage but closed a
penny firmer at 1104p with more than 3m traded.
The stock had risen strongly in recent days ahead of the figures and most
observers said the company would need to pull something out of the hat if
the rise were to be sustained.
The shares were lower at the market opening yesterday and fell sharply when
it transpired that the figures were directly in line with analysts'
forecasts and that sales growth was predicted to be slower this year than
last. Many houses, particularly Morgan Stanley, were offering stock, but US
investment bank Goldman Sachs bought aggressively.
Then, at the company's presentation, analysts took a more considered view of
the figures, particularly the higher than expected cash reserves of Pounds
500m. Also, managing director Mr Peter Job said he was confident that
Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 automatic dealing system would be launched soon
following successful site tests. The shares recovered and Warburg was able
to offer shares at 1110p after bidding at 1080p.
The market buzzed with stories that a stakebuilder had been at work in
Lonrho, the troubled conglomerate, and that a shareholding in excess of 3
per cent and possibly as high as 5 per cent was about to be announced. The
suggestions inevitably triggered rumours of an imminent bid and the shares
responded by moving up 5 to 127p with a hefty 4.9m traded. Dealers also
noted good buying in the traded options market.
There has been very heavy turnover in Lonrho since it revealed sharply
reduced profits and a cut in the dividend on January 23. A stakebuilder
could have taken advantage of this weakness and the ready availability of
stock. Lonrho plummeted before and after the dividend cut, slumping from the
200p mark in December last year to a low of 108p at one point.
Earlier in the session, there were rumours that Charter Consolidated, the
industrial materials group, was about to launch a bid for Lonrho and would
help to finance such a move by selling its near 39 per cent holding in
Johnson Matthey, the precious metals refining group, to Rustenburg, one of
the world's biggest platinum producers. Charter held at 527p, while Johnson
Matthey was a shade easier at 368p.
Leading property shares were badly hit by the nervousness surrounding P &amp; O
and Chelsfield. One trader said: 'The sector is very nervous and it just
takes a story like this to put it into reverse.' The weakest stocks included
MEPC, down 10 at 367p, Land Securities, off 10 at 457p, and Hammerson
Ordinary, 12 cheaper at 485p.
Poor sentiment over British Aerospace saw the shares fall 12 to 270p, a
five-year low, on turnover of 4.5m. There are worries that the current weak
oil price may delay the placing of firm orders, particularly the Al Yamamah
2 contract from Saudi Arabia. Fears for the 1992 dividend have also
surfaced.
British Airways continued to bask in the glow of Tuesday's better than
expected results, adding 6 at 254p on 10m traded.
Lloyds Bank underperformed the sector, in spite of a broker buy
recommendation, and closed 8 down at 389p on good turnover of 2.8m as the
market responded to stories that Lloyds is sole banker to Chelsfield, the
privately owned property development group.
Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance, badly hit by recent profits downgrades,
staged a minor rally, the latter boosted by a recent heavyweight research
document from Smith New Court. Royal put on 9 to 229p and Sun 2 to 271p.
A Kleinwort Benson review of forthcoming preliminary results from the life
assurance sector prompted keen interest in Legal &amp; General and Lloyds Abbey
Life. The latter improved 3 to 388p as Kleinwort increased its final
dividend estimate to 6.3p, up 5 per cent on last year, following Lloyds
Abbey's unexpectedly good new business figures. Kleinwort is more cautious
on L &amp; G, which lost 8 to 350p.
Racal Electronics dipped 1 1/2 to 52p with turnover remaining high at 6.3m.
Electronic Data, one of the market's high-flyers recently, attracted
profit-taking and slid 73 to 440p.
Talk that a large block of Taylor Woodrow stock was overhanging the market
left the shares 6 down at 106p, the lowest for more than five years. The
shares have tumbled recently as analysts chopped profits estimates for the
group to take in expected land provisions. Morgan Stanley has shifted its
1991 profits estimate from Pounds 25m to zero, while Panmure Gordon recently
cut its 1991 figure from Pounds 32m to Pounds 20m.
Wellcome fell 15 to 1103p ahead of a television programme expected to be
critical of its Aids treatment Retrovir, or AZT. Two weeks ago Wellcome
shares jumped 24 after the company announced that a study had shown Retrovir
could be used at an earlier stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection.
Selling of Glaxo American Depositary Receipts in New York by the US house
Bear Sterns was said to be behind a fall, for the shares in London, of 12
1/2 to 804 1/2 p.
Tobacco groups BAT Industries and Rothmans International continued to suffer
on fears that the European Parliament would back an EC plan to ban all
tobacco advertising, except at the point of sale. BAT, also depressed by the
expected effect of US floods on its insurance subsidiary Eagle Star,
weakened 14 to 637p. Rothmans fell 14 to 1074p.
Buy notes on Compass Group pushed it 3 higher to 440p. Paribas, the
French-owned broking house, pointed to Compass's increased hospital
occupancy levels, while Nomura drew attention to the potential for catering
contracts.
Leisure group Ladbroke continued to attract attention ahead of its results,
due next month, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew confirming 'moderate' business in one of
their recommended stocks. The shares added 4 at 219p on a turnover of 2.8m.
Guinness rose 2 to 574p, supported by a strong buy recommendation from
Shearson Lehman Brothers, which emphasised growth in profits from the beer
division. Shearson believes beer, representing 27 per cent of profits, will
outperform spirits in the near future. Nomura also recommended Guinness
recently, expecting the company to outperform the market over the next five
years.
Food retailer Kwik Save receded 7 to 573p as County NatWest, continuing the
recent trend among brokers, cut its profits forecast for the second time in
a week, this time by Pounds 5m to Pounds 113m.
Specialist chemical and industrial company BTP lost 8 to 244p after
announcing a one-for-six rights issue at 205p to raise Pounds 28.3m to pay
debt and cover the cost of new acquisitions. Hoare Govett's chemicals
analyst Mr Martin Evans changed his recommendation on the stock from
'undervalued' to 'buy' and said that after the dilution of the new shares
was taken into account the price had only declined by a penny.

FT  13 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sets record high as bond
weakness ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
IN SPITE of continued weakness in bond prices, US stock markets retained
their firm tone yesterday as program buying and short-covering spurred
equities to record levels, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.26 at 3,276.83, an
all-time peak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 3.37 to 417.13, while the
Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks surged ahead 11.55 to 644.92, a
new record. New York SE turnover rose to 237.6m shares from Tuesday's 200m.
Doubts about the direction of US monetary policy (recent statements from
within the Federal Reserve have dampened hopes of an interest rate cut), and
the lack of fresh economic news, have recently left the market without
direction. Repeated weakness in bond prices, prompted by the pressure of
Dollars 36bn in fresh supply this week, had also cast a cloud over stocks.
Yet, yesterday some more good corporate earnings news and technical buying
kept the market on course to set new records.
News Corp climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 on the news that the media
group expects to report improved fourth-quarter results, and that operating
profits in its fiscal first half rose 38 per cent.
CBS put on Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 144 7/8 after the broadcasting group
revealed a fourth-quarter profit of 61 cents a share, compared to the
Dollars 6.81 a share loss incurred a year earlier. CBS also said it expected
to return to profit for 1992, and envisaged no further writedowns on its
sports programming.
Loews jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 109 5/8 in the wake of a sharp
increase in fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 4.04 a share, up from Dollars
1.66 a year ago.
Chrysler dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 15 in turnover of 3m shares on news
of a ratings downgrade from PaineWebber and reports that the car
manufacturer might boost its preferred stock offering from Dollars 400m to
Dollars 1bn.
Insurers were in the limelight following full-year results announcements.
Travelers improved Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 23 on reporting a Dollars 380m
after-tax profit for 1991, against a big loss in 1990 after large property
tax write-offs. Aetna climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 46 1/4 in the wake of
full-year net profits of Dollars 505m, down from Dollars 614m a year
earlier.
Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling operations of the soft drinks giant,
lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 1/2 after the company unveiled a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 125m.
Car accessories retailer AutoZone fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 3/8 after
its chairman and partnerships led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the buy-out
specialists, said they would sell a total of 4.75m shares in a secondary
stock offering.
Over-the-counter stock Egghead forged ahead Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 23 1/4
, a 52-week high, after the personal computer software retailer revealed
fiscal third-quarter net income of 36 cents a share, well up on market
estimates. Applied Materials advanced Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 45 1/2 in the
wake of fiscal first-quarter net income of 37 cents a share.

MODERATE losses in financial services issues countered gains in the
communications and media and the gold sectors, leaving Toronto mixed
overall.
The heavily weighted banking sector began to slide around mid-morning.
Standard &amp; Poor's said it might downgrade Toronto-Dominion Bank's long-term
debt because of its asset quality, which led to selling across the sector.
The composite index ended 2.0 off at 3,595.8, but rises narrowly led
declines by 318 to 306 after volume of 33.3m shares.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar climbs on rumour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR climbed to its highest this week against the D-Mark, boosted by
rumours of unrest in the former Soviet Union and defensive comments from
Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The US currency finished near the week's high in London at DM1.6070, up from
DM1.5905. In New York it ended at DM1.6073.
Mr Greenspan's comments late the previous night that he would oppose a
devaluation policy left the US unit stronger at the London opening. Then
came Mr Eduard Shevardnadze's warnings of a coup in Russia, and talk of
Libya preparing for a punitive western military strike, and the dollar shot
through the DM1.60 level.
Traders dismissed the importance of the rumours of Soviet unrest, however.
'People wanted to be in the mood to buy dollars,' commented Mr Michael
Feeny, senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank. It was not the first time Mr
Shevardnadze had spoken of unrest.
'The market was ready to listen, even though it was old news,' Mr Feeny
added. He said it was also unlikely that the Fed would cut rates in the near
term.
Many felt that the US dollar would consolidate overnight as the speculators
take their money and run. This week's rise has largely been based on
technical factors and rumour.
However, the dollar will today get its first solid piece of data since
Friday's disastrous jobs figures. US retail sales for January are expected
to be flat.
The US unit had a harder time pushing through the psychologically important
Y127.50 barrier - the level at which the Fed and the Bank of Japan had
intervened last month - to finish in London at Y127.55, compared with
Y126.85 on Tuesday. It slipped in New York to close at Y127.40.
The market still feared intervention around the Y128.50 level. Comments from
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese finance minister, that it was not yet time for
a weak yen reinforced those fears.
Sterling continued to trade within a narrow band against the D-Mark,
strengthening from DM2.8650 to DM2.8750.
The D-Mark was weaker against most currencies in the European exchange rate
mechanism, as a result of the rumours of Soviet unrest and also dollar
strength.
The lira improved from 752.43/53 per D-Mark to 751.75/85. Traders suggested
that investors were keen on the extra yield available in the lira over the
D-Mark.
The peseta climbed from 62.99/63.02 per D-Mark to 62.95/97. The Spanish
currency's strength ensured that sterling remained a mere 10 basis points
above the ERM grid for most of the day.
Sterling's weakness in the ERM would appear to be the main obstacle to a
rate cut in the UK.
There was continuing speculation that the Bank of Spain could ease monetary
policy after it announces inflation figures today.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES firmed at the short end of the UK money market, as the central bank
dealings indicated no immediate change in interest rates.
One week money rose to 10- 9/16 per cent. Further out, however, the market
was still tentatively hoping for an interest rate cut, with the key three
months interbank rate at 10 7/16 - 3/8 per cent. Overnight rates traded at
11 1/4 per cent for most of the day, but closed at 10 7/8 - 5/8 per cent.
The March short sterling contract ended one basis point down at 89.80. At
that level, the contract still implied a cut in rates by the middle of
March.
Market rates were pushed up by the Bank of England's measured approach to
easing the forecast Pounds 1.35bn shortage.
By noon, the Bank had resolved about half of the shortfall, purchasing bills
worth Pounds 780m. They included band one bank and treasury, and band two
bank paper at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank also offered two repurchase deals at
10 7/16 per cent, which fell due on March 3 and 4.
In the afternoon, a further Pounds 115m was injected through band one and
two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds 440m left the
market only Pounds 55m short.
Traders said it was significant that the bank had not operated in band three
or four paper, which tends to be slightly cheaper. 'It is as if the Bank is
saying: Steady as she goes, 10 1/2 is here to stay for a while,' said a
senior trader.
Most of the overall shortage - Pounds 922m  - was due to repurchase
agreements falling due. Treasury paper and maturing assistance accounted for
Pounds 283m, while exchequer transactions added Pounds 205m back into the
market. Bankers' balances below target and a rise in note circulation took
out Pounds 245m.
Tomorrow is expected to be another expensive day in the money markets, said
one senior trader.
A generous DM2.4bn securities repurchase agreement from the Bundesbank
helped to ease call money in Germany from 9.55/65 per cent to 9.50/60 per
cent.
In the US, the Federal Reserve exercised a matched sale-purchase agreement
while rates were trading at 3 7/8 per cent. The presumed Fed target is 4 per
cent, and yesterday's action signalled no change in monetary policy. Market
sentiment is turning from an expectation of a reduction in the funds rate to
a more measured wait-and-see approach, said many dealers.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US price boost for Canadian
lumber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in North American lumber prices to near-record levels is bringing
some welcome relief to Canada's hard-pressed forestry industry but signals
an unusual degree of uncertainty about future timber supplies.
MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry group, reported last week
that lumber was the only one of its major products for which prices had
advanced in the past year.
Despite the continuing lull in the US and Canadian economies, Madison's
Canadian Lumber Reporter this week quotes the price on 2 x 4 inch planks
from the west coast at USDollars 240 per 1,000 board feet, up from Dollars
201 a month ago and Dollars 156 at this time last year. The jump, which has
been mirrored on futures markets in Chicago, has brought prices within a few
dollars of record levels.
The increase has occurred despite demand for timber remaining subdued. Mr
Roy Carroll, president of Angus Forest Products, a Toronto-based wholesaler,
says that 'there's quite a lot of anticipation, but so far we haven't seen
it take hold'.
This 'anticipation' reflects low interest rates and President Bush's
proposal of a Dollars 5,000 tax credit for first-time home-buyers. Housing
starts, which were running at an annual rate of 1.1m last December, are
expected to climb to at least 1.2m this year.
Mr Tom Martin, a Chicago lumber analyst, says many timber dealers are
covering their entire expected commitments for the spring construction
season in the cash market to protect themselves against possible price
increases in May or June.
Prices of the 2 x 10 inch planks used mainly in housing have risen even
faster than the
2 x 4 inch. According to Madison's, they are changing hands at about Dollars
294 per 1,000 board feet, up from Dollars 170 a year ago.
But most of the impetus for the price jump has come from supply
uncertainties. Late in 1991 the US Forest Service virtually stopped sales of
timber from government-owned forests in Oregon and Washington in response to
environmental pressures to protect the northern spotted owl and other
wildlife. More than 5 per cent of total US timber production is expected to
be withdrawn between the second half of 1992 and the end of 1993.
The future pricing of Canadian lumber has been thrown into doubt by a heated
trade dispute stemming from Ottawa's removal last October of a 15 per cent
export tax on shipments to the US. The tax was imposed in 1986 to forestall
a US countervailing duty against low stumpage (tree-cutting) fees charged in
provincially-owned forests.
Some provinces have subsequently raised these fees. But US lumber producers
are now also complaining that British Columbia's curbs on unprocessed log
exports amounts to a subsidy. By not allowing them to bid for the logs, the
US industry contends that the restrictions keep prices low for Canadian
sawmills.
The US International Trade Commission issued a preliminary ruling in
December that the low stumpage charges were still injuring US lumber
producers. The Commerce Department is due to issue a final ruling on March
5, which could be followed by a countervailing duty of as much as 20 per
cent.
Mr Martin estimates that fears of a countervailing duty have added Dollars
10 to Dollars 15 per 1,000 board feet to current lumber prices. Sawmills in
British Columbia warned customers last week that they will be expected to
absorb any new duties.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian jute producer breaks
ranks

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDIAN jute mill operator has broken ranks with the rest of the industry
to end a work stoppage; and others are set to follow its lead.
Abandoning the long-established tradition of letting the Indian Jute Mills
Association negotiate wage agreements on behalf of the industry, Delta Jute
and Industries has signed an interim agreement with the trade unions for the
reopening of its mill, which produces mainly high value jute items for
export.
In its eagerness to resume production, Delta has conceded the wage demands
of trade unions. As long as the rest of the industry remains strike-bound,
the company will have no problem in paying the higher wages as the prices of
jute goods have rocketed following the suspension of production by 54 mills
in West Bengal 16 days ago.
Disturbed by Delta's move, however, Mr Bharat Jalan, chairman of IJMA, has
announced that the remaining 27 member mills are now free to conduct
negotiation with the unions and arrive at settlements. Emboldened by the
Delta initiative, seven other units have already made settlement offers.
The consensus in the industry is that Delta will find the interim settlement
a big burden whenever the strike in the industry ends. In the traditional
jute mill industry, according to Mr Jalan, wages constitute as much as 40
per cent of the total cost of production of jute goods. If the economic
demands of the unions were conceded wages would have a share of 55 per cent
of production total costs, striking at the industry's viability.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Accountancy Column: Watchdog passes first test but more to
come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the new watchdog of accounting
standards, is taking stock after three weeks of publicly rapping corporate
knuckles.
After months of backroom work away from public attention, the panel leapt
into the spotlight at the end of January. In the space of a few days, it
announced settlements reached with four companies whose accounting practices
it had questioned.
Now it anticipates issuing no new reprimands for several weeks. Its caseload
has temporarily subsided, and it must, in any case, turn its attention to
the task of selecting a new chairman. Mr Simon Tuckey, QC, the present
incumbent, has just been appointed a judge and will not be able to continue
his work with the panel.
'I'm quite pleased with how things have gone,' says Mr Tuckey, weighing his
thoughts carefully before speaking. 'We have set out to make our presence
known and we have dealt with a number of cases satisfactorily. I have the
impression that we have succeeded in making it clear we mean business.'
The panel was established in February last year as one of three arms of the
new Financial Reporting Council. While the other two bodies, the Accounting
Standards Board and the Urgent Issues Task Force, set new accounting
standards and guidelines, the panel polices the existing ones.
Until now that has primarily meant scrutinising deviations from the
Statements of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAPs) drawn up by the
Accounting Standards Board's predecessor, the Accounting Standards
Committee.
In the case of Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate and one of the
first two companies to draw the panel's attention, there was a contravention
of SSAP 3, on earnings per share, over its treatment of disposals and
reorganisation costs. For Ultramar, the oil and gas group since taken over
by Lasmo, it was SSAP 8 and the interpretation of advance corporation tax.
Shield Group, a property developer and estate agent, transgressed SSAP 6,
concerning prior year adjustments on the value of its properties.
Finally, Forte, the hotels group, was scrutinised for its refusal to
depreciate freehold and long-leasehold property. The panel decided that the
company had not, in fact, broken SSAP 12, the depreciation standard, but
Forte nevertheless agreed to provide more detailed information on its
policies in future accounts.
The companies themselves argue that their divergence from the standard was
justified, giving a truer view of the accounts in light of the businesses
concerned - and did not always boost earnings.
Mr Tuckey replies: 'Our approach is that if you depart from the standard you
need to justify it. If you think some other treatment is preferred you
should state it in a note but use the official figure in the accounts. It's
a matter of emphasis.'
More seriously, some critics suggest that the four chosen were easy targets,
or that the punishment they received was too light. Others question the
disappointing total number of settlements which have been reached so far.
There was an inevitable delay last year as the panel found its footing,
identified cases to examine, and conducted its investigations. Nevertheless,
its remit was to examine company accounts with financial years beginning in
December 1989, all but a handful of which should now have been received. It
seems surprising that it has only so far made four public pronouncements.
The criticism leaves Mr Tuckey undeterred. 'We have dealt with every case
that has come our way,' he says. 'The volume is rather larger than we had
anticipated.'
He stresses that the panel has written to a further 240 companies that have
failed to comply with a statutory requirement introduced by the 1989
Companies Act. They have not broken accounting standards, but have simply
neglected to include a note stating that their accounts were prepared in
accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The action may have helped to raise the profile of the panel, but it is a
technicality which has probably done little directly to raise the standard
of financial reporting.
In addition, the panel has held discussions with a small number of other
companies over the last year, but decided they have no case to answer. In
these cases, the policy is to make no public announcement. But the number of
companies in this category is believed to be less than 10.
Partly the panel is restricted by its remit: it does not have the resources
to probe accounts at random, and is reliant on referrals. Some have come
from the Department of Trade and Industry and other government bodies; and
others from individuals, including Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great
Grimsby.
Three of the four companies criticised had qualified auditors' reports to
highlight their divergence from accounting standards. The fourth drew
attention to its unusual treatment on the profit and loss account - rather
than hiding it in an obscure note - and stated the alternative figure.
The reactive nature of the panel helps explain why those chosen appear to be
relatively soft targets: they were easy for outsiders to spot. If there is a
demand for greater and more aggressive policing of sloppy accounting, the
panel's powers or the mechanisms feeding it information will need to be
strengthened.
One thing as unclear to the members of the panel as to outsider observers is
what effect it is having on financial reporting. The ultimate sanction is
that the directors are forced in court to re-state their company's accounts
at their own expense. That remains to be tested. Its main weapon is negative
publicity.
So far that has had some clear effect: Williams Holdings' share price
dropped 20p after the announcement and closed down 11p on the day. 'I heaved
a sigh of relief when the Williams share price dropped,' said one member of
the panel. 'All our work would be as nothing if the market ignored it.'
The danger is that media interest in the panel's edicts will wane as the
novelty wears off, as they become more commonplace, or the issues being
criticised appear too esoteric.
'For those of us who are out with our clients, it is obviously a talking
point at the moment,' says Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte. 'There is a realisation that they may have to justify
their accounts.'
'I think the existence of the panel could have a salutary effect on a number
of companies. But my sense is that most are pretty supportive. The majority
are irritated by the few getting away with things,' he adds.
Another partner in a leading accountancy firm says: 'Auditors can now take a
tougher line by using the panel as a threat. To say an auditor was impotent
in the past would not be true. But in a very competitive marketplace, it was
quite hard to stand up for what you believed in. You yielded till any
deviation from the standards was flagrant.'
One other significant imponderable remains. So far the panel has reached
amicable settlements with the companies it has investigated. But the
ultimate appeal is to the courts, which might be called for the first time
to test the Companies Act requirement that accounts present a 'true and
fair' view.
'That is uncharted territory,' says Mr Tuckey. 'But we have made it clear
we're prepared to go all the way if we have to. Directors will have to take
that into account.'

FT  13 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries remain weak after auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury's quarterly refunding programme remained the dominant influence
on US bond market sentiment yesterday, with bond prices continuing weak
across the board after the afternoon auction of 10-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  11/32 at
102 3/32 , yielding 7.811 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down
1/8 at 99 5/32 , yielding 5.060 per cent.
There was little buying and selling during the morning, and the main
objective among market participants was to establish secure positions in
advance of the 10-year auction.
Demand for the new securities had been expected to be relatively light, and
the auction subsequently went much as expected. The unusual steepness of the
yield curve, however, was believed to have lured more investors to the
10-year issue than Tuesday's three-year issue.
The final leg of the refunding is later today, when the Treasury sells
Dollars 10bn of 30-year bonds.
THE PRICES of longer-dated UK gilts edged higher yesterday on continuing
signs of economic weakness, although prices slid marginally at the short end
on weaker hopes of an early cut in interest rates.
The latest quarterly bulletin from the Bank of England, published yesterday,
gave little evidence of economic recovery, although the Bank said that it
still expected recovery this year. Analysts also expect to find little sign
of recovery in employment data due today or inflation data on Friday.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent bond due 2003/07 firmed from 111 7/32 to 111
15/32 during the day. In a light day on Liffe, with only 16,000 contracts
traded, the long gilts future rose from its opening of 97.27 to close near
the high of the day at 98.00.
In contrast, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 fell by  1/32 of a point to 101
3/16 .
PRICES of German government bonds remained firm, with 34,000 of the March
10-year bund contract traded.
Expectations that 10-year bund issues would remain scarce helped to keep
prices firm, analysts said. Shorter-dated government bonds, by contrast,
weakened.
JAPANESE government bond yields rose yesterday on fears for the yen. Reports
that the US Federal Reserve does not want to see any further depreciation in
the dollar led to concern that intervention would hit the yen, helping to
push Japanese government bonds down from their Monday close. (Tuesday was a
holiday.) The yield on the benchmark no 129 bond rose from Monday's close of
5.445 per cent to 5.5 per cent during the day.

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: US insurers warn on weak state
of economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of the largest US composite insurers yesterday renewed warnings about
the depressed state of the domestic property market and the impact of this
on the sector, although both pointed to the benefits of earlier cost-cutting
measures on underlying operations.
Travelers, the Hartford-based multi-line insurer, unveiled an after-tax
profit of Dollars 317.8m for the year, against its loss of Dollars 178.4m in
the previous 12 months. The improvement stemmed from a turnround on the
realised investment gain/loss front.
In 1990, Travelers made a Dollars 650m pre-tax addition to reserves to cover
bad debts on real estate investments and mortgage loans, causing it to
register a net realised investment loss of Dollars 566m. Last year, there
was a net realised investment gain of Dollars 1m, plus a further Dollars
10.4m tax credit - although the company did add a further Dollars 103m
pre-tax to reserves due to the real estate situation, of which Dollars 56m
fell in the final quarter.
Commenting on the figures, Travelers warned 'weakness in the economy
continues to delay any meaningful improvement in the real estate markets',
but it claimed to have established 'substantial reserves in anticipation of
the environment we foresee'.
At Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, net profits fell from Dollars 614m in 1990 to
Dollars 505m last year. Again, the difference is largely explained by
investment gains/losses and the depressed state of the property market. Its
shares rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 3/4 .
Aetna's 1991 figures are scored after net realised capital losses of Dollars
186m - which included a Dollars 357m after-tax addition to reserves for
potential mortgage loan and real estate write-downs. In 1990, net realised
capital losses were Dollars 82m, with a Dollars 163m addition to reserves
for property-related investments.

CAMPBELL SOUP, the US food group, announced a 19 per cent rise in after-tax
earnings to Dollars 160.6m for the three months to January 26, following
profit improvements in its core North American operations.
In the same period a year earlier, the second quarter of Campbell's
financial year, the company made a net Dollars 135.3m.
Campbell's total sales declined by 1 per cent, to Dollars 1.75bn, while
earnings per share increased in line with net profits, to 64 cents.
The company said operating profits from North America were up by 18 per cent
to Dollars 261.1m, with sales from continuing businesses rising by 3 per
cent. Soup volumes improved by 6 per cent, helped partly by the acquisition
of a noodle manufacturer and some new lines.
In the biscuit and bakery division, operating profits declined by 5 per cent
to Dollars 24.9m, while marketing expenditure increased in a fiercely
competitive sector.
At Campbell International, profits were flat at Dollars 14.2m, although
operating margins improved.
Campbell operating profits in the second quarter were 15 per cent higher at
Dollars 300.2m.

manufacturer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIDDINGS &amp; LEWIS, the largest US machine tool maker, yesterday reported its
highest sales and earnings since it went public in 1989, due to continued
strong demand for its industrial automation systems.
G &amp; L, which took over its struggling rival Cross &amp; Trecker late last year,
raised operating net earnings from Dollars 18.4m, or Dollars 1.73 a share,
in 1990 to Dollars 21.3m, or Dollars 1.84, last year. The figures include
Cross &amp; Trecker from October 31, but exclude tax credits of 6 cents and 12
cents a share in 1991 and 1990 respectively.
Fourth-quarter operating net earnings rose from Dollars 4.75m to Dollars
6.3m, but earnings per share fell from 45 to 43 cents on increased shares
outstanding. Revenues jumped from Dollars 66m to Dollars 131.1m for the
quarter, and from Dollars 243m to Dollars 326.6m for the year.
The company reported record bookings of Dollars 203.7m in the fourth
quarter, up from Dollars 70.9m a year earlier. Mr William Fife, chairman and
chief executive, said quotations for new equipment had picked up well since
the acquisition.
The deal turned Giddings &amp; Lewis into the world's fourth biggest machine
tool producer, and was aimed partly at expanding the company's presence in
continental Europe, where C &amp; T was stronger.

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Continental Air creditors file
suit against Lorenzo

<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier and one in
bankruptcy since late 1990, have filed a suit against Mr Frank Lorenzo, the
airline's former chairman and chief executive. The suit, brought by the
official creditors' committee, claims Dollars 180m in damages.
Mr Lorenzo, known as a pugnacious union-buster and wily deal-maker, quit as
Continental's boss in August 1990, although he remained a director of the
airline.
At that stage, he also sold the privately owned Jet Capital company - in
which he and other Jet Capital directors had an 80 per cent stake - to
Scandinavian Airlines System. Jet Capital, in turn, held a big stake in
Continental, and SAS ended up with 18.4 per cent of Continental's voting
rights.
However, before the end of 1990, Continental had sought protection under
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code - a situation which still exists,
although the airline has now filed a reorganisation scheme with the courts.
Under this proposed plan, ordinary shareholders in the airline would get
nothing - rendering SAS's equity stake worthless.
The creditors' lawsuit alleges that Mr Lorenzo, Jet Capital and Mr Robert
Snedeker, another Continental director, received Dollars 41.6m as a result
of the series of transactions with SAS in August 1990. It suggests that the
payments were made when Continental was already insolvent, breaching Mr
Lorenzo's and Mr Snedeker's duties as directors of the company. It also
argues that Mr Lorenzo and Mr Snedeker benefited from a preferential
transfer which preceded the SAS deal.
The creditors' committee stressed that SAS was not a defendant in the suit.
Lawyers said the suit alleged a mixture of fraudulent conveyance, breaches
of fiduciary duty and preferential transfer.
Mr Lorenzo last night was unavailable for comment.

<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the large US retail and financial services company, has
announced a reorganisation of its retail group's field management structure.
The move will eliminate 600 jobs and bring cost savings of about Dollars 50m
by next year.
Sears said it would close 10 regional offices and 26 of its 72 district
merchandising units by mid-April. Responsibilities at the remaining
districts will be broadened.
The move comes just over a month after the company said it would cut 7,000
retail jobs to save it Dollars 50m this year.
In addition to reducing the workforce, Sears said yesterday it would lower
its compensation rates for sales personnel who sold on commission. This
would bring them more in line with the competition and change the company's
policies on such costly matters as overtime.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said that while cost-saving programmes to date
had improved the bottom line by reducing the ratio of selling, general and
administrative expenses to revenues, 'we need to do much more to be
successful in this highly competitive environment'.
Sears said it was studying its retail headquarters staff and field staff
offices to see how to reorganise their structures.

TRW, the US automotive, space and information services group, yesterday
unveiled a loss of Dollars 140m for 1991 after taking a final quarter
restructuring charge of Dollars 256m, which the management had warned about
in December.
Excluding the charge, which was taken to help fund an overhaul of TRW's
businesses - including a 10,000 workforce reduction, big cuts in capital
spending, and up to Dollars 500m of asset sales - the group made a net
profit of Dollars 25m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 116m in the year,
both well down on earnings at the same stage of 1990.
The picture throughout TRW's divisions was the same: sales were higher in
the fourth quarter than a year ago, but full-year sales were flat or lower
than in 1990. Overall, group sales were up 3 per cent in the quarter at
Dollars 2.1bn, but down 3 per cent over the full year at Dollars 7.9bn.
The figures were well received on Wall Street yesterday, with TRW shares
rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 3/4 .

<TEXT>
CBS, the US media group, yesterday posted a net loss of Dollars 85.8m, or
Dollars 5.32 a share, reflecting an after-tax loss of Dollars 195.5m, or
Dollars 12.06, from its baseball and football television coverage.
In 1990, CBS had net earnings of Dollars 110.8m, or Dollars 4.30 a share,
including an after-tax loss of Dollars 171.2m, or Dollars 6.65, on its
sports contracts. Sales in the year fell 7 per cent to Dollars 3.04bn from
Dollars 3.26bn.
Earnings in 1991 were further depressed by what Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman
and chief executive, called a 'stubborn' recession, expanding cable
competition and rising programming costs.
For the fourth quarter, the company had net income of Dollars 9.4m, or 61
cents a share, on sales of Dollars 937.4m, against a loss of Dollars 156m,
or Dollars 6.06, on sales of Dollars 919.7m.
The company had fourth-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 9.4m against an
operating loss of Dollars 175.3m a year earlier. For the full year, CBS's
loss from continuing operations was Dollars 98.7m against profits of Dollars
91.5m.
CBS, which paid Dollars 1.06bn for its four year baseball contracts has had
pre-tax losses of Dollars 604m for its sports coverage. CBS said these
contracts have been reduced to net realisation value and no further
write-offs are expected.
Mr David Londoner, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said the results roughly
met his expectations. 'I'm happy the third-quarter charge is done with. CBS
has good ratings now and 1992 is starting to look better.' Mr Londoner
expects CBS to earn Dollars 9-a-share in 1992.
Mr Tisch said he expected the company to return to profitability in 1992 in
spite of reduced advertiser demand for broadcast commercial time in the
first quarter of 1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU and NEC, two of Japan's leading computer companies, yesterday warned
that profits in the year to end-March would fall sharply as a result of
weakness in the markets for computers and computer components, including
semi-conductor chips.
Fujitsu said yesterday that parent company pre-tax profits were expected to
plunge by 60 per cent to Y50bn (Dollars 394.9m), while consolidated pre-tax
profits could be down by as much as 80 per cent to Y30bn.
NEC's parent company pre-tax earnings are likely to be off by 30 per cent to
Y100m, while consolidated results could be down by 45 per cent to Y170bn,
the company said.
The cuts in profits are a reminder that Japanese companies are not immune to
the worldwide slump in the computer industry. IBM, the world's biggest
computer company, is expected to report the first loss in the company's
history in 1991.
Both companies had earlier warned that profits would be down in the current
fiscal year, but have had to revise estimates further in the light of
unexpectedly weak markets.
The two companies have been hit hard by the plunge in prices of 4 Megabit
dynamic random access memory chips, the latest generation of high-capacity
computer memory chips. The experience has underscored the huge risks that
Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have assumed in their race to stay at
the cutting edge of technology in memory devices.
Both companies have already moved to cut capital spending, although they
said yesterday they were still considering plans for the next fiscal year.
Fujitsu said that ICL, the British computer company which it acquired about
a year ago, would not be affected by any spending cuts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO IBERCORP, a Spanish financial services group, is negotiating with
potential buyers for its banking offshoot and for its broking business.
The group is seeking to sell some 30 per cent of its bank, Banco Ibercorp,
to Banque D'Arjil, a French banking business. It hopes to merge its broking
arm with a fellow member of the Madrid Stock Exchange.
The search for partners or possible new owners for both enterprises
illustrates the extent of the squeeze on margins facing smaller financial
institutions in Spain.
Ibercorp's broking arm has been hit by the end to fixed broking commissions
on the Madrid Stock Exchange. With most of the broking business now in the
hands of the big Spanish banks, the operating margins of independent brokers
have weakened significantly.
Yesterday's developments came amid an allegation by the Madrid newspaper, El
Mundo, of possible fraud by Ibercorp's co-chairman, Mr Manuel de la Concha,
a former head of the Madrid Stock Exchange.
Mr de la Concha last night denied the allegations and said he was taking
legal action against El Mundo.
According to El Mundo, Mr de la Concha falsified the names of a list of
shareholders in 1990, which was subsequently submitted to the stock market
regulatory commission following its enquiries into the purchase of Ibercorp
shares.
Mr de la Concha said buyers of the shares were identified to the commission
at the time. Yesterday the Bank of Spain had no comment on the report.
Created in the early 1980s, the Ibercorp group was one of the first
operations to be set up in Spain independently of the big banks to
concentrate on asset management.
Known popularly as the 'beautiful people's bank', it was backed by high net
worth individuals and top socialites, some of whom were closely connected to
senior members of the governing socialist party.

<TEXT>
METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German mining and industrial group, plans shortly to
float off 20 per cent of the shares in Buderus, one of the companies it
bought from Feldmuhle Nobel. It is considering two other such stock market
moves this year.
Analysts estimate the three deals could raise around DM500m (Dollars 312m).
Metallgesell-schaft has said it intends to float a minority of the shares in
Lurgi-Umwelt, its environmental engineering unit. Also under consideration
is the flotation of a minority in Dynamit Nobel, also bought from Feldmuhle.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, said Buderus,
whose activities include building materials, heating and kitchen equipment,
and stainless steel goods, made record profits in 1991.
As well as Dynamit Nobel (explosives and plastics), the DM1.45bn purchase
from Feldmuhle included Cerasiv (industrial ceramics).
Part of Buderus's investment plans involve a plant in Gera, east Germany, to
help meet demand for heating equipment. Mr Schimmelbusch did not say how
much the capital increase would raise. Metallgesellschaft will retain 80 per
cent of the shares.
The group has followed a policy of floating off minority stakes in important
industrial and mining activities.
One quoted subsidiary is Kolbenschmidt, the motor components maker whose
profits slumped last year. Mr Schimmelbusch said some of Kolbenschmidt's
piston production would be transferred from Germany to lower-cost France and
Brazil to improve profitability.
Kolbenschmidt's poor performance was one reason for the group's sharp drop
in profits last year; others were low non-ferrous metals prices and start-up
costs of new smelters.

20,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the automotive unit of industrial group Daimler-Benz AG, is
considering cutting up to 20,000 jobs by 1995 as part of a radical
cost-cutting plan, industry sources said.
Sources said the management board had not yet decided how and when cuts of
this magnitude should occur, but a drastic reduction of Mercedes' worldwide
workforce of 238,000 people was necessary to achieve targetted savings of
DM4bn (Dollars 2.5bn) annually by 1995. Reuter reports.
Mercedes said last week a slowing down of car sales in Germany, coupled with
weak sales in other European markets and the recession in the US, could lead
to lay-offs.
The company would only confirm it was 'considering a reduction in the
workforce of several thousand.'
A cut of 20,000 jobs would mainly affect production workers in Germany as
the company strives to make its production process leaner, the sources said.
In addition to the 20,000 job cuts, another 3,000 jobs will be lost by 1995
from the administrative HQ of Mercedes and the Daimler holding in the
Stuttgart area.
A reduction in the administrative staff was announced by the Daimler
management board last year.
Last week, BMW announced it would axe 3,000 jobs by the end of this year to
increase productivity in light of sharper competition coupled with a
contraction of the German market.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PUMA, the German sports shoe and equipment company owned by Aritmos of
Sweden, has finally broken into profit. Its return to the black for 1991
follows several difficult years of stiff competition in the US market and
production hold-ups in Asia.
The company made a group profit of around DM11m (Dollars 7m) before tax and
restructuring costs. Mr Stefan Jacobsson, chief executive, said the move out
of 1990's loss of DM9.4m made it clear the group was now on an upward trend.
Puma had already foreshadowed a return to profit, despite having hopes of an
end to its Far Eastern losses dashed by regional troubles in 1991. These
stemmed from the organisational difficulties of shifting production to
low-cost Indonesia, and a fire in the Philippines factory.
Formerly owned by members of the Dassler family, Puma slipped into loss in
1986, the year its preference shares were sold to the public.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wimpey continues disposal programme with
Pounds 45m sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE WIMPEY, the construction group which last year embarked on a disposal
programme to reduce debts, yesterday announced that it had raised a further
Pounds 45m from the sale of St Alphage House, a central London office block.
Since the summer the group has raised Pounds 300m from property sales and
the disposal of its waste management and offshore engineering businesses.
Wimpey yesterday declined to name the purchaser of the 20-storey St Alphage
House which it acquired in 1978. The profit on the sale, given the length of
time the building has been on the group's books, is thought to have been in
excess of Pounds 20m.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said that the sale would 'further strengthen
the group's balance sheet and investment capability'.
At the end of June Wimpey had net debt of Pounds 372m - equivalent to almost
60 per cent of shareholders' funds. Debts were expected to have been reduced
to less than Pounds 300m by the end of last year following the Pounds 105m
sale of Wimpey's waste management business to a joint venture between Wessex
Water and Waste Management of the US.
In the autumn the group also sold - for Pounds 110m  - its 50 per cent stake
in Little Britain, another central London office development.
The cash from the sale of Little Britain will not become available until the
second half of this year. Other disposals include Wimpey's Coppergate
development in York for about Pounds 20m and the sale for less than Pounds
10m of the group's offshore engineering business.
Last night brokers said the St Alphage sale might help underpin the final
dividend when Wimpey announces its annual results next month which are
expected to show a loss. The dividend is thought to have been under pressure
since the slump in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.6m to just
Pounds 200,000.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE and Wireless has asked the US authorities for permission to run its
own integrated international telecommunications network from the US to the
UK and Hong Kong.
The UK-based telecommunications group wants to link Cable and Wireless
Communications, its US subsidiary, with Mercury Communications and Hong Kong
Telecom, its British and Hong Kong subsidiaries.
Its application, filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in
December but not revealed by the company, has already run into opposition
from competitors.
Sprint, the long-distance US carrier, has argued that the licence should not
be granted unless its own application last month to provide services from
the UK is approved.
The UK government looks inclined not to grant Sprint such a licence, raising
the prospect that the introduction of competition across the Atlantic could
become caught up in a trade dispute.
Syncordia, a subsidiary of BT, Mercury's dominant UK rival, has told the FCC
that approval of C and W's application should depend on whether other
companies are allowed to compete with Hong Kong Telecom, which holds a
monopoly on international services in the colony.
American Telephone and Telegraph and MCI, the two largest US long-distance
carriers, want tough conditions imposed to stop C and W distorting
competition in the US by using its privileged position in foreign markets.
The US-UK route looks set to be the main battleground as international
telecommunications opens up to competition. It is the busiest
intercontinental route, and some experts predict that call charges could
drop by two thirds to 30 cents (16p) a minute if there were full
competition.
C and W's application and the response by its competitors are the latest
moves in an elaborate game in which the largest telecommunications groups
try to turn themselves from national monopolies into globally competitive
groups. Until last month, C and W was negotiating to create a global
alliance with AT&amp;T.
Traditionally, telecommunications companies have owned international
facilities on a co-operative basis with the carrier at the other end. C and
W already provides international services out of the US as a 're-seller',
using the facilities owned by AT&amp;T and others.
Its application to run end-to-end networks has concerned competitors, who
fear C and W could gain an unfair advantage by being able to operate both
ends of a cable or satellite link.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Labour calls for probe into Lloyd's syndicates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party last night called for an independent investigation into
allegations that a group of Lloyd's syndicates run by market professionals
offloaded bad risks on to outside Names.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City affairs spokeswoman, said she had asked Mr
John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, to appoint an investigator after
receiving detailed documentation about the alleged malpractice.
She was among three Labour MPs who were sent details of the transactions.
It is thought the documents were passed on by Conservative MPs who suffered
heavy losses after becoming Names in the market in the mid-1980s. Names are
the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's and many play
no part in the day-to-day operation of the market.
The allegations centre on the way in which the market's syndicates reinsure
risks among themselves in a continually evolving spiral, known as the London
market excess or spiral business.
The documents allege that a group of syndicates run by professional agents
and Names made large amounts of money out of this business, but that others
 -whose members consisted mainly of non-professionals  - consistently faced
losses after being saddled with bad risks.
Full details of the allegations - and the syndicates involved  - are
expected to appear in the House of Commons order paper today after two
Labour MPs tabled a series of parliamentary motions last night echoing Ms
Mowlam's call for an investigation.
Earlier this week at a Westminster meeting, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of
Lloyd's, faced strident criticism from Conservative MPs who had suffered
heavy losses through the reinsurance business.
The completion of an independent report into the reinsurance spiral at
Lloyd's is expected in the next few days.
The report has been prepared by accountancy firm Rodney-Smith and Partners.
It was commissioned by action groups formed by Names who are members of
catastrophe reinsurance syndicates at Lloyd's managed by Gooda Walker and
Rose Thomson Young agencies.
The report was commissioned following a legal opinion by Mr Gavin Lightman
QC in October. Mr Lightman said the reinsurance contracts might be
'voidable' - contain flaws allowing Names to apply to have them set aside.
Names on the reinsurance syndicates suffered heavy losses as a result of a
string of catastrophe losses between 1988 and 1990.
They have been encouraged by the successful out-of-court settlement earlier
this week negotiated by Names on the controversial Outhwaite syndicate.

Burton may have an impressive line-up of non-executives these days, but its

Debenhams for yet another chief executive, the group is hoping to make
better use of talent within its only consistently successful retailing

that was equally the case a year or two ago. Until it finally happens,
Burton's shares will doubtless remain as unfashionable as some of its

The good news to emerge from the opening day of the Opec meeting is that the
gap between Saudi Arabia's demand assumptions and those of other Opec
members appears narrow by historical standards. But with so much at stake,
it will not be surprising if it takes longer than usual to close. Judging by
yesterday's nerves, the spot crude market still thinks Opec is going to find
it hard to secure price stability by the time demand starts to fall in the
second quarter. The haggling in Geneva is the more fraught when one
considers that production in Kuwait is continuing to creep upwards. The
market will want some reassurance that any agreed production ceiling takes
that into account. Otherwise, the oil price will continue to be driven by
short-term fears of over-supply.

FT  13 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Tarmac-Steetley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's decision by the Brussels competition authorities to refer the
Tarmac-Steetley joint venture back to London looks sensible enough. Bricks
and clay tiles, after all, do not easily cross the Channel, so markets
affected by the proposed deal will be exclusively regional ones. In
addition, it was always logical that Redland's bid for Steetley - which
raises similar competition issues, but is too small to come under EC merger
regulations - should be dealt with by the same jurisdiction.
It is doubtful, though, whether the market should look too hard for wider
implications. It would certainly be wrong to see yesterday's concession to
the UK as representing a change in Brussels' thinking. The Commission has
already turned down two requests from the German government to be allowed to
investigate largely domestic mergers, and will have made an exception
yesterday only because the arguments were unusually clear cut. Any erosion
of legal sovereignty sticks in the EC throat and will not be easily be
repeated.
Investors would also be unwise to assume that Sir Leon Brittan's apparently
strong talk about dominant positions in yesterday's statement was an overt
steer for the UK's Office of Fair Trading. An unconditional reference of
both deals to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission remains a possibility,
though the justification would be more political than commercial. Redland
will certainly hope that Mr Lilley, the UK trade secretary, is prepared to
accept undertakings which would remove the need for full scale
investigations of both ventures.

FT  13 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: News Corp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is perhaps sobering for News Corporation shareholders to speculate what
might have happened a year ago if something had gone wrong during the
company's delicate refinancing talks with the banks. The negotiations were
so delicately poised, that a single piece of bad news might have had lenders
making a hasty bee-line for the door.
Yesterday's 38 per cent rise in net profits for the six months to December
underlines just how far things have changed. Having got into a fix because
huge capital spending coincided with declining cash flows, the company's
financial position is gradually improving through cost cutting and asset
sales, such as the timely Pacific Magazines deal. The interest bill fell
Dollars 100m at the half way stage. News Corp's outstanding debt is still
vast, but the pressure to sell good assets in depressed markets is off.
Having recovered from their low of under ADollars 3 early last year the
shares were trading in London yesterday at ADollars 16.50. Their future
strength will depend on the speed of any recovery in the company's three
main territories, and by the prospects for BSkyB. Yesterday's confirmation
that the satellite TV station will be in the black next month is encouraging
news, and will no doubt be accompanied by a fanfare of publicity. That alone
is reason to hold on to the shares for a while longer.

FT  13 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A timely story from Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,523.7 (-13.4)
Reuters managed to announce its annual results several minutes before the
figures appeared on the official Stock Exchange news service - a neat way of
embarrassing the competition. The figures themselves highlighted the
company's continued resilience in the second half: Reuters has been coping
with recession better than most.
Granted, the earnings and the full-year dividend increases of 10 and 13 per
cent respectively were a far cry from the heady growth of a few years ago.
But Reuters' markets have scarcely been growing apace, and Pounds 24m of
rationalisation costs and Pounds 29m of accelerated depreciation were
absorbed easily enough. As in the previous year, it was an unexpectedly
strong rise in the cash position which made the difference. Reuters now has
more than Pounds 500m of net cash, which generated Pounds 50m of interest
and funded the dividend increase. The question of what to do with the money
is gradually becoming more pressing, although quarterly and half-year
billing for customers currently paying in advance will act as something of a
brake on further accumulation.
The strong performance of the shares since last July means they are on a
historic multiple of 20. That is somewhat at odds with Reuters' frank
admission that trading this year will continue to be tough, so the shares'
progress from here may be limited. Both the Dealing 2000 (phase two) and
Globex projects should at last go live this year, which will help counteract
the costs of yet more rationalisation. But the group will manage only small
price increases and is braced for fewer new orders. While Reuters will have
to pedal hard to make headway, yesterday's evidence suggests it will not be
going backwards.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Familiar theme launches Bush's re-election bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday officially launched his bid for re-election
and moved to counter his main rival from the Republican party.
Asking for four more years to complete the job he took over in 1989, he told
an invited audience of supporters in Washington: 'I came here to do
important work and I finish what I start.'
As he set about trying to restore his electoral fortunes, the president said
his message had not changed since he became vice-president in 1981.
'I believe government is too big and it costs too much, and I believe in a
strong defence for this country, good schools, safe streets, a government
really worthy of the people,' he said.
The president's candidacy has been no secret. He has already raised more
than Dollars 11m (Pounds 6.1m) in campaign funds, and his name is on primary
ballots in 26 states.
But yesterday's declaration was more than a formality. It reflected a change
of gear by Mr Bush, who just weeks ago had expected to cruise triumphantly
through next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
He is now seeking to restore his fortunes in the recession-battered
north-eastern state.
At the start of this year, Mr Bush's campaign managers ex-pected to leave
most of the New Hampshire campaigning to Mr Dan Quayle, vice-president, and
other members of the Bush cabinet.
Faced with the prospect of a large protest vote for the right-wing
commentator Mr Patrick Buchanan, this programme has been beefed up with
presidential visits yesterday and this weekend and radio and television
interviews.
Mr Bush criticised the isolationist views of Mr Buchanan who different polls
give between 22 per cent and 28 per cent of the vote. This is not enough for
the Bush campaign to be unsettled seriously.
Some Republicans are worried, however, by the appearance in some opinion
polls of Mr Jim Lennane, a Republican businessman who founded a computer
company in California.
They fear he could prove a more palatable alternative for voters who find Mr
Buchanan's hanging-and-flogging rhetoric too strident and so further erode
Mr Bush's vote.
Mr Buchanan is thought to be unlikely to do enough damage to Mr Bush to
force him to withdraw as Senator Eugene McCarthy did to President Lyndon
Johnson in 1968. However, Mr Bush's political strategists want to eliminate
Mr Buchanan from the primaries as soon as possible.
If the Buchanan campaign stays alive until June it could force Mr Bush to
adopt a more right-wing stance than he would like in California, the most
populous state and one of the last to hold a primary.
In turn, this could complicate the president's campaign strategy in the
November general election, when some politicians believe the Democrats could
win California for the first time since 1964.

FT  13 FEB 92 / MPs quiz Midland over 'supergun': Bank officials admit
weakness of their policy on arms exports to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR officials of Midland Bank yesterday admitted to MPs that the bank's
policy of not dealing with arms exports to Iraq could easily have been
'subverted by deception'.
They told the House of Commons trade and industry committee, however, that
the bank had no record of having been involved in financing the export of
components for the Iraqi 'supergun'.
The activities of Midland's secretive defence equipment finance department
were first disclosed in a Financial Times investigation last summer.
Mr Charles Bryant, managing director of international banking services at
Midland, said the bank had a policy in the 1980s of refusing to 'advise or
confirm letters of credit' if they related 'overtly' to arms exports to
Iraq. He conceded it might have been possible to get round this by
misdescribing the items to be exported and disguising their true nature.
Mr Menzies Campbell, a Liberal Democrat MP, said this made the policy 'not
worth the paper it was written on'.
Between 1985 and 1989, Midland arranged Pounds 871m in credit facilities for
exports to Iraq backed by Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department. Mr
Bryant denied that any of these had been used for arms exports other than
'soft' defence items such as communications equipment.
The officials said there were no records to support allegations made to the
committee that Midland financed the export to Iraq of components for the
'supergun' project: steel tubes from Sheffield Forgemasters, the UK steel
company, and propellants from the Belgian munitions company, PRB.
Mr Bryant admitted Midland was Sheffield Forgemasters' bank when the
contract was signed but said he could not explain why Midland was referred
to in papers connected with the contract.
The officials were also questioned about Mr Stephan Kock, a former
consultant to Midland's defence equipment finance department and
non-executive director of Astra Holdings, the UK defence group which
discovered in 1989 that PRB, its newly acquired subsidiary, was supplying
the 'supergun' propellants.
The committee has heard allegations that Mr Kock visited Baghdad in 1988 to
negotiate finance for the propellants.
Mr Tom Robson, former director of Midland's trade and export finance
department, said Mr Kock had never travelled abroad on Midland business. He
also said there was no record to support the allegation of Mr Gerald James,
former chairman of Astra, that Mr Kock had been brought on to the Astra
board on Midland's recommendation.
He admitted he was aware that Mr Kock had produced a gun during an incident
near his home in Scotland, and that during a subsequent trial Mr Kock's
solicitor said his client carried a gun because the nature of his work made
him concerned for his safety.
'Is it normal for consultants of Midland Bank to carry guns?' asked Mr Doug
Hoyle, a Labour MP. Mr Robson said: 'No.'

EDGE CITY. Life on the New Frontier By Joel Garreau Doubleday Dollars 22.50.
546 pages
One of the most dynamic urban centres in North America is a city with no
name, merely a number: 287/78. You will not find it on any map, nor does it
have a coherent civic government.
Yet it, and the dozens more like it mushrooming across the US and Canada,
may represent the biggest change in more than 100 years to how the western
world builds its cities. 287/78 lies about an hour west of Wall Street, in
the lightly wooded suburban sprawl of New Jersey. It takes what identity it
has from the two interstate highways - 287 and 78 - which cross at this
point.
These good transport links have encouraged some of America's biggest
companies to quit the dirt, high costs and sheer inconvenience of Manhattan
for grassy new 'campuses' hidden away amid the clapboard and shingle homes
and shopping strips.
The world headquarters of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph is here. So too are
offices of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Bristol-Myers and Hoechst Celanese. 287/78 may
not have a name, but it has more office space than downtown New Orleans. It
may not have any commercial flights into its little airport, but so many
corporate jets use it that it has its own customs shed.
But this, you may be thinking, is no city. It has no centre, no soul, no
shared history. It is merely a characterless, suburban excrescence, a
ghastly monument to the power of unfettered American development capital.
And that, says Joel Garreau, in his stimulating book, is where you would be
very wrong. To him, 287/78 is a prime example of an 'edge city', a
phenomenon which, like it or not, is 'the crucible of America's urban
future', and an example the rest of the world is starting to follow.
Edge cities are the mixed business, residential and shopping conurbations
which have sprung up on the edge of America's big 19th century cities.
Garreau reckons there are about 20 in the greater New York area alone. Other
examples include the area around Houston's Galleria shopping mall, and the
remarkable sprawl that is greater Los Angeles, probably the first edge city
of all.
Garreau, a journalist on the Washington Post newspaper, reckons that what we
normally think of as a city, with a defined centre, tall buildings standing
cheek-by-jowl, is a relic from the last century. What makes a city a city,
he argues, is not how it looks, but how it functions, and edge cities exist
because they provide an efficient answer to the needs of the computer, motor
car and jet age.
They are also a response to the age of the working woman, with employers
realising in the 1970s they could tap a huge pool of well-educated, female,
white-collar labour if they sited their offices out in the suburbs.
For the most part, edge cities are the product of commercial developers  -
'the Medicis of the 20th century', according to one Houston planner - who
have simply been responding to the iron laws of the marketplace. Garreau
says: 'Their unshakeable observation was this: if they gave the people what
they wanted, the people would give them money. The crazy quilt of edge city
made perfect sense if you understood the place as the manifest pattern of
millions of individual American desires over 75 years.'
Good architects and planners, however, have tended to stand aloof, regarding
the suburbs as 'sprawl gone wrong', and the people in them as 'so banal as
to be utterly remote from their experience and interests'.
Garreau defines an edge city as having at least 5m sq ft of office space -
more than exists in downtown Memphis, Tennessee  - which is apparently the
level needed to support a luxury hotel and set off further development. It
must have 600,000 sq ft of retail space, enough for a large shopping mall,
the edge city equivalent of the town square. It must also have more jobs
than bedrooms, be perceived by the population as one place, and have been
suburbs or cow pastures a mere 30 years ago.
'Making sense of an edge city,' he writes, 'requires the following leap of
faith: any place that is a trade, employment and entertainment centre of
vast magnitude is functionally a city. That is true no matter how sprawling
and strange it looks physically, and no matter how anarchic it seems
politically.'
Garreau is on more controversial ground when he argues that this new
phenomenon does not necessarily spell decay for America's old inner cities.
He points out that the rise of edge cities has coincided with, and possibly
provided the capital for, a striking revival in many of America's biggest
city centres, which may become mainly cultural and tourist resources. That,
however, is to brush aside the dire problems of the black urban underclass
living alongside many of these cultural jewels - although he does point out
that America's new black middle class is growing rapidly in edge city.
This is an important book, wittily and entertainingly written in somewhat
breathless journalistic prose. Its many pleasures include an amusing
glossary of developers' English. Plants and trees are 'softscape'. Potholes
are 'pavement deficiencies' and a beautiful building is 'one that is fully
leased'.
Garreau provides no clear answer to the central question of whether the edge
city can rise above its sterile origins. He admits to depression on the
subject during the four years in which he wrote this book.
Yet whenever he lost hope, there was always someone on hand with good
advice: 'Calm down, take deep breaths. These edge cities are only 10 to 20
years old. It took Venice 500 years to become what it is today. Our new edge
cities are works in progress. It's just beginning to dawn on us that they
are cities.' Quite so.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Why falling inflation is still good news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Towards the end of last year, I wrote that the UK economy bore the shape of
a 'drooping L'. The phase of steeply falling output had come to an end; but
production was still falling slightly. Since then, little has happened to
change the picture. This is illustrated by the chart of manufacturing
output.
It would be as foolish to be depressed by this February's gloomy Bank of
England Bulletin (which apparently was gloomier still before the Treasury
got to work on it) as it would have been to be reassured by the Bank's more
upbeat assessment in November; and I owe an apology to one or two small
businessmen to whom I sent the November Bulletin. But wouldn't it be just
too convenient if a similarly gloomy forecast from the Treasury (forecasters
tend to move in flocks) were used to justify a Budget giveaway before the
election? Such a giveaway would have nothing to do with the real Lord Keynes
who advocated state and state-supported investment in a recession and was
always wary of lasting deficits on current revenue and expenditure.
The election is cited as a reason for caution by home buyers and businessmen
alike. This is probably just an excuse for delay when they feel uncertain.
What vast revelation they expect to get after polling day escapes me.
If Labour wins, there will be some highly inefficient social redistribution
through the mechanism of across-the-board increases in pensions and child
benefit. There will be a mixture of reasonable removal of the ceiling on
National Insurance contributions and a vindictive and counterproductive
increase in the top marginal income tax rate from an effective 40 to 60 per
cent. There will also be the threat of a legal minimum wage, and more
support for the anti-social Social Charter.
But these are insidious longer-term dangers, and would not quickly transform
the business outlook. Nor, for that matter, would any success in the
education and training programmes about which Labour spokesmen talk so
incessantly.
There is, however, one unambiguous piece of immediate good news. That is the
rapid fall in the rate of inflation, which is much steeper than anything to
be indicated by tomorrow's Retail Prices Index. A much better indicator of
trends is the Producer Output Price Index. It has now fallen - excluding
food, drink and tobacco which are affected by Budget changes - on a
seasonally corrected basis, to 2 per cent per annum, the lowest since the
start of the series.
The RPI is being dragged above this level by faster increases in the service
sector. Retail prices of services other than housing and public utilities
rose by 10 1/2 per cent in the year to last December. But some relief is
coming on this front, too. Not only have reported pay settlements in
manufacturing fallen, according to the CBI Databank, to 4.1 per cent in the
last quarter of 1991, the lowest since the Databank began (in 1980). This
series reflects, more than it causes, inflationary pressure. But in
addition, the much more sluggish private services sector reports a fall to
6.1 per cent in the second half of last year, down from a peak of more than
9 per cent in 1989.
Manufacturing productivity growth is now recovering strongly: to 5 per cent
per annum, according to the CBI, and nearly 3 per cent according to official
estimates. Even allowing for wage drift, the gap between pay and
productivity is now close to the 2 per cent normal among Britain's main
competitors.
When inflation is low, the opinion polls show that jobs and recovery are the
top priorities. But once the upturn comes, inflation goes back to the head
of the agenda and unemployment is relegated. Thus those take as their motto
'I am their leader, I must follow them' will run from pillar to post. In
fact low and falling inflation is still a blessing. For it provides headroom
for a recovery of output.
The postwar view that governments could spend their way into prosperity has
been exploded. But nor is there any excuse for governments and central banks
to stand idly by if the world looks like spiralling into depression. What
they can do, especially if they act in concert, is maintain an expansion of
demand in money terms sufficient to support a rate of real growth in line
with the growth of productive capacity, but not to finance inflation. This
common sense can be called reconstructed Keynesianism, or monetarism without
mysticism.
For most industrial countries a 5 per cent per annum growth rate of nominal
GDP - that is, GDP in actual money  - will be something close to what is
desirable. So if underlying inflation falls below this figure there is
headroom for a resumption of growth. This is the case in the UK and in the
Group of Seven summit countries as a whole.
For the first time since the 1973 oil price explosion, worldwide demand
expansion in money terms has been insufficient for normal non-inflationary
growth and it is reasonable to think of a stimulus. The main exception is
Germany where nominal GDP growth has been above 6 per cent because of the
boom in the west following unification.
In the UK, annual nominal GDP growth (at 'factor cost' to avoid tax
distortions) is down to 3 or 3 1/2 per cent, the lowest since the early
1960s.
Will, however, national authorities go in for this minimal degree of demand
management? The excuse that nominal GDP estimates are late and erratic does
not hold water, if one is concerned with responding to trends rather than
fine tuning. Indeed the US and Japan are acting to maintain nominal demand
growth, without using the terminology. So too, if a little less clearly, is
the Bundesbank which wants to stamp on inflation but certainly not to
produce deflation.
I prefer to talk about policy rather than personal indebtedness, because
nobody knows how far consumers and businessmen will want to reduce borrowing
before resuming their normal spending habits.
Suppose this takes a long time. What can governments do? I doubt whether
fiscal policy can help - except by strictly temporary tax cuts  - if only
because the budgetary outlook in so many countries is so bleak. Monetary
policy is still the most promising route.
The limits of interest rate policy have not been reached. But if they ever
are, Keynes did speak of burying pound notes in the ground and leaving it to
the forces of self-interest to dig them up. Milton Friedman has spoken of
dropping dollar bills by helicopter. It is not time for these heroic devices
yet, given that nominal demand is still only a little below a normal growth
path - having descended from highly inflationary rates.
Are countries such as the UK and France barred from either conventional
monetary policy or more spectacular gestures because of the exchange rate
mechanism? Yes. But they are not powerless. The weapons that the non-German
ERM members must adopt are more like those of a peripheral region within a
currency area that is not enjoying the boom conditions at the centre. The
main recourse for these areas is frankly to price themselves back into work,
which Britain and France are indeed doing.
If the non-German ERM members can just hang on some while longer to the
policies which have brought about low inflation, the heavy cavalry of the
Bundesbank will come up from behind. They may not say so in Frankfurt; but
once Germany is over the inflationary hump, interest rates there could fall
quite quickly and the G7 would be ripe for another attempt at joint monetary
management.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Struggles in the sky: The problems facing BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 2,350 job cuts announced by British Aerospace yesterday have struck at
the heart of the diversified company's traditional military and commercial
aircraft activities. They are unlikely to be the last.
In the face of the decline in defence spending and the slump in the civil
aviation industry, BAe has been forced to speed up the restructuring of its
aircraft operations during the past 18 months. The latest cuts are part of a
long restructuring process which has seen more than 10,000 people leave the
company over the past two years.
The company has already warned that unless it wins the Ministry of Defence
order for new Asraam advanced air combat missiles this year it will be
forced to cut more jobs. Even more could follow if the company fails to
clinch quickly a new Saudi Arabian order for Tornado and Hawk aircraft.
BAe's commercial aircraft operations - with the possible exception of its 20
per cent stake in the European Airbus programme - could also be at risk if
it is unable to finalise the second phase of the Al Yamamah arms contract
with Saudi Arabia in the next few months.
'Without the second Al Yamamah contract, commercial aircraft, especially
smaller regional aircraft, are likely to become a luxury BAe could ill
afford in its present circumstances,' a City aerospace observer warned
yesterday.
The Middle East produced Pounds 2.2bn of BAe's revenues in 1990 largely as a
result of the first Al Yamamah contract, compared with about Pounds 115m in
1985. But the decline in oil prices and the low US dollar exchange rate
against sterling last year has put pressure on the programme's funding.
Saudi Arabia funds its payments to BAe from a regular amount of crude oil
set aside for the purpose; BAe is understood to be seeking an increase in
the amount of oil from 500,000 to 750,000 barrels a day, plus a cash
advance.
BAe, like most other aerospace companies, continues to derive the bulk of
its profits from military activities. In contrast, its commercial aircraft
business, which employs about 21,500 people, or 1,500 more than its military
aircraft division, has always struggled to make ends meet. Defence reported
operating profits of Pounds 273m in the first half of the company's current
financial year compared with a Pounds 16m loss for commercial aircraft.
After regrouping all its defence businesses under one umbrella at the end of
last year as part of its latest recovery efforts, BAe is restructuring its
commercial aircraft activities into three separate units: regional aircraft,
Airbus and corporate jets.
The biggest losses have come from the company's regional aircraft
activities, including small propeller commuter aircraft and 70-100 seater
jets. These losses are likely to grow in the present cut-throat conditions
of the market, which accounts for only 5 per cent of the overall civil
market, itself 50 per cent controlled by the US Boeing company. In addition,
in the present climate of recession it is difficult to see the civil market
taking over some of the slack from the decline in military business caused
by the post-cold-war cuts in defence spending.
At the time of its flopped Pounds 432m rights issue, BAe stated that despite
considerable improvements in efficiency and competitiveness, the regional
aircraft business in its present form 'does not generate a sufficient return
on capital employed'.
The most serious problem has been the BAe 146 regional jet conceived by
Hawker Siddeley in the early 1970s, saved by the Labour government in the
late 1970s, and now BAe's last wholly-owned commercial jet airliner. The 146
has faced fierce competition not only from other manufacturers such as
Fokker or Canadair but also from big aircraft makers such as Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas with their respective smaller derivatives of the Boeing
737 or MD80.
Unlike the rest of the industry, the 146 also failed to build up a backlog
of orders during the good years of the 1980s. Its current backlog is 40
aircraft. Production peaked at 36 aircraft a year in 1989, falling to 26
aircraft in 1991, and expected to be about 24 this year.
BAe has been actively looking for partners to form an industrial alliance in
the regional aircraft business. But negotiations are expected to be long and
difficult. In the meantime, the company has been forced to rationalise its
regional aircraft activities to match demand and prospects.
Its Advanced Turboprop (ATP) commuter aircraft programme has been under
pressure and has struggled in vain to make a return. The smaller BAe
Jetstream turboprop commuter aircraft programme has fared better in the
market.
After being highly critical and apprehensive over the European Airbus
programme for many years, BAe now regards its 20 per cent stake as holding
the most long-term promise for its commercial aircraft operations. But
although Airbus is expected to provide BAe with substantial annual revenues
by the mid-1990s, it is putting pressure on BAe resources. The company is in
the costly process of building up production of the wings for the new Airbus
A330/A340 widebody airliners due to be delivered to customers from 1994.
Airbus, like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, also faces a difficult year in
terms of winning new orders because of the financial problems of all
international airlines. The other success story is BAe's 125 corporate jet
family, which has continued to perform strongly. But these programmes are
relatively small in the context of the company as a whole.
By splitting the commercial aircraft operations into three parts, BAe
appears to have set the stage for even broader restructuring of these
activities. This could eventually include the merger of its new regional
aircraft unit with other international partners and possibly a similar
alliance or even the sale of the profitable corporate jet business.
'They are going to have to take a tough decision whether they stay in the
regional market or not in the absence of finding a suitable partner,' said
Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aerospace analyst at Shearson Lehman.
This would mark the end of an era in the British aircraft industry. But BAe,
due to report its 1991 preliminary figures next week, which are expected to
show a loss because of extraordinary restructuring charges, is in a
precarious position.
BAe's overall difficulties have been compounded by its senior management's
loss of credibility after the mishandled rights issue last year.
The power vacuum created by Sir Roland Smith's departure after being forced
out of the chairmanship in September has not been filled; it has grown.
Sir Graham Day, already the chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, is only BAe's
interim chairman. After four months of searching for a full-time successor,
Sir Graham has just started interviewing potential candidates.
The search is proving difficult. Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of
Courtaulds, the chemicals group, and Reuters, the financial information
company, was Sir Graham's favoured candidate. He turned the job down a month
ago.
Sir James Blyth, the chairman of Boots who is a BAe director and a former
head of export sales at the Ministry of Defence turned down the post last
autumn. Mr David Simon, the chief operating officer at British Petroleum
said no. Sir David Lees, the chairman of GKN, has also turned down an
approach. Attention is currently focused on Mr Christopher Lewinton,
chairman of TI, the engineering group.
The process of finding a new chairman has been complicated by the need to
find a new finance director. Mr Dudley Eustace is leaving this summer after
taking responsibility for the shortcomings of the company's financial
reporting system which failed to send early warnings of the collapse in
group profits.
The political climate in the UK is also likely to complicate the task of
finding a new chairman. Although BAe insists a new chairman is expected to
be appointed at the end of April, it seems likely that such a move will be
delayed until after the general election. The outcome will not just affect
how much work BAe will get from the Ministry of Defence. A new chairman
would want a clear political mandate to rationalise the company by closing
unprofitable operations and selling others without fear of political
interference.
Whoever ends up in the hot seat faces an uncertain future. He will confront
the dilemma of either refocusing the group on its traditional aerospace
activities, with a subsequent phasing out of its car and property interests,
or reinforcing its ambition to be Britain's leading diversified
manufacturing conglomerate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The former occupant of Black Forest Chateau has returned. After a three-year
stint in his native Cyprus, Chris Leveras is back in Teesside helping to
spare the government's blushes with some cheesecake.
In 1982 Leveras founded his cake-making company, CDL 44 Ltd - CDL for his
initials and 44 for his age at the time - in Hartlepool. Six years later he
had built it up to employ 400 producing a turnover of Pounds 5.5m and then
sold out to Allied-Lyons.
Now he is taking a second bite at the British appetite for sweetmeats by
setting up a new company, Livera Foods, and announcing plans to produce up
to 75m gateaux and cheesecakes a year from a state-of-the-art factory in
Stockton-on-Tees.
This gourmand assault on the market has spared the government embarrassment,
in a Tory marginal con-
stituency, by promising to create 700 jobs on a site to which the Ministry
of Defence had planned to move its large quality-assurance unit before the
peace dividend forced a rethink.

The icicles were almost audible when Ernest Saunders, former chief executive
of Guinness, turned up on Radio Four's Today programme to discuss the
collapse of the Guinness II trial.
Before the interview Saunders had been asked to wait in the tiny hospitality
room at Broadcasting House with another guest already there. His face
blanched markedly when he opened the door to find Barbara Mills who, as
director of the Serious Fraud Office, was the power behind his 10-month
sojourn at Ford Open Prison.
The surprise was mutual. Carelessly or cunningly, Radio Four had told
neither of them that the other was to be there.

Any reader who senses a familiar ring in the name of Stephen Mitchell - the
lawyer who claims he has met the two Libyans charged with blowing up Pan Am
flight 103 - is probably not mistaken.
An insurance specialist, he has worked on many of Lloyd's of London's
celebrated cases, including the Savonita and Sasse affairs as well as the
corporation's computer-leasing debacle. Moreover, a Lloyd's member himself,
he surprised friends and foes alike by joining the board of the embattled
Richard Outhwaite agency.
Mitchell is no stranger to tragedy either. His fiancee was one of the 346
victims of the 1974 Turkish Airlines DC10 disaster, after which he
successfully fought for compensation from McDonnell Douglas in the US courts
on behalf of 100 British families.
He apparently has no axe to grind in the Lockerbie case. He says his meeting
with the Libyans' lawyer was arranged through a mutual friend.

If people are flying about more, is the recession over? BAA's monthly
airport traffic figures do not have anywhere near the same impact as changes
in US railroad box-car loadings once had on Wall Street sentiment, but they
do suggest something is happening out there.
A year ago everyone was on hold because of the Gulf War, so last month's 13
per cent jump is a distortion. Nevertheless January was the fourth month in
a row to show a year-on-year increase and traffic on the Edinburgh- London
route, regarded as a barometer of the domestic economy, has risen for the
past two months and is up on January 1990 levels.

If stockbrokers were forced to apologise and withdraw every report that
proved to be rubbish, the City would be a much more sensible place. But as
it rarely if ever happens, it is surprising that such a row has erupted over
BZW's draft report on the implications of the Accounting Standards Board's
proposals for company accounts.
In terms of the quality of its investment research BZW ranks well down the
league tables and it is not known for any particular expertise in reviewing
new accounting standards.
So why should there be such an uproar when it produces what sounds like a
piece of shoddy research?
Having to withdraw the draft is highly embarrassing for BZW. But it also
shows how difficult it is for brokers to publish material which is not to
companies' liking.

Ours not to reason why. Just be thankful the air of chivalry hasn't entirely
evaporated in defence secretary Tom King's reshuffle of Britain's Army.
True, cooks and latrine- diggers are being lumped together with drivers and
so on to make a Royal Logistic Corps. But new titles are out for cavalry
regiments due for amalgamation, although the peculiar logic that gave rise
to the old names has become still more unfathomable in the process.
The fact that the titles now refer to armoured troops is easily grasped by
comparison with manoeuvres such as the replacement of the existing King's
(no relation) Royal
Hussars by the King's Royal Hussars formed from the Royal Hussars (Prince of
Wales's Own) combined with the
14th/20th King's Hussars.
Never mind that another regiment currently carries that title (the
15th/19th). It will disappear, along with the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen
Mary's Own) and re-emerge dashingly as the Light Dragoons, which is what
their ancestor regiments were called before, for reasons now obscure, they
started becoming hussars early last century.
Even more obscure is why, on reverting to dragoons, they should be light
ones. Could it be, for instance, that they're 'light' in the same sense that
beer is, or entertainment?

FT  13 FEB 92 / Leading Article: The bill for Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE-YEAR plans, despite communism's demise, have their uses. In 1988 the
European Community agreed its very first five-year deal on overall EC
funding and spending, which allowed the Community to get on with its
revolutionary plan for a single market. Yesterday, the European Commission
came up with its second five-year plan. It has much to commend it. But it
cannot be accepted as it stands, even though the need for the Community to
settle its financial future over the next few years is self-evident.
Brussels is calling for total spending to rise, in real terms, by a third,
to Ecu88bn by 1997. Money to the EC's four poorest states would be doubled
over the next five years, as it has been over the last five. The Commission
wants a further real increase of 100 per cent in resources to meet the EC's
growing external responsibilities. Less costly in terms of new money, but
more controversial in terms of policy, is Brussels's plan to gear EC
research and training funds more to companies' needs.
Many member states will object to such a steep increase in the EC budget,
especially in difficult economic times. But poorer EC countries are
demanding more cash from Brussels to help them converge with the richer in
the run-up to economic and monetary union. Spain has more or less threatened
not to ratify the Maastricht treaty, unless it gets more.
Power ambitions
Apart from farm spending, the greatest strain on the EC budget in recent
years has come from outside - the Gulf war, the plight of Kurdish refugees,
and changes in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Maastricht
confirmed the Community's great power ambitions. But power brings
responsibilities. If the Twelve are going henceforth to co-ordinate their
foreign policies, it is logical that they should also increasingly pool
their foreign aid.
The proposed increases in spending can be justified, therefore, but only if
spending as a whole is brought securely under control. Reform of farm policy
is a sine quo non. In its absence, the budget proposal should be rejected.
Lop-sided nature
At least as important, are changes in the way revenue is raised. Getting
member states to agree this package will be made all the harder by the
lop-sided nature of contributions. At present, only Germany, the UK, France
and (marginally this year) the Netherlands are net contributors. It is a
scandal that the two countries with the highest average incomes - Denmark
and Luxembourg  - should be net beneficiaries of the budget, and that
Belgium should get more than Portugal.
The Commission has tinkered with the system of national contributions, to
make it less dependent on food and customs duties and on value added tax
(VAT), and more dependent on gross national product. But this will only show
up gradually over the next five years. In the meantime, Germany, whose
average income has been lowered by unification, is by far the biggest net
contributor (Ecu9bn), three times the net amount put in by the next largest
contributor, the UK, even after the British rebate.
The Commission ruled out a more radical move to a GNP-based system as
non-negotiable. But the problem cannot be fudged much longer. Alongside an
agreement on a new and larger budget, both farm policy reform and a more
equitable system of raising revenue need to be in place.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Arts: Black comedy spirals out of control - Cinema

<TEXT>
BARTON FINK (15) Lumiere, Gate Notting Hill, Screen on the Hill
THE FAVOUR, THE WATCH AND THE VERY BIG FISH (15) Odean Haymarket
STAR TREK VI (PG) Empire
SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (U) MGM Trocadero, Cannons West End
Writers have never recovered from being evicted by time and social progress
from the garrets they see as their natural habitats. Many still seek
castigatory environments even when, in the age of arts subsidies and social
welfare, comfort is within their reach.
Take the hero of Joel and Ethan Coen's Barton Fink, a black comedy about
madness that won the top prize, and several others, last year at Cannes.
Playwright Fink (John Turturro) has come to Hollywood after his latest
Broadway success - Bare Ruined Choirs, 'a simple tale of fishmongers' - and
is now holed up at the faded, majestic Hotel Earle. The time is the 1940s
when the cinema became a great provider, a welfare state by another name, to
every serious writer willing to slum it for a few months in Tinseltown.
When not discussing his screenwriting future with the fat studio head
(Michael Lerner combining LB Mayer with Jack Warner) and the thin, alcoholic
novelist teaching him the ropes (John Mahoney doing a William Faulkner),
Fink is marooned in his mouldering hotel room with writer's block. The
typewriter, though seldom struck, beats a deafening tattoo when it is.
Fink's neighbour (John Goodman) is genial on the surface, psychotic just
beneath. Mosquitoes whine like insect Eumenides. And the wallpaper is coming
away from the wall stickily, audibly, nastily, like flesh from an early
religious martyr.
Ah yes, but is the place falling apart? Is the neighbour mad? Is the
wallpaper in need of attention? Or is Fink himself, fright-haired and
pop-eyed in his steel-rim spectacles, a few cards short of a full deck?
Initially inspired by Clifford Odets, this lost-in-Hollywood left-winger is
turned by the Coens into a joke-archetypal writer who expressionistically
appropriates every new world he moves into. Though not told explicitly
through Fink's eyes, the scenes inside and outside the hotel both aspire to
a mildly deranged surrealism. The Coen-esque world of Raising Arizona and
Miller's Crossing, where daft events are delivered with a piercing sobriety,
is here given a subjective pretext by the dotty sensibility of the main
character.
But rather than legitimising the Coen style, this ends up devaluing it.
Barton Fink swept the board at Cannes, one suspects, because Roman Polanski
was jury president. Here was a film after Mr P's own heart: a Repulsion or
Cul De Sac for the 1990s, turning clinical claustrophobia into high black
comedy. But Polanski's films had an intensity and a savage cutting edge.
Barton Fink plays increasingly like a series of hit-and-miss sketches dreamt
up by two film-makers doodling between assignments.
Michael Lerner's studio chief is a hit: a human super-blob who alternates
between apoplexy and ingratiation. (Foot-kissing of screenwriters is a
speciality.) But Lerner's scenes could belong to a different film from the
neo-Gothic ones involving Goodman - inspired as if by Kubrick's The Shining
 -or the subplot romance with Judy Davis, who plays novelist's moll to the
Faulkner character and ends up as a corpse between Fink's sheets.
As with many films that spiral out of control, accumulation replaces
momentum. When murder, arson and dementia take over in the last reel, we
feel the same sense of jaded bemusement as when a horror film, running out
of anything further to up, sets fire to the ogre's mansion, hurls the
escaping hero(ine) into the open air, lashes the orchestra's string section
into overdrive and cranes up to view the aesthetic shambles with the
clemency of distance.
There is no mercy even in distance for The Favour, The Watch And The Very
Big Fish. Adapted by Anglo-Australian writer-director Ben Lewin from a story
by France's Marcel Ayme, this is a Euro-pudding that should never have left
the mixing bowl.
Where, to begin with, are we? Paris is the nominal setting and France is the
country of origin for most of the supporting cast. Yet the stars are
Anglo-American (Bob Hoskins, Jeff Goldblum, Natasha Richardson) and the
dialogue is out of Ionesco by a French-English phrasebook. As for the plot -
something about a photographer (Hoskins) employed by a religious artefacts
shop who falls in love with a pretty actress (Richardson) and finds his
perfect Christ model in her one-time ex-convict lover (Goldblum) - it aims
at a deadpan farcical tone, a sort of Gallic Fish Called Wanda, and misses
by a continent.
Bemused by the choppy editing and Franglais dialogue, I never once believed
in the romantic electricity supposedly taking place between Richardson and
Mr Hoskins, here sporting a posh accent, a moustache and a very big fish.
This last, featured in only one scene, is put through a mincer by Hoskins's
cordon bleu sister. Do not ask me why.
Elsewhere I recall two funny moments - a dog attacking a stuffed lion and a
porno film voice-dubbing session - and many more moments of stupefaction
shading into somnolence.
I was on red alert throughout Star Trek VI. Warp-speeding through the
galaxies with Kirk, Bones, Scotty, Spocky and the rest of them, we thrill to
another plot in which the evil Klingons menace decent humanity.
This time their bankrupt empire is suing for peace and their chancellor
Gorkon (David Warner as a galactic Gorbachev) is assassinated en route to
the United Federation of Planets. Was his ship blown up by the Enterprise?
Klingon nasty Christopher Plummer thinks so and so he ships Kirk and Bones
off to Klingon Siberia. From this wintry hell on a far-flung planet we are
told that 'No one ever escaped': which means our heroes take ten minutes
rather than five to do so. Meanwhile, back on the Enterprise, only a missing
pair of gravity boots can help Spock find the true culprits and prove his
masters' innocence . . .
Never mind gravity boots. As the spaced-out saga clocks up its 25th year, I
am concerned about all those gravity toupees. William Shatner's Kirk wears a
grey and curly number, while Bones favours a youthful sideways-with-parting
and Spock sports that unchanging jet-black fringe set off by twitching bat
ears. We have never seen so many attempts to conceal advancing
empty-headeness with advanced cranial foliage.
Star Trek VI itself is a piece of shameless let-your-hair-down camp. Rife
with idiot charm, it rejoices in lines like 'You've not experienced
Shakespeare until you've read him in the original Klingon' (Plummer to Kirk)
and 'There's an old Vulcan proverb: 'Only Nixon could go to China'' (Spock
to anyone still listening). Director Nicholas Meyer, on his third trekkie
outing, seems as happily confused as the rest of us over ranks and titles.
(I thought Kirk was an Admiral the last time round? And when was Spock
promoted to Captain?) But undeterred he hurls jokes, explosions and special
effects at us as if there were no tomorrow.
For this cast we are sadly told there may not be. In the closing credits the
stars literally sign off - pink autographs enscrolled on a galactic
background - and another generation, says the over-voice, will soon boldly
go 'where no man - no one - has gone before.' Ah, Political Correctness. Not
even the battle-scarred Enterprise can resist the onslaught of that.
Finally, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is back. Heaven knows what the PC
brigade have to say about this. Here we have an overprivileged Wasp
debutante establishing sway over a group of socially deprived mineworkers of
reduced stature. Still, the songs are good. And the animation, after 50
years, is matchless.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Technology: Beer casks obey the new barcode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses of empty beer casks and kegs costs the UK brewing industry an
estimated Pounds 10m a year.
The brewers have managed to cut the losses from more than double that amount
over the past five years by alerting police, pub staff and metal dealers to
the organised theft and smelting of the aluminium and stainless steel
containers for their scrap metal value.
But about 200,000 kegs, with an average replacement value of Pounds 50 each,
are still lost every year. Many are 'borrowed' for use as mooring buoys and
supports for fences at local gymkhanas. Mountain bikers use them as
obstacles. Building tradesmen erect working platforms on them.
Others are merely stacked in forgotten corners by customers who cannot be
bothered to return them to the brewery.
As the distribution networks of the brewers have extended well beyond their
own pub estates in the UK and into export markets, keeping track of the
whereabouts of individual containers has become more difficult.
But Charles Wells, the family-owned Bedford brewery, and management
consultants P-E International, of Egham, Surrey, have devised a computerised
system of monitoring the movement of the kegs using barcode technology.
Charles Wells labels each of its casks and kegs with a barcode which
identifies the brewery, the size of the container, and the date and place of
its manufacture.
This basic information is fed into the computer database along with the
manufacturer's serial number stamped on each keg.
A computer terminal at the production line is used to key in details of each
day's brew - brand of beer, brew number and date. Then automatic scanners
read the barcodes of the kegs as they are filled.
When the containers are moved to the loading bay, the make-up of each load
is fed into the computer by radio-linked portable data capture units. Any
other brewer's products included in the load are also identified.
Draymen with portable scanners again identify each container after it is
loaded and add in personal identity codes and information about the time and
place of loading and the vehicle in use.
All deliveries and collections at each outlet they visit are similarly
recorded. The portable unit is plugged into a printer in the cab of the
vehicle to produce delivery notes for signature by the landlord or manager.
When the drays return to the brewery, the data from their portable units are
down-loaded to the central computer. The brewery thus has a daily record of
every container delivered to, and returned by, each customer.
Undue delays in returning empty casks can be spotted and action taken to
recover them.
The system has cost about Pounds 250,000 to develop. But Jona-than Harrison,
Charles Wells's finance director, says: 'We have about 66,000 containers,
and we reckoned that if our losses were in line with the industry average,
they were costing us more than Pounds 150,000 a year.'
After a year's operation, he says, losses are less than 2 per cent compared
with an estimated 5 per cent for the industry as a whole.
Apart from combating theft, the system has brought other benefits.
Containers are being used more efficiently by speeding the return of empties
to the brewery and reducing stockholding.
Other cost savings are likely to flow from the analysis of data that the
system provides on keg repairs, usage patterns in different trade sectors
and the return of spoiled beer.
Brand marketing and sales are expected to benefit from the flow of
information; and the system provides extra insurance in any contamination
emergency by enabling the brewer to trace and recall the affected product
quickly.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Technology: Cesar in charge of the crew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every time an Air France flight is delayed or cancelled an amazing back-room
operation swings into action.
Using pen, paper, scissors, pins and glue a team of people works to redesign
the airline's six-month flight crew rota - trying to make optimum use of
cockpit and cabin staff while obeying the safety and other regulations and
agreements.
In an effort to improve efficiency and save money by using crews more
effectively, Air France asked Cap Gemini Sogeti, the European computer
consultancy group, to help build a system to handle the staff rota. The
project was nicknamed Cesar.
Using its Kads (knowledge acquisition and design support) software
development tool, CGS's research and development unit, Cap Gemini
Innovation, set out to build an expert system which would model the
decision-making process.
Three years later Cesar is almost ready to go into operation and will be
handed over at the end of May. To meet the operational demands of the
airline it has to guarantee short response times and 24-hour availability.
When it is fully operational Cesar will do the work of 30 people and produce
'an optimised' updated rota within 10 minutes instead of the three hours it
took to do manually.
The system will run on a local area network comprising 20 Vax workstations
and servers connected to an IBM 3090 mainframe. It will have cost Air France
FFr40m (Pounds 4m) with about half of that being spent on hardware.
Dominique Sylvestre, CGS project manager for Cesar, said Air France was
expecting to recoup the cost within three years through savings made by
using flight crews more efficiently. Air France is hoping to sell the system
to other airlines or transport organisations such as railways.
Cesar is one of a number of customer applications to emerge from CGS
Innovation's FFr600m-a-year R&amp;D programme, which includes more than 30 EC
research projects.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Swallowing Popcorn -
Gary Mead peers into the future with a trend spotting guru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE who chooses to change their surname to Popcorn risks not being taken
seriously. And if the first name name is Faith, and the business is
commercial futurology, then surely all hope is lost?
Not so fast. Faith Popcorn is the author of 'The Popcorn Report' which has
sold 80,000 hardback copies in the US. Popcorn's marketing advisory service,
'BrainReserve', has been employed to spot consumer trends for almost 20
years for big-name clients such as American Express, AT&amp;T,
Colgate-Palmolive, IBM, Philip Morris and Procter &amp; Gamble.
Popcorn's book, now published in the UK*, is a distillation of her marketing
gambits, a gaudy collection of invented terminology wrapping up both real
and fool's gold.
Stuart Bull, chief executive of the advertising agency KHBB (part of Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi group), says the book's 'good commonsense nuggets are heavily
disguised by 'PopSpeak', the illusion that putting two words together and
retaining their initial capitals gives a thought proprietary gravitas'.
One of BrainReserve's formulations is 'Advernews: A future customised
newspaper, printed off your home computer screen'. Others include
'Foodaceuticals: A new food industry . . . Food, beyond simple nourishment -
with medicinal qualities . . .'; and 'Trendbending: The process of
'reshaping' a product, business, or idea to the trends . . .'
According to Popcorn, the book deals not just with current fashions but also
future spin-offs: 'It's designed to give you a quick picture of the future
so you can understand your present. It's like driving around at night
without your headlights on. We just turn the headlights on.'
So what are some of her views of the future? She says that 'virtual
reality', that form of computer technology which gives its user a
three-dimensional feel, will displace traditional supermarket shopping. She
believes that consumers are becoming so enraged with allegedly socially
irresponsible companies that they will be drawn towards competitors which
offer added values, such as a healthier 'corporate soul', meaning
acknowledging mistakes and making themselves more publicly accountable. She
thinks 'Cause Marketing', whereby companies vouchsafe charitable donations
when consumers make purchases, will expand. These ideas are hardly novel;
Stuart Bull published an article on the impact of virtual reality technology
 -in 1973.
Popcorn says that 'Cocooning', perhaps her best-known formulation, and one
which is arguably a real contribution to the marketing lexicon, is already
with us; people are increasingly concerned to buy products and services
which protect them from the harsh and unpredictable realities of the outside
world. Some other trends she identifies are:
Fantasy adventure: consumers looking for products and services which add
spice to mundane existence.
Small indulgences: small-scale luxuries which massage bruised selves.
The vigilante consumer: whose pressure will manipulate marketing managers to
re-think business ethics.
Alongside the identified trends are many prescriptive acts of philanthropy,
one being that companies should begin to appoint children to their boards.
'Children are very nervous about their future and I think they should have a
vote. Kids should be on the boards that dictate and pollute their future,'
says Popcorn.
But is IBM, whose current corporate soul Popcorn thinks is 'not too great',
likely to appoint a child as a non-executive director? 'Did we ever think
that children would write to Tony O'Reilly and make them (Heinz) stop using
drift nets to catch tuna? The kids wrote to him and he stopped. Then
everyone follows. Maybe someone like Anita Roddick (of the Body Shop) will
put a child on the board.'
The book baldly states that the most important message for marketing in the
1990s is that we should be hopeful that tomorrow will be better than today.
But that is of little practical help; according to Bell, what is fundamental
to trend spotting is 'gauging the underlying level of consumer confidence'.
Moreover, polishing a company's ethics ignores one basic obstacle; marketing
managers have as their raison d'etre the principle 'sell more', which is
rather difficult in a slump.
But even in PopSpeak, some traditional values remain. 'We think 'doing the
right thing' will be good for business. I couldn't ever tell a client to do
something that wouldn't be good for business, it would be unfair. We really
believe it sells product, the bottom line is about selling product.' That's
good old fashioned faith.

90s; published by Century, Pounds 14.99.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rational debate succumbs to party
line - Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST casualty of elections is rational debate. Between now and April 9
ministers and their shadows have a single priority: they must stick to what
the respective party leaderships decree is the 'line'.
The political imperative is that all the prominent figures speak with
precisely the same voice.
The content of their pronouncements becomes of secondary significance. There
must be no splits, wobbles or divisions. For the next eight weeks party
strategists and journalists will do little but scan every spoken and written
word for such gaffes.
Labour is most obviously vulnerable. The Conservative assault on its tax and
spending policies took off because some of Mr John Smith's colleagues were
heard playing slightly different tunes to those of the shadow chancellor.
Mr Smith would prefer a Trappist silence - at least until after the Budget
on March 10. His strategy has not won universal approval in the shadow
cabinet. In any event neither he nor his colleagues can escape the
questioning of the media.
Inevitably, variations show up in the textual analysis. This was underlined
again this week by Mr Roy Hattersley's comments on the top rate of tax.
Differences of emphasis become behind-the-scenes rows and personality
clashes. Party strategists argue for more rehearsals. Mr Smith is under
pressure to simplify Labour's tax and spending pledges and re-issue them on
a single sheet of paper.
Discussion on the Labour front bench about possible changes to the way
public borrowing is treated in the national accounts has been similarly
troublesome.
There is a perfectly good argument for adjustments to the present
conventions. No private company could treat the receipts from asset sales as
negative current spending, as the government does.
But senior Labour strategists have decided that however coherent the case
for change, it is better to try to suppress the debate. They find it too
easy to see the headlines: 'Labour plans to fiddle the books.'
The Conservatives have proved more adept at keeping to one line. The daily
co-ordination exercise between the five ministerial musketeers led by Mr
Richard Ryder is repaying its initial investment. Ministers anyway are more
practised than their shadows. The day-to-day business of government
inculcates the habit of sticking to the line.
But the musketeers have decided that there are some debates in which they
must not engage.
Scotland provides the most obvious example. In private, ministers readily
confess that the upsurge of nationalist sentiment north of the border may
require a radically different approach after the election.
But that must not even be hinted at in public before polling day.
Until then the line must be that the only choice is between independence and
the Union. That way the Scottish National party may take votes from Labour
and in the process save some of the remaining Conservative seats.
Mr John Major has not been immune from the pressures which have boxed in Mr
Neil Kinnock over taxation. He has been obliged to give unequivocal
commitments - not to increase value added tax, not to abolish the ceiling on
National Insurance contributions - which foreclose perfectly rational
options.
Tacit collusion has so far allowed the two main parties to avoid the same
trap on the environment. Neither seem ready to make it an election issue.
Only the Liberal Democrats are willing to discuss the sharp increase in the
price of fossil fuels which every politician with an interest in the subject
regards as inevitable. As one minister puts it: 'We all know that in the end
we will have to introduce some form of carbon tax. But for God's sake don't
quote me.'
It is not hard to imagine that the question will be put directly to Mr Major
and Mr Kinnock over the next few weeks; or that both will answer that they
would not dream of increasing domestic heating bills or, like the Liberal
Democrats, putting 50p on the price of a gallon of petrol.
So who loses from this widening gap between private reality and public
pledges? In the first instance it is the voter, who is denied the rational
debate. But perhaps the bigger loser is the winner of the election. Mr Major
and Mr Kinnock are busy making their own straitjackets.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Business confidence is key to
lending, MPs told - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK business confidence and hesitant bank managers bruised by bad debts
since the 1980s boom years may be the chief obstacles to lending to small
business when the economy recovers, a Commons committee heard yesterday.
Mr Brian Pearce, chief executive of Midland Bank, told the Treasury and
Civil Service committee that he believed the main UK banks would have plenty
of capital to expand their lending. Senior executives of the three other
leading banks appearing before the committee agreed.
Mr Martin Gray, chief executive of retail banking at National Westminster,
said: 'We are not seeing a plethora of excellent quality propositions which
we are having to turn away.'
Mr Pearce disclosed that Midland made provisions in the financial year just
ended against lending to 12,000 personal and small-business customers with
shortfalls in their debt repayments of between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds
250,000.
All the bankers present rejected suggestions that bank managers had less
power to make loan decisions than previously. Mr Geoffrey Miller, Barclays
managing director, said his managers had power to lend a minimum of Pounds
20,000 unsecured and Pounds 80,000 secured, rising in some large branches to
Pounds 1m. The other banks produced similar figures.
Mr Miller said 80 per cent of Barclays' lending decisions were taken at
branch level. Only 4,500 cases were referred to head office and 55,000 to
its 24 regional offices.
Asked what it was doing to help the Citizens' Advice Bureaux and other
counselling bodies deal with debt problems, Barclays said it had supplied
six managers to the CAB organisation. The committee suggested that some
managers who might otherwise be made redundant could be seconded to advice
organisations.
Mr Trevor Blackley, NatWest's general manager of UK branch banking business,
said his bank had given Pounds 250,000 over three years for money advice
bureaux.
All the banks said a statutory levy towards the costs of money advice would
not be appropriate. Mr David Pirrie, a director at Lloyds, said banks
already provided a great deal of financial counselling through their
branches.
MPs asked about mechanisms to ensure that the new banking code was enforced
after it came into force on March 16. They were told that the banking and
building society ombudsmen would collect details of infringements. Those
banks and building societies which persistently failed to observe its
provisions could be reported to the Bank of England or the Building
Societies Commission.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Trustees' investment powers to be
widened - Charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARITIES could benefit by several hundred million pounds as a result of a
government concession giving charitable trustees wider discretion in how
they invest their funds.
Ministers are to draw up regulations to give charities broader powers of
investment than provided for by the Trustee Investment Act 1961. This says
that only half a charity's assets can be invested in shares rather than in
gilts.
The regulations are expected to be drawn up over the summer and to come into
force at the begining of next year. Though the new regime has yet to be
decided, charity organisations are looking for a system that would allow
three quarters or four fifths of a charity's assets to be invested in
shares.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, estimates that charities have
lost about Pounds 400m a year because of the restrictions in the Trustee
Investments Act.
The move follows an embarrassing defeat for ministers before Christmas
during discussion of charities legislation in the Lords.
The concession represents a victory for the Home Office over the Treasury,
which had previously taken the line that the question should not be dealt
with separately from the broader consideration of the 1961 act. A
consultation paper on the issue has been promised 'in due course', but there
is no prospect of this being published before the election.
Ministers held out, however, against another change on which they were
defeated, which would have limited trustees' liability to the assets of the
charity.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the government would consider how
to address the point - raised by peers  - that unlimited personal liability
deterred people from becoming trustees of unincorporated charities. However,
he said that was too complex to be dealt with quickly enough for inclusion
in the bill.

</HEADLINE>

THE GOVERNMENT has 'fiddled' the figures on reduced hospital waiting lists,
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, said yesterday, Ivo Dawnay writes.
In a bid to counter government claims that lists have fallen by record
numbers, Mr Cook said that the number of patients removed from lists without
treatment had increased by 82 per cent.
He said that while those getting operations rose by 6.6 per cent in the 18
months to March 1990, in the period up to September the increase was only
0.2 per cent.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, junior health minister, said those removed from lists
were among 836,000 patients judged by doctors as no longer requiring
treatment.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Position of Labour's Scots MPs
questioned - Devolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PASSING remark by Mr Robin Cook has once again raised the political
quandary posed by Scottish MPs being able to vote in Westminster on English
and Welsh issues.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has written to Mr Neil Kinnock, the
Labour leader, asking whether 'the Cook doctrine' would inevitably apply to
other opposition frontbenchers.
The question resurfaced in a BBC Scotland programme on Friday when Mr Cook
apparently ruled out continuing as health secretary once the Scottish
parliament, pledged by Labour, was set up.
Last night Mr Kinnock's office tried to defuse the issue with a statement
stressing that the constitutional position would allow him to continue to
choose his cabinet from among all elected MPs once a Scottish assembly was
set up.
Mr Cook's remarks were said by colleagues to reflect a personal rather than
a party position. The Conservatives, however, indicated that they would
continue to press Mr Kinnock on the issue - dubbed the 'West Lothian
question' after it was raised by Mr Tam Dalyell, then MP for the now
disbanded constituency.
In his open letter to Mr Kinnock Mr Lang claims other Labour MPs who would
be affected include Mr Gordon Brown, trade and industry spokesman, about
five mid-ranking frontbenchers and Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor. Each of
these, he argues, would be wielding powers in England on aspects of
government business that Labour intends to devolve to the Scottish
parliament.
Mr Lang goes on to ask whether Labour's Scottish MPs would be excluded from
all main departments of state or whether they would be allowed to hold only
all-UK portfolios such as foreign affairs, defence and energy. 'If the
latter, does not this limit the prospects of your English and Welsh
colleagues occupying such posts,' asks Mr Lang.
At the weekend Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, partially
tackled the question by hinting that the creation of English regional
assemblies would help resolve the problem.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont faces growing cabinet
pressure for tax cuts - Conservative General Election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT is facing growing pressure from cabinet colleagues to
launch the Conservative campaign for an April 9 election with a 1p cut in
the basic rate of income tax and a  1/2 -point cut in interest rates.
Senior ministers believe most cabinet members now favour the chancellor
cutting the basic rate of income tax from 25p to 24p and substantially
raising tax thresholds in the March 10 Budget.
With ministers acknowledging that the economic recession remains far deeper
than they had anticipated, a significant number of ministers believe the
Budget should include tax cuts worth up to Pounds 3bn.
The prospect that tomorrow's official figures for unemployment last month
will show another large rise has meanwhile strengthened the conviction that
Mr Lamont should take the first opportunity that presents itself to cut
interest rates by  1/2 a point.
Mr John Major told businessmen in Portsmouth yesterday that he was no doubt
that the prospects for recovery were 'very bright indeed'. But he conceded
that it was impossible to put a precise date on a revival in consumer
confidence, which is seen as the essential element in that recovery.
Labour yesterday underlined its determination to keep the recession - and
the consequent rise in unemployment - at the heart of the political debate.
It published a detailed analysis of the rise in the jobless total since 1979
in every parliamentary constituency.
In the 80 most marginal seats - which will be the main election battleground
 -the increase ranged from 2 per cent to 312 per cent. In more than half the
rise was more than 100 per cent.
In the wake of the announcement by British Aerospace that it was shedding
2,350 jobs, Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said the
opposition would continue to highlight the surge in unemployment as a key
indicator of 'the failure of the Thatcher-Major government'.
Even though opinion-poll evidence shows that most voters do not blame Mr
Major for the recession, Mr Blair said that Labour expected the rising
jobless total to emerge as a key indicator of the government's economic
competence.
A Pounds 3bn package of tax cuts would allow both a reduction in the basic
rate (costing Pounds 2bn) and the above-inflation increase in tax thresholds
which many in the government believe is essential to demonstrate its
commitment to the lower-paid.
In spite of strong signals from both the Treasury and 10 Downing Street that
a sharp rise in borrowing means Mr Lamont will have to present a prudent
Budget, ministers believe that Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn of tax cuts would be
consistent with the government's image of responsible economic management.
The prime minister and the chancellor, however, are likely to delay their
decision until the end of this month.
Barring a spectacular reversal in the opinion polls over the next few weeks,
Mr Major plans to announce the election within days of the Budget, probably
on Thursday March 12. Parliamentary business managers said that the Commons
would then have until Monday March 16 to complete or abandon any remaining
legislation.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke focuses on opposition
education plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday took the election battle to Labour's ground with
a sharp attack on opposition plans for education, Philip Stephens writes.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, accused Labour of planning to
reverse the drive towards higher standards for education, which he said was
behind the government's school reforms.
Mr Clarke launched a poster campaign which suggests that Labour would turn
children into dunces by abandoning the national curriculum, diluting
examinations and banning the publication of school-by-school results.
Mr Clarke said the opposition planned 'an assault upon the future of our
children'.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's education spokesman, responded with a point-by-point
denial of the charges, saying that Mr Clarke was guilty of a series of
obvious and 'outrageous' lies.

FT  13 FEB 92 / CD sales beat LPs by almost five to one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPACT DISCS outsold long-playing records by almost five to one in the UK
last year, according to provisional figures from the British Phonographic
Industry (BPI).
In 1990 CDs outsold vinyl albums by two to one.
Music companies have been reducing the number of titles available on vinyl
and WH Smith, the retailer, announced earlier this year that it would stop
selling LP records.
Music companies and record stores say their decision to limit vinyl sales
reflects a growing preference for CDs. Mr Rupert Perry, UK managing director
of EMI Records, said: 'If the consumer was still interested in vinyl we
would continue to put it out.'
The number of CDs sold increased by 23.4 per cent to 62.8m last year, in
spite of a 5.5 per cent fall in unit sales of recordings of all types. LP
record sales fell 47.9 per cent to 12.9m. Cassette sales fell 11.1 per cent
to 66.8m, only slightly ahead of CDs. Two years ago cassette sales were
twice as high as those of CDs.
The higher price of CDs meant that their wholesale value was 44.6 per cent
higher than that of cassettes. The wholesale value of CDs last year -
excluding distribution costs, retailer's margin and value added tax - was
Pounds 345.5m, an increase of 26.4 per cent on 1990. The wholesale value of
cassettes fell 2.9 per cent to Pounds 239m and the value of LPs fell 42.3
per cent to Pounds 46.4m.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Old Masters give market new life: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PORTRAIT of a Lady with a Pet Squirrel and a Starling', painted in London
in the 1530s by the Flemish master Hans Holbein, is to be sold at Christie's
in London on April 15.
The auction house is reluctant to quote an estimate for such an exceptional
work but bids in excess of Pounds 15m are expected.
The highest price secured in the UK for an Old Master painting is the Pounds
8.1m paid by the Getty Museum of Malibu at Christie's in 1985 for Mantegna's
'The Adoration of the Magi'.
According to the Hon Charles Allsopp, chairman of Christie's Europe, the
Holbein is 'the most exciting picture to come on to the market here since
Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' in 1987 and by far the best Old Master picture to
have been offered since Velazquez's 'Portrait of Juan de Pareja' in 1970.'
In the same sale, which is to be held in April, Christie's will also offer
'Daniel and Cyrus before the Idol of Bel' by Rembrandt, which might make at
least Pounds 8m, and 'The Old Horse Guards London from St James's Park' by
Canaletto, which should attract bids of about Pounds 5m.
The arrival on the market of three such important paintings puts impossible
stress on the rickety barriers which attempt to maintain the UK's national
heritage. The Rembrandt and the Canaletto were offered for sale to the
National Gallery but the gallery has an annual purchasing grant of just
Pounds 2.75m, which has been frozen for 10 years.
The total purchasing grants of the nationally financed museums amount to
Pounds 8.47m. The National Heritage Fund, which has an annual grant of
Pounds 12m, is unwilling to commit all its resources to retain perhaps just
one of these paintings.
The Holbein was not offered to the National Gallery. It is owned by Lord
Cholmondeley who wants the highest possible price from the open market.
Mr Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, said yesterday: 'The
'Lady with a Squirrel' is one of the greatest of Holbein's works of this
kind. Its retention in this country is therefore of great importance.
'Only a generous change of heart from Lord Cholmondeley can now bring
matters to a happy conclusion.'
Lord Cholmondeley says he needs the money to maintain the two large houses
that he recently inherited - Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire and Houghton in
Norfolk. He has just received a Pounds 1m estimate for the cost of repairing
drains and piping at Houghton.
'Daniel and Cyrus' is tiny - 23.4cm by 40.1cm  - but it has been passed as a
genuine Rembrandt by the experts who are re-attributing about half the
artist's work to his followers. It belongs to the Eliot family of Port
Eliot, Cornwall.
The Canaletto, like the other two paintings, has never appeared on the
market. It was bought by the Earl of Radnor from the artist in 1749 and has
passed down through inheritance.
It may not be coincidence that the three paintings have come up for sale at
the same time.
Owners of valuable works of art face two threats - the possibility of a
high-taxing Labour government and the proposals by Mr Tim Renton, minister
for the arts, to draw up a list of national treasures that cannot leave the
country. The Holbein and the Rembrandt would certainly be on the list.
It is now up to Mr Renton to find extra funds or to see the three
masterpieces almost certainly sold to foreign bidders. Ironically, the
Canaletto must have been painted from just about the site of Mr Renton's
office.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Battling the repossession scourge: Help for mortgage debtors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Council of Mortgage Lenders will today announce the number of homes
repossessed in the second half of last year. The figure will take the total
for 1991 up to just under 80,000 - a staggering increase on the 5,000
repossessed annually as recently as 10 years ago.
Yet the announcement is likely to be greeted with relief by the government
and the lenders. This is because it is far short of gloomier predictions
from housing analysts and campaigners that repossessions would top 100,000
last year.
Ministers are also optimistic that the chancellor's mortgage rescue package,
announced on December 19, will make a significant impact on the number of
repossessions in 1992.
The government's contribution to that package was an agreement to pay the
mortgage interest element of social security benefits direct to lenders, so
that it was not spent on other things.
In return, the lenders agreed not to repossess the homes of people covered
by such benefits. They also set aside up to Pounds 1bn for mortgage-to-rent
schemes under which housing associations would buy the homes of repossessed
borrowers and rent them back to their former owners.
The lenders claimed that the package would cut repossessions by 40,000 in
1992 - half of which would be through mortgage-to-rent schemes.
Yet almost two months after the chancellor announced his package, only three
building societies have announced details of their schemes - two of them
only pilot schemes covering fewer than 500 homes.
At the heart of the delay has been a clash of interests between the lenders
and the housing associations over the terms for mortgage-to-rent schemes.
The housing associations are keen to help keep borrowers in their homes but
are unwilling to take on an open-ended liability to bail out the lenders. So
they want the lenders to pay for outstanding repairs before handing over
homes, to write off arrears owed by borrowers and to cover their set-up and
administration costs.
They have also been unhappy about the terms on offer for loans to buy the
repossessed homes. The lenders were prepared to offer loans at 6 per cent to
8 per cent, but the associations reckoned that they needed interest rates of
below 5 per cent if they were to charge affordable rents.
Little progress was made in the negotiations between the lenders and the
housing associations until three weeks ago, when the Nationwide Building
Society launched its pilot mortgage-to-rent scheme. Anxious to be the first
to announce a scheme, Nationwide conceded most of the associations' demands.
Housing association costs were to be fully covered, mortgage arrears would
be written off and houses put into good repair before sale. Nationwide also
conceded interest rates for loans to the associations of between 3.5 per
cent and 5 per cent, in return for a share in any increase in value of the
houses.
Nationwide's terms were not widely welcomed by other lenders, who saw them
as overly generous. But they set a benchmark from which the housing
associations were reluctant to depart.
The Halifax pilot, announced on Friday, is thought to be broadly along the
same lines as Nationwide's. So too is the Bradford &amp; Bingley's, launched on
Monday.
Other initiatives are in the pipeline. Leeds Permanent will announce details
of its scheme today, with Woolwich following later this month. Some of the
mortgage indemnity insurers, who stand to lose as much as Pounds 3bn over
the next two years, are thought likely to set up their own schemes.
Most of the centralised lenders, the new mortgage companies which are among
the hardest hit by arrears and repossessions, have yet to devise rescue
schemes. The Mortgage Corporation, however, has set up a Pounds 15m business
expansion scheme to convert 150 homes into assured tenancies. It is also
talking to housing associations about renting empty properties to homeless
families.
The pace of setting up mortgage-to-rent schemes will now quicken. Many
involved in housing are, however, cautious about their ability to meet their
target. Sir George Young, the housing minister, last week declined to
endorse the 40,000 forecast, pointing out that it had been made by the
Council of Mortgage Lenders, not the government. Shelter, the pressure
group, earlier this week suggested that mortgage-rescue schemes would not
save more than 24,000 homes.
That pessimism is shared by Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at
the stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, who believes that rescue schemes will
have only a marginal effect on the level of repossessions. He is optimistic
about repossessions this year, however, because lenders are doing more to
help customers manage their finances.
'The building societies and other lenders have achieved a truly remarkable
reduction in the number of likely eviction cases. Around two thirds of their
serious arrears cases are now under control,' he says.
After the activity to set up mortgage rescue schemes the solution may have
lain with the lenders all along - in the form of better debt counselling.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Early halt to CFC output is announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK will stop making ozone-destroying chemicals by the end of 1995, the
Department of the Environment and ICI, the country's largest chemical
manufacturer, said yesterday.
That will be two years ahead of the European Community deadline and five
years ahead of the internationally agreed Montreal Protocol.
The commitment matches the announcement by President Bush on Tuesday that
the US would stop producing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals
causing most damage to the earth's protective ozone layer, by the end of
1995.
Both countries are accelerating the phase-out of CFCs in the light of new
evidence that the upper atmosphere is losing ozone far more rapidly than
scientists had realised previously. An 'ozone hole' may appear over densely
populated regions of the northern hemisphere, letting in harmful ultraviolet
radiation from the sun.
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said it was
not enough for the UK just to echo the new US timetable. Ms Tracy Heslop of
Greenpeace called for an immediate ban. 'All John Major has to do is pick up
the phone to ICI to stop the production of ozone destroyers,' she said.
Mr John Beckett, who is managing ICI's phase-out of CFCs, said an immediate
halt was not practical because many users, particularly in the refrigeration
industry, still had no available substitutes.
ICI halved CFC production from 80,000 tonnes in 1986 to 40,000 tonnes last
year, and the company has committed Pounds 200m to the development and
manufacturing of alternatives.
People are still not taking the CFC phase-out seriously enough, according to
Mr Beckett. 'We at ICI have had a free CFC recycling and recovery scheme for
some time and we're very disappointed at the response,' he said.
He added that ICI's new plant at Runcorn, Cheshire, which produces a
non-ozone-destroying substitute for CFC coolants, was running below full
capacity.
Yesterday Mr Klaus Toepfer, Germany's environment minister, urged the EC and
the US to help bring forward to 1995 the worldwide ban on ozone-destroying
chemicals.
Mr Toepfer said such a deadline should be set by a conference next November
in Copenhagen of 46 industrial and developing countries which are
signatories to the Montreal Protocol. He said he was in touch with his EC
and US counterparts about a joint push for a worldwide ban by 1995.
Mr Toepfer is also pressing German industry to stop making and using CFCs
next year. 'Germany will become the first CFC-free country in the world in
1993,' he said.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Truck and van sales fall 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW COMMERCIAL vehicle sales fell 17.2 per cent to 16,677 last month,
against 20,131 in January last year.
According to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, the recession in the UK new-vehicle market shows no sign of easing,
with commercial-vehicle registrations in January 50 per cent down on the
same month three years ago.
Sir Hal Miller, SMMT chief executive, said sales last month were the lowest
January total since 1981 and reflected 'the continuing serious state of the
commercial-vehicle industry'.
Sales of light and medium trucks and medium vans were particularly hard hit.
Registrations of new trucks (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) have
fallen by 63.9 per cent in the past three years from 6,442 in January 1989
to 2,325 last month.
Rover again lost ground in the small-van market, while sales of
Mercedes-Benz and Nissan medium vans fell sharply. Volkswagen improved in
this sector, helped by the progressive launch last year of its Transporter
range.
In the heavy-truck market (above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight), Volvo
ousted Leyland DAF from sector leadership.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Big rise found in seized homes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR said last night that statistics to be released today by the Council
of Mortgage Lenders show 78,000 homes were repossessed last year, up from
44,000 in 1990.
Figures leaked to the party were said to indicate that at the end of
December 270,000 households were more than six months in arrears with
mortgage payments, an increase of 50,000 on the figure for the end of June.
Labour also published research showing that in every region of England
except London, the number of homes empty because of repossessions was more
than the number of homeless families in temporary accommodation.
The party added that there were 220,000 empty homes on the market left
unsold because of the housing slump.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, warned that the backlog of
unsold properties meant the housing market had no hope of recovery in the
next year.
He promised that a Labour government would buy some of the empty homes to
rehouse homeless families.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Property prospects worsen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE in the recovery of the UK commercial property industry has
diminished during the past three months, according to a survey by Gallup,
the research group.
More than half the property companies and funds questioned did not expect an
upturn in the market for at least one to two years.
The survey found that 64 per cent of respondents believed conditions would
improve and 9 per cent believed they would worsen. Last October 75 per cent
of respondents thought conditions would improve and 3 per cent thought they
would worsen.
Most respondents expected the retail property market to recover first. The
market considered least likely to lead a recovery was business space for
light industrial and office use, closely followed by offices. The City of
London was the least popular area in the country with property investors.
British Land, the property company headed by Mr John Ritblat, was considered
by nearly a quarter of respondents to be the most successful property
company of 1991. Land Securities, the largest UK property company, was rated
the most successful by 5 per cent of respondents.
Gallup, which carried out the survey with Chartered Surveyors Weekly, an
industry magazine, interviewed 98 directors of large property companies and
funds which control Pounds 59bn of property.

FT  13 FEB 92 / CBI reports poor prospects for manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for a recovery in UK manufacturing remain weak, with only two
regions expecting a 'slight' improvement in orders and output during the
next four months.
Only the north-west of England and the west Midlands - one of the regions
worst affected by the recession - expect a small rise in orders, while
manufacturing companies elsewhere expect production to remain flat or to
deteriorate.
The lastest findings of the Confederation of British Industry and Business
Strategies survey of regional industrial trends add to the bleak picture of
the UK economy painted by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin
earlier this week. The Bank admitted the economy was still in recession and
did not predict when an upturn would occur.
Although little change in output or demand was expected over the next four
months, the CBI survey points towards a reshuffle in the fortunes of the 11
regions.
Scotland, which has appeared to withstand the manufacturing recession
comparatively well, expects a sharper than average fall in orders and
output. The survey said Scotland was helped by the boom in North Sea safety
and technical work but now appeared to be slipping into a weaker position.
Scotland also recorded the biggest fall in optimism about prospects. Along
with the north of England, the south-east and the west Midlands, this severe
pessimism reflected the gloomy outlook for exports, the survey said. Overall
optimism, which rose marginally in the previous survey, declined.
The steepest fall in new orders in the past four months was in the west
Midlands, Scotland and Wales. Total orders fell in every region - a finding
at odds with expectations expressed in the last survey. The CBI said the
sharp fall in demand caught many companies by surprise, one reason being the
failure of export orders to live up to expectations.
One result of the recession has been a striking change in the distribution
of manufacturing activity. Before the recession, levels of capacity
utilisation were lowest in Scotland and the north. Now they enjoy the
highest rates while the south-east, Wales, East Anglia and the west Midlands
are more likely to have companies working below full capacity.
The survey predicted declines in investment in plant in all regions bar the
east Midlands, where little change was expected. All regions expressed
positive intentions to invest in training.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Rail sell-off campaign targets Tory
marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO RAIL unions yesterday entered the pre-election campaign with a warning
that rail privatisation could cut services to Tory-held marginal
constituencies.
The campaign, which will cost Pounds 70,000, urges voters in the 62 most
marginal Tory-held constituencies not to return candidates who support
privatisation. The initiative is part of the rail unions' Campaign for
Better Railways, which was launched two years ago.
It began yesterday with the distribution to all BR employees of a leaflet
setting out the unions' view of what privatisation will mean to them. The
unions will use posters, advertising and leaflets to drive their message
home to voters in the selected constituencies.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said the
Conservative party was planning to include rail privatisation in its
election manifesto. 'We know that the privatisation of British Rail will
result in the destruction of much of our rail network,' he said.
'There will be closures of lines, fewer trains, much higher fares and, when
the drive for profit takes over, safety margins will become depressed and
narrower.'
He said privatisation would push passengers away from trains and lead to
further congestion on roads. Privatisation threatened the jobs of a third of
RMT members, about 40,000 rail staff.
Mr Richard Rosser, general secretary of the TSSA white-collar rail union,
said: 'We know many passengers are saying 'anything is better than this'. We
will show them that things are as bad as they are now because BR is already
being forced to operate as a private company.'
He said a white paper detailing government plans had been expected by the
end of last year. 'So the first one to fail to achieve a Citizen's Charter
target is the prime minister himself.'
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport minister, yesterday said privatisation would
lead to an expansion of the railways. The white paper is expected this
month.
A confidential BR document leaked to the Labour party last month warned that
privatisation would mean the loss of InterCity links for dozens of towns and
cities in the UK, many in Conservative-held constituencies.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Willis warned over EETPU poaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS FROM 11 unions representing a majority of votes on the general
council of the Trade Union Congress yesterday warned Mr Norman Willis, the
TUC leader, that poaching by the EETPU electricians union will not be
tolerated if the union rejoins the TUC.
Many of the 11 unions, most of which have had disputes with the EETPU either
before or since it was expelled in 1988, welcome its return after its merger
with the AEU engineering union.
Some insist, however, that as a pre-condition of return the EETPU must 'hand
back' groups of workers it has recruited from TUC unions. That will be
difficult to enforce, especially if the Conservatives win the election and
outlaw the TUC's Bridlington agreement, which governs union membership
disputes.
If serious attempts are made to block the return of the EETPU some AEU
factions would probably favour leaving the TUC too, rather than jeopardise
the merger. The Labour election campaign could be disrupted by a dispute
looming between the TGWU general workers union and its 700 office staff who
play an important role in Labour electioneering in some constituencies. The
staff have voted by 509 to 203 for a one-day strike next week.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Britannia puts legal system's resources on trial: The
problems caused by long and complex trials have been highlighted this week
by the collapse of the second Guinness case. Paul Cheeseright looks at the
costs and strains of the longest trial of all, which ended last week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COURTROOM is being dismantled. The computer screens disappear. Eleven
jurors have been left to pick up the threads of their lives. The lawyers
have swiftly moved on to other cases. The UK's longest criminal trial is
over.
It took 17 months, or 252 working days, to reach the verdict.
The state paid for the investigation. The state paid for the prosecution. It
paid for the court. It paid, through the legal-aid system, for most of the
defence. The only thing for which it did not pay was the loss suffered by
victims of the fraud that led to the case in the first place.
This was the Britannia Park fraud case. It was heard in two offices,
converted and joined together, on the top floor of the Nottingham Crown
Court building. Not a luxurious conversion, but bespoke nonetheless.
Ms Elizabeth Folman, the East Midlands courts administrator, recalled: 'We
invited the prosecution and defence counsel to come to an empty room and say
what they wanted.' They chose tables and chairs and six computer screens for
the jurors. A 'portacourt' was brought in to give Mr Justice Potter, the
judge, a bench.
Here, with a view of a multi-storey car park, the immediate future of Mr
Peter Kellard and some fellow directors and business associates of Britannia
Park was played out. This week Mr Kellard and three other directors are
starting prison sentences ranging in length up to four years.
It was then, a successful prosecution. 'It is always worth it if you're
bringing wrongdoers to justice,' said Mr Don Dovaston, assistant chief
constable of Derbyshire police, which spent Pounds 2m between 1986 and 1989
interviewing 390 witnesses in the UK and around the world, compiling 5,000
pages of statements and obtaining 2,600 documents as exhibits.
Derbyshire police's involvement began after the Britannia Park theme park at
Shipley, near Heanor in Derbyshire, collapsed in 1985 with debts of Pounds
9.34m. The park was open but unfinished and designed to honour British
achievement. Police rapidly enlarged their inquiries to encompass fraud.
Mr Bernard Carnell, a partner in Offenbach and Co, the London solicitors
which acted for Mr Kellard, said: 'More than one person has said the case
was as serious as Guinness One (the first trial concerning the Guinness
takeover of Distillers), but more complicated.'
Pursuing the case put the legal system under strain. Professor Michael Levi
of the University of Wales said: 'Nobody would argue with the proposition
that the system finds it difficult to cope with these complicated issues.'
He is examining the conduct of fraud cases for the Royal Commission on
criminal justice.
The strain was evident during both the investigation and the trial. Mr
Dovaston explained that a squad of 10 officers had to be set up, drawing in
officers from the Derbyshire force with fraud experience. The number rose to
40 when arrests were in the offing. According to the inspector of
constabulary the problem for Derbyshire police was that the force had been
under-funded for the past nine years, and the Britannia Park case swallowed
resources.
So did the trial. The Lord Chancellor's Department has a notional figure of
Pounds 1,900 a day to cover the basic accommodation cost and the expenses of
judge and jury. That would mean merely holding the trial cost nearly Pounds
 1/2 m. The Crown Prosecution Service has calculated that its spending on
lawyers was Pounds 1m. The legal aid bills have yet to be delivered.
All but one of the five defendants received legal aid. Seven firms of
solicitors were involved. Their costs alone might total about Pounds 1m.
Four defendants had a queen's counsel in court, two had junior counsel. The
length of the case means that both barristers and solicitors will have to
put in special bills.
The longer the trial went on, the more apparent became the intellectual tour
de force of all those involved. Mr Timothy Barnes, the crown's prosecuting
counsel, said: 'Every part is magnified by a factor of 10 from one's normal
experience.' For him 'normal' is half-a-day's cross-examination of a
witness. He cross-examined Mr Kellard for 60 hours over 17 days. His opening
speech took 44 hours, his closing speech 33 hours.
The jury, praised by Mr Justice Potter for their 'quite remarkable care,
attention and patience', saw the seasons change outside. One of 12 had to
withdraw because of a family illness. Had another been forced to withdraw
the trial would have stopped and been held again. The 11 saw summer heat
induce the lawyers to take off their wigs. They saw a 'flasher', chased by a
policewoman, fall to his death off the top of the car park.
The question of their ability to absorb all the evidence - for the
prosecution 158 witnesses and 118 statements, and for the defence 28
witnesses and six statements - has quickly been posed.
Mr Carnell said Mr Kellard wanted to appeal. 'The Court of Appeal will be
asked to consider: can a court ever be sure the jury has assimilated the
facts, how can you be sure they have taken into account the evidence of
October 1990 and been able to balance it off against the evidence they heard
in October 1991?'

FT  13 FEB 92 / Labour pledges to keep fraud case juries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would not move to end trial by jury in fraud cases, Ms
Marjorie Mowlam, the Labour City affairs spokeswoman, said last night.
She said replacing juries with alternatives such as the three-person
tribunal advocated by the Roskill Fraud Trials Committee would risk
undermining 'basic civil rights'.
She said the party would, however, consider appointing specialist legal
advisers to juries in complex fraud cases.
Ms Mowlam said Labour would streamline the roles of the bodies responsible
for fighting fraud as part of a wide-ranging review of domestic approaches
to the pro-secution of such alleged crimes.
It would be given a broad remit, including consideration of the following
areas:
Improving the efficiency with which resources currently earmarked for
dealing with fraud are used. Ms Mowlam says there was duplication of effort
among the bodies with fraud-related responsibilities, including the Serious
Fraud Office, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Department of Trade and
Industry, the City's self-regulating organisations and the Stock Exchange.
Savings from better use of these resources could help the SFO to improve its
performance in prosecuting large fraud cases. Labour would retain the SFO
and the CPS as separate bodies.
Opening the way for the SFO and other prosecuting bodies to opt for civil
instead of criminal proceedings if there was a better chance of obtaining a
conviction.
Encouraging prosecuting counsel to limit the number of counts rather than
'throwing the book' at defendants. The SFO has been criticised for embarking
on all-embracing prosecutions that clog up the courts for months or even
years and become complex beyond the grasp even of experienced judges.
Placing time limits on both the duration of trials and delays in bringing
cases to court.
'Bringing successful prosecutions should act as a deterrent to others
considering fraud,' Ms Mowlam said. 'When the delay in bringing a case is
years, the deterrent effect is minimal.'
Examining the effectiveness of the pre-trial hearings introduced at the
recommendation of the Roskill committee.
Ms Mowlam also called on the government to use the lessons of the Guinness
proceedings as part of the basis for changing takeover legislation and
reforming auditing and accounting practices. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and
industry secretary, should 'turn his mind to improving the DTI's performance
as a regulator', she said.
Ivor Owen adds: Ms Mowlam later reinforced these criticisms in the Commons,
arguing that the need for action had been underlined by the collapse of the
third case concerning Guinness, and the 'potential collapse' of the second
Guinness case.
She went on to question whether fraud could be dealt with under the existing
law, and emphasised that the three people who had been convicted had spent
less time in jail than the time that was taken up by the trial.
Recalling that the sentence imposed on Mr Ernest Saunders, the former
Guinness chairman, had been reduced because of ill-health, she said he had
appeared on the media earlier yesterday 'in blooming health and protesting
his innocence'.
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, refused to comment on
individual cases but confirmed that Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord
Chancellor, was reviewing court procedures.

The commission concluded after an eight-month study that Wightlink, the

services to and from the UK mainland, but cleared it of abusing its
position.
Isle of Wight County Council said it was disappointed. It had hoped that the
commission would force Wightlink to give up at least one of its three routes
to a competitor.
Wightlink, a subsidiary of the Bermuda-based Sea Containers, is the biggest
of four operators on Isle of Wight routes. The others are Red Funnel, a
subsidiary of Associated British Ports, and two independents: Hovertravel
and Cowes Express.
The MMC says Wightlink carries 71 per cent of ferry passengers, 85 per cent
of cars, 80 per cent of lorries and 94 per cent of coaches. Its profits are
put at about 12 per cent of the replacement costs of its assets.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions face clash on recruits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF the FDA Civil Service union decided yesterday to reject the
advice of a Trades Union Congress disputes panel and accept health service
managers into membership for the first time.
The decision by the union's executive will cause friction with the Nalgo
public service union, whose members include some of the 200-plus general
managers who have applied for FDA membership.
Nalgo had asked the TUC disputes panel to instruct the FDA not to recruit
the managers, who are among a group of about 800.
The panel last week refused Nalgo's request but advised the FDA against
recruiting the managers, saying the introduction of another union into the
health service would not be helpful.
The dispute is politically sensitive because the government has said it
plans to legislate to weaken the TUC's adjudication role in settling union
membership disputes by giving individuals greater freedom to join the union
of their choice.
Ms Liz Symons, FDA general secretary, said yesterday that most of the health
service managers who had applied for union membership were not in any union
at all.
'They are attracted by our service for people on personal contracts. We
believe they should have the opportunity to belong to a trade union. Most
are not in one.'
The FDA will, however, face strong opposition from Nalgo when it attempts to
take into membership those people already in the public service union.
Mr Keith Sonnet, Nalgo assistant general secretary, said his union would
look at individual cases but 'we would not want to see our members join
another union'.
Under TUC rules the FDA would have to seek Nalgo's approval before
recruiting its members. The disputes panel said that it saw no reason why
Nalgo or any other unions should 'facilitate transfers at the insistence of
the FDA'.
Public rows about the transfers would inevitably attract the attention of Mr
Michael Howard, employment secretary, who argues that unions should not
refuse membership to an individual because of objections from another union.

FT  13 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Andean common market fails to deliver -
The region has 90m people but governments look elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER TWO frustrating meetings convened to decide on external tariffs for
the Andean common market, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela
still have not reached final agreement.
Although the heads of state defined four main tariff levels (between 5 and
20 per cent) last December and stipulated that these would come into effect
on January 1, 1992, Ecuador still insists on a long list of exceptions.
The December presidential summit accelerated the Andean Pact timetable,
largely in recognition of the fact that most members were already opening up
their economies at a fast pace. In concentrating on trade liberalisation,
the presidents virtually buried a broader range of policies designed to
promote regional industrialisation and development. But most experts believe
that the original programmes - drawn up soon after the pact's foundation in
1969 - dated so quickly that if it had not been for the change of plan the
pact would have slipped into obscurity.
The integration process was supposed to boost the regional market, promote
technology and research, and develop key industrial sectors, according to Mr
Germanico Salgado, former head of Ecuador's central bank. 'Now there's none
of this, no genuine substance or coherence. The common external tariffs are
very low, giving no margin of preference,' he said.
Trade between Andean Pact members has only represented between 3 and 15 per
cent of the pact's total foreign trade. It reached Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds
660m) in 1981, with Colombia as the biggest exporter, then the crises of the
1980s deepened and intra-regional trade dropped back until 1991, when it
rose to Dollars 1.7bn. Colombia's was the only economy to expand
significantly during the past decade, and its relatively low birth rate
ensured a steady increase in per capita income.
Although there are more than 90m people in the region, business and
governments are most interested in North American and European markets. The
geography of the Andean countries - two seaboards connected by the Panama
Canal and a forbidding chain of mountains slap through the middle of the
region - has also made communications difficult. The private sector, which
had little say in the Andean Pact's early programme, attributes slow
progress on integration to government instability and changing policies.
But as the pact changes character, the private sector is beginning to take a
more active role. 'Integration is useful, for all the classic trade
advantages - lower prices, competition and so on. We should not be too sorry
about the companies that disappear because they are inefficient,' said Mr
Fernando Navarro, president of Ecuador's National Federation of Chambers of
Commerce in Quito. 'At least by legalising frontier contraband we shall be
leaving an absurd fiction behind us.'
Other regional blocs have proved more dynamic than the pact itself, causing
friction among members.
Impatient with the delay caused by Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela plan to
forge ahead with Mexico in consolidating the Group of Three.
Ecuador's plea for special treatment rests on two main arguments - that it
is a relatively small and under-developed economy.
Negotiations are to continue in two to three weeks' time.

FT  13 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Sweden loses its fear of capital inflow -
A surge of foreign money has helped close the investment gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR so long a net exporter of capital, Sweden has suddenly become the focus
for a dramatic inflow of foreign investment which promises over time to
change the face of the country's corporate ownership.
The country's central bank is expected to reveal early next week that around
SKr50bn (Pounds 4.8bn) of foreign investment flowed into Sweden during 1991.
This contrasts with only SKr13.8bn in the previous year and a mere SKr9.7bn
in 1989. During the whole of the 1980s the volume of Swedish investment
flowing overseas was six times larger than the amount of investment coming
into the country.
The closing of the investment gap, from SKr75bn at the end of 1990 to SKr14m
for the last year, reflects partly the slowdown in the Swedish investment
offensive abroad that grew so fast between 1987 and 1990, especially through
mergers and acquisitions in the European Community.
But the substantial increase in inward investment volume also indicates just
how attractive Sweden is becoming for investment opportunities in the eyes
of a growing number of foreign companies.
The country's leading business magazine, Affarsvarlden, calculated recently
that inward investment rose by 400 per cent last year while the number of
Swedes employed by foreign-owned companies tripled. An estimated 135 Swedish
companies employing 40,000 workers were bought by foreign concerns over the
past three years.
Sweden has witnessed some significant acquisitions by foreign companies.
These include the purchase of Nobel Industry's consumer goods division by
the German chemical group, Henkel; the take-over of Inter Innovation by its
rival in security printing and payment machines De La Rue, the UK company;
the acquisition by the Danish company ISS-International Service Systems of
Electrolux's commercial cleaning services; and the purchase of Boliden Kemi
by the Finnish company, Kemira Oy.
In addition, corporate Sweden has seen the growth of joint ventures and
strategic alliances between domestic and foreign companies. The most notable
have been the 50 per cent stake in Saab Auto taken by General Motors,
Volvo's complex partnership with Renault, Gillette and JP Morgan's 47.8 per
cent acquisition of Swedish Match, and the Norwegian company Freia's 49.6
per cent purchase of Marabou chocolate. Swedish company shares are now more
appealing for foreigners, an interest in buying helped directly by the
abolition in December of the turnover tax on share dealing on the Stockholm
bourse.
Foreigners, at the end of 1991, held 8.1 per cent of the SKr552bn-worth of
shares on the local stock market and it has been estimated that foreigners
accounted for the purchase of between SKr15bn-20bn shares during last year.
In 1992, Sweden's shareholders' association has estimated that up to SKr30bn
more Swedish corporate stock could be bought by foreigners.
The surge in foreign business interest in Sweden stems from a number of
inter-related factors as the economy has become more deregulated and
international.
The most important positive change has been Sweden's commitment to join the
EC by 1995, coupled with the promise of financial stability through the
pegging of the krona to the European Currency Unit, firm control of monetary
policy using high interest rates if necessary, measures to cut costs,
keeping inflation down to average EC levels, and improving productivity.
The country's non-Socialist coalition which came to power last October has
speeded up liberalisation with a robust free market strategy. As many as 35
of the country's state-controlled companies are to be privatised.
Old laws restricting foreign companies are also being scrapped. Last month,
the government made it easier for them to buy shares and real estate by
abolishing a law dating back to 1916 which required non-Swedes to obtain
permission from the public authorities to acquire voting shares or equity
every time the purchase exceeded or was increased by 10 per cent of a
company's stock. More reform is in the pipeline.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATS and Republicans are heading for a clash in Congress over how much
of the tax incentives package proposed last month by President George Bush
to enact.
But with the tax debate turning into a contest of political gamesmanship, it
is the Democrats who are proposing the full list of measures set out by Mr
Bush in his State of the Union address, and the Republicans who are calling
for a more limited package of short-term measures.
With the backing of the White House, the Republican minority in Congress has
selected seven main measures from Mr Bush's proposals. They include a cut in
the capital gains tax rate, an investment tax allowance, and tax incentives
for first-time home buyers.
Mr Richard Gephardt, leader of the Democratic majority in the House of
Representatives, countered the Republican bill by introducing one with 50
measures, which he said represented the entire Bush package.
This is the bill on which the House ways and means committee, Congress's key
taxation body, began work yesterday.
The Republican bill omits the tax break Mr Bush promised to middle-income
families: a Dollars 500 (Pounds 276) per child increase in personal tax
allowances.
While this measure was not included in the short-term plan Mr Bush
challenged Congress to pass by March 20, his State of the Union address
specifically asked Congress to act on it 'right away'.
The bill also lowers the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to
prevent the wealthy from escaping tax-ation by sheltering their income.
'It appears that the tax train is leaving the station and the middle-income
people have been left behind,' Mr Gephardt said. 'What the administration
now wants considered is short-term legislation, loaded with special interest
tax measures, shorn of most relief for moderate-income Americans and
financed by phony accounting changes.'
Both Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the ways and means committee,
and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, his counterpart on the Senate finance committee,
said yesterday there would be only one tax bill this year: it should
therefore address the entire range of tax proposals.
Congressman Bill Archer, the senior Republican on the ways and means
committee, said Mr Bush would veto the Gephardt bill as it did not comply
with the fiscal discipline required by the US budget enforcement act.
'I don't think it's a good-faith effort when Dick Gephardt submits a bill,
claims it's the president's bill, but offers no spending cuts to pay for the
balance of the tax initiatives,' Mr Archer complained.
Should the Gephardt bill pass, however, it would present Mr Bush with the
ticklish political task of explaining why he was vetoing legislation
comprising largely his own proposals, and preferred a bill giving little or
nothing to middle-income families.

<TEXT>
MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, yesterday said his
stabilisation policies were under threat from inflation, writes John Barham
in Buenos Aires.
'We will not throw away all we have achieved. We will persevere and continue
with the changes,' he said.
The spectre of rising inflation is already setting off pre-emptive price
increases and index-linking. Mr Cavallo has responded by demanding companies
keep prices down and unleashing tax inspectors on offending businesses.
Mr Cavallo's economic liberalisation policies have steadily lowered
inflation, which fell to a monthly rate of 0.6 per cent in December although
flaring in January to 3 per cent. Mr Cavallo has forecast inflation of 6-7
per cent for 1992; last year prices rose 84 per cent.
The minister warned that 'without economic stability it will not be possible
to grow or to maintain political stability'.
He repeated that inflation would simply lead to recession and called on
companies to invest more, raise production and lower prices.
The minister is keenly aware that further inflation will increase political
pressure to devalue the peso, the new currency introduced in January.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S Economy Ministry has warned that state companies' failure to rein
in spending could jeopardise the country's stabilisation programme, writes
Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
Under a programme agreed with the IMF, Brazil must produce an operating
surplus of 1 per cent of GDP this year. However, preliminary figures for
last year show the public sector deficit worsened to 2.25 per cent of GDP,
mainly due to the failure of state companies to cut costs.
Federal investments have been slashed, but few state companies met the
requirement of last February's economic plan to reduce costs for 1991 by 10
per cent, according to ministry officials.
Some even increased spending, appealing to the Treasury for extra funds.
Many failed to make payments to the state social security fund, pushing it
to the verge of bankruptcy.
Some of the large state companies, such as Petrobras, started this year by
granting generous salary increases to employees.
A ministry official said yesterday: 'The state sector is out of control.'
Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, economy minister, is expected to order a
crackdown on costs and try to resolve the problem of state companies unable
to service debt because they are owed money by other parastatals.
He has already blocked the accounts of Eletrobras, the state electricity
company, for not meeting debt payments and threatens the same for other
offenders.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Clinton deeper in draft-dodge controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas suffered a fresh blow to his presidential
campaign yesterday when he was forced to release a letter casting doubt on
denials of draft-dodging during the Vietnam war.
The release of the letter pre-empted a disclosure on national television,
but the timing could not be worse with less than a week remaining until the
critical New Hampshire Democratic primary election next Tuesday.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is challenging Mr Clinton for the Democratic
nomination, said: 'I think voters should be concerned about his veracity and
character.'
The letter, which was leaked to ABC News from Pentagon files, concerns Mr
Clinton's intention to serve in the reserve officers' training corps (ROTC)
at the University of Arkansas. This was a move that allowed him to avoid
military service in Vietnam for four years. However, he went to Oxford as a
Rhodes scholar and never made good on the pledge.
The letter, written in 1969, expresses regret for misleading an Arkansas
reserve officer by failing to disclose the depth of his opposition to the
war. He also thanks the officer for 'saving me from the draft'.
After the original charges of draft-dodging surfaced, Mr Clinton denounced
the story as Republican muck-raking. He also denied he was a draft-dodger,
noting that in the autumn of 1969 he had made himself eligible for the
draft. (He received a high number in the lottery and was therefore not
called to serve).
The letter gives a poignant account of how Mr Clinton wrestled with his
conscience. The young student condemns the Vietnam war and the draft, but
says he did not wish to be a draft-resister. The ROTC seemed a compromise.
But having received the deferment, Mr Clinton said he was consumed by
anguish and the loss of self-regard. 'I decided to accept the draft, in
spite of my beliefs, for one reason: to maintain my political viability
within the system.'
He hints at his future career in national politics. 'For years I have worked
to prepare myself for a political life characterised by both practical
political ability and concern for rapid social progress.'
By releasing the letter, Mr Clinton has avoided charges of a 'cover-up' but
runs the risk of having his economic and social programme - which attracted
much support in the initial phase of the Democratic campaign - subsumed by
the controversy over his Vietnam years.
Vice-President Dan Quayle was dogged by similar controversy in the 1988
presidential campaign, although unlike Mr Clinton he did not put himself
forward for the draft and served instead in the Indiana National Guard.

<TEXT>
Dr Carmen Lawrence, premier of Western Australia, plans to privatise the
state's two largest financial institutions as part of an economic package
announced yesterday, writes Bruce Jacques.
Dr Lawrence said the government's Insurance Office would be sold outright
and 40-49 per cent of R&amp;I Bank would be sold. But she said the economic
environment precluded immediate sales and the government would wait until
'the time was right'.
She did not specify whether the institutions, both involved in lending to
failed entrepreneurs, would be floated or offered for trade sale. There are
also question marks over their attractiveness. The R&amp;I Bank late last year
required a ADollars 70m (Pounds 28.7m) capital injection from the Reserve
Bank.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK aid to Africa hit by serious problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST two in five of Britain's aid-funded projects in Africa run into major
problems, including time and cost overruns, according to the Overseas
Development Administration (ODA) in its departmental report presented to
parliament yesterday.
'African economies have been typified by low skill levels, inferior
infrastructure, wasteful public expenditure and ineffective institutions,'
the report says.
As a result, the ODA has moved the balance of British aid to Africa towards
supporting economic reform programmes 'designed to improve the policy and
institutional environment,' the report says.
In an separate assessment of more than 200 completed projects from 1966 to
1989, the ODA also reveals that 45 per cent of the projects were either
failures, or only partially successful. Evaluation reports 'highlighted the
difficulty of succeeding at the project level if the policies of the
developing country at sector and national level are unsatisfactory.' The ODA
identifies a stark contrast with Asia, where significant problems are
confronted in just 10 per cent of projects.
When the value rather than the number of the problematical projects is
measured, the problem is even worse. In Africa, which accounted for projects
worth Pounds 324m assessed in 1989-90 and 1990-91, overruns and other
'major' problems affected projects worth about Pounds 140m - or about 42 per
cent. In contrast, Asia attracted funding worth Pounds 100m, but ran into
complications in just 10 per cent.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Japanese machinery orders drop sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE machinery orders, a key leading economic indicator, plunged in
December to their lowest level since February 1988, the Economic Planning
Agency (EPA) said yesterday.
The sharp decline - 13.9 per cent below a year ago excluding order for ships
and from electric power companies - adds to a growing weight of evidence
that Japan's economy is slowing sharply. The latest figures will increase
pressure on the authorities to cut interest rates.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, none the less said
yesterday that further monetary easing was not yet required, and that
companies were not facing a squeeze in funding.
Mr Mieno said underlying economic activity remained firm. He also poured
cold water on ideas put forth by some members of the ruling Liberal
Democratic party aimed at hastily propping up the stock market, where prices
have slumped for the past two years. Mr Mieno said any such ideas had to
take account of the long-term market impact.
Private machinery orders for the month came to Y696.4bn (Pounds 3bn), which
was 25.6 per cent below November's orders. Machinery orders were 9.4 per
cent lower in the last quarter of the year, compared to a year ago.
Orders from manufacturing industries were down by 11.2 per cent
month-on-month, or by 17.3 per cent compared with a year ago.
Non-manufacturing industry orders were down by 33.4 per cent on the month,
or 10.6 per cent from December 1990.
Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, said the sharp
decline in non-manufacturing orders was likely to disappoint government
officials who had been counting on this sector to hold up the economy.
Total machinery orders, from the public and private sectors, were down by 8
per cent compared with a year ago. For the year as a whole, total machinery
orders fell by 2.1 per cent, while private machinery orders excluding ships
and power equipment were down by 1.4 per cent.
The EPA survey indicated an upturn in machinery orders in the first quarter
of the year, with private orders excluding ships and power equipment
expected to grow by 18.3 per cent compared with the third quarter of 1991.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Minister's yen to end recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE people reached for their calculators yesterday after Mr Michio
Watanabe, the foreign minister, announced that knocking noughts off the yen
would lead the country out of 'recession'.
A redenomination, he argued, would revive the economy by stimulating demand
for new vending machines - of which there are some 5m in Japan - and paper.
The Bank of Japan was not amused and the Finance Ministry was embarrassed.
Past calls for a redenomination have been inspired more by pride than fiscal
policy. Many Japanese believe Y1.27 to the dollar sounds better than the
present rate of about Y127. Instead of just yen, according to Mr Watanabe's
plan, there would be yen, sen and rin, with 100 sen to the yen, and 10 rin
to the sen.
A similar system existed before the Second World War. Older Japanese people
believe that a return to the yen and sen would be a symbol of the country's
successful rise from the ashes. The word 'sen' is still sometimes used to
denote fractions of a yen, but the smallest denomination now is the flimsy
one yen coin.
Mr Watanabe is also deputy prime minister, a faction head of the ruling
Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and the next in line for a stint as prime
minister. He has a reputation as a straight talker, although this has led to
public apologies for insults to Americans, Chinese and Brazilians in recent
years.
In a public address, Mr Watanabe said redenomination should come as soon as
possible. It would revive the economy by creating new demand for a range of
currency-linked products, including accounting materials, vending machines,
paper and computers, he said.
Finance Ministry officials said revising the currency system would make no
real difference to the economy. An ailing Tokyo stock market drew some
encouragement from the idea but the paper industry was the only sector to
report an increase in stock prices.
A surprised Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, insisted that the
central bank was not considering a redenomination. He opposed the idea
because the costs would outweigh the benefits. He also cast doubt on another
of Mr Watanabe's statements, the suggestion that Japan's economic conditions
are 'similar' to those of the Great Depression. The country is officially
expecting 3.7 per cent growth this fiscal year, and 3.5 per cent next year.

THE New Zealand Reserve Bank said yesterday that the country's inflation
rate fell more sharply than expected last year, to levels not expected until
1993. The rate was down to minus 0.02 per cent in December, writes Terry
Hall in Wellington.
The bank, which was given responsibility for handling monetary policy in
pursuit of low inflation in 1988, was not supposed to achieve nil to 2 per
cent inflation until 1993.
Releasing the latest six monthly outlook yesterday, the bank governor, Dr
Don Brash, said that 'with hindsight, there could be some validity' in
accusations that the bank's monetary target settings had been too tight and
that this added to business difficulties.

THE South African government and the African National Congress have moved
closer to setting up an interim government for the transition to
post-apartheid democracy, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg.
The ANC yesterday released proposals on the interim administration, which
showed growing convergence with those of the Pretoria government, although
officials warned there were still many stumbling blocks to early agreement.
The ANC wants an all-party Interim Government Council to oversee
multi-racial elections and to supervise the security forces, the public
media and the budget.
This body, which would be appointed by the Convention for a Democratic South
Africa (Codesa) - the multi-party conference which is currently discussing
constitutional issues - could also take on additional powers 'considered
necessary for proper government'.
The ANC also proposed that what it calls a 'constituent assembly' should
both draw up a post-apartheid constitution and act as a legislature in the
interim period. This proposal parallels that of the government, which
proposes that an elected interim parliament draw up a constitution.
Where they differ is on the way such a body would be constituted.
The ANC insists that it be elected on the basis of one-man, one-vote, while
the government says this would provide insufficient protection for
minorities.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Libyan gesture to Paris on bombings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBYAN government has agreed to co-operate with France in an
investigation of the 1989 terrorist attack on a UTA jet liner over West
Africa but has again refused to extradite two Libyan agents accused of
plotting the Lockerbie disaster nine months earlier.
The Libyan authorities' stance was reported to the United Nations by Mr
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general. He pressed Libya on the
matter after a Security Council resolution last month that in effect called
for the handing over of the Lockerbie bombers to British or US justice.
The secretary general said Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, had
informed his special envoy that a judge was already appointed to try the
accused. If Britain and the US were dissatisfied with the Libyan judges they
should send judicial observers, Col Gadaffi advised.
In his report to the Security Council, the secretary general said he
subsequently got further clarification of the Libyan position in both the
UTA and Pan Am disasters, which took a total of 441 lives.
Libya now accepted French requests for all material evidence and access to
documents, as well as the assembling of witnesses, and the facilities for
contacts and meetings to investigate the UTA disaster.
This decision was taken because France - which did not seek extradition of
the suspected terrorists - acted 'in conformity with international law and
did not infringe upon the sovereignty of Libya,' according to Col Gadaffi.
The Libyan response came after reports that the suspects in the Pan Am
bombing had disappeared and might have been executed. However, this has been
denied and Mr Boutros-Ghali has made no mention of it.
Libya is expected now to invite a French magistrate to Tripoli to
investigate the downing of the French jet, rather than surrender four agents
France wants to question.
US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Libya was trying to
confuse the issue and 'remains unwilling to comply in any meaningful way'
with the UN resolution, Reuter reports from Washington.
'We fully expect Libya to comply with those demands. If Libya fails to
comply, as we've said before we consider all options open,' he said.
Libya, meanwhile, is preparing for a possible punitive western military
strike by hiding its mobile Soviet-made Scud missiles and strengthening its
air defences, a US official claimed.
'We've had considerable evidence that the Libyans are concerned about some
offensive military action,' said a government official, who added that the
Libyan actions had been evident for many weeks.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Cresson wins the round but party is reeling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS expected, France's conservative opposition parties failed in their
attempt this week to bring down the Socialist government of Mrs Edith
Cresson, when their censure motion on its handling of the George Habash
scandal fell far short of the required parliamentary majority.
But Mrs Cresson's government cannot easily shrug off the political damage
caused by the controversy over the ostensibly unauthorised hospitalisation
in Paris of the Palestinian leader. The affair has undoubtedly added to the
popular discontent with the administration of President Francois Mitterrand.
Winding up the debate with a combative defence of the government's record,
Mrs Cresson called on her Socialist supporters to mobilise 'for the next 400
days', to be ready for the general elections scheduled for the spring of
next year. It was a forceful performance, but the critical date for Mrs
Cresson's government is not 400 days away, but less than 40, in the local
and regional elections of March 22.
At the best of times, the Socialists would expect to be handicapped in these
elections, weighted in favour of the rural vote and conservative local
forces.
But to judge from recent opinion polls, that verdict is likely to be severe.
The Socialists' share of the vote may slide to below an average of 20 per
cent.
If that happens, they could no longer claim to be the largest single party
in France. The pressure on President Mitterrand to replace Mrs Cresson with,
say, Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, might then become
intense. It might become hard to resist pressure for early general
elections.
Socialist support in the Rhone-Alpes region, according to a survey by the
BVA polling institute, is likely to fall to 18 per cent, 10 percentage
points less than in the previous regional elections of 1986. In the Auvergne
region, the Socialist vote could drop from 30.8 per cent to 19.5 per cent.
In the Ile de France region round Paris, the Socialist vote would drop even
further, to 16 per cent, compared with 28.6 per cent in 1986.
These losses would not be reflected in a corresponding swing to the
traditional conservative parties. In all three these regions, the Gaullists
and the centre-right UDF are together likely to lose voting share: in the
Rhone-Alpes it would drop from 41.9 per cent to 39 per cent, in Auvergne
from 46.5 to 42 per cent. The big gains, according to the polls, would be
made by the protest-vote parties: the extreme right-wing National Front and
the ecological movements.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Saviour of Serbs forced to try to save himself: Beleaguered
Milosevic is abandoning the militant nationalists he promoted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIA'S president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, is trying to stave off mounting
opposition within his republic by turning his back on the militant
nationalists who fought his war by proxy. In doing so, the politician who
built his career as the saviour of all Serbs - wherever they lived - has
turned inwards to Serbia itself.
He now condemns as a warmonger Mr Milan Babic, the leader of Krajina, the
self-proclaimed Serbian republic and enclave in Croatia. But no mention is
made of the fact that the war was waged on the pretext of saving Croatia's
Serbs in what was termed a hostile state.
The dispute with Mr Babic highlights the change in Mr Milosevic's tactics, a
change dictated partly by economic reasons. Faced with the expense of the
war, and financing the federal army, Mr Milosevic last month dropped the
idea of uniting all Serbs in one state. It appears to be only a question of
time before he calls for an independent Serbia, abandoning the idea of
salvaging a Yugoslav federation.
In addition, Serbia's ruling Socialists, instead of co-opting the
opposition, marginalised it during the seven-month war through their tight
grip over the media. Any party or activists in the anti-war movement were
denounced as traitors.
However, resistance to forced mobilisation in Serbia, and western pressure,
contributed to Mr Milosevic's shift in policy. Now promoting himself as the
man of peace, he is trying to bring the militant nationalist elements to
heel. But even if he succeeds in this, it will not lessen the price of the
war borne by Serbia.
On the home front, Mr Milosevic has to contend with rising dissatisfaction
over the economy. The government has frozen the price of some staples but
the average monthly wage equivalent to about Dollars 80 barely covers
essentials.
The official inflation rate of 3,000 per cent is believed by economists in
Belgrade to be well below the actual figure. Industrial output has fallen by
at least 30 per cent in relation to last year's already low output. These
indications are important for Mr Milosevic's political base which is
anchored in the economy, as many key factory directors were appointed after
he came to power in 1987.
The question now is whether he can maintain control of a republic
confronting imminent economic collapse.
His call for peace in January temporarily silenced the opposition. But now,
this unpredictable leader faces an economically devastated and war-weary
Serbia. More importantly, many people are asking what the war gained. Says
Mr Dragoljub Micunovic, president of the opposition Democratic Party:
'Serbia could have been where it is now (on the verge of independence),
without the victims of war'.
Yesterday, in just three hours, more than 2,000 people signed a petition
sponsored by the Democratic Party demanding Mr Milosevic's resignation. The
Serbian Renewal Movement, under Mr Vuk Draskovic, has supported this
initiative, and called a rally on March 9 - anniversary of the suppression
of anti-government demonstrations - to press for the Serbian president to
quit. The stakes are high for Mr Milosevic and March could be his most
crucial month.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Reading between the budget lines: Andrew Hill combs the
Community draft text for hidden meanings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL publication of the EC's new budget plans will begin a new round of
that traditional Brussels game, Hunt the Nuance, with industry and
competition officials leading the chase.
The quarry is the controversial plan to use budget funds to improve
industrial competitiveness. The Commission is calling for an annual increase
of Ecu3.5bn by 1997 in the amount it spends to help industry adapt to change
and increased competition from outside the EC.
That money will be channelled through a number of existing programmes: some
40 per cent will be targeted through research and development, 30 per cent
through training programmes, and the rest through 'trans-European networks'
 -pan-European infrastructure projects in, for example, the
telecommunications and transport sectors.
In outline, this seems relatively uncontroversial. The direction of research
policy will be made more responsive to the demands of industry; social funds
will be used not only to cure long-term and youth unemployment, but to
prevent it - by retraining workers for new tasks; efficient trans-European
networks will help the internal market, and should aid cohesion between the
rich north and poor south of the Community as infrastructure is improved.
There is even a measure of consensus on this between Brussels' industry and
competition camps, often said to be at loggerheads. They agree there are
risks inherent in the plan; both sides accept the need for EC research and
development programmes to be guided more from the bottom - that is,
industry; both say that the developments are an advance for EC industrial
policy, although competition officials, unsurprisingly, concede only that
the proposals mark a 'half-step' forward.
Agreeing an acceptable package has not been easy, however, particularly for
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, who would have opposed the
budget had his fellow-commissioners not made amendments at the 11th hour.
Summing up his concerns, he said: 'I would never have agreed had I thought
it (the budget) could be a vehicle for an intrusive industrial policy
designed to pick winners or prop up lame ducks. I'm finally satisfied that
it can't be used for that purpose.'
In particular, Sir Leon believes he has fought off the possibility of the
Ecu3.5bn being earmarked for a separate 'industrial reconversion fund', and
has limited the chance that regional funds could be used as instruments of
industrial policy.
He and his advisers are also pleased that they have preserved the
'horizontal' nature of EC industrial policy, with funds theoretically
available across all industrial sectors and the whole Community.
The text makes no reference to specific sectors - such as motors textiles,
electronics or defence - which might benefit from the extra cash.
Sections on research and development will refer to backing specific
technologies, rather than industries; the training funds should be available
through centres or for specified training programmes.
But these may be artificial victories for the competition camp. Senior
industry officials claim there was never any intention to set aside a fund,
nor to specify the destination of the new money, for example.
As with any piece of Commission prose, the key lies in the interpretation of
the text, a task which had begun before the budget was agreed. The direction
of the debate is unlikely to please the pro-competition lobby.
On Monday, Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, pointed out that
although specific sectors would not be mentioned in the budget's provisions,
it was obvious that certain industries - he singled out cars - could
legitimately claim support for retraining workers.
He and his senior officials are pleading for more attention to economic
reality and slightly less to what they claim are sometimes inflexible
competition rules.
Advocates of a robust competition policy argue that too much flexibility
could encourage laziness.
As became clear in Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission
president, will also press for full exploitation of the policy. In spite of
his protestations, there are still fears that the richer member states - in
particular, France and Italy - will be most expert at lobbying for central
support.
Industry and competition advocates agree that the debate is far from over.
Indeed, it is likely to become even more heated in the coming months, both
because the criteria for spending the extra cash have to be thrashed out in
Brussels and because the squeals from a recession-hit European industry are
probably going to get more strident as the hunters close on their prey.

SWEDEN'S prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, yesterday hit out at Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, Volvo's executive chairman, over the motor group's proposed
SKr38.7bn (Pounds 3.7bn) acquisition of Procordia, the Swedish food and
health care concern.
In a forthright intervention into Sweden's biggest corporate power struggle,
Mr Bildt insisted that his government, which has a 42.7 per cent stake in
Procordia, opposed the principle of the deal.
'It is not just a question of the price (of the Volvo share offer). It is a
question of getting an industrial structure that we can believe in,' he said
in an interview.
Declaring that the government was discussing 'alternative solutions' to
ensure the company's long-term future, Mr Bildt criticised the Volvo
chairman's assertiveness. 'Mr Gyllenhammar said he was ready to force the
deal through against the government. There is no way that can be done.'
The government's reaction to the affair, said Mr Bildt, 'illustrated the end
of the old Swedish corporatist way of industrial restructuring. Things are
different. The deal has demonstrated that.'
Commenting on Volvo's pre-emptive announcement of the takeover two weeks
ago, Mr Bildt said: 'We do things somewhat differently under this
government, and that I think might be one cause of the troubles there have
been. They (Volvo) took it for granted that everything they did would be
automatically approved of by the government.'
Volvo, already the owner of a 42.7 per cent stake in Procordia, has claimed
that the link-up would produce industrial benefits, but is understood to be
interested above all in access to Procordia's cash flow.
However, Mr Bildt said: 'It is difficult to see any synergy effects. . . .
There might be other ways of satisfying their demands for cash flow.'

'IF PEACE breaks out in Yugoslavia, or if the Middle East negotiations
succeed, the European Community will be called on to contribute massively to
reconstruction in those regions', says a senior Community budget official.
'But we have no idea when this might be.'
The official was illustrating the peculiar budgetary problem for the EC in
trying to foresee the unforeseeable five years ahead. Unlike governments
which can fine-tune their national budgets year by year, the Community tries
to lock itself into five-year plans, the second of which was proposed by the
Commission yesterday.
These five-year plans are not set in concrete. The EC's 'financial
perspectives' for 1988-92 has so far been revised five times through a
cumbersome and time-consuming procedure. But all these revisions were
prompted by foreign policy demands on the Community, arising from the Gulf
war, Kurdish refugees' plight, changes in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
These demands have led the Commission to propose:
Creation of a separate major budget category for EC external action.
A near-doubling of money for EC external action from Ecu3.6bn (Pounds
2.56bn) this year to Ecu6.3bn in 1997.
A new reserve, which will rise to Ecu900m by 1997, to make provision for
possible default by dubious borrowers like ex-Soviet republics and for
unforeseen foreign crises.
The Community is steadily building financial expectations on the part of its
eastern neighbours. Its so-called Phare programme for central Europe, the
Balkan and Baltic states is mainly project aid and does not carry long-term
commitments.
Equally, Brussels has carefully avoided including specific financial
protocols in its recent association accords with Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary.
But these agreements promise the central Europeans 'decisive support' in
their moves to market economies.
The Commission also wants to reinforce its diplomatic service.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Tories unite with Labour to attack EC budget plan: Hurd says
Delors is bidding for a larger rise than is justified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STRASBOURG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative and Labour parties were yesterday united in their criticism
of European Commission plans to raise European Community budget revenue by a
third over the next five years.
The determined opposition in Westminster arose even though Mr Jacques
Delors, the Commission president, said the plan was 'the minimum necessary'
to make a success of the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union.
Mr Delors made a strenuous effort to head off a row over the UK's rebate on
its budget payments, and to pre-empt criticism of Commission plans to help
industry restructure.
But in London, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said he did not believe
there was a case for raising the resources' ceiling available to the EC over
the next five years, because there was room for growth within the existing
ceiling.
'Mr Delors is bidding for more than is justified. We will go into a whole
range of Community meetings lasting several months, and at the end of the
day all of this has to be agreed by all of us,' he said on BBC radio.
For Labour, Mr Chris Smith, an opposition Treasury spokesman, said reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy would he negotiations, and he emphasised the
need for reform of the regional and structural funds, to benefit British
regions.
Brussels wants the budget to rise from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 47.4bn) this year
to Ecu87.5bn (at 1992 prices) in 1997 to accommodate greater spending on
regional aid, foreign policy, farm reform and a strengthened research effort
to sharpen industrial competitiveness.
Mr Delors, presenting the 1993-97 plan to the European Parliament, recalled
that the first five year plan, agreed in 1988, had made possible the
achievements of the single market, more even EC development through regional
spending, and financial stability. At least equal effort was now needed for
European union to succeed, he said. 'We must implement the agreement of
Maastricht.'
Anticipating resistance to the size of the increase, Mr Delors pointedly
reminded the 12 heads of government that 'half of the rise comes about
because of political commitments you undertook, and the other half you would
have to spend anyway' if the EC did not exist.
At Maastricht in December, the 12 agreed to increase substantially fiscal
transfers to the four poorest member states - Spain, Ireland, Portugal and
Greece. This accounts for half the proposed Ecu21bn increase.
The other three priorities share the rest, but if member states were acting
individually, the cost of helping eastern Europe, agriculture and industrial
restructuring 'would still have to be met', Mr Delors argued.
Downing Street officials yesterday stressed, however, that although Mr John
Major, the prime minister, had agreed at the Maastricht summit to the
cohesion fund to help poorer EC countries, he had not signed up to spending
on this scale.
The UK is a net contributor to the budget despite the 1985 rebate
arrangement which Germany - by far the biggest net contributor - is now
questioning.
Mr Delors confirmed that the UK rebate would not be re-examined until after
the British general election, due at the latest by July. 'The Commission
does not intend to upset that (election) process through its proposals.'
UK officials stressed that any change in the rebate arrangement would
require the unanimity of the 12, so that Britain could veto it.
Mr Delors strongly defended his controversial industrial restructuring
plans, vehemently insisting that 'we are not talking about French
interventionism'.
There would be 'equality of access' to the new 'bottom-up' attempt to make
research more responsive to industrial innovation, and an independent
scientific committee would decide where the EC should spend
'competitiveness' funds which would rise to Ecu3.5bn in 1997 at today's
prices.

FT  13 FEB 92 / British Aerospace plans to cut another 2,350 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, DAVID WHITE and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is to cut 2,350 jobs at five aircraft plants, reflecting
reductions and delays in defence contracts and the impact of the recession
on the airline business.
The latest cuts, due to be carried out this year, mainly affect
administrative and technical staff and follow the loss of 10,000 production
jobs at BAe over the past two years. The group now employs 116,000 people.
BAe said it hoped to achieve the cuts through voluntary means but did not
rule out compulsory redundancies.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour party's employment spokesman, described the news
as 'a devastating blow'.
Union officials accused the government of inaction in the face of demands to
help defence businesses diversify into other sectors.
In the House of Commons, Labour MPs called for 'action, not words' when Mr
Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, rejected demands for new
policies to counter the rising tide of redundancies in manufacturing
industry.
The BAe announcement came a week after 450 jobs were cut at the group's
guided weapons division. Up to 1,000 more jobs at that division depend on
the group clinching a new air-combat missile project for the RAF.
Worst affected by yesterday's announcement is the civil aircraft site at
Hatfield, Hertfordshire, where 830 of 3,400 jobs will be lost. Seventy jobs
will also be shed at Woodford, Cheshire. The financial problems of small
airlines and fierce competition has damaged BAe's regional aircraft
business.
A further 550 jobs are to go at BAe's main military aircraft plant at
Warton, Lancashire, and a similar number at Brough, Humberside. Work on
Tornado jets at Warton will come to an end this summer unless BAe wins a
fresh contract from Saudi Arabia.
BAe is also shedding 350 employees at Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, whom it
had planned to move to Farnborough, Hampshire, when the Kingston plant
closes later this year. The company said they were no longer needed.
BAe is about half way through a programme of cuts in its military aircraft
division which it announced in 1990. This will reduce the number of
production sites from six to four and cut employment from more than 26,000
to about 21,000. Its Preston plant in Lancashire will close next year.
Preliminary 1991 results are due to be presented next Wednesday. BAe said in
September that these were likely to show pre-tax profits of at least Pounds
150m, excluding exceptional items, but that rationalisation costs alone
would be about Pounds 250m. In 1990 it had pre-tax earnings of Pounds 376m.
Mr Michael Jack, a social security minister, last night apologised after
suggesting in a BBC radio interview that the redundant BAe workers would be
'liberated' by the company's decision. He said that he used an 'inadvertent
and unfortunate phrase'.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, has written to the prime
minister to complain that Mr Jack's comments would be 'deeply offensive to
every unemployed person in Britain'.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Pressure increases to solve problems of fraud trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, ROBERT RICE, RICHARD DONKIN and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government to find a solution to the problems of complex and
unmanageable fraud trials increased last night when the Labour party
announced that it would streamline the role of agencies responsible for
dealing with fraud.
A Labour government would consider appointing specialist legal advisers to
juries involved in complex fraud cases. It would also consider giving
prosecuting authorities the opportunity to choose between civil and criminal
proceedings, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the party's City affairs spokeswoman, said.
However, it would not move to end jury trial in fraud cases, she said, as
this would undermine 'basic civil rights'.
Ms Mowlam argued that there was much duplication of effort among the various
bodies with fraud responsibilities. These include the Serious Fraud Office,
the Crown Prosecution Service, the Department of Trade and Industry, the
City self-regulatory organisations and the Stock Exchange.
The Serious Fraud Office confirmed that it was pressing the government for
its officers to have interviewing powers consistent with those of DTI
inspectors. Some of the biggest SFO prosecutions, including the Guinness and
Blue Arrow cases, have had to rely heavily on DTI inspectors' reports.
Giving these powers to the SFO could reduce the time spent preparing cases
for trial.
Mrs Barbara Mills, outgoing director of the SFO, is also known to believe
there is scope for improvement in the use of preliminary hearings before
fraud trials.
In the Commons, Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, said Lord
Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, was reviewing court procedures.
Mr Redwood assured the House that the government would take 'every action to
bring villains to book'.
Earlier, Lord Mackay had acknowledged the need for urgent attention to be
given to the issue but had warned that there was no easy solution. He agreed
with comments made by Mr Justice Henry, the judge in the second Guinness
trial which collapsed on Tuesday, about the need for cheaper and quicker
serious fraud trials.
He said he would resist pressure to scrap juries in complex fraud cases  - a
recommendation of the 1986 Roskill Fraud Trials Committee.
Pressure on the government to act is likely to increase further later this
week when the year-long Blue Arrow trial ends. The jury is still considering
its verdicts, having been sent out on Tuesday morning.
With costs estimated at about Pounds 40m, Blue Arrow is by far the most
expensive criminal prosecution brought in the UK.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, one of Britain's most successful but more enigmatic corporate giants,
has appointed its first chief operating officer and forgot to tell anyone
outside the company. Robert Faircloth, 54, the new occupant of the post,
will report directly to chief executive Alan Jackson and will be based at
BTR's Silvertown House headquarters in London.
Edgar Sharp, 58, executive director America, and Mike Smith, 51, executive
director Europe, will report to Faircloth. Until now BTR has had a
relatively flat corporate structure but the promotion of Faircloth, who held
the same European title as Smith, suggests that the company's management
structure is becoming more hierarchical. Hanson, for example, has four chief
operating officers, two of whom are based in the US.
Faircloth's appointment was made on November 22, but word has only leaked
out publicly in the past few days. BTR had notified its own staff internally
in November, but said that it saw no need to publicise the fact by reporting
it to the Stock Exchange.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NatWest, one of Britain's top two high street banks, has completed the
rejuvenation of its top management team with Martin Gray's promotion to head
its core UK branch banking operation.
The 45-year-old Gray was the logical candidate to become chief executive, UK
branch business (UKBB), since he served as general manager UK branch
business under Derek Wanless who was chief executive financial services
(UKFS). Just over a fortnight ago Wanless, aged 43, was made one of two new
deputy group chief executives and given considerable new responsibilities.
Under the latest reorganisation groups, UKFS disappears and although Gray
takes on the main responsibilities, several subsidiaries, such as Lombard
North Central, Ulster Bank and Isle of Man Bank, become part of Bernard
Horn's international business portfolio. Trevor Blackler, aged 52, currently
deputy general manager UKBB, becomes general manager, operations of Gray's
new empire.
Like Wanless, Gray is a Northerner. He was born in Leeds and started his
career there. However, unlike Wanless, who got a first class honours degree
from Cambridge, Gray has worked his way up from counter clerk.
*****
S G WARBURG has picked David Rowland, chairman and chief executive of
Sedgwick Group, Europe's biggest insurance broker, to join the board as a
non-executive.
Rowland, 58, fills a gap after both Tony Salomon, former president and chief
executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Gualtharus (Hugh)
Kraijenhoff, supervisory board chairman of Akzo, retired last year.
Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, describes Rowland as 'a businessman
of very considerable distinction in a very relevant area of business'.
Rowland, who has just produced the radical report on reform at Lloyd's, was
at the helm of Stewart Wrightson for seven years until shortly after it
merged with Willis Faber in 1987. He has known Warburg well for many years;
S G Warburg's then parent, Mercury Securities, held a 29 per cent stake in
Stewart Wrightson until 1985.
Other non-executive appointments have been announced:
Brian Firmin at GREYFRIARS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.

closed only 4.63 lower at 1,678.92. The FAZ index also fell 4.63 to 684.09
at midsession.
There was movement, but little conviction in the big blue chips as turnover
rose from DM5.4bn to DM5.8bn. Chemicals fell back, Hoechst losing the most
with a DM2.80 decline to DM251.
Carmakers varied, Daimler and Volkswagen falling DM4.80 to DM734, and DM3.50
to DM337.50 respectively but BMW rising DM5 to DM546.50.
The big price changes came in smaller companies with Puma, the sports goods
producer controlled by Aritmos of Sweden, up DM45, or 22 per cent to DM250
while Ava, the retailer, put on DM95, or 15 per cent to DM740.
Puma's rise followed a statement that it had returned to profit in 1991
after several difficult years. Ava racked up a market turnover of DM299m,
placing it sixth in the German top 10. It rose on rumours that Asko, which
said a week ago that it owned more than 50 per cent of Ava, was buying up
Ava stock on the open market. Asko denied this later.
PARIS remained locked in a narrow trading range and the big moves were seen
in less liquid stocks. The CAC-40 index ended down 2.46 to 1,861.60 in light
turnover of FFr1.4bn.
Perrier continued to rise as institutions sought to build up small but
crucial stakes in the hope of selling out to the highest bidder in the event
of a takeover battle. The stock added FFr18 to FFr1,548 with 77,025 shares
traded.
However there were reports that the Cob had decided that Perrier did not
have the right to sell its treasury stock to St Louis. If this were the
case, analysts said it was likely that a Paris court, due to meet on
February 25, would annul the sale of the 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier,
thus facilitating Nestle's bid and offering the Agnelli camp a graceful
exit.
Among second-liners, Chargeurs rose FFr56 or 5.1 per cent to FFr1,150 with
42,250 shares traded on news that the UK satellite television venture BSkyB,
in which Chargeurs has a 15.9 per cent stake, could soon be profitable.
Chargeurs also said that it had entered a cooperation agreement with an
Italian textiles group.
The builder Spie Batignolles jumped FFr19.50 or 6.1 per cent to FFr337.50
with 25,675 shares traded on talk that Schneider might sell off part of its
stake in Spie in the wake of the latter's poor results.
MILAN closed lower as traders squared their positions ahead of the close of
the monthly trading account on Friday. Dealers estimated that 60 per cent of
the monthly options contracts had been abandoned. The Comit index fell 2.88
to 538.33 in turnover estimated at around Tuesday's L87.7bn.
Among industrials, Fiat fell L38 to L4,937 while Pirelli eased L9 to L1,122
as its plants were halted by a four-hour strike.
Dealers reported some buying interest in Generali from domestic mutual
funds, which pushed the stock up by L80 to L30,880 at the official close.
But the stock eased after hours.
AMSTERDAM was steady, as the CBS Tendency index closed unchanged at 121.9.
Heineken lost Fl 2.60 to Fl 170.00 mainly due to profit - taking. Trading
group Borsumij continued its strong advance, gaining Fl 2.00 to Fl 64.70
after it announced good 1992 profit prospects earlier in the week.
MADRID saw strong volume in the electrical and construction sectors. The
general index finished 0.47 up at 259.51. January CPI figures are released
today and most observers have forecast a rise of 1.5 per cent, lower than
previous predictions, which should give a stimulus to the market. Hopes of a
cut in interest rates also lifted prices.
ZURICH saw Swiss interest rates steady to marginally higher and the SPI
index fell 1.5 to 1,125.5. Banks, traditionally sensitive to interest rate
changes, closed lower. UBS bearers fell SFr40 to SFr3,810 and CS Holding by
SFr20 to SFr2,000.
STOCKHOLM had another look at Tuesday's Ericsson results, concentrated on
the gloomy outlook for 1992 and put the B shares down SKr3 to SKr114 in
turnover of SKr62m. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 3.8 to 953.6 in
turnover down from SKr405m to SKr324m.
HELSINKI hit a second consecutive 1992 high with the Hex index 1.7 higher at
896.7, as did VIENNA, the 18-share ATX index rising 2.04 to 1,033.21.
ISTANBUL corrected falls of the last two days, the 75-share index closing up
83.66, or 2 per cent, to 4,266.62.

FT  13 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Denmark puts backbone into Nordic
performance - But it is facing a difficult start to the 1991 results season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
While other Nordic markets battled, rose and retreated in varying degrees of
disarray through 1991, Danish equities performed relatively well, with the
all-share index increasing by 12 per cent over the year - a rise only
moderated by worries in the financial sector.
Brokers expect that 1992 will also be bullish. However, the impending 1991
results season will have to go through an uninspiring start, on banking
performance, and then reflect the high cost of international ambitions in
the insurance industry before it gets to the more stable core of the Danish
equity market.
Shipping shares, dominated by the AP Moller companies, D/S 1912 and D/S
Svenborg and Lauritzen Holding, rose by 31.4 per cent in Denmark last year,
and industrials, which historically have underperformed any other sector
except the banks, gained 18.4 per cent, reflecting the current export-led
recovery in the country's economic fortunes and a relative improvement in
the profitability of manufacturing exporters.
Seven out of the 10 best performing shares were industrials, including two
of the heavyweights: Carlsberg, the brewer involved in a major deal with
Allied-Lyons in the UK, which gained 54 per cent, and Novo Nordisk, the
pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes group, 51 per cent stronger.
In the medical field, two smaller health care companies, Radiometer,
manufacturer of blood analysis equipment, up 71 per cent, and Coloplast,
colostomy bags and similar types of medical equipment, up 95 per cent,
performed well, as did the enzymes specialist Chr. Hansens Laboratorier.
The field was led by Brdr. Hartmann, a small company specialising in
recycling of industrial wastes, which rose performers were Sophus Berendsen
and the shipping companies, Lauritzen and D/S 1912. Berendsen, which
controls the UK-listed Rentokil, acquired the linen service business of
Sweden's Electrolux in Sweden, France and Holland last year to become
Europe's third largest linen service company.
Copenhagen's equity market was supported generally by a satisfactory
development in some of the main economic indicators, and Denmark, unlike its
Nordic neighbours, was spared the sight of collapsing banks.
Inflation, at 2.4 per cent, was lower than in any other European country.
Danish export companies have gained market share, especially in Germany and
the other Nordic countries. The current account balance of payments, in
deficit for 27 years until 1990, is now in surplus of about DKr14bn (Dollars
2.3bn), or just over 1 per cent of GDP. The trade surplus, including both
visibles and invisibles, is now a huge DKr50bn, about six per cent of GDP.
There is no indication that 1992 will see a break in these trends, although
exports may be dampened slightly by slower growth in Germany. The GDP growth
rate, according to the government's forecast, will be about 2.5 per cent.
Last year saw lively new issue activity. Some 12 new companies were listed,
including Norway's Hafslund Nycomed, the shares of which are now traded more
heavily in Copenhagen than in Oslo. Total new capital raised was DKr12.6bn,
about one third of this accounted for issues by Novo Nordisk and Baltica
Insurance last summer.
Last year was a relatively poor year for Danish bank shares but still
marginally positive, with the sector index up by only 1.5 per cent, less,
probably, because of its own constituents' prospects than because
international investors moved out of Nordic bank shares, including Danish
ones, as a result of events in Norway, Sweden and Finland.
The banks' 1991 results are not expected to be exciting. While securities
trading business should provide a cushion, loan-loss provisions are still
high; and, as a new departure, the Danish financial sector authorities have
asked the banks to keep a careful watch on the quality of their loan
portfolios, and on the level of their loss provisions.
It was a bad year for the insurers, which showed up in the index for
investment and property companies, where the holding companies controlling
the Baltica, Hafnia and Topdanmark insurance companies are listed. The index
fell by 14.3 per cent.
Hafnia's and Baltica's shares have been affected by Hafnia's (unsuccessful)
attempt to gain control of Baltica Holding, and Hafnia's bid, together with
Norway's UNI Storebrand, to gain control of Sweden's Skandia. The
considerable financial costs of these two ventures will help to push Hafnia
into the red for 1991.

FT  13 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on lower
yen and bond prices
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOWER yen and bond prices, and worries about developments in an alleged
bribery scandal discouraged market participants, and the Nikkei average lost
ground in low activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei, which lost 287.60 on Monday, gave up another 277.88 to close at
21,541.64. The index opened at the day's high of 21,781.44 but fell on
small-lot arbitrage-related selling, hitting the session's low of 21,475.60
in the afternoon.
Volume rose to 170m shares from 137m. Dealers continued to dominate trading,
though some light basket buying by foreigners was noted. News yesterday that
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed in principle to parliamentary
testimony by key figures in the Kyowa bribery scandal raised fears of
political repercussions.
Market participants were cautious about the near - term outlook for
equities. 'Domestic institutions are done with trading for the year,' said
Mr Dan Kerrigan at County NatWest, adding that large moves in the market
before the March book closing were unlikely.
Declines led advances by 823 to 139, with 129 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks slipped 18.13 to 2,428.72, and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.38 to 1,219.58.
All first section sectors, except paper stocks, lost ground. In the morning,
some shares were supported by comments from Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign
minister, that Japan should carry out a redenomination of the yen to boost
the economy.
Mr Watanabe said in a speech on Tuesday that redenomination would help
create new jobs and demand through replacement of computers and vending
machines.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said that his ministry was not
considering such a move. Nevertheless, paper and printing shares gained on
prospects of new money being printed.
Oji Paper advanced Y7 to Y862, but Dai Nippon Ink surrendered an early rise
to profit-taking, finishing unaltered at Y1,490.
A total of 22 issues reached new lows since January last year, including
Fujitsu, which lost Y12 to Y770. It said that unconsolidated pre-tax profits
for the current year to March would be down 60 per cent, while consolidated
figures are forecast to fall by 80 per cent.
Other high-technology issues were also weak, with NEC declining Y20 to
Y1,150 and Hitachi falling Y17 to Y877.
Precision instrument makers continued to fall after last week's decision by
a US district court to charge Minolta Camera for patent infringement.
Minolta ended Y30 cheaper at Y470 and Nikon relinquished Y29 to Y821.
In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 264.58 to 23,217.15 in volume of 108.5m
shares.
Roundup
SENTIMENT was mixed in the Pacific Rim, as Hong Kong reversed Tuesday's
decline and Seoul fell for the third consecutive day.
HONG KONG rebounded strongly at the close, almost wiping out Tuesday's
59-point correction. The Hang Seng index climbed 57.91 or 1.24 per cent to
4,732.43. Turnover decreased to HKDollars 1.9bn from HKDollars 2.4bn.
Laggards were sought, Hong Kong &amp; China Gas rising 70 cents to HKDollars
13.30 and topping the most active list. The utility was also supported by
rumours of a covered warrant issue and strong earnings growth.
SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrials index ended
2.82 lower at 1,521.10, in turnover of SDollars 133.5m, against SDollars
167.4m.
City Developments fell 14 cents to SDollars 4.12 in heavy volume on rumours,
later denied, that a leading member of the Kwek family, the biggest
shareholders in CityDev, was seriously ill.
KUALA LUMPUR pulled back from the day's lows on bargain hunting. The
composite index lost 3.70 at 600.75 in turnover of 61.9m (91.6m).
SEOUL's decline continued, the composite index dipping 10.09 to 664.23 in
turnover of Won341.5bn. Concern over possible bankruptcies of small
companies hung over trading.
TAIWAN ended slightly lower as the correction to last month's gains
continued. The weighted index shed 10.44 to 5,061.60 as turnover fell to
TDollars 32.8bn from TDollars 47.4bn.
AUSTRALIA lost ground in early trading on publication of disappointing
December retail sales figures, but recovered well later. The All Ordinaries
index gained a net 1.7 at 1,617.1 in a turnover of ADollars 256.4m.
TNT rose 8 cents to ADollars 1.85 following reports that Federal Express was
considering restructuring. News Corp fell 8 cents to ADollars 15.70. After
hours, it announced a 38 per cent rise in half-year profits, better than
market expectations.
NEW ZEALAND showed further improvement but ended off the day's high: the
NZSE - 40 index put on 9.72 to 1,477.64 in turnover of NZDollars 23.5m.
Telecom and Fletcher Challenge both gained 4 cents to NZDollars 2.39 and
NZDollars 3.46.
MANILA recovered on local sentiment: the composite index gained 12.69 to
1,225.48 in turnover of 155m pesos.
BANGKOK gained in active trading, the SET index adding 14.53 at 801.44 in
turnover of Bt11bn. Banks were strong on a half-point cut in prime rates
from tomorrow.
BOMBAY soared to a record intra-day high of 2,337.75 before closing at
2,305.38, up 31.91 or 1.4 per cent.

The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicators, the most widely used
overall guide to the course of the wool market,on February 12 reached 597
cents a Kg., exactly back to the closing level reached at the end of last
season. Prices for some wools are well above that basis and others fall far
short of it, but there is no doubt that the wool market is now seen as
nearly certain to reach new peaks in the free market era. Demand is
particularly strong for middle range categories, where drought has
supplemented production cuts by farmers.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were
struggling last night to find common ground enabling them to agree a cut in
production that will support world prices.
Meanwhile the oil market took fright at the hard task confronting the
thirteen ministers. Oil prices dipped on reports of unease at the meeting
when North Sea Brent crude for March delivery dropped by 22 1/2 cents to
Dollars 18.27 1/2 a barrel.
The producer's club has focused on the need for a cut in output of 1.2m
barrels a day to 1.5m b/d, representing a 5 to 7 per cent cut on overall
production of 24.2m b/d. But ministers were in tense negotiations over the
details last night.
Saudi Arabia is being pressed by some smaller producers to agree to a new
round of production quotas which shows meaningful cuts in individual
countries' production. The kingdom has in the past preferred a more informal
approach and, in any case, insists that any new quotas should be based on
current capacity rather than historical production.
Saudi Arabia is more sanguine over the outlook for oil demand in the second
quarter and puts the call on Opec oil at 23m, and doers not want to cut its
own output much more than 500,000 b/d from the present 8.5m b/d. On the
other hand, Mr Celestino Armas, Venezuelan oil minister, believes demand
will be lower than 22m b/d and that Opec should cut output accordingly.
Ministers from countries such as Venezuela and Algeria are under intense
political pressure from home to secure an agreement that will give some
fillip to oil prices. Many traders believe that a cut of 1.5m b/d will do
little more than support prices and that the producers must cut by much more
if they are to boost prices during the traditionally weak second quarter.

<TEXT>
A PUBLIC inquiry into plans by Hamilton Oil to build a gas processing plant
and oil terminal at Point of Ayr in North Wales is likely to delay the
Pounds 1bn project by at least six months.
Hamilton said this week that it was disappointed at the Welsh Office's
decision to go ahead with the inquiry and that it would be looking at
alternative sites.
Hamilton, which was acquired by Australia's BHP last year, had been looking
to start production of oil and gas from its Hamilton field, off the coast of
North Wales by late 1994. The company has a 45 per cent stake in the
project, with Lasmo holding 30 per cent and Monument Oil &amp; Gas 25 per cent.
Mr Ed Blair, Hamilton's president, says the company is now looking to the
middle of 1995 before output will begin.
The Hamilton field is estimated to contain some 750bn cubic feet of gas and
between 100m and 200m barrels of oil. Mr Blair said the field would produce
200m cu ft of gas a day - all of which has been sold to PowerGen for its
planned Connah's Quay power station. In addition, it will pump 30,000 to
50,000 barrels a day of oil.
The field will be developed with three production platforms: two for gas and
one for oil, with two pipelines taking the gas and oil onshore to the
processing plant. 'The water is relatively shallow, it's close to shore and
close to its market, which makes it fairly quick and cheap to develop,' said
Mr Blair.
The New York Mercantile Exchange plans to launch unleaded gasoline futures
within the next six months, reports Reuter from New York.

<TEXT>
THE COLOMBIAN coffee authorities have reduced the price paid to growers by 5
per cent in response to very low international prices, writes Sarita Kendall
in Bogota. This is an unusual move for Colombia, which has tried to maintain
domestic purchase prices despite the large deficit incurred by the National
Coffee Fund.
Mr Jorge Cardenas, manager of the coffee growers' federation, said it was a
critical moment for coffee on both the internal and foreign fronts: this
year's harvest is running at about 16.7m bags (60 kg each), the highest
ever, and though Colombia hopes to export some 13m bags, stocks will
increase.
The federation and the regional coffee organisations are to pare spending to
a minimum, while growers will be encouraged to renovate plantations in order
to reduce the area harvested during the next two years. The aim is to cut
production by 500,000 bags.

investment'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICA is expected to double its annual investments in the petroleum
industry over the next four years, taking advantage of new flows of foreign
capital into the region.
Mr Alvaro Teixeira, Secretary General of the Association of Latin American
State Petroleum companies, said yesterday that new investments in
exploration and production between 1992 and 1996 are likely to total Dollars
75bn, an annual average of Dollars 18.75bn, not including the petrochemical
sector.
This compares with Dollars 8bn invested in 1990 and Dollars 9bn last year.
The major part will come from Venezuela, the region's biggest producer,
which is embarking on a series of joint ventures, followed by Mexico and
Brazil, which has an ambitious programme to become self-sufficient by 1994.
Latin America has the world's second largest oil reserves after the Middle
East and is at present responsible for 12 per cent of global production.
According to Mr Teixeira the new investment drive will increase the region's
production from 7.4m barrels per day to 10m b/d by the end of the decade.
He said: 'Latin American reserves have increased 600 per cent over the last
25 years - more than any other region in the world. The potential of new
discoveries is still very high because the area is still little explored'.
Mr Teixeira described the petroleum sector as 'one of the engines of growth
of Latin America', which could 'benefit greatly from the region's re-entry
into the international financial community'. He said it could be an
essential tool for integration, adding that several countries including
Brazil and Mexico were negotiating with Cuba for offshore exploration rights
and shared use of terminals and refineries.

TUNISIA'S FIRST first privately owned and managed mining project, at
Bougrine in the province of Kev, has cleared a substantial hurdle by winning
USDollars 16.1m of financial support from the International Finance
Corporation, the World Bank's private-sector financing offshoot.
A German financial institution, Deutsche Investitions und
Entwicklungsgesellschaft, will also provide support with a loan equivalent
to Dollars 11.3m.
Metall Mining, the Toronto-based subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft of
Germany, owns 50 per cent of the project, which is expected to go into
production at the end of 1993 at a total cost of Dollars 50m for the mine,
mill and associated surface facilities.
The Bougrine mine is expected to create 200 jobs and have an annual output
of about 38,000 tonnes of zinc and 8,000 tonnes of lead in concentrates.
Other shareholders in the venture include Tunisia's Office National des
Mines; Societe Tuniso Seodienne d'Investissement et de Developpement; Banque
Tuniso Koweitienne de Developpement; and Banque de Developpement Economique
de Tunisie.

recession in the West for the recent slump in prices, he said prices were
firming again as western economies picked up. He claimed that Soviet exports
had remained largely unchanged, at 700,000 tonnes a year between 1989 and
1991.
Mr Petrosian added that his organisation, which is now restricted to Russia,
had proposed to the commission a review of the Russian licensing system to
restrict exports, even though it had no control over exports by other
republics such as Tajikistan and Ukraine.
But Mr Lev Lubensky, who heads the export department of Concernaluminium, a
conglomerate that represents all Russia's aluminium smelters, painted a more
likely picture of the situation. He said that a new licensing regime coupled
with stiff new export tariffs introduced in January had already curbed
exports. Russian exports, however, would rise again this month as a result
of the recent relaxation of certain export tariffs, but not to last year's
level because the strict new licensing system would remain in place.
But he also admitted that until domestic Russian labour, energy, and other
production costs approached world levels, it would still remain profitable
for Russian producers to sell aluminium at weakened world prices on the LME.
Possibly attempting to cheer up western producers, he said the domestic
Russian price of aluminium was rapidly rising. After the removal of all
price controls on aluminium as part of Russia's January 2 price
liberalisation, he said that the domestic prices of aluminium had leapt from
Rb1,800-4,000 to Rb30,000-50,000 a tonne. At the market rate, the latter
converts to Dollars 300-500 a tonne.
He also denied Mr Petrosian's suggestion that other republics had a
significant presence on export markets, since Tajikistan accounted for only
15 per cent of former Soviet exports while Ukrainian exports were
negligible.
He said Russian exports to the West had increased over the past two years
because of two factors. Firstly, because of the collapse in exports to
former Comecon countries, which had previously accounted for 70 per cent of
Soviet sales abroad. Secondly, he blamed a proliferation of independent
exports by joint ventures and enterprises, over which central authorities
had no control.
The European Commission, which is now considering some sort of compromise to
help western producers without closing the door to Soviet imports, stepped
into the dispute after western European producers complained they were
having to close down capacity as a result of the cheap imports.
The irony is that up-to-date western smelters with advanced environmental
standards are threatened with closure by the output of badly outdated
Russian smelters. Mr Lubensky noted, however, that western investors were
showing no enthusiasm for helping to re-equip Soviet plants.

Copper broke out of its recent range on the LME after a surge on Comex at
midday took March above Dollars 1 a lb on technical buying. Three-month
metal on the LME broke through resistance at Dollars 2,200 a tonne, and
further gains are seen if prices hold above Dollars 2,210. However,
commission house selling was evident above Dollars 2,200 and as there are no
fresh fundamental developments, the market could retreat if it does not
establish a new range above Dollars 2,220, dealers said. LME aluminium
prices succumbed to late profit taking after an afternoon rally on talk that
the giant Krasnoyarsk smelter, Russia's second largest, had threatened to
close unless the new export regime imposed earlier this year is lifted.
Nickel prices were mostly under pressure from liquidation and concern that
recent Chinese purchases may be unwound. New York raw sugar futures were
holding on to light gains by midday after falling to the lowest levels since
August on Tuesday. Analysts said slack demand and ample supplies were
keeping sentiment bearish. In Chicago wheat was again down at midday
following limit losses on Tuesday. New York March cotton was ahead by the 2
cent limit at midday on aggressive buying.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gummer expects big changes in
reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EVENTUAL reforms to the EC Common Agricultural Policy will differ
fundamentally from the commission's original proposals, Mr John Gummer,
agriculture minister said yesterday.
The EC council of farm ministers, which met earlier this week, was becoming
'more and more aware of the flaws in the commission's thinking', he told the
National Farmers' Union AGM in London. The proposals from Mr Ray MacSharry,
the agriculture commissioner, are designed to decouple income support for
farmers from price support for farm output.
Assuring delegates that he would not agree to a reform package that
discriminated against British farming, Mr Gummer said: 'We are being asked
to bear the burdens of a problem we did not create'. He cited a 9,000
hectare Scottish sheep farm running 1,080 ewes; net profit on the sheep in
1990 was Pounds 1,087. Under current proposals it would have support cut by
30 per cent and could not be expected to survive.
Mr Gummer said the Gatt negotiations were trying to create a more liberal
world market for agriculture. If the EC were to compete in that market, the
EC needed to encourage the efficient farmer. Instead, the EC had brought
forward proposals that would 'weaken those farmers throughout the Community
who have modernised their structures and adopted commercial methods to
become modern and up to date'.
He said it was those producers that were vital to the Community if it was to
retain a competitive agricultural industry in the future. 'Does it really
make sense to penalise them for the efforts they have made? Suddenly to
reward inefficiency instead?'

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Credit Foncier launches Ecu750m 12-year
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Foncier, the French public-sector housing finance agency, yesterday
launched a Ecu750m 12-year issue in the international bond market despite
nervous conditions.
Outstanding Ecu bonds weakened as dealers and investors anticipated heavy
supply of new issues. Denmark is planning a Ecu1bn domestic bond issue
before the end of this month. Spain and the European Community are
considering large issues in the international market.
Yesterday's deal, lead managed by Paribas Capital Markets, creates a
benchmark at the 12-year maturity. This attracted institutional investors
wanting to buy longer-dated Ecu paper.
In addition, firms in the management group have the option of increasing
their allotments by one third if demand is strong, so the deal may be
increased to Ecu1bn next week, further improving liquidity.
Against this, demand for Ecu bonds remained sluggish and participants
commented that bonds offered a fair, but not generous, yield. The paper
carries a coupon of 8 3/8 per cent and will be priced today to yield 7 basis
points more than French government Ecu bonds at the 10-year maturity.
Elsewhere, KFW, the German state project finance agency, launched a CDollars
250m five-year deal, lead managed by IBJ International. With a coupon of 8
3/8 per cent, the bonds were priced to yield 34 basis points more than
comparable Canadian government paper, again considered ungenerous by
participants, given poor market conditions.
Canadian dollar bond prices have fallen sharply this month following a
strong performance for most of last year. Government bond yields at the
five-year maturity have risen from 7.25 to nearly 8 per cent since the start
of this year.
While there are pockets of demand for new bonds, many investors remain
nervous. From a fixed-reoffered price of 99.80, the bonds traded down to
99.70 bid by the close.
A retail targeted CDollars 100m five-year deal was launched by Credit
Lyonnais, lead managed by Hambros. The 8 1/2 per cent bonds were priced to
yield 10 or 11 basis points more than the KFW issue, reflecting the issuer's
lower credit quality.
There was no fixed re-offer, but the bonds were bid 1.85 points below issue
price by the close, just inside full fees of 1.875 per cent.
Stet, the Italian state telecommunications agency yesterday fixed the
exercise price of warrants on SIP Savings shares at L1550. The warrants were
part of Stet's L400bn equity-linked bond issue launched last month.

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico sets its sights on
derivatives trading - The country's plan to offer on-shore warrants and
options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY JUNE, Mexico's stock market authorities plan to be offering listed
warrants on the bolsa index and on some 10 to 12 leading stocks. The move is
an effort to bolster liquidity and stem the growing tide of derivative
business conducted off-shore.
Mr Guillermo Prieta, vice-president at the Comision Nacional de Valores
(CNV), said the creation of covered warrants would itself increase turnover
in the underlying market. He said investors would also be able to use the
warrants to protect their investment portfolios from unfavourable price
changes.
If the warrants market is successful, the CNV would establish a listed
options market which the Mexican authorities would bring under the same
level of close regulation that it has planned for the warrants market. In a
third stage, the authorities plan to set up a financial futures market.
Mr Prieta also revealed that Mexico would shortly introduce an intermediate
market for the thousand or so businesses worth between Dollars 3m and
Dollars 30m. The listing requirements for the smaller companies market will
be lighter than those in the main bolsa.
Foreign and domestic investors interested in buying options on the bolsa
currently have to buy offshore warrants listed in Luxembourg on baskets of
Mexican stocks offered by Merrill Lynch, Nomura and the Mexican bank
Banamex.
Merrill Lynch also offers off-shore warrants on seven individual Mexican
stocks. US-listed options on Telmex, the telephone monopoly, whose American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, are
also available.
These have proved popular, and have threatened to divert business away from
the underlying Mexican stock market, according to Mr Juan Jose Suarez, head
of derivatives at Banamex. As securities houses sell options and warrants
mainly on ADRs, they have tended to buy and sell the underlying ADR, rather
than the Mexican stock, to cover the risk.
At the end of 1991, some 74.3 per cent of foreign investment, or Dollars
14.2bn in Mexican stocks, was in the form of US-based ADRs. This was mainly
because many US institutional investors are only allowed to buy dollar
denominated shares. But the demand for Mexican-listed stocks has also been
damped by the high cost of buying them, their low liquidity and constraints
on hedging - problems which will be reduced when Mexico introduces its own
options market.
The Mexican brokerages hope that by offering derivatives they will also
attract more foreign investment in Mexican-listed stocks.
Foreign investors seem to agree. Mr Lincoln Rathbone of Scudders, Stevens,
and Peabody, points out that if the derivatives are liquid, 'it is a big
plus for Mexico . . . since this allows you to employ tools regarding
controlling risk that we are used to'.
Mr Tim Davies, of James Capel, echoes this view. 'There is no real way to
hedge the country risk of investing in Mexico - that makes some foreigners
more hesitant.'
The Mexican warrants will also be on-shore, and thus open to many more US
and Mexican institutional investors than the Luxembourg warrants.
However, foreign investors may not gravitate to Mexican warrants if the
regulators do not guarantee the warrants and options through a controlled
clearing system, as happens in the US. Without guarantees, the purchaser of
a warrant or option is accepting the credit risk of the Mexican broker or
bank that issues the option - which often is significant. (Under Mexican law
only domestic institutions will be able to issue derivatives).
Mr Suarez, of Banamex, suggests further problems. The bolsa prohibits margin
trading; short sales are almost impossible because of burdensome regulation;
brokerage fees are much higher than in the US; and proprietary trading -
essential to liquidity - is difficult. All these restrictions make it
impossible to use options and warrants as proper and efficient hedges
(because they inhibit the arbitrage between the underlying and derivative
market). Investors will probably continue using off-shore instruments, if
they are legally free to do so.
Mr Prieta seems aware that the regulation of Mexico's underlying bolsa needs
to be reduced, and suggested that in the near future some restrictions will
be lifted, including those on proprietary trading. This should increase
liquidity, and allow the Mexican market to compete more effectively.

THE LONG-TERM debt of Asda, the UK stores group, falls below investment
grade, according to a report from Moody's, the US credit rating agency,
writes Richard Waters.
Moody's assessment of Asda, at Ba1, one notch below investment grade, places
the company two notches below the BBB rating accorded it by IBCA, the UK
credit rating agency.
Moody's also rated Asda's convertible capital bond (issued by Asda Group
Finance) at Ba3, three places below investment grade, and said the British
group's commercial paper failed to qualify as Prime.
Moody's said the ratings reflect 'on-going pressure on Asda's core earnings
in the UK grocery market'.
Asda refused to comment on the ratings, which were unsolicited. Moody's
ratings affect Pounds 420m of long-term debt.

bad fourth period
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
COCA-COLA Enterprises, the largest bottler for the American soft drinks
company, yesterday reported a Dollars 82.4m loss after tax for 1991,
compared with a profit of Dollars 93.4m a year earlier.
However, the damage came largely in the fourth quarter, when CCE suffered a
net loss of Dollars 125m, compared with a Dollars 11.1m profit a year
earlier, after taking a Dollars 152m restructuring charge.
CCE, in which Coca-Cola has a large minority stake, said that the charge
covered a range of organisational changes.
These ranged from standardising computer systems to severance and relocation
costs resulting from corporate 'decentralisation'.
The figures do not include any results for Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling
Group, the oldest and biggest of Coca-Cola independent bottlers which CCE
acquired via a share swop deal in December - part of a general consolidation
trend in soft drinks group's bottling operations.
Yesterday, CCE said cash operating profits should show a 'healthy increase'
in 1992, but increased interest and amortisation costs related to the
Johnston deal would prevent this year's earnings per share surpassing
1991's, once non-recurring items were stripped out.

restructuring

<TEXT>
FEDERAL Express, the Memphis-based express package delivery company, has
confirmed market suspicions that it is actively looking to restructure its
international operations, although it would not speculate on when any
decisions might be reached.
The company released a formal statement saying it had been considering
options aimed at reducing its losses overseas. It said these could include
restructurings as well as co-operative or other business arrangements with
third parties. Preliminary talks had been held with outside parties, it
added, but the company stressed the examination of options was 'at this
stage, exploratory only'.
It said, 'No conclusions have been reached with respect to any courses of
action the company may take, nor have there been any agreements with third
parties.'
The bulk of Federal Express's problems overseas have come in Europe. Last
spring, the company took a Dollars 121m charge against earnings to cover
workforce and other cuts in the UK and a large part of its British operation
has been sold back to Littlewoods, the privately-owned UK retailer.
In the second quarter of its current financial year - to end-November -
Federal Express still reported operating losses of Dollars 64.5m, up from
Dollars 54.7m a year earlier and said it was 'disgusted' with the
performance.

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Gencor criticised over terms of
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENCOR, the South African mining and industrial group, is facing complaints
that its R2bn (Dollars 740.7m) rights issue is unfair to UK shareholders.
The terms which have been offered to UK shareholders, who account for about
3 per cent of Gencor's issued capital, are very unusual because they are at
a fixed sterling price of 172p a share.
All other shareholders must pay in rand.
Analysts can remember only one other similar offer, by Goldfields of South
Africa two years ago.
Complaints have been made because, since Gencor fixed the terms, the
financial rand has fallen from 5.84 to the pound to 6.3 and virtually wiped
out the value of the 'nil paid' rights to UK shareholders.
In contrast, South African registered, non-resident shareholders, have
rights which are worth about 23p a share.
Gencor's broker, Smith New Court, said a previous Gencor R1.5bn rights issue
in July 1989, met a very bad response from UK shareholders who lost money by
allowing their rights to lapse.
Irate shareholders subsequently told Gencor it had been difficult to obtain
financial rands from UK clearing banks.
'Gencor had many requests to do subsequent rights issues in sterling. We
knew it was risky but we tried to help. This has been done with the best
intentions.
'Currencies can move back and the closing date is not until February 28,'
said a Smith New Court official.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Durlacher West, commented: 'Gencor has
successfully been building a good image with the London financial community
over the past two years. This could put a dent in that process.'
He pointed out that another South African company, Tiger Oats, in a current
rights issue which also has Smith New Court as broker, hopes to solve the
problem in a different way - by pointing small UK shareholders in the
direction of Nedbank for their financial rands.

<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, blamed the extended worldwide recession and the
strength of the US dollar for a 14.7 per cent drop in its 1991 net earnings
to Dollars 817m, or Dollars 6.05 a share.
The New York-based group recorded a 1 per cent decline in 1991 revenues, to
Dollars 20.4bn. However, it said its operating income and financial strength
were sufficient to permit an increase in the annual dividend, from Dollars
1.72 to Dollars 1.84 a share.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 1991 was Dollars 195m, or Dollars 1.44 a
share, more than double the Dollars 84m, or 65 cents, earned in the last
quarter of 1990. But the 1991 fourth quarter included after-tax portfolio
gains totalling Dollars 79m at the ITT Hartford insurance group and ITT
financial division. Fourth-quarter revenues fell by 2 per cent, to Dollars
5.35bn.
ITT said three of its four service businesses improved their operating
earnings in 1991. These were the Hartford insurance group, the ITT
communications and information services division and the ITT financial arm.
The ITT Sheraton hotel business suffered lower earnings as a result of lower
occupancy rates, which reflected reduced travel in the US and the impact of
recession.

<TEXT>
CITIZEN Watch, the Japanese precision equipment-maker, has agreed to acquire
a medium-sized German machine tool company, G. Boley, as part of a strategy
to expand its European manufacturing oper-ations and to reduce its
dependence on watch production.
The DM13m (Dollars 8.6m) purchase is the first foreign acquisition by
Citizen, which is attempting to expand its office automation equipment and
machine tool businesses, and was attracted by G. Boley's expertise in the
manufacture of numerically-controlled lathes.
Japanese companies see the acquisition of small and medium-sized European
manufacturers as an important means of establishing a base in the region
without prompting controversy over Japanese investment.
G. Boley, based in Esslingen, has a capital of DM5.1m, sales last year of
DM30m, and 130 staff. The agreement between the two companies provides for
the Boley name to be retained, though the German company will be
wholly-owned by Citizen Machinery Europe.
The Japanese company said the purchase would improve its European
development and marketing of lathes, and that G. Boley, founded in 1870,
would be contracted to produce small lathes for Citizen, while continuing to
make its present lines under the Boley brand.
Watches still account for about 51 per cent of Citizen's sales, but revenues
have been under pressure because of recession in the US and Europe, and
because of a general decline in watch prices.

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: India enters the race for cable
networks - Companies seek a toe-hold in a new industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GITA PIRAMAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW business has hit India and it has incredible potential: electronic
entertainment.
So now some of the country's biggest business houses are trying frantically
to acquire toe-holds in this field which has so far been dominated by
small-time operators working on shoe-string budgets.
Over the past few weeks, the powerful Hinduja group, as well as newspaper
barons such as Mrs Shobhana Bhartia of the Hindustan Times group and Mr
Samir Jain of the Times of India group, have been buying up small cable
operations in almost every big city.
Their strategy is to create unified cable networks across the country.
The race for cable networks is hottest in Bombay.
Currently, there are at least 6,000 cable operators in the city with 20 new
ones starting up each day.
A study by the Independent Operations Research group estimates that more
than 90,000 people in Bombay watch cable television.
The programmes these entrepreneurial operators broadcast are generally in
English, and largely pirated.
Despite periodic crackdowns by the police, the cable companies continue to
flourish, providing stiff competition to Doordarshan, the
government-controlled television.
Ironically, the latest victim of this rampant piracy is Hong Kong-based Star
TV which virtually created the electronic entertainment boom when it started
beaming its five-channel satellite broadcasts to India last August.
Indian cable operators, always starved of software, have been taping Star TV
programmes and broadcasting them illegally.
With big business moving into this field, however, there are bound to be
sweeping changes. The government is already working on legislation to
regulate cable networks.
A new law is expected to be introduced in the up-coming budget session of
parliament.
Meanwhile, new software companies are mushrooming, hoping that when the big
business houses have finished buying up the midget cable operators, there
will be a big market for locally produced programmes in various Indian
languages.
At the same time, advertising companies are keeping a watchful eye on
events.
The government's new guidelines will enable the monitoring of accurate
viewership patterns.
In a city such as Bombay, with a 10m-strong population, cable companies
offer the most cost-effective route to consumer advertising.

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Wooltru down on decline in
consumer spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in consumer spending caused a 28 per cent fall in earnings at
Wooltru, one of South Africa's premier consumer-based retailers, in the 26
weeks to December.
Mr David Susman, chairman, described the trading period as the 'most
difficult for many years.' He noted clothing, footwear and textile sales
showed showed a real decrease of 3.5 per cent, while food volumes were 13.5
per cent down on a year earlier.
The results are the first from a blue-chip retailer for the second half of
1991, and are considerably worse than other market leaders which reported
towards the end of last year. They confirm that consumer spending dropped
off sharply last year, South Africa's long-running recession having
initially been restricted more to the capital goods sectors.
Although turnover rose by 17 per cent to R1.98bn (Dollars 77m), net income
before tax declined by 28 per cent to R106.7m. Net income was 31 per cent
lower at R57.3m and earnings per share were 28 per cent down at 164.5 cents.
Commenting on the results, Mr Susman said budgets and buying plans set early
in 1991 were too optimistic and, faced with excess stock, drastic markdowns
were forced on the group. Hardest hit was Makro, the wholesale arm of the
group, where an aggressive store development programme led to a 61 per cent
drop in pre-tax profit.
Woolworths, the upmarket food and clothing flagship of the group, had a
disappointing performance with pre-tax profit down 55 per cent. This was due
to weaknesses in textile procurement, marketing and management controls.
The board said the fall in profits in the second half should be less severe.
The dividend was maintained at 77 cents per share.

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Scitex shrugs off difficulties
with 31% improvement

SCITEX, the Israeli maker of electronic pre-press systems, yesterday
reported a 31 per cent increase in net profits in 1991 to Dollars 100.6m,
dodging both the worst effects of recession in the US and Europe, its main
markets, and the collapse of the Robert Maxwell empire with which it was
associated.
The profit rise was much less spectacular than the more than 100 per cent
increase of the two previous years, but Scitex executives were far from
disappointed, given the circumstances.
Mr Maxwell was chairman and controlled 15 per cent of Scitex until little
more than a month before his death when he sold out. It subsequently emerged
the shares were owned by Maxwell pension funds, not the private Robert
Maxwell Group as previously thought, but proceeds from the sale worth Pounds
107m (Dollars 192.6m) had gone to the Robert Maxwell Group instead of the
pension funds.
'He never had much impact on the running of our business, even as chairman,'
Mr Giora Bitan, Scitex's chief financial officer, said yesterday.
'But to have had a substantial portion of our shares in the hands of the
Maxwell receivers is not something we would have liked.'
Mr Bitan said the quick productive returns Scitex equipment offered printers
and publishers had bolstered demand, despite the recession. Sales and
service revenue rose 22 per cent from Dollars 351.5m in 1990 to Dollars
430.2m in 1991.
He said the outlook for 1992 was 'not easy, and said the company was
increasingly targetting the growing 'mid-range' market where small print
houses were switching from black and white to colour reproduction.
Mr Bitan said this sector was aimed to grow from about 5 per cent of sales
last year to 15 per cent in 1993.
Scitex costs moved up last year to Dollars 165m from Dollars 135m in 1990.
Net R&amp;D expenses were Dollars 26.9m, compared with Dollars 22m. Earning per
share were Dollars 2.70 with a total dividend for the year of Dollars 0.40
per share.

FISHER-PRICE, one of the world's biggest marketers of pre-school toys,
yesterday posted second quarter earnings of Dollars 4m, or 26 cents a share.
The company, spun-off from Quaker Oats last June, recorded a net deficit of
Dollars 29.2m in the 1990 second quarter. Revenues were virtually unchanged
at Dollars 185m, compared with Dollars 184.6m.
Part of the improvement came from lower advertising and merchandising
expenses, which dropped to Dollars 27.7m in the 1991 second quarter from
Dollars 43.4m last time.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were cut to Dollars 42.9m from
Dollars 54.7m.
The New York-based company said last year's figures do not necessarily
reflect the results had Fisher-Price been operating as a stand-alone entity.
For the six months, net income was Dollars 12.2m, or 80 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 373m, against a net loss of Dollars 38.7m on revenues of
Dollars 339.4m.
On Wall Street, the shares eased Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 at
mid-session yesterday.
During the first half, domestic revenues climbed 26 per cent to Dollars
266.1m, but international revenues tumbled 17 per cent to Dollars 106.9m.
Foreign currency translations accounted for Dollars 7.4m of the Dollars
22.1m decline.
Mr Ronald Jackson, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We view the
international business as a growth opportunity, even though we didn't make
as much progress as we had hoped in 1991.'

FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: US insurers warn on weak economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of the largest US composite insurers yesterday renewed warnings about
the depressed state of the domestic property market and the impact of this
on the sector, although both pointed to the benefits of earlier cost-cutting
measures on underlying operations.
Travelers, the Hartford-based multi-line insurer, unveiled an after-tax
profit of Dollars 317.8m for the year, against its loss of Dollars 178.4m in
the previous 12 months. The improvement stemmed from a turnround on the
realised investment gain/loss front. In 1990, Travelers made a Dollars 650m
pre-tax addition to reserves to cover souring real estate investments and
mortgage loans, causing it to register a net realised investment loss of
Dollars 566m. Last year, there was a net realised investment gain of Dollars
1m, plus a further Dollars 10.4m tax credit - although the company did add a
further Dollars 103m pre-tax to reserves due to the real estate situation,
of which Dollars 56m fell in the final quarter.
Commenting on the figures, Travelers warned 'weakness in the economy
continues to delay any meaningful improvement in the real estate markets',
but it claimed to have established 'substantial reserves in anticipation of
the environment we foresee'. Write-offs during the year on the property
front totalled Dollars 270m, taking the real estate reserve balance at the
end of the year to Dollars 909m, against over Dollars 1bn a year ago.
Travelers' net income before investment gains/losses was actually lower in
1991, at Dollars 306m, against Dollars 388m. Again, real estate took its
toll, with 'underperforming' mortgage loans depressing investment income.
However, it reported an improvement in underlying property-casualty
operations, where it claimed earlier restructuring moves had improved the
cost structure. Its shares rose  7/8 to Dollars 23.
At Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, net profits fell from Dollars 614m in 1990 to
Dollars 505m last year. Again, the difference is largely explained by
investment gains/losses and the depressed state of the property market. Its
shares rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 3/4 .
Aetna's 1991 figures are scored after net realised capital losses of Dollars
186m - which included a Dollars 357m after-tax addition to reserves for
potential mortgage loan and real estate write-downs. In 1990, net realised
capital losses were Dollars 82m, with a Dollars 163m addition to reserves
for property-related investments. The 1991 fourth-quarter addition to
reserves for real estate investments was Dollars 154m, against Dollars 102m
in the same period last year, prompting a net realised capital loss in this
period alone of Dollars 116m, against a loss of Dollars 95m.
'Our views about the depth, geographic breadth and during of problems in
these markets became more pessimistic late in the year,' said Mr James Lynn,
Aetna's chairman. 'It is still very difficult to assess what will be
happening to the economy and commercial real estate markets and, in turn,
the effect on our portfolios.' He added the total mortgage loan reserve
balances and real estate write-downs stand at over Dollars 1.2bn.
Without the net capital losses, he added, results for 1991 were 'very close'
to 1990. Like Travelers, Aetna pointed to the benefits of reorganisation,
and noted the commercial property-casualty operations contributed to
earnings despite the 'difficult environment'.

THE start-up of Canada's CDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 4.4bn) Hibernia offshore
oil project's has been delayed by at least one year to November 1997, says
Mr Jake Epp, federal energy minister
The federal and Newfoundland governments are urgently trying to find
investors to take over the 25 per cent interest held by Gulf Canada, the
upstream energy company controlled by the Reichmann brothers of Toronto,
which said it was quitting Hibernia last week.
'We are looking at all options and new tax incentives to attract new
partners, even smaller companies,' said Mr Epp. He said no potential
investors have come forward.
About CDollars 2bn of construction and equipment contracts have been awarded
for Hibernia, located nearly 200 miles east of St John's, Newfoundland, and
a further Dollars 500m were due this spring. These contracts may be delayed
and mothballing of the project cannot be ruled out.
Under a 1990 agreement, Gulf has 243 days to find a buyer for its 25 per
cent interest or the other partners, Petro-Canada (25 per cent), Mobil (28%)
and Chevron (22%) must buy Gulf out pro rata.
Analysts estimate Gulf's investment is worth about CDollars 200m. The
federal government is committed to CDollars 2.7bn.

<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the leading software supplier, said Apple Computer was seeking
potentially crippling damages of Dollars 4.36bn in the long-running software
copyright infringement dispute between the US companies.
The outcome of the legal battle could have a profound impact upon the
personal computer industry in which Microsoft is the leading software
supplier.
Microsoft charged Apple's claim was 'insupportable and speculative'. The
company denied infringing Apple copyrights and noted the court had yet to
rule on infringement.
Apple filed its suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, the computer
systems group, in 1988. It claimed an early version of Microsoft's Windows
program produces computer screen displays copied from Apple Macintosh
displays.
Microsoft has since sold over 9m copies of the latest version of Windows,
introduced 10 months ago, which provides IBM-compatible personal computers
with ease-of-use graphical interface features, previously unique to Apple
Macintosh personal computers.
On Friday, Microsoft will file a motion for summary judgment, asking the
court to dismiss Apple's remaining claims. It will also ask the court to
apply its earlier rulings to the latest version of Windows.
Apple, however, said it was 'increasingly confident' its infringement claims
will be upheld and said it expected the case to go to a jury trial this
summer.
Hewlett-Packard, also named in the suit, has had only limited success with
its NewWave program and Apple's claims against the company are expected to
be much smaller. It also denies infringement.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS CORPORATION has overcome continuing losses in the 50 per cent-owned
BSkyB satellite TV operation in Europe and the Ansett Transport group in
Australia to increase profits for the six months ended December 1991.
The Australian-based international media conglomerate, controlled by Mr
Rupert Murdoch, lifted net earnings by 38 per cent, to ADollars 252.2m
(USDollars 189.60m), despite an 8 per cent slide in revenue to ADollars
5.3bn from ADollars 5.7bn. The interim dividend is being held at 5 cents a
share.
The profits progress was achieved despite almost ADollars 62.7m in
equity-accounted losses - compared with a ADollars 13.9m profit previously -
from BSkyB and Ansett plus continuing asset disposals.
News said BSkyB should be in profit by the final quarter of 1991-92, and
improved results were expected from Ansett.
BSkyB, with more than 2m domestic satellite dish customers in the UK, is
expected to reach operational break-even next month, News said.
It is believed that financing charges on the venture still account for
around Pounds 3m a week.
News Corp directors outlined a period of asset sales and debt restructuring,
including disposal of the Enquirer/Star newspapers in the US. Proceeds from
the disposals and cash raisings totalled ADollars 1.5bn, with most going to
debt repayments required under banking agreements.
This helped to reduce net interest payments in the six months to ADollars
497.3m from ADollars 593.0m, and depreciation charges eased to ADollars
115.2m from ADollars 152.7m.
The US-based Fox Broadcasting television operation emerged as the big
earnings improver in the six months. Gross television income jumped to
ADollars 124.4m from ADollars 10.7m. Newspapers, however, remained the
group's mainstay, lifting income to ADollars 286.8m from ADollars 255.2m.
All other business areas recorded lower gross income, with magazines down to
ADollars 104.9m from ADollars 128.2m; films falling to ADollars 67.7m from
ADollars 93.7m; and book publishing off to ADollars 156.7m from ADollars
160.4m. Other operations dipped to ADollars 106.4m from ADollars 148.6m.
On a geographic basis, the UK recorded the biggest gross income rise, up to
ADollars 173.9m from ADollars 39.3m. Directors said this reflected improved
margins on the company's five main newspapers.
The US remained the News group's most profitable region, even though its
gross income contribution fell from ADollars 571.5m to ADollars 471.8m.
Directors said US earnings were hit by the sale of nine consumer
publications, while Twentieth Century Film's result was also down.

<TEXT>
IBERDROLA, Spain's biggest private sector electricity utility, reports a
31.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1991, to Pta87.6bn (Dollars
876m). It follows a sharp cut in interest charges, down nearly 6 per cent to
Pta199bn.
In its first result since the merger last year of the country's two leading
private utilities, Iberduero and Hidrola, Iberdrola said it had finished the
year in better shape than it had expected.
Cutting interest payments has become critical for Spain's heavily-borrowed
utilities, as they are about to begin a series of generating plant
investments to fulfil government energy requirement forecasts for the end of
the century.
Iberdrola reported income of Pta787bn, up some Pta66bn from 1990. It said it
had improved the quality of its profits by cutting deferred costs by
Pta5.1bn to Pta18.5bn; capitalising some Pta10bn worth of debt in mothballed
nuclear plant; and by raising provisions by Pta11bn.

ALITALIA, Italy's state-owned national airline, reported a 7 per cent rise
in revenue to almost L6,000bn (Dollars 5bn) last year, despite the effect on
business of the Gulf war, writes Haig Simonian.
Mr Giovanni Bisignani, Alitalia's managing director, said earnings had
recovered in the second half of last year, with operating profits of around
L80bn in July to December. The airline carried around 8.5m in the second
half against a 18.2m for all of 1991. The second-half improvement may
attenuate what is expected to be a heavy loss in 1991. At group level,
Alitalia lost L123bn in the first half of 1991.
Mr Bisignani said the company was committed to its fleet renewal programme.

further patent action
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Japanese camera-makers are anxiously awaiting contact from
Honeywell, the US controls manufacturer awarded Dollars 96m last week by a
US jury for alleged violation of its autofocus technology patents by Minolta
of Japan.
Japanese industry officials said yesterday they were aware that Honeywell
had stated an intention to pursue actions against 15 other camera equipment
manufacturers, including Canon, Nikon, and Fuji Photo Film, which the US
company alleges have also infringed on the patents.
The Japanese makers said they did not plan to halt exports to the US, in
spite of Honeywell's plans to attempt to ban Minolta from marketing in the
US any cameras containing the autofocus technology.
While the timing of the court's decision was seen by some Japanese as linked
to the recent increase in US-Japan trade tension, the camera makers said the
long-running dispute with Honeywell involved a more fundamental principle of
patent rights.
'If a man invents an electric fan with three blades, does he also have a
patent on a fan with five blades?,' asked an official from Minolta, which
was relieved that the US jury dismissed a charge that it had wilfully
violated the patents.
Japanese makers, who are already being squeezed by sluggish camera sales,
generally argue that they developed their own technology, in spite of an
'advanced disclosure agreement' that some of these companies entered into
with Honeywell in the 1970s.
Ricoh, the office equipment and optical goods maker, said the issue was
'very technical', and it expected that Honeywell would need a long period to
prepare a claim which took into account the differences in equipment
produced by the various Japanese companies.
Canon said: 'We don't think we have been infringing, but we will take the
necessary action if Honeywell contacts us.' Asahi Optical, the maker of
Pentax cameras, said the company was gathering information in expectation of
contact from Honeywell.
The size of the award surprised several companies, though the industry
generally was relieved that the US jury did not find Minolta guilty of
wilful violation.
Minolta had reckoned that such a finding could have cost it as much as
Dollars 500m, a heavy burden for a company that last October reported its
first interim loss for 25 years.

<TEXT>
ILVA, the Italian state-owned steelmaker, has sold its subsidiary, Capolo
Gestioni Industriali, to a group of investors in one of the country's
biggest leveraged buy-outs.
Separately, Capolo is merging with Carlo Secchi, a company specialising in
lithography on steel, which is a key step in printing on steel strip used
for cans.
Capolo is Italy's second biggest producer of steel cans for the food
industry and general packaging, with turnover of around L194bn (Dollars
162.61m) last year. Together, the combined group will have sales of around
L225bn a year.
The transaction is a further step in Italy's privatisation programme. It may
also reflect the drive by Ilva, which is one of the government's main
candidates for partial privatisation, to reduce debt and produce a profit
for 1991.
Italian stock market rules require a company to show three straight years of
profits before an initial public share offering can be made. Although Ilva
had strong earnings in 1989 and 1990, last year was much tougher, and the
company has been making a number of disposals to boost its extraordinary
earnings.
The deal was organised by LBO Italia, the Italian arm of the big LBO France
group, with Akros, the Milan merchant bank, advising the vendors.
The majority shareholder in the privatised Capolo is Europe Capital
Partners, a big LBO fund. Meanwhile, Ilva will retain a stake of around 18
per cent in the new company.

Laird - Fullarton's 14-year expansion in Scotland's computer industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT MANY UK manufacturing companies expect their turnover this year to be at
least 50 per cent more than it was in 1990.
Yet that is the forecast at Fullarton Fabrication, a Scottish company which
supplies components and sub-assemblies to the computer industry.
Fullarton is in the throes of the biggest investment programme in its
14-year history, spending Pounds 4.5m on increasing capacity at its eight
plants at Irvine, Ayrshire. It expects this year's sales to exceed Pounds
50m - against Pounds 32m in 1990 - and envisages its workforce increasing by
140 to 1,400 over the 12 months.
Fullarton is one of the few UK companies to exploit the concentration of
large electronics manufacturing companies in Silicon Glen, the popular name
for the Scottish electronics industry, and thus to compete with components
suppliers from the Far East from which the multinationals draw many of their
supplies.
It is also unusual because it is to a large extent the creation of one man,
Mr Allan McLuckie, its managing director. However, it operates with
considerable autonomy as a subsidiary of the Laird Group, the London-based
car parts, plastics and building products group.
Fullarton was set up in 1978 by Mr McLuckie and five others when the night
storage radiator manufacturer, where they had worked their way up from the
shop floor, got into difficulties. They initially directed their
metal-working skills to making farm gates and electricity meter boxes, but
the objective was to become a sub-contractor to the computer industry.
In 1979 Mr McLuckie, a tenacious Scot who wastes neither time nor words,
achieved the remarkable feat of coaxing International Business Machines'
plant at Havant, Hampshire, into buying metal casings for its computers from
Fullarton when it had fewer than 30 employees.
By 1984 turnover had reached Pounds 4.2m and Fullarton employed 180 people
producing components for the computer industry in high volume. But Mr
McLuckie and his colleagues reluctantly decided that further growth would
require constant heavy investment and, as he puts it: 'Success was bringing
its own problems; six guys were spending a lot of time running round the
boardroom table.'
In early 1985 Fullarton accepted an approach from Laird and sold out. Laird
insisted on orderly financial planning to avoid the occasional overtrading
of the past. Mr McLuckie now reports to Mr Ian Arnott, Laird's managing
director, but says: 'We still look at this company as if we own it. Laird
has given us the freedom to run our business.'
Since then Fullarton has invested Pounds 8.7m (not including the current
Pounds 4m programme) in expansion, with contributions from Laird
supplemented by grants from the Scottish Office. It has expanded into
electrical assembly, cable assembly and plastic injection moulding, and now
operates seven plants.
Fullarton's success - it is now the largest employer in Irvine - is based on
the acceptance that it exists to service the multinationals. 'We're just the
meat in the sandwich. We don't control our own destiny,' says Mr McLuckie.
Supply contracts are often arranged at short notice and can be cancelled
equally quickly, and delivery is normally on a just-in-time basis.
Fullarton assembles keyboards for personal computers for IBM's plant at
nearby Greenock and installs electrical components and cabling in sheet
metal computer casings. Its other local customers, all within about 70
miles, include Oki, the Japanese printer maker, at Cumbernauld and Compaq at
Erskine, as well as Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi, Unisys and Timex. It now
supplies Intel, the US company, with PC cases in Oregon, as well as Ireland.
Like many other company managing directors, Mr McLuckie says: 'Our best
asset is our people.' What may make Fullarton different is that in addition
to building a training and education centre, it brings all its employees up
to date on the state of the company about every six weeks.
Staff are bussed to the training centre in groups of about 80 and Mr
McLuckie spends about an hour and a half briefing each group. It takes about
18 sessions and means interrupting production over a week and a half. Mr
McLuckie says it pays off in terms of commitment and productivity.
From Laird's point of view Fullarton is a profitable investment (though
pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 2m in 1989 to Pounds 1.6m in 1990 on sales
ahead from Pounds 30m to Pounds 32m) and is likely to grow further. Laird
executives visit Irvine only about three times a year and there are no Laird
appointees on the staff.
'It's a stand-alone business,' says Mr John Gardiner, Laird chairman, 'which
brings no direct benefits to other parts of the group apart from profits.'
But he says that Fullarton draws on the knowledge of Laird's engineering
subsidiaries in France and Germany, which are run by local nationals.
Fullarton's current expansion is aimed at increasing its capacity with an
eighth factory (buying a redundant plant from a neighbouring company) and
installing more metal-processing and plastic-moulding equipment. Mr McLuckie
says that suppliers like Fullarton are becoming 'an extension of the
multinationals' facilities', as the large companies increasingly obtain
their components and sub-assemblies from a single company rather than from a
handful.
'The multinationals' forte is R&amp;D and marketing; ours is providing a
service,' he says. He calls Fullarton an 'industrial supermarket' where the
customer can buy a wide range of goods and where the 'shelves' (ie the
factories) can be rearranged and stocked to provide whatever the client
wants.
Neither Mr McLuckie nor Mr Gardiner is deterred by the shake-out taking
place in the world electronics industry, with IBM's difficulties
particularly well-publicised. 'In general electronics is tough at the
moment,' admits Mr McLuckie. 'But currently our business with IBM is busy
and we're expanding.
'I don't expect to get through 1992 without some tough times. But the beauty
of our story is that, even with peaks and troughs, we've finished each year
with more people than we started with.'

total, a special payment of 0.5p was made.
Mr Val Fleming, chairman, said the lower UK content in the portfolio
together with some dividend cuts and the fall in deposit interest received
had collectively resulted in a reduction in earnings per share.

Lancashire Enterprises, the former economic development arm of Lancashire
County Council, yesterday reported pre-tax profits more than doubled to
Pounds 2.12m and a dividend up from 5p to 11p.
Turnover was up 65 per cent at Pounds 11m (Pounds 6.67m) as a result of
selling economic develop- ment management and advisory contracts to a wider
range of clients, which now include the European Commission, the UK
government and several regional and local authorities.
The company, privatised two years ago, also has regional development
contracts in Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary and is pursuing others in
Czechoslovakia and Albania, as well as a venture capital fund in north-west
England.
Its shares are traded on matched bargain basis. Lancashire County
Investments has 25 per cent, but the only other disclosable holding is that
of Clydesdale Bank Nominees, with 3.6 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOORFIELD Estates, the USM-quoted property development group, reported a
pre-tax deficit of Pounds 691,000 in the year to October 31 1991.
The result compared with a profit last time of Pounds 565,000 and came from
turnover down from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 8.6m.
The commercial division reported a profit of Pounds 296,000 on property
disposals. However, after after writing off interest of Pounds 388,000 and
making provisions of Pounds 949,000 against the value of part of its
portfolio, a loss of Pounds 1.04m was incurred.
The residential division recorded a 25 per cent advance. The division turned
in profits of Pounds 1.87m from house sales slightly up at 67 (65) units.
The average sale contributed Pounds 20,000 to profits.
Mr Tony Phillips, chairman, said the property sector had been badly affected
by the recession, although the group's residential developments in Yorkshire
and commercial developments in the Midlands and Yorkshire had not been as
badly affected as other parts of the country.
He did not envisage a recovery in the commercial sector until later this
year.
A tax credit of Pounds 226,000 (Pounds 193,000 charge) helped mitigate the
loss.
A final dividend of 0.1p is proposed. This compares with a total for the
1990 year of 2.4p.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Refocused St Modwen declines 48%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at St Modwen Properties, the Birmingham-based group, fell 48
per cent, from Pounds 4.05m to Pounds 2.11m, in the year to November 30.
The figures masked a change in the shape of the group from a property
developer with some rental income to a property investment company with a
development stream.
Gross profits came to Pounds 10m, of which rental income contributed Pounds
5.4m and property development Pounds 4.6m. In the previous year the
contributions were Pounds 4.2m and Pounds 6.5m respectively.
Out of an operating profit of Pounds 7.6m interest charges took Pounds 5.5m
compared with Pounds 4.3m the previous year. The rise is partly explained
through the group stopping the capitalisation of interest charges on its
developments.
Present gearing is 88 per cent, but during the year the group reduced its
debt load from Pounds 56m to just under Pounds 40m. With lower interest
rates, the borrowing cost this year should be reduced.
As the annual rent roll is now Pounds 6.9m and rising, borrowing costs are
covered. 'We no longer need development profits to avoid loss,' said Mr
Anthony Glossop, chief executive. Development profits this year, in any
case, will be lower than 1991.
A sharply lower tax charge, resulting from the holding as investments of
developments in Enterprise Zones, left net profit at Pounds 2m (Pounds
2.78m) and earnings at 1.7p (2.3p). The dividend is 0.55p (0.5p).
There were no extraordinary charges, against a Pounds 2.14m provision
against an investment in an associate.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Watmoughs'Pounds 22m rights for Spanish
print plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATMOUGHS, one of the UK's largest printers, yesterday announced a 1-for-4
underwritten rights issue at 350p to raise Pounds 22.3m for a new gravure
printing facility in Spain.
The Pounds 36m plant will service five year contracts to print Hello
magazine - the UK's most recent publishing success - Hola magazine, Hello's
progenitor, and Blanco y Negra, a leading Sunday supplement, in Madrid.
Mr Patrick Walker, chairman, said the three contracts would require 80 per
cent of the new plant's capacity when it comes on stream in spring 1993. It
would be profitable at that level from day one.
The market welcomed the move, with Watmoughs' shares falling only 7p to 425p
having earlier touched 405p on news of the rights issue.
The group is forecasting pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 8m (Pounds
11.6m) for 1991 together with a final dividend of 8p, an increase of 0.25p.
Gravure printing of Sunday supplements and magazines like Marie Claire is
becoming an increasingly international business. Watmoughs hopes the Spanish
plant will give it a platform for the southern European market. Mr Walker
hopes to cash in on being a specialised printer, unlike the publishing
groups Bertelsmann of Germany and Hachette of France, Spain's main existing
gravure printers.
The majority stake Watmoughs purchased last year in Revai, a Hungarian
printer, has already given it a web-offset capacity with which to develop
new markets in eastern Europe, Mr Walker said.
The company already has about half the Sunday supplement market in the UK,
and also prints travel and mail order catalogues.
Since its launch in 1988, Hello magazine has had a marked success in the UK,
rising to a weekly circulation of 520,000. Packed with news of the rich and
famous - a critical interview is as likely to be printed as a picture of a
Calcutta slum.
Hola magazine, published with Hello by Hola SA, has an average weekly print
run of 750,000 while Blanco y Negro, published by Prensa Espanola, has a
720,000 print run.
Analysts expect the plant to be dilutive on earnings this year, requiring an
increase in borrowings that will lift gearing to a maximum of 40 per cent
before the plant becomes cash generative in 1994.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GWR shares up since SCPSA man died
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Great Western Resources, the USM-quoted oil, gas and coal company,
have doubled from 5 1/2 p to last night's close of 12p, in the two weeks
since a key figure in a court case involving GWR died.
The company has made no public announcement. It said yesterday that it would
not have been appropriate to comment on the death of Mr Joe Norman, one of
three defendants in a case alleging civil conspiracy injuring the South
Carolina Public Services Authority, which was at one time GWR's single
largest customer.
Mr Norman, a former employee of SCPSA, died from a gunshot wound on February
2.
SCPSA had charged GWR's coal division, Mr Clyde Goins, its former president,
and Mr Norman with conspiracy, fraud and unfair trade practices. In papers
filed in a South Carolina state court, SCPSA alleged, among other things,
that Great Western Coal and Mr Goins secretly paid Mr Norman to violate his
duties as SCPSA's purchasing manager.
When asked whether the death of Mr Norman would affect the litigation, Mr
Howard Wolf, GWR chairman, said: 'As every student of geometry knows, three
points make a plane. If one of those points is removed, obviously there has
been a change.'
However, Mr John Tiencken, general counsel at SCPSA, said: 'The litigation
is ongoing and the death of Joe Norman does not negatively impact our case.'
He added that SCPSA's civil case against GWR would proceed as soon as
appeals by GWR were disposed of in two federal courts.
In recent weeks, three directors have purchased GWR shares: Mr Gary
Loveless, who bought 1m at 8p on Tuesday, Mr Bill Syson, who bought 150,000
at 6p on February 4, and Mr Wayne Phelan who bought 104,167 at 12.6p last
night.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BTP calls for Pounds 28m to help complete
European jigsaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the specialist chemicals and industrial group, yesterday announced a
Pounds 28.3m rights issue, part of which will be spent on two French
adhesives businesses.
The 1-for-6 issue at 205p was launched with the group's share price of 252p
virtually at an all-time high after outperforming the market by more than 40
per cent in the past year. It closed down 8p.
The Pounds 8.8m purchase of Lambiotte and TRL, from Borden France and
Sofragraf respectively, will continue the continental expansion of the
Mydrin adhesives and textile coatings businesses that was first pushed
forward via a rights issue 20 months ago. That funded the Pounds 15.5m
purchase of Cerestar, the west German-based adhesives concern.
Mr Frank Buckley, chairman and chief executive, said continental activities
already extended to Scandinavia and Italy. France was 'the last hole in the
European jigsaw'.
With an annual operating profit in the new subsidiaries of Pounds 1.41m on
sales of Pounds 23m, there was scope to improve margins towards the 9 per
cent average for the chemicals division. They would take the continental
share of group turnover up to 34 per cent.
However, Mr Buckley said the most exciting project, which would take up
Pounds 4.5m of the issue proceeds, was the building of a factory near
Blackburn to produce preservatives for water-based industrial products.
Environmental concerns were pushing many of these products away from
solvents, but the water-based alternatives 'have to be preserved because
bugs grow in water'.
BTP had 60 per cent of the world market for preservatives for cosmetics and
toiletries, but this field was tiny compared with industrial applications,
he said. The new factory, part of the biocides division, would be additional
to the group's normal annual capital spending of about Pounds 5.5m.
Another Pounds 9.8m is earmarked for further deals, including a joint
venture in India costing about Pounds 4m.
Initially the proceeds will wipe out debt of between Pounds 12m and Pounds
13m - gearing of 20 per cent. Mr Buckley said the group would have Pounds 8m
to Pounds 9m cash at its March year-end.
Analysts are forecasting a rise of less than Pounds 1m in pre-tax profit
from last year's Pounds 18m, with earnings per share reduced to about 15.2p
(15.81p) by extra shares in issue.
The company intends to raise the final dividend to 5.75p, giving an expected
total of 8.85p, a 5 per cent rise.

<TEXT>
Allied Leisure, the tenpin bowling and nightclub group, yesterday reported a
slight increase in interim profits, but only after a drop in interest
charges after last year's Pounds 16m rights issue.
Pre-tax profits in the 25 weeks to January 5, rose from Pounds 1.63m to
Pounds 1.65m on sales up 18 per cent at Pounds 10.6m. Interest fell from
Pounds 1.04m to Pounds 788,000.
The group has also written off its investment in loss-making theme bars,
taking a Pounds 3.23m extraordinary charge that includes anticipated losses
until they are sold.
Mr Richard Carr, chairman, said the recession had created the most
challenging trading conditions the company had ever experienced, but that it
had 'managed much better than the majority' of its competitors.
Bowling produced more than 90 per cent of operating profits, after profits
from the dancing division fell by two thirds to Pounds 295,000.
Earnings per share fell from 6.92p to 3.69p but the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.5p.

ICI already owns Valentine in France and the move fills a gap in the British

fragmented niche market in which only small quantities of high-value,
specialised coatings are used. ICI, however, will now be able to add its
Autocolor products to Valentine's, usingBarnices' distribution network.
The price was not disclosed at Barnices' request, but is unlikely to be

GENERAL Consolidated Investment Trust reported a net asset value of 155.6p
at December 31 - an advance of 12.7 per cent over the previous year's 138p.
Sir Mark Thomson, chairman of this split-level trust, said its

Many had reduced or omitted dividend payments in an attempt to conserve cash
resources, he said.
Net revenue edged ahead to Pounds 4.76m (Pounds 4.7m), while earnings per
income share emerged at 10.7p, a marginal rise on the previous year's
10.67p.
As intimated in November, a final distribution of 2.75p is proposed,
maintaining the total for the year at 10.41p.
A dividend of 3.23p is recommended on the stepped preference shares.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wickes confident despite Pounds 6.72m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WICKES, the DIY and timber group which ran into severe financial problems as
a result of an ill-judged acquisition, yesterday said it was turning round
in spite of the continuing recession and an annual pre-tax deficit of Pounds
6.72m.
In the second half, the group produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.2m,
although this was not sufficient to offset a first half deficit of Pounds
12.9m. Last year it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.85m.
Sales in the year fell from Pounds 623.9m to Pounds 526.8m. Losses per share
were reduced to 2.1p (3.5p).
No dividend is declared although the company said it was its intention to
resume dividends in 1992.
Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said the turnround was the result of
corrective action taken at the end of 1990 to sort out its troubled Hunter
and Malden timber businesses.
'As both these business move into profit the bleeding that has been so
painful over the past 18 months will come to a stop,' he said.
Wickes's core DIY retailing businesses continued to perform strongly with
its UK division increasing pre-tax profits by 24 per cent.
The operations in mainland Europe produced an 80 per cent improvement in
pre-tax profits. During the first half of this year the group will open
Wickes was able to cut borrowings substantially following a rights issue in
March. Debt fell by Pounds 53m to Pounds 87.9m.
Mr Sweetbaum said there had been little sign of economic recovery but he was
nevertheless confident of an improving trend in profitability.
COMMENT
The strength of Wickes's core business has never been in doubt even though
its disastrous diversification into timber threatened its very survival. And
with the numbers on the timber side eventually heading the right way, Wickes
is re-emerging as a plausible recovery play. The company's specialist niche
at the heavy end of the DIY market has protected it from the flak of the
price war that has recently beset the mainstream DIY sector and it has
continued to make encouraging progress in mainland Europe. Assuming no
further nasty lurches in the economy, analysts are looking for pre-tax
profits of Pounds 15m in the current year which offers a prospective
multiple of almost 17 on yesterday's share price, which was 2p higher at
66p. Wickes's attractions have hardly gone unnoticed by the market but the
shares may still offer good value on any weakness.

A MUCH reduced operating surplus and exceptional charges hit William Jackson
in the half year ended October 27. Pre-tax profit plunged from Pounds 1.85m
to Pounds 431,000.
Mr Peter Oughtred, chairman, said the recession, pre-letting costs at

The company trades as a baker, meat products manufacturer, and discount
stores operator.
Turnover rose to Pounds 101.4m (Pounds 99.2m) but operating profit fell to
515,000 (Pounds 2.39m). Exceptional charges were Pounds 322,000 comprising
profit of Pounds 782,000 on sale of surplus stores less reorganisation
expense of Pounds 460,000.
Earnings per share were 18.21p (45.26p).

FT  13 FEB 92 / Profits for the thundering herd: Merrill Lynch's efforts to
shake off its wire-house image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrill Lynch has an identity problem, although it may not seem a
particularly pressing issue for a company that has just reported record
profits of Dollars 696m (Pounds 384m) for 1991.
Merrill has long been known as the king of the US wire houses, the Wall
Street firms whose armies of brokers send by wire their customers' stock
orders to the markets in New York. In recent years, however, the company has
changed shape, a process which accelerated at the end of the 1980s as
excessive costs and unfavourable market conditions led to losses and a rapid
restructuring.
Merrill, known as the 'thundering herd' on Wall Street, has emerged a
hybrid, a one-stop financial services giant with a large presence in retail
stockbroking, wholesale capital markets, institutional investment banking
and asset management. The company, therefore, dislikes being categorised as
merely a retail stockbroker. 'We are always fighting our wire-house image,'
says chief executive Mr William Schreyer.
Merrill's strength as a wire house helped fuel last year's record earnings.
Lower interest rates attracted investors to equities and lured companies
into issuing billions of dollars of bonds and stocks. Merrill, the largest
stockbroker and underwriter of debt and equity, reaped the benefits.
Merrill's wire-house strength also encouraged big growth in its asset
management business, as the company's network of brokers persuaded
stockbroking clients to hand their assets over to Merrill for management.
Mr Daniel Tully, Merrill's president, explained how the company forged new
skills from old strengths: 'We stopped asking, 'what do we have to sell?'
and instead asked, 'what do our clients want to buy?''
As a result Merrill now manages Dollars 435bn of client funds, making it the
largest custodian of individual assets in the US.
Although expansion of the asset management business has been part of a plan
to smooth the earnings stream by bolstering fee-based revenues, stockbroking
remains the most important source of revenue.
Taking a 10-year view, the percentage of operating revenues accounted for by
commissions has fallen sharply. In 1981 it was 42 per cent while last year
it was down to 32 per cent.
Although earnings from principal transactions and investment banking grew
during the decade, the biggest difference was in the amount Merrill made
from looking after investors' money.
At the start of the 1980s, fees from asset management and custodial business
were so small they did not get a mention in the annual report. Ten years
later, they make up 12 per cent of operating revenues, bringing in income of
Dollars 774m in 1991.
Estimates put Merrill's 'recurring revenue' at between 25 per cent and 30
per cent of earnings. Yet Mr John Keefe, a brokerage analyst at Lipper
Analytical, argues that Merrill is still a hostage to market cycles.
The difference between a good quarter and a bad quarter remains considerable
 -for example, Dollars 372m between the fourth quarter of 1990 and the
second quarter of 1991. Of that gap, Mr Keefe says about Dollars 60m was
accounted for by repeat revenues, while the remainder originated from
trading, banking and broking commissions.
If Merrill is still largely a wire house, it is at least a slimmer wire
house. During the 1980s Merrill over-expanded, and by the latter half of the
decade the company was overmanned and its staff overpaid.
In 1989 the management adopted what Mr Schreyer terms a 'lean and
tough-minded' approach to cost management. Merrill took a charge, layers of
management were eliminated, unprofitable lines of business were sold, and
the workforce reduced from 47,000 to 38,000.
'In two years we took Dollars 400m out of our basic cost structure,' boasted
Mr Schreyer.
The effect on profitability was dramatic. In 1990, Merrill's return on
equity was 6 per cent. By the end of 1991 it had risen to more than 20 per
cent.
However, Merrill still has weaknesses. In investment banking the company is
the biggest stock and bond underwriter, but it dominates the less
profitable, bulk end of the business.
Its lack of an extensive network of established corporate contacts means
Merrill has less of a presence in the businesses that pay higher fees, such
as initial public offerings, and in the high-margin world of mergers and
acquisitions. In 1991 it ranked fourth in the league table of top Wall
Street M&amp;A advisers.
A key problem is that in the eyes of many big US corporations, Merrill is
still regarded as a retail broker lacking the wholesale investment banking
experience and institutional reach of Morgan Stanley or First Boston. Hence
Merrill's uneasiness with the 'wire house' tag.
Mr Schreyer acknowledges the weaknesses, and says more time is needed to
build up M&amp;A. However, Merrill will not chase market share for the sake of
becoming number one. 'We have learned that you don't have to win all 10
events to win the decathlon,' he said.
In spite of the turnaround in returns, the tighter controls on costs, and
the record earnings, perceptions about the quality of the company's
management have been slower to change.
Mr Schreyer and his number two, Mr Tully, have endured criticism, mostly
about the rise in costs during the 1980s.
In 1989, with Merrill knee-deep in red ink, such criticisms seemed valid.
Today, however, Wall Street sings a different tune about the Schreyer-Tully
partnership. Mr James Hanbury, analyst at Wertheim Schroder, says: 'Yes,
they were responsible for the blow-up of expenses and the disastrous results
in the 1980s, but they're still there. You give them the blame for the
crummy results, and the credit for the good ones.'
What of the future? 'We are the only firm in the world that does not have to
compete with Merrill Lynch,' says Mr Schreyer. His partner thinks there is
room for expansion in the fee-based business, thanks to the greying of
America and the demands of newly middle-aged baby boomers.
The company, however, still makes more money from stockbroking than from any
other business. Given this reliance on market-related earnings, whether it
can thrive during a prolonged market slump will be the real measure of the
new Merrill.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Reuters profits increase 6.3% in spite of fall in new orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS Holdings, the financial information and news company, reported a 6.3
per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 340.3m, in spite of
continuing weak conditions in its traditional markets.
The number of employees fell by 475 to 10,335 and the group incurred
rationalisation costs of Pounds 23.5m in Europe and North America. It also
warned that further cuts might be necessary this year.
Mr Peter Job, managing director, said Reuters had experienced a big fall in
new orders at the end of 1990, and had reacted by improving efficiency.
He added: 'In the near term, market recovery is not in sight and we expect
revenue growth to slow further in 1992, particularly since, in response to
our customers' needs, we have generally avoided increasing prices.'
Turnover rose 7.1 per cent to Pounds 1.47bn in the year to December 31,
while earnings per share increased 10.5 per cent to 54.7p (49.5p).
Strong cash flow increased net cash from Pounds 217.1m to Pounds 502.9m and
interest income rose from Pounds 30.4m to Pounds 49.6m.
Because of its strong balance sheet, Reuters increased the final dividend to
12.3p (10.6p), raising the total by 13.3 per cent to 17p. The dividend cover
falls from 3.29 to 3.21.
Reuters said the long-delayed second phase of Dealing 2000, its automated
trading system which enables foreign exchange traders to complete
transactions on-screen, had been successfully tested by 30 banks in London
and New York. The group plans a formal launch within weeks.
Reuters had also satisfactorily tested Globex, which will provide
screen-based trading of futures and options. Globex is being created jointly
by Reuters with the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and is to be launched later this year.
Mr Job said Reuters had been under great pressure to provide more
information about the group, and for the first time had broken down
operating profits by geographical area, excluding the rationalisation
provisions and central costs of Pounds 113.8m.
It said Europe contributed Pounds 305m, compared with Pounds 312m in 1990;
Asia Pacific Pounds 124m, up from Pounds 110m; America a loss of Pounds 5m,
compared with a loss of Pounds 8m. Visnews, its television agency, made
Pounds 1m (Pounds 4m).
Reuters shortened the depreciation period for its subscriber terminals from
five to four years, at a cost of Pounds 29m.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Burton chief takes Pounds 750,000 pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Laurence Cooklin, who succeeded Sir Ralph Halpern as chief executive of
Burton Group, is leaving the company after little more than a year in the
post with a pay-off of Pounds 773,000.
The company provided no official reason for his departure although analysts
suggested that Mr Cooklin had not performed with sufficient vigour to
impress Burton's non-executive directors.
Mr John Hoerner, a 52-year-old American who previously ran Debenhams
department stores, took over as chief executive yesterday. His priority will
be to address the future strategy of Burton's struggling fashion multiples,
such as Burton, Top Shop, Top Man and Dorothy Perkins, which many industry
observers believe are unsuitable for the changed retailing climate of the
1990s.
Mr Cooklin, who had been on the Burton board for 12 years, was intimately
linked with the Halpern era. His compensation package was certainly
reminiscent of Burton's extravagant years which saw its directors receiving
substantial bonuses.
Sir Ralph Halpern received a Pounds 2m pay-off when he left the company in
November 1990 and two other departing directors, Mr Paul Plant and Mr
Michael Wood, received compensation packages of Pounds 600,000 and Pounds
350,000 respectively. Mr Cooklin is also entitled to unspecified bonus
payments deferred from past years.
Burton's remaining executive directors have all been appointed since Sir
Ralph's departure.
Ms Kimlan Cook, retail analyst at stockbrokers County NatWest, said Mr
Cooklin had helped remedy some of the worst mistakes of the past. 'But he
failed to make the necessary radical changes to the fashion multiples,' she
said.
Verdict, the retail consultancy, is about to publish a study which shows
that Burton steadily lost market share in the year to August. Mr Richard
Hyman, Verdict's director, estimated that Burton's share of the Pounds
17.3bn UK clothing market had fallen from 9.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent.
'The significance of Burton's figures has to be placed in the context of a
strategy that has seen them sacrificing margin to maintain volume. They have
given away margin and they have lost market share,' he said.
Mr Richard North, Burton's finance director, said Burton had since stemmed
this loss of market share and was perhaps now regaining it.

FT  13 FEB 92 / BZW scraps leaked research report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, yesterday
announced it was scrapping a controversial research report after leaks of
its conclusions hit the share prices of the companies concerned.
The move by the broker follows complaints from some of the companies that
the report was inaccurate and misleading.
In a statement issued through the Stock Exchange yesterday, BZW said: 'Some
comments in that report were capable of misunderstanding; this, and as a
result (of) certain press comment, may have given rise to an inaccurate
perception of the financial position of these companies.'
A draft of the report is believed to have been sent to a number of
investment institutions at the end of last week, attracting press comment.
It concerned the likely effects of accounting changes proposed by the
Accounting Standards Board on the published figures of five companies:
Fisons, P&amp;O, Cable &amp; Wireless, Ladbroke and British Airways.
At least three of the companies - Fisons, Cable &amp; Wireless and British
Airways - said yesterday the BZW draft contained inaccuracies, and they had
complained to the broker about these. The companies declined to describe the
alleged inaccuracies.
'We were in touch with BZW, and pointed out inaccuracies in their statement
and examples which were open to misinterpretation,' BA said. Cable &amp;
Wireless added: 'We considered that the information that was coming out was
misleading. On the basis of what we saw, we made representations to them
(BZW).'
The BZW paper is believed to have redrafted the five companies' accounts as
they would look under sweeping changes proposed to UK accounting by the ASB.
The resulting earnings per share, balance sheet gearing or both would have
deteriorated in each case, the broker is believed to have said.
Mr Bill Smith, head of UK research at BZW, said early press comment on the
report had been wrong, and added: 'It was not a position we wanted to see
continue, and this was the best way of dealing with it.'
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, said yesterday that redrafting
published accounts to the board's proposed new formats should not have had
any impact on the companies' share prices because it involved looking at
existing information in a new way.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Branson poised for Virgin Music deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD BRANSON is in advanced talks to sell all or part of his record
publishing arm Virgin Music Group, the world's largest independent record
label.
He said last night: 'We have had some considerable approaches at a level I
wouldn't dismiss out of hand in the way I have done over the last 20 years.'
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank handling the valuation, have had
discussions with several bidders this year including German publishing giant
Bertelsmann, and Thorn EMI, the UK electronics and entertainment group.
Mr Branson said he would be more interested in an alliance 'and it would be
nice if it were a European company'.
Mr Branson has been receiving suitors for the music group for nearly a year
although he has denied a sale was imminent.
He is understood to have commissioned a preliminary valuation of the music
group's library of rights last autumn. Talks began soon afterwards with
Thorn EMI and the initial asking price is understood to have been around
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 558.5m).
Mr Branson has had less contact with the music business in recent years,
although he said last night he would not want to leave the business
entirely. The change in his interests is understood to be one reason for the
discussions. A second is believed to be his other businesses' long-term need
for capital.
Mr Branson took the Virgin Group off the stock market in 1988. His airlines,
retail, communications and music businesses are run separately.
Since then, the companies have needed an annual injection of some tens of
millions of pounds, partly for investment in airlines and retailing. Mr
Branson has sold minority stakes in the airlines, music and retail to a
series of partners.
The music group is now 25 per cent owned by Fujisankei Communications, the
Japanese group, which paid Dollars 150m in 1989.
In the last filed accounts, the music group's turnover in the year to July
1990 was Pounds 308.6m, of which Pounds 274m was recording, Pounds 30m music
publishing and Pounds 5m the recording studios. It made an operating profit
of Pounds 22.9m, Pounds 17.9m from the recording business.
Bertelsmann AG, whose New York-based music group had turnover last year of
DM3.5bn (Pounds 1.22bn), confirmed last night talks had taken place.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: A gratuitous comparison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J D A EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, British Rail managers have to have thick skins but should they really
have to put up with being likened by Mr Jonathan Price to a group of
Communist party officials running an east German Kombinat (Letters, February
10)?
Perhaps Mr Price would like to say how many such groups have consistently
reduced operating costs over recent years; halved their dependence on
government grant; turned round a major component of their business from
substantial loss to significant profit; and stand comparison with the best
in Europe on productivity and cost-effectiveness in spite of enjoying a far
lower share of national resources?
Does he have any idea of the fundamental changes taking place in BR in
organisation, in restructuring working arrangements, in programmes for
quality, safety and culture change?
It is ironic that your paper's same edition mentions a project to build the
Waterloo International Terminal which is on time, on budget and on its way
to providing a thoroughly modern, fitting gateway for the coming Channel
tunnel services. Where is the eastern European parallel for that?
There is much to be done to improve railway services in Britain and
management undoubtedly has its part to play.
But the debate and performance of the railways will be helped by
constructive, informed comment rather than by gratuitous abuse.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: Never mind childcare, what about the over-40s?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs JANET L JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It makes my blood boil every time I read yet more inches of newsprint
on the subject of childcare facilities for working mothers. It seems to have
escaped the notice of the powers-that-be that there are armies of women who
are past child-bearing age but willing and able to work for another 20 years
before reaching pension age.
Where are the jobs or concern for these women?
One would be forgiven for imagining that women between the ages of 40 and 60
did not exist] If one has the misfortune to fall into that category, the job
prospects are poor, if not nil, after the age of 50, despite having years of
good experience under our belts. Which is why I have been forced to obtain
employment in Libya - the last outpost of the middle-aged secretary] In the
UK they are, apparently, unemployable.
On one of the few occasions when I secured an interview last year (for a
low-grade, low-paid job), and having presented my credentials stating I had
30 years' experience and for the past six years had been employed as an
executive secretary, I was obliged to take a spelling test] We may be
regarded as dinosaurs - but we are not cretins]
If there is indeed an actual or projected shortfall in the workforce, owing
to decreased numbers of school-leavers, why are mothers of small children
targeted for vacancies? We exist, too, and we do not demand nursery
facilities. Are employers too short-sighted to recognise this fact?
Incidentally, I raised four children, as a working mother and made my own
childcare arrangements, when it became necessary to return to work 20 years
ago. Nobody ever wet-nursed me]

FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: Public sector pay rises a missed opportunity to hold
down inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From CHRIS TRINDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Pay rises above inflation for 1.5m public employees' (February 11)
you contrast the government's decision to implement in full the Pay Review
Body recommendations for nurses, teachers, armed forces and doctors, with
the Confederation of British Industry evidence that pay settlements of 4.1
per cent in manufacturing are at their lowest level since 1980. However, the
full implications could perhaps be spelt out more fully.
There is first the public sector externality effect for 1992 of this week's
announcement. The review body pay awards set the parameters for the rest of
the public service. More than half of the National Health Service staff had
their pay increases announced this week, and the remainder - although they
may not do so well - see these settlements as the benchmark for their own
negotiations. Similarly, the teachers' pay settlement is closely watched by
other local authority employees.
But on this occasion there may also be a private sector effect and
follow-through public sector effect into 1993. The review body groups'
settlements this year were partly based on comparability with private sector
earnings increases in the year up until autumn 1991. The current steep fall
in private sector settlements, while welcome, is fragile. The slightest sign
that the government is not serious about the consequences of not keeping pay
rates down, now that we are in the ERM, could lead to a weakening of this
private sector resolve. And if private sector pay in 1992 is higher than it
would otherwise have been, then next year's Pay Review Body settlements will
be higher, too.
Ahead of the election, the government could have given an unambiguous signal
to help ratchet down pay increases to the new permanent lower levels of
inflation. This one chance window of opportunity has now been missed.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: Sponsors of the arts should be given credit for
their role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN TWEEDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Massil's letter (February 8) on business sponsorship of the arts
shows he has no understanding not only of arts sponsorship, but also of arts
funding. No government has funded the arts to everyone's satisfaction. As Mr
Massil knows, there were sponsors in ancient Greece, though his comments on
sponsorship of the Parthenon make no sense.
Business has no moral or legal obligation to fund the arts. Sponsorship is a
business deal, a transaction where both sides benefit. If the media
steadfastly refuses to credit sponsors then the business rationale within a
company becomes increasingly difficult. No sponsor is asking for its logo to
be emblazoned across Frances Barber's bosom in the National Theatre's Night
of the Iguana. Data General is seeking recognition for its sponsorship of
this wonderful new production - are the four words 'sponsored by Data
General' too much to ask? Fortunately not, in the FT at least, though other
newspapers have been slower in following this lead.
ABSA stresses that sponsorship should be a supplement to, never a substitute
for, government support. Business is a partner with government, central and
local. Sponsors, by bringing their guests to 'hospitality rooms' and then a
performance, are increasing the potential audiences to the arts. Hostility
towards business is an example of ignorant prejudice. The arts need the
support of business - let us encourage more money from the private sector,
not less.

TOMORROW MARKS a crunch point for Algeria in two respects.
At home, it is the first Friday since the High Council of State, the
country's supreme authority since President Chadli Bendjedid was deposed on
January 11, decreed a state of emergency and banned the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS). The biggest disturbances in recent weeks have always followed
Friday prayers, and the FIS, before being banned, had called a protest march
for tomorrow.
Abroad, eight international banks are meeting in Paris to decide whether to
proceed with a Dollars 1.5bn loan, intended to refinance Algeria's
commercial bank debt. The country owes roughly Dollars 5bn to commercial
banks (two-thirds of it to the Japanese), but its total foreign debt amounts
to Dollars 23.9bn, of which well over half is owed to foreign governments.
France, the largest single creditor, believes a rescheduling package would
be more realistic than refinancing, given Algeria's already heavy 70-75 per
cent debt service ratio. The Japanese banks, by contrast, firmly reject the
idea of rescheduling.
On a technical level, the solution could be simple in principle even if
complex in detail: an agreement to refinance the commercial debt, while
rescheduling the government loans. But the French are quite right to see a
connection between the debt and Algeria's political problems.
Restricted growth
By swallowing up such a large proportion of the country's export earnings,
the debt has severely restricted growth, causing very high unemployment,
especially in the 16-24-year-old age group which constitutes a vast
reservoir of demonstrators and rioters for the FIS. In turn, instability
deters foreign investment.
Governments are unsure whether to provide more financial support to a state
trying desperately to contain Islamic fundamentalism or, on the contrary, to
withhold it from a state which has ignored the popular will expressed
through the ballot box, and has now suspended many freedoms.
High stakes
The stakes are high, especially for Europe. It is all too easy to imagine
Algerian boat people, fleeing across the Mediterranean from civil war or
from a militant Islamic regime.
Since no political solution is imaginable without some room for economic
manoeuvre, Algeria's creditors should be generous in the short term. But
they should also make it clear to Algeria's rulers that they do not see the
restoration of order and state authority, however necessary, as a solution
in itself. Indeed it may not even be possible without some kind of political
dialogue - for which the FIS at present, with its leaders either in prison
or on the run, is no more prepared than the government.
Algeria's record in foreign policy is almost as good as its record in
domestic policy is bad. It brokered, for example, the solution of the
US-Iranian hostage crisis in 1980-81, and its present foreign minister, Mr
Lakhdar Brahimi, was the architect of the Taif agreement which has brought
civil peace to Lebanon. The time may soon come for the Algerian government
to accept some help from others that it has helped in the past - notably
Saudi Arabia and Iran - in seeking a way out of its own domestic troubles.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN JAPAN'S foreign minister, Mr Michio Watanabe, says that redenominating
the yen would take Japan out of recession, he is talking through his hat.
But Mr Watanabe's idea still deserves more than the brush-off it received
from the Bank of Japan.
Why should the Japanese, excellently educated though they are, have to
employ advanced mental arithmetic to buy a house for several hundred million
yen? Meanwhile, in Italy even a newspaper costs L1,200. The individual
measures of a useful unit of account should have meaningful purchasing
power. Yet an individual lira or yen buys nothing. Things are worse for
policy-makers. At an annualised Y455,600,000,000,000 in late 1991, Japan's
gross national product looks still more overwhelming than it is. And what of
Italian public debt, now at some L1,400,000,000,000,000? The number is too
big to comprehend. No wonder Italian politicians are paralysed.
If the lira were divided by a thousand, it would overtop the D-Mark. If the
yen were divided by a thousand, it would be worth Dollars 8, making it a
suitable symbol for Japan's dynamic economy. So, altogether now: two, four,
six, eight: it's time to redenominate.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Personal View: The problem of plutonium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WALKER and FRANS BERKHOUT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine the plight of a producer compelled by government inertia and past
contracts to pay over the odds for obsolete and potentially dangerous
materials. This is the unenviable situation of the nuclear electricity
producers in Europe and Japan - and the problem is plutonium.
Plutonium is one of the materials recovered from spent nuclear fuel during
reprocessing. Separated from the uranium and waste in spent fuel rods, it
can power conventional or 'fast' reactors. This permits recycling and is an
alternative to storing spent fuel.
The difficulty is that the economics of reprocessing have changed since the
1970s. Twenty years ago, countries with nuclear power programmes believed
that reprocessing would help reduce the volume of radioactive wastes, and so
ease disposal problems. It would also produce the plutonium considered to be
an essential fuel for the next generation of reactors.
But plutonium-fuelled fast reactors have been expensive and prone to
technical mishap. Storing spent fuel is cheaper than reprocessing, and a
recent study for the German government shows that the costs of eventually
disposing of it are close to those of dealing with wastes from reprocessing.
Furthermore, uranium - used in conventional reactors - has become plentiful
and cheap. The electrical utilities in Europe and Japan which signed
contracts in the 1970s and 1980s with the British and French reprocessing
companies prefer it to plutonium.
These companies - British Nuclear Fuels and Cogema respectively - responded
to the early demand for reprocessing by building a facility (Thorp) at
Sellafield, in the north-west of England, and two at La Hague, in Normandy.
One of the La Hague plants began operating in 1990. The other is expected to
come on stream in 1992-93, as is Thorp. Some 15,000 tonnes of spent fuel
have already been delivered to these plants.
About 190 tonnes of plutonium will be produced by the new plants over the
next decade. Large amounts are also likely to come from dismantled US and
Soviet warheads. A great deal of plutonium is therefore becoming available
when there is no commercial need for it.
Under their contracts with the reprocessors, the European and Japanese
utilities must take back their radioactive wastes and the plutonium
separated from them.
This creates a further problem for the governments of the countries
concerned. An unwritten rule of international politics forbids states with
no nuclear weapons from amassing more plutonium than is required to meet
commercial needs. Germany and Japan in particular find themselves in a bind.
As their spent fuels are reprocessed in Britain and France, they will gain
title to more than 30 tonnes of plutonium which, if not used, would put them
in breach of the rule.
To consume this surplus plutonium, Germany and Japan have made plans to use
it in mixed-oxide (Mox) fuels in existing reactors. The snag is that Mox
fuels are expensive and politically controversial on safety and
environmental grounds. Utilities face problems in getting licences for
enough of the reactors to take the fuel.
Plutonium consumption will lag far behind production. This has long been the
case in Britain which has stockpiled 34 tonnes of plutonium.
But the costs cannot be counted in commercial terms alone. Plutonium is a
nuclear weapons material and because of its toxicity is a potential
environmental threat. These two facts make plutonium transport a fraught
political issue. This is true particularly for Japan. From August,
repatriating its plutonium will involve an armed Japanese ship regularly
crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This prospect has already aroused
the territorial sensitivities of countries on the route.
Government officials know that the policy of supporting the reprocessing of
nuclear fuel to obtain plutonium for which there is no ready market no
longer makes sense. Before plutonium begins to accumulate at La Hague and
Sellafield, these officials should bring together the parties to the
reprocessing contracts and break the present impasse.
If the conclusion is that the reprocessing plants should not operate, so be
it. The spent fuels can be stored instead, saving money and avoiding the
production of yet more plutonium.

A good night for schadenfreude. Redundant on BBC2 (8.00) investigates the
fortunes of two young City brokers who went from yuppiedom to redundancy.
George exchanged his BMW for a bike and Guy discovered that he was no longer
an eligible bachelor ..though the workhouse hardly looms since George had
insured himself against redundancy and Guy had 'put something aside for a
rainy day'.
The third part of C4's series The Germans (9.00) considers the once
unassailable Deutschmark and asks whether the economic miracle is over now
that the Germans are struggling with the huge cost of assimilating the

high unemployment.
BBC2's profile of another European country, Fire In The Blood, in which Ian
Gibson conducts us around Spain, is proving much the more impressive of
these overlapping series. Today: the rapidly changing position of women.
Those who have still never seen BBC Bristol's classic programme about the

FT  13 FEB 92 / Arts: Laurie Booth - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laurie Booth's newest piece, Requiair, is subtitled 'A Flight Dance', and
Nigel Coates' design is of a pair of white aeroplane wings hanging above the
dance area. Hans Peter Kuhn's sound installation is an often ravishing
sequence of noises interspersed with bird-song, faint curlew pipings, and
what may well be the first electronic celestial choir. We seem to be poised
between earth and heavens, as if on top of a windy hill-top - the Elizabeth
Hall's hideous and steeply raked auditorium encourages this feeling -
looking at dance that meditates upon ideas of flight and the aspirations
behind those ideas.
It is thus I interpret Booth's work for himself and four colleagues: Jo
Chandler, Desiree Cherrington, Gary Lambert and Ellen van Schuylenburch,
which received its London premiere on Tuesday and Wednesday. The dancers
wear unisex shirts and trousers in anonymous clayey shades and, like the
clothes, Booth's dances - which had an erotically challenging tension in
recent duets with Russell Maliphant - here look neutral, almost neutered.
The text, as displayed by Booth himself, is fascinating, because his own
movement style - sinuous, coloured by stunningly effective accelerandos that
melt into quiescent poses - is so richly varied. The dancer and the dance
become one. His companions, able dancers all, can nowhere match (as Russell
Maliphant can match, and indeed challenge) the many nuances of Booth's
bravura language. It owes something to martial arts, to T'ai Chi, to contact
improvisation, Indian dance and capoeira - whence come the flicker-quick
gesture and the long, logical flow of action. It owes as much to Booth's own
prodigious concentration, which draws us into his imaginative world. In
Requiair, the ideas are oblique, allusive: the manner of post-modern dance
is never going to provide the obvious imagery of aerial ecstasy that ballet
can furnish. Instead, Booth appears like a Daedalus, dreaming of escape by
flight. In one of the most touching and beautiful sections of the piece -
which is uneven, but often rewarding - Booth lies on the ground as Kuhn's
shimmering sound-world hangs above him, and seems to meditate upon movement
that he then starts to explore. In contrast, he also creates a trio for the
two men and himself which is a dazzlingly accented scherzo of contact games,
of falls, holds, and wild clamberings.
The dance runs for about 70 minutes. I think it too long, and because of the
dissipation of movement ideas among the cast, too diffuse: few of its massed
effects touch the potency of Booth's own presence. But it is also a work
from a secure and eminently gifted creator, whose vision of dancing is
strong, highly personal, and always convincing. The performance initiated
the annual 'Spring Loaded' festival of new dance which now moves to The
Place: there will be further reports in due course.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Arts: Making it Better - Hampstead Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This new play, by James Saunders, operates on many levels and does not quite
succeed on any one of them. Even so, I commend it. I found it witty,
intelligent and interesting until, somewhere in the middle of the second
half, a certain creakiness set in. In the space of two hours it covers a
woman's three contrasting love affairs; the ways in which Czechs and English
have used one another before and after 1989; issues of betrayal and
independence, manipulation and honesty, in both love and politics; and the
uses of drama.
Making it Better - which has already been playing in Vienna and which is
also opening now at the Theatre la Bruyere in Paris - does all this deftly,
urbanely and with a fair degree of humanity. For London theatre-goers it has
the added interest of presenting Jane Asher in its leading role.
The plot. An Englishwoman finds herself alone, after her husband of 20 years
has come out of the closet. (She met him in Prague in 1968 and, on their
return, married him 'on the rebound. I suppose I was in love with Prague.')
On a whim she picks up a middle-aged Czech and starts a casual affair with
him. Her husband meanwhile starts to carry on with another Czech, much
younger and prettier. Later, to the considerable chagrin of her husband and
the older Czech, she and the young man begin a serious affair. All this
occurs in the last half of 1989; a brief prologue and epilogue are set in
the present.
Diana and Adrian, the English wife husband, both work in Bush House for the
drama department of the World Service. Again, Saunders can find humour in
this. The point, however, is to bring drama itself up as a subject. With
Josef, who is plainly a highly cultured (and rather endearingly pompous)
man, this works. But, though I was convinced of young Tomas's intelligence,
I couldn't quite believe that he brought Diana to the point of discussing
'drama as a cultural weapon' immediately prior to orgasm - though she
assures us and him that he did. This in in Act Two, which tends to cover too
much ground too rapidly, leaving an impression of glibness.
Jane Asher has often played bitchy ex-wives with great success in recent
years; the role of Diana gives her a welcome variant on this. She's softer
here, though still witty, and only occasionally adopts a hard edge. She
sometimes overdoes little things (fidgeting during a tense scene with her
husband, unnaturally quick responses to other people's lines) and underdoes
big ones (her last, drunk, scene with Tomas). David De Keyser is absurdly
perfect as Josef, while Larry Lamb is, well, almost perfect, as the almost
absurd Adrian.
Rufus Sewell is marvellous as Tomas; voice, accent, cheekbones, eyes are all
used with a youthful Czech intensity that heightens the whole play. The
device of using half-banal World Service snippets during scene-changes
('More from the late great Buddy Holly later') pays dividends.
Michael Rudman's direction makes everything work smoothly. Maybe too much
so? At any rate, the production could not quite fend off the idea that
gathered in my head as the play neared its close; that really these
characters were all literary devices. Diana &amp; Co. amount to less than the
themes they raise. Which is another way of saying this play has too little
inner life. It also has some lumpy metaphors. The one about the British as
ducks is used so many different ways - water off a duck's back; plastic
duck; us dying ducks; the endearing way of the duck to surface from its
mucky dives - that it loses any serious use except to draw attention to
itself.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Arts: David Hockney designs 'Turandot'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Hockney's designs for Turandot are executed in glowing red, green, and
blue, with softer colours for some of the principals and a chorus in black
until it changes into rich blue for the brief finale. They provide a Hockney
show - in three dimensions and moving through time - of the utmost
brilliance and beauty. The designs were commissioned jointly by the Lyric
Opera of Chicago and the San Francisco Opera. While in New York the Met
revived its extravagant Turandot supershow, designed and produced by Franco
Zeffirelli, with Gwyneth Jones in the title role, Chicago played the
'Hockney Turandot' ten times, last month and this. It goes to San Francisco
next year.
Hockney said that he thought most productions of Turandot 'unbelievably
overdesigned.' He wanted 'to take out the dragons, to simplify it, to get
rid of the grotesque chinoiserie . . . no fussiness.' His Peking is built of
a few careful, striking shapes - red walls and green corrugated roofs
against a cobalt-blue sky. Perspective is not realistic, space not literal.
Light plays a major role, and Duane Schuler, Chicago's resident lighting
man, is one of America's best. The reds, greens, and blues gleam and glow
with carefully controlled intensities, the moonrise of the first scene is
magical, and the final musical crescendo is matched by a breathtaking
sunrise crescendo of light.
The approach is enchanted fairytale. Puccini characterised both the princess
and the prince as 'superhuman'; the psychology of the characters is not
subtle; and the pictorial style of the decor suits Turandot better than it
did Tristan. At the same time, the sets are designed to present the actors
with effective acting spaces (as the Met Turandot does not). The important
staircase of the riddle scene is not omitted.
The show has been criticised for being 'designer's opera', and so of course
it is, but the fault is not Hockney's. He has not yet found - not here any
more than in the Los Angeles Tristan he designed - a cast and a producer who
respond to and make the most of his visions. (May he do so in the Covent
Garden Frau ohne Schatten, his next operatic assignment.) This Turandot was
not mutually inspired teamwork such as one finds in the Peter Sellars
presentations. In all but the visual aspect it was pretty well hackwork.
Chicago is a very big house, and Ardis Krainik had engaged a big-voice
international Turandot and Calaf, Eva Marton and Lando Bartolini. They gave
their standard performances. Marton sang and moved through the role without
expression, usually loudly, sometimes rather coarsely. Bartolini has a
ringing tenor, which he used without subtlety, charm, or grace. Lucia
Mazzaria was the Liu; she, on the other hand, sought to give some light and
shade to the music, but her voice sounded worn and uncertain. Dimitri
Kavrakos's Timur was sonorous and wooden. The trio of masks had more merit:
an able young Ping, James Michael McGuire; a veteran Pang, Piero de Palma;
and a nimble Pong, Douglas Perry.
Bruno Bartoletti conducted, and William Farlow produced. As a musical or
dramatic enactment of Puccini's score, the result was without interest. As a
Hockney show, it was unforgettable.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Technology: Squeaky wheel gets the grease - R&amp;D / How the
funding for EC research projects is distributed and how to get it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE next race for European Community research funding has begun. On Tuesday,
the EC's 17 commissioners agreed an overall Community budget for the next
five years which will be worth Ecu 86bn (Pounds 61bn) annually by the time
it comes up for renewal in 1997. A chunk of this cash - some Ecu6.9bn - will
be available for 'internal policies', including research and development.
Exactly how it will be spent has yet to be decided - the Community is only
just getting round to handing out the Ecu 5.7bn earmarked for the 1990-94
programmes. But according to Martin Collins, a former EC project manager and
author of a new book* on applying for EC research funds, companies should
act now if they want to influence the European Commission's research policy.
'Now is the perfect time,' says Collins, who works in Brussels for Doornheim
Devries, a technology consultancy. 'The officials are just sitting down to
think about it and they'll be calling together all sorts of technical groups
to discuss the programmes in the next few months.'
EC research and technology funding is available principally through the
'framework programmes', aimed in theory at cross-border consortia carrying
out pre-competitive research - projects with long lead times. The money,
which is channeled through five different departments of the European
Commission**, normally covers up to 50 per cent of project costs. The
framework programme which officials are now working on is the fourth, which
will be divided into perhaps six strategic areas; they in turn will be split
into specific programmes aimed at, for example, information technology (the
programme known as Esprit) or advanced materials (Brite/Euram).
The fourth framework programme is likely to overlap with its predecessor,
which finishes in 1994. It could prove to be the most controversial
programme of Community-funded research yet. This is because research funding
provides excellent terrain for the battle between advocates of an
interventionist EC industrial policy and the free-marketeers.
There is already a forum for the funding of market-oriented projects - the
Eureka pan-European research programme
Its aims are broadly the same as the EC framework programme - to encourage
the competitiveness of European industry through cross-border co-operation -
but Eureka's 20-nation membership goes beyond the 12 EC states. It acts as a
central agency, bringing together partners who then apply for funding to
national governments or to the EC.
The most fundamental difference, however, and the one that makes Community
funds a more attractive prospect for many companies is that whereas Eureka
projects are spontaneous and conform to no set strategic plan, the scale and
direction of EC research funding can be assessed in advance.
There is a standard procedure candidates for EC research programmes must go
through. It usually lasts - from planning to a final decision - up to 18
months:
Experts decide a 'workplan' for a particular programme.
The Commission might ask for expressions of interest in the programme
through an announcement in its daily Official Journal.
A formal 'call for proposals' appears in the Journal giving details of the
programme. Further information may be distributed at special proposers' days
held in member states.
After the deadline, evaluation panels assess the technical merit of a
proposal, the reputation of those involved and the ability of the consortium
to achieve its aims.
A management committee examines the balance of the consortium and the way in
which the funds are likely to be distributed between member states.
The Commission negotiates with the consortium about its composition and its
budget and eventually passes the dossier on to the director-general of the
relevant Commission department for final approval.
It is important not to leave an application until the last moment. A company
which makes no move until the call for proposals appears may find itself
facing a deadline for applications as short as six weeks.
On the other hand, according to Collins's guide, a little foresight can give
a company a valuable inside track. Such a company might be able to influence
the direction of EC policy at the planning stage. It would certainly get to
know the kind of proposal which Commission officials were looking for and
the people to lobby during the technical evaluation of the project and
budget negotiations.
No company should underestimate the need to get inside the Commission
structure, either directly - by seeking representation on any of the
planning or assessment panels - or indirectly, by buttering up national
representatives and Commission officials, says Collins.
Successful lobbying, however, will be useless if it is not matched by a
judicious choice of consortium partners and an effectively drafted
application.
Choosing consortium members is still a mixture of cunning and common sense.
For example, it will obviously be an advantage to have partners with prior
experience of and perhaps influence in the applications process, and to
ensure that the consortium will not break apart because of simple problems
such as inability to communicate. In a more cynical vein, Collins also
advises candidates to pick at least one partner from Portugal, Spain or
Greece - to salve Brussels' conscience about the neglect of poorer EC
members - and to steer clear of Japanese partners, who might arouse the
underlying prejudice of some Commission officials.
For the application itself, the advice is straightforward: allow plenty of
time, perhaps three months, isolate the programme's objectives and selection
criteria and make sure you answer all of them.
The logistics of applying for EC research funds seem daunting. Once the
application has been lodged, candidates have to attend numerous meetings and
negotiations before a decision is made. And even assuming a consortium is
successful, about a third of its budget might have to be set aside to cover
the cost of attending regular meetings with partners and the Commission, and
the preparation and submission of progress reports to Brussels.
Given that sort of administrative commitment, it is unsurprising that many
companies have little energy left for the EC's vision of building a
'European Technology Community' and prefer to take the money and run. Even
if the goal is purely financial, is it really worth joining the race for
funding?
Collins has mixed feelings. On the one hand he knows a number of small
start-up companies which have established themselves by tapping into the
Commission network and drawing down research funding. But he adds: 'If you
already have a viable business, don't get side-tracked by EC grants, because
they can be so time-consuming and obviously the obligations you take on can
be so great they might distract you from the core business.'

<TEXT>
One night, as he mingled with other Tokyo businessmen intent on forgetting
their worries with a drink and a song, Seiya Matsumoto, president of
Pioneer, had a thought that was to alter the course of his company's
history.
The head of the Japanese audio company had been joining in a sing-along when
he noticed a drawback to the conventional karaoke format using audio tapes:
whenever someone asked for a song, everyone had to wait until it could be
found.
Matsumoto's experience led Pioneer to develop systems for karaoke using
laser discs, a move which was to mark the first significant success for the
group in its plan to become a diversified consumer electronics group and
establish its place in the growing market for audio visual products.
Since the early 1970s, Pioneer had been hoping to expand out of the
specialist audio market.
Although it had been producing TVs and experimenting with VTRs, Pioneer was
already well behind its bigger, stronger competitors which dominated the
market.
Pioneer was a small fish in the consumer electronics world and it was
looking for a new product with added value to give it a leading edge.
The laser disc provided just that. A digital video disc that combines the
high quality sound offered by digital recording with the improved picture
quality and the random access capability of laser technology, the laser disc
was a new medium which seemed to offer a wide range of applications.
Although originally invented by Philips, the Dutch company failed to market
the laser disc, which it called the CD-V, as a successful consumer product.
The problem, as with many entirely new technologies, was finding a use for
the laser disc that would justify the high cost for consumers of investing
in the hardware.
Pioneer's initial attempts to repackage existing software, such as popular
films and music, and producing practical guides to golf courses and
educational material, met with little success.
Rather than give up, as many others did, Pioneer forged ahead. It was years
after it started developing the laser disc that it stumbled, almost by
accident on the application that would win wide consumer acceptance. As a
result of its success with laser disc karaoke, Pioneer has achieved an
important objective - to build the group into an audio-visual company.
Its involvement with the laser disc has supported other new products such as
the projection cube which combines several 40-inch projection monitors for
large public display video screens. Pioneer, however, now needs to win wider
acceptance for its laser discs in western markets, which will mean
developing software appropriate to a western audience.
It plans to do this through straightforward marketing, rather than by
following other Japanese electronics manufacturers into acquisitions.
Another challenge is to find an alternative application for the laser disc
that will attract widespread consumer demand before the karaoke boom dies
out. If it waits too long, the appeal of laser karaoke could be overtaken by
interactive media being developed by competitors.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): White Horse shows a
lot of bottle - Efforts to promote Scotch whisky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Distillers, the Guinness spirits company, sold more bottles of its
White Horse Scotch whisky in Japan in the final quarter of 1991 than in the
preceding nine months.
It was the first evidence that a Pounds 2m, three-year investment in
repackaging the product was paying dividends.
For more than 100 years, White Horse has been one of the industry's leading
brands. Sir Peter Mackie, the Scottish distiller who launched it in 1890,
gave it a distinctive taste by using three particular malts in the blend -
Lagavulin from Islay, and Craigellachie and Glen Elgin from Speyside.
At a time when most distillers branded their products with their family
names, he also distinguished his whisky from competitors by naming it after
an Edinburgh tavern.
The White Horse brand rapidly gained popularity and sales as a result.
Today, Mackie's original blend is one of the top 10 Scotch whisky brands,
with total sales of 2m cases a year in about 100 countries.
The brand, part of UD's portfolio since the takeover of DCL in 1986,
occupies different positions in several markets. In the UK, for instance, it
is a 'value-for-money' brand, priced between UD's market leader, Bell's, and
the cheaper Vat 69. In Japan, White Horse leads the premium blended sector,
selling at Y3,800 (Pounds 13) a bottle compared with Johnnie Walker Red,
Cutty Sark and J&amp;B, at about Y2,500.
But UD's global marketing, with local adaptations, has been based on the
brand's long-established appeal to consumers. Advertising campaigns have
focused on the distinctive taste of the whisky and the images of freedom and
independence conveyed by wild white horses.
Three years ago, however, signs of a weak link in the marketing mix emerged
from consumer research in all the White Horse markets from Japan to South
Africa and South America.
David McNair, UD's brands director, says: 'The consistent message coming
back to us was that the packaging no longer did full justice to the brand'.
The bottle - a standard design in clear glass - and the labelling had been
largely unchanged for 30 years. They were seen as outdated, no longer
reflecting the brand values conveyed by the advertising. New designs were
developed and consumer reaction to them was researched in the UK and other
European countries, Japan, South America, and South Africa.
One design - a squat, slightly bell-shaped bottle - won approval for its
distinctive and contemporary appearance in every market but one. Japanese
whisky drinkers overwhelmingly plumped for an alternative: a tall bottle
with a short, angular neck.
The importance of the Japanese market persuaded UD to introduce the
preferred design last September. The rise in sales that has followed may
exaggerate the effect of the change, but there is no doubt the initial
impact on the market has been considerable.
In the UK and other world markets, the brand will be progressively
re-launched this year in the short, squat bottle, with a crisper, cleaner
look to the labelling.
UD's bottling lines in Glasgow have been modified and every aspect of the
design has been rigorously tested from its appearance on a supermarket shelf
to its ability to withstand the roughest handling.
The grooming of the White Horse has been a long, painstaking, and expensive
business but UD believes it will have greater appeal to consumers worldwide
as a result.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Business Law: Gulf war aftermath highlights risks of
performance bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN FEATHERSTONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic fall-out from the Gulf war has emphasised the inherent risks in
performance bonds which are used in international trade.
These bonds were designed to be easy to call on - but there is always the
corresponding danger that banks and British suppliers may have to honour
calls for repayment which are based on false statements made by purchasers.
Once a bond is in place, the law can do little or nothing to prevent
payment, no matter how unfair this may seem.
The current political situation in the Gulf, combined with the number of
British companies supplying goods to Iraq and involved in the ambitious
Iraqi building programme before war broke out, make it likely that a
disproportionately large amount of capricious claims will emerge from Iraq.
After the invasion of Kuwait the UK government, along with the European
Community and the US, imposed sanctions on Iraq, and these included the
prohibition of payment under performance bonds to Iraqi residents. Many
British suppliers must have been relieved: those who had failed to meet
commitments as a result of the Gulf war would not have to fund payment under
the bond as long as sanctions were in place.
However, once the sanctions are lifted, the banks will have to pay if they
receive a demand that meets the requirements of the bond, whatever the
circumstances. For this reason, banks must continue to safeguard their right
to claim a counter-indemnity from suppliers.
Suppliers have therefore found to their cost that banks are, quite
legitimately, not releasing security while there is a possibility that they
may have to make a payment under a bond. This possibility will remain unless
a demand under the bond is withdrawn or - and this is most unlikely - unless
the UK enacts further legislation to absolve suppliers and their banks from
liability to Iraqi banks and purchasers, in appropriate circumstances.
Current sanctions prevent all payments under performance bonds with Iraq -
even those called justifiably, in connection with events or defaults by
suppliers before the hostilities. Once sanctions are lifted, suppliers who
defaulted prior to hostilities will clearly not have grounds for complaint
when payment has to be made.
But more worryingly, some suppliers are bound to be victims of unjustifiable
calls; in addition, suppliers who are unable to meet their contracts because
of the hostilities will nevertheless be expected to pay if they receive a
call.
In order to understand the potential weaknesses of performance bonds more
fully, and to consider how to avoid capricious calls, it is necessary to
consider how the bonds work.
As a rule, a bond is issued by a bank at the request of its customer - the
supplier - who is selling goods or services to a purchaser, usually based in
another country. The bond is normally issued in favour of a purchaser's
local bank, so that he can pursue any claim in his home country.
The supplier agrees to indemnify his bank against any payment it might have
to make as a result of the bond. The supplier's bank then asks the local
bank to issue the bond and provides it with a similar indemnity.
This contract between the two banks may contain a pitfall for suppliers:
depending on how the bond is negotiated, the contract may be governed by the
law of the local bank. This is to be avoided if possible, as it may leave
suppliers uncertain as to how any dispute might be resolved.
The underlying contract between supplier and purchaser will almost certainly
provide that, if the supplier defaults, the purchaser can call on the bond.
He can do this by making a simple demand for repayment and, if required, by
producing relevant documents. It is important to bear in mind that the
purchaser does not need to prove any allegation of default.
When the purchaser makes a demand, this sets off a chain of indemnity. The
local bank is obliged to pay the purchaser, triggering the local bank's call
on the supplier's bank, and the supplier's bank's call on the supplier. The
banks are not concerned with any dispute as to whether the supplier is in
breach of his agreement with the purchaser. A bank which fails to pay
without good cause can suffer immense damage to its international
reputation.
The purchaser is not usually required to give reasons for his demand, apart
from, in some cases, a statement that the supplier is in breach of
obligations to the purchaser, or that the purchaser has asserted such a
breach. This means that unscrupulous purchasers can demand payments from the
bank or local bank, even if there has been no breach of the underlying
contract. Indeed, some purchasers regard the calling of performance bonds as
a legitimate way to obtain a discount.
To avoid being outmanoeuvred in this way, suppliers should ask their banks
to include wording that requires the purchaser to substantiate his
complaint. However, some purchasers and local banks make an outright refusal
to accept anything other than the traditional wording.
Ideally, purchasers should be required to make a series of detailed
statements and to produce documents in a given form. This should discourage
some from making false statements. Those not so deterred will at least be
committed to a stated position which may be of use to the supplier in any
subsequent legal dispute.
However, the use of a fuller demand still does not require banks to check
the truth of the statements or to refuse payment because they might be
false. The sole exception occurs in all cases when the bank has manifest
evidence of fraud - but such evidence is hardly ever available and the bank
cannot be expected to adjudicate between the parties.
If sanctions against Iraq are lifted, it is most unlikely that a supplier
will be able to enlist help from the English courts to prevent payment under
the bond, even if he cannot now perform his side of the underlying agreement
because of the Gulf war.
Some have suggested that a supplier could invoke the legal doctrine of
frustration by claiming that the Gulf war had made it impossible for him to
fulfil the underlying contract, thereby discharging the obligation between
himself and his bank, or between his bank and the local bank.
This ploy is unlikely to work, however. As a matter of law, the doctrine of
frustration is not invoked by hardship, inconvenience or material loss.
Instead, it focuses on any change in the significance of a contractual
obligation.
Since the obligations under the bond are independent of the contract, it
would be irrelevant to argue that the contract itself had been frustrated by
the hostilities. It is difficult to see any circumstances in which the
obligations imposed by the bond could be avoided by frustration or otherwise
as a result of the Gulf war.
It is even more difficult to say whether the government should consider
further measures to absolve suppliers and their banks from all liability in
appropriate cases. There would be practical difficulties, especially where
obligations between the supplier's British bank and the Iraqi local bank are
governed by Iraqi law and/or by an Iraqi exclusive jurisdiction clause.
In such cases, any pronouncement by the UK is unlikely to affect the
liability of the supplier's bank to the local bank. If the supplier's
obligations under the bond were cancelled by English law, this would leave
his bank potentially out of pocket through meeting a call under the bond
from the Iraqis, without being able to claim counter-indemnity from the
supplier.
There is also the wider concern that London should continue to be seen as a
world financial centre in which bonds will be honoured, come what may,
without government interference. If obligations under bonds to Iraq were
discharged - albeit due to what we might consider to be exceptional
circumstances - this reputation would be tarnished.
The lesson to be drawn for the future is that suppliers whose customers ask
them to take out a bond should consider the ramifications carefully and take
good advice. Those who already have bonds in place with Iraq can only hope
for the continued protection of sanctions.
It is interesting to note that current sanctions against South Africa apply
only to trade in military equipment, broadly speaking. It is unlikely that
payment under performance bonds will be singled out for special treatment
and continue to be prohibited, if the government should choose to modify its
objective of preventing the inflow of capital to Iraq.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Isle of Wight ferry operators cleared by MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE OPERATORS of ferry services to the Isle of Wight
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
labelled the world's most expensive route by aggrieved islanders - were
yesterday cleared by the Monopolies Commission of acting against the public
interest.
The commission concluded after an eight-month study that Wightlink, the
biggest Isle of Wight ferry operator, enjoyed a technical monopoly on
services to and from the UK mainland, but cleared it of abusing its
position.
Isle of Wight County Council said it was disappointed by the verdict. It had
hoped that the commission would force Wightlink to give up at least one of
its three routes to a competitor.
It took comfort from a decision by Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry
secretary, that the director general of fair trading should check the
position again in three years' time.
Wightlink, a subsidiary of Bermuda-based Sea Containers, is the biggest of
four operators on Isle of Wight routes. The others are Red Funnel, a
subsidiary of Associated British Ports, and two independents: Hovertravel
and Cowes Express.
The Monopolies Commission launched its investigation into the four
companies' ferry services last year because of complaints from islanders
about fares. It received almost 600 letters on the subject during its
inquiry.
In the absence of bridges, tunnels or regular air services between the
island and the mainland, the ferries offer the only means of crossing the
Solent to nearby Southampton, Portsmouth or Lymington.
Residents said high fares limited their ability to visit the mainland and
discouraged tourist traffic, on which the local economy was heavily
dependent.
The commission's report says Wightlink has a technical monopoly on the
island's ferry services, carrying 71 per cent of the passengers, 85 per cent
of cars, 80 per cent of lorries and 94 per cent of coaches.
The company's profits, it says, are substantial, at about 12 per cent of the
replacement costs of its assets. They are not so great, however, as to be
regarded as against the public interest and the other operators are making
losses or moderate profits.
The commission acknowledges that ferry fares per mile on Isle of Wight
services are among the highest in the UK. A day return for a car and family
of four can cost Pounds 59.40 on a summer weekend, it says.
The shortest crossing distance, Lymington to Yarmouth, is just under 4 miles
and the shortest crossing time, Southsea to Ryde, is 10 minutes.
The report says comparisons with other routes are of limited value, however.
Short crossings tend to have a higher cost per mile than long ones, it says.
Many comparable Scottish services are heavily subsidised and cross-Channel
ferries carry much heavier loadings.
Mr James Sherwood, president of Sea Containers, said the report vindicated
the company's strategy since acquiring the Isle of Wight ferry services from
British Rail in 1984.
'This strategy has been to increase capacity and frequency of sailings and
standards of on-board comfort while not increasing tariffs by more than
inflation,' he said.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Mackay unmoved as lawyers protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD MACKAY, the Lord Chancellor, stood firm yesterday in the face of a mass
meeting of legal-aid lawyers called to protest at the government's plans to
introduce standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts.
Lord Mackay, who was barracked and hissed, told more than 2,000 lawyers
gathered in Central Hall, Westminster: 'Only those who do not have to face
the harsh realities could believe that any publicly funded legal service
could be provided without regard to price.'
He made it clear that he would not be intimidated by threats of strike
action or boycotts of emergency-duty solicitor schemes in police stations.
'Your threat to refuse to answer calls for help would hit members of the
public at their most vulnerable in a police station and, if successful, it
could lead to the very miscarriages of justice which we all wish to avoid,'
he said.
Lord Mackay's defence of the government's decision to impose a
below-inflation increase of 3 per cent in legal-aid fees met with laughter.
With legal-aid expenditure set to exceed Pounds 1bn in 1992-93 - more than
double the figure of five years ago - he said lawyers doing legal-aid work
could not be immune from the pressure to hold down costs.
Correcting what he said was a misconception about the new arrangements, Lord
Mackay said standard fees would be related to work done. They would not be
just average fees.
He was adamant that standard fees were not a cost-cutting measure.
Mr Gareth Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, told the rally that the
legal-aid system was 'creeping towards collapse'.
No one got fat on legal aid work, he said. 'What we want and demand is
prompt payment of money earned. Our entitlement is fair pay, fair terms for
fair work properly done.'
Mr Alastair Logan, the solicitor who represented two of the Guildford Four,
said the fixed-fee proposals, coupled with below-inflation increases in
fees, represented a 'life-threatening attack' on the whole system of
criminal legal aid.

FT  13 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Post Office will allow managers to
take sabbaticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SABBATICAL leave, unusual outside academic circles, is to be introduced for
post office counter managers. The move is likely to be followed by pressure
from other Post Office workers for sabbaticals to be extended to all grades.
Managers will be able to save up annual holiday entitlement, starting this
year, towards a sabbatical and combine it with a period of unpaid leave. A
minimum block of 13 weeks would normally be taken.
Sabbaticals are common in the academic world, where they are frequently for
one term in seven and are intended mainly for travel and writing. They are
also more widespread in the US, where about 13 per cent of companies offer
some form of paid sabbatical leave.
Extra paid leave may be allowed by the Post Office in special cases, for
example where an employee needs it for study relating directly to the job.
The Communication Managers' Association, which represents the 3,000 counter
managers, said it would press in the next pay negotiations for the scheme to
include further paid leave.
Some UK companies offer extra blocks of holiday for long service, special
projects or compassionate reasons, or as workers approach retirement. The
Post Office scheme is unusual because it will be an entitlement. Employees
will not have to explain what they want the time for, and there will be no
qualifying period.
Mr Terry Deegan, general secretary of the CMA, said he expected a trend
towards unions including bids for sabbaticals in pay negotiations. For many
groups 'the point has been reached where, in pure pay-bargaining terms,
there is not much further to go,' he said. Sabbaticals were also attractive
to employees because, unlike many other perks, they were not taxed as a
benefit in kind, he added.
The Union of Communication Workers, which represents the bulk of Post Office
employees, said it, too, would press for sabbaticals. 'They have always
seemed to be the privilege of an elite. It's preposterous that no one thinks
that people in manual grades would have much to do with the time off,' it
said.
Staff taking part in the scheme for Post Office counter managers will have
to take at least three weeks and three days of their holiday each year.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Pledge on early end to CFC production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK will stop making ozone-destroying chemicals by the end of 1995, the
Department of the Environment and ICI, the country's largest chemical
manufacturer, said yesterday, Clive Cookson writes.
That will be two years ahead of the European Community deadline and five
years ahead of the internationally agreed Montreal Protocol.
The commitment matches the announcement by President Bush on Tuesday that
the US would stop producing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals
causing most damage to the earth's protective ozone layer, by the end of
1995.
Both countries are accelerating the phasing out of CFCs in the light of new
evidence that the upper atmosphere is losing ozone far more rapidly than
scientists had realised previously.
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said it was
not enough for the UK just to echo the new US timetable. Ms Tracy Heslop of
Greenpeace called for an immediate ban.
Mr John Beckett, who is managing ICI's phase-out of CFCs, said an immediate
halt was not practical because many users, particularly in the refrigeration
industry, still had no available substitutes.

ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem made a direct appeal to the European
Community yesterday to override 'the diktat' of its farmers and compromise
over agricultural subsidies in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations.
In a speech to the European Parliament at the start of a tour of EC
countries, Mr Menem said that by failing to agree to compromise proposals on
farm trade the Community risked sparking a trade war.
'The reluctance of certain European governments to accept a progressive
dismantling of agricultural subsidies will bring with it serious
consequences for international trade,' the Argentine leader said. 'Can the
principle of free trade, which should govern trade relations, be
subordinated in the area of agriculture to the diktat of a definitively
minority sector?'
Argentina is a member of the Cairns group campaigning for a liberalisation
of farm trade in the current round of talks on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Menem also appealed to European companies to participate in his country's
privatisation programme.

   ST PETERSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) yesterday signed a
multi-million-dollar joint venture with a Russian company and called for
western restrictions on high-technology exports to be lifted, Reuter reports
from St Petersburg.
The deal, with St Petersburg-based Dalnya Svyaz (Dals), is to provide and
market digital transmission equipment to improve long-distance domestic and
international phone links in the former Soviet Union, AT&amp;T officials said.
AT&amp;T Network Systems International will own 68 per cent of the new company,
to be called AT&amp;T of St Petersburg. Dals will hold the remaining 32 per
cent.
Mr Alexei Alyushin, Russia's deputy communications minister, said the joint
venture was only a small part of AT&amp;T's plans to develop Russia's
communications.
However, neither he nor AT&amp;T officials gave details of future projects. They
would not say how much would be invested in the current joint venture, but
said it amounted to millions of dollars.
Mr Sam Willcoxon, an AT&amp;T group executive, said the deal was part of an
overall plan to improve the infrastructure in the Commonwealth of
Independent States and eastern Europe. 'I view this as a tremendous
opportunity as our countries begin to develop commerce,' he said.
'The need for communications is going to grow dramatically,' Mr Willcoxon
said, adding that gains from the venture would be long-term but the need for
such a deal was immediate.
Mr Willcoxon complained about western restrictions on high-technology
exports imposed during the Cold War by the Paris-based Co-ordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom).
'Many of us believe that these are an artefact of history and AT&amp;T is
working very aggressively to persuade those that need to be persuaded that
this particular artefact be done away with,' he said.
Cocom has allowed exports of only slow-speed fibre optic cables of up to 45
megabits per second because of fears that a high-speed link would make
military communications more difficult to intercept. AT&amp;T officials said
there were 93 international circuits between Russia and the US, well below
requirements.

officials see growing opportunities in emerging markets
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW asset management company was launched in Washington yesterday to take
advantage of growing opportunities for direct and portfolio investment in
developing countries, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, writes
Michael Prowse in Washington.
The Emerging Market Corp was founded by Mr Moeen Qureshi and Mr Donald Roth
 -until recently two of the World Bank's most senior officials - and Mr Jay
Higgins, a former vice-chairman of Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street
investment house.
Bankers Trust, the New York bank which is already active in emerging markets
in developing countries, has agreed in principle to become a partner in the
new company.
The new company will be based in Washington and begin operations in April.
Its immediate aim is to establish a Dollars 200m-Dollars 250m (Pounds
111m-Pounds 139m) fund for making direct equity investments.
Mr Qureshi, the chairman-designate, said yesterday EMC would add value by
providing a vehicle through which pension funds and insurance companies
could take direct equity stakes in developing countries. At present,
investors were mainly limited to portfolio investment in emerging markets.
He said the age of substantial bank lending to developing countries had
passed. His company was being established to ride the new wave of direct and
portfolio equity investment.
EMC may also represent the start of a trend towards seeking private-sector
solutions to the problems of economic development. It can be seen as a
profit-making, entrepreneurial version of the International Finance Corp
(IFC), the arm of the World Bank that seeks to promote private-sector
development in the third world.
In eastern Europe, EMC could compete with the public-sector European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, which has taken direct equity stakes in
enterprises.
EMC offers investors considerable expertise in development and finance. Mr
Qureshi was until recently in charge of operations at the World Bank  - one
of two senior vice-presidents under Mr Lewis Preston, the president. Mr Roth
is currently the bank's treasurer, its senior financial officer. Mr Higgins
was head of investment banking at Salomon and previously head of mergers and
acquisitions.
EMC aims to operate in Asia, Latin America, eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
Mr Qureshi said he expected eastern Europe to be an important market but to
develop slowly. In the former Soviet republics, the group would seek
'enclave-type projects' where returns were likely to be independent of the
economy's overall performance.
Although focusing initially on direct equity stakes, EMC will seek to take
advantage of growing opportunities for stock market investment as capital
markets deepened in developing countries and former communist economies.
Mr Qureshi said opportunities were far greater than generally appreciated.
He expected portfolio investment in emerging markets to expand from about
Dollars 20bn now to about Dollars 100bn by the end of the decade.

MR Patrick Buchanan, the right-wing Republican challenger to President

In a speech in Concord, Mr Buchanan accused Japan and Europe of spending

high-technology businesses, particularly the aerospace industry led by
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
As president, he would tell the British, French, German and Spanish
governments who back Airbus that 'we are going to protect Boeing because
they built the planes that kept you free (during the Cold War).'
The US is a world leader in civil aviation, one of the few high-technology
industries unchallenged by Japanese competition. The Bush administration has
filed two complaints about subsidies of Airbus to the Geneva-based General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but Mr Buchanan said he would introduce
countervailing duties to raise the price of Airbus aircraft.
With five days remaining to next Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire, the
first in the 1992 election campaign, Mr Buchanan, with roughly 30 per cent
support, trails Mr Bush by 15 points. But many voters remain undecided, and
the Bush camp is fearful of a recession-inspired backlash.
Political experts calculate that Mr Buchanan needs between 35 and 40 per
cent of the vote to keep his challenge alive in the southern primaries. Bush
supporters are inflating his likely vote next Tuesday in the hope that, even
if he scores an embarrassing 35 per cent, he will be written off by the
press.
Mr Buchanan, a former speech writer to Presidents Nixon and Reagan, drew a
crowd of more than 200 people at Concord on Monday night. Many were
middle-income Americans worried about the local economy.
The Republican challenger called for an end to all US foreign aid, the
removal of most-favoured-nation trade benefits for communist China, and the
withdrawal of all US troops from Europe in response to the collapse of the
Soviet Union. 'It is time to tell the big boys in Europe who steal our
markets around the world that they should look after themselves.'
The Boston Herald, a conservative-leaning tabloid newspaper, joined the
right-wing Manchester Union Leader yesterday in endorsing Mr Buchanan in a
front-page editorial. The Herald said Mr Bush's support of a tax increase in
1990 meant he had betrayed those who voted for him in 1988.
In his speech Mr Buchanan evoked memories of the 1950s, when the US
dominated the world economy and led the struggle against Stalinism. The US
won the Cold War 'but the victory has left ashes in our mouths. There is a
social and economic crisis in America today,' he said.
Referring to national opinion polls indicating that three out of four
Americans are worried about the future, Mr Buchanan said he would cut taxes,
support term limits for Congress and slash the federal bureaucracy. He
quoted Abraham Lincoln's words on the eve of the Civil War: 'There is a
storm coming.'

FT  13 FEB 92 / Caterpillar strike widens

<TEXT>
THE United Auto Workers union of the US is to widen its three-month strike
against Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment.
The decision came after Caterpillar offered last week to end its lock-out of
5,650 workers this weekend.
The company's move was aimed at bringing the union back to the bargaining
table. But the union says it wants to maximise pressure on Caterpillar to
win an industry 'pattern' contract, comparable with settlements at similar
companies. It will send the locked-out workers on strike.
The union believes that allowing locked-out workers to return to the job
would prolong the partial strike by 2,400 of its members, which began on
November 4.
However, the UAW accepted the company's invitation to resume talks next
week.

FORCES under the command of former Panamanian strongman General Manuel
Antonio Noriega investigated and arrested a key figure in Colombia's Medelln
cocaine cartel, a US Drug Enforcement Administration agent admitted
yesterday, writes Henry Hamman in Miami.
The acknowledgement by the agent, Mr Thomas Telles, is significant as the
government has alleged during Gen Noriega's Miami drug trafficking trial
that the general protected the operations of the Medelln cartel in Panama.
Mr Telles had at first denied knowing with whom the Medelln 'lieutenant,' Mr
Jose Eduardo Zembrano Caicedo, was affiliated.
Defence attorney Mr Frank Rubino sought to introduce several documents
dealing with the investigation and arrest of Mr Zembrano.

FT  13 FEB 92 / India starts easing import restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KK SHARMA

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA yesterday started the process of easing the restrictions on imports
imposed in March last year when the country was in the midst of a severe
balance of payments crisis.
Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the
country's central bank, announced in Bombay that the requirement of a 25 per
cent cash margin on letters of credit for imports would be withdrawn from
today.
Simultaneously, the surcharge that banks were required to impose on import
credit will also be withdrawn.
As a result, industry will be able to import without difficultly the raw
materials and components it needs urgently to raise production.
The move follows the rise in the foreign exchange reserves to a healthy
level of over Rs 100bn (Pounds 2.13bn) following various measures taken by
the government. These include the first instalments of a standby credit of
Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from the IMF and immunity schemes for Indians
with foreign bank accounts if they repatriate their illegal wealth.
Easing restrictions is part of the economic reforms initiated since July
last year by the Narasimha Rao government. This has led to withdrawal of a
number of government controls and regulations, including those on foreign
investment and industrial licensing. However, import restrictions were
retained, except for minor changes, until the foreign exchange reserves
improved.
Trade and industry has long been pleading for the easing of the restrictions
on the grounds that they were affecting industrial production.
Industrialists blame the restrictions on imports and bank credit for the
recession and they have, therefore, been asking for their withdrawal.
Dr Manmohan Singh, minister of finance, said restrictions would be eased as
soon as foreign exchange reserves reached a healthy level.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Sudanese political trends alarm Cairo: Growing tensions
between neighbours in north-east Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Major-General al Zubeir Mohammed Saleh, Sudan's deputy leader,
completed a visit to Egypt this week, he had soothing words about the
strained relations between the neighbouring Arab-African states. 'Agreement
had been reached,' he said, 'on the formation of a joint committee to
promote co-operation in all fields for the good of the two peoples.'
Behind his bland pronouncements, however, lies a troubled relationship, and
it is doubtful that Gen al Zubeir's presence in Cairo - this was the
highest-level Sudanese mission to Egypt in 18 months - has done all that
much to calm festering Egyptian worries about developments in the Sudan.
A senior Egyptian official, who described the whole issue of Egypt-Sudan
relations as 'extremely sensitive,' said Cairo would 'wait and see how the
Sudanese government is going to manage its relations in the Arab world, and
how the 'fundamentalist non-Moslem wave' of policies there will manifest
itself'.
From Cairo's perspective, Sudan presents an alarming picture these days: a
weak military regime in the thrall of a powerful fundamentalist tendency led
by Dr Hassan al-Tourabi of the National Islamic Front, which, according to
Egyptian claims, is bent on creating a militant Moslem state and haven for
extremist groups from across the Arab world.
Egypt's official Rose el-Yousef magazine this week published a detailed
account, apparently based on Egyptian intelligence reports, of what it
described as a network of terrorist training camps under Dr Tourabi's
control.
It also refered to the presence in Sudan of 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, some of whom had served in Lebanon.
Another Egyptian concern is over sanctuary given to Egyptian militants in
Sudan recently, including the blind cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman who
fled Egypt in 1990.
A visit to Khartoum last December by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
of Iran, accompanied by offers of military assistance, prompted an
extraordinary outburst in Al Ahram, the official Cairo daily, by Ibrahim
Nafeh, its editor-in-chief and confidant of President Hosni Mubarak.
'God help the brotherly Sudanese people,' Mr Nafeh wrote. 'For years, the
situation in Sudan has been deteriorating, with governments changing hands
consecutively until (Sudanese President Omar) Al Basir rose to power in a
military coup d'etat and overshadowed all previous leaders in his blunt
efforts to push Sudan down the drain.'
Egypt's growing troubles with Sudan, which it ruled under an Anglo-Egyptian
condominium until the early 1950s, date from the last idiosyncratic years of
Colonel Jaafar Nimeiri's rule before his removal in a bloodless coup in
1985.
Mr Nimeiri's efforts to impose Shari'a law (a 1,300- year-old Islamic code)
had fuelled conflict between the mainly Moslem north and the Christian or
animist south: a debilitating civil war continues to this day.
His replacement after a transitional period of military rule by Mr Sadiq
al-Mahdi as prime minister between 1986 and 1989 added to Egypt's problems
with its neighbour. Mr Mahdi, a fervent nationalist, had little regard for
the web of agreements negotiated over the years between Khartoum and Cairo,
including an 'integration accord', and these were replaced with a
'Fraternity Charter' in 1987 - a largely meaningless agreement - that was
designed to 'restore warmth' to the troubled relationship.
Gen Saleh's visit to Cairo was dogged by a border dispute that was rekindled
following the signing of an agreement last December between Sudan and a
Canadian-registered company for oil exploration in a zone Egypt claims as
its sovereign territory. He insisted that the control over what is known as
the Halaib administrative triangle on the Egyptian Sudanese Red Sea border
could be resolved amicably.

Vietnam agreed last October to take back a number of people who were deemed

persecution. Vietnam yesterday welcomed the return and expressed sorrow at
the deaths of 23 boat-people burnt alive in a Hong Kong camp riot last week.
It urged that those considered responsible be put on trial.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Reserve Bank said yesterday that the country's inflation
fell more sharply than expected last year, to levels not expected until
1993. Inflation fell to minus 0.02 in December.
The bank, which was given responsibility for handling monetary policy in
pursuit of low inflation in 1988, was not supposed to achieve nil to 2 per
cent inflation till 1993.
Releasing the latest six monthly outlook yesterday, the bank governor, Dr
Don Brash, said that 'with hindsight, there could be some validity' in
accusations that the bank's monetary targets had been too tight and that
this had caused extra business difficulties. The creeping 4 per cent
devaluation, since late November, could have been done earlier, he declared.
However, he argued that the bank had eased monetary policy substantially
during the year. Had the bank acted earlier, the wrong signals might have
been sent to the markets about its commitment to low inflation.
The bank predicts renewed inflationary pressures following the recent
devaluations, and Dr Brash pointed out that the bank would not hesitate to
tighten monetary policy.
Current settings are comfortably on track to achieve the 1993 target, laying
a sound foundation for an improvement in New Zealand's growth prospects.
Dr Brash added that underlying inflation rate was estimated to have fallen
to an average 1.7 per cent in 1991. It could fall lower over the coming
months, before rising to reach a peak of about 3 per cent next year.

KASHMIRI militants said Pakistani security forces killed up to 12 people and
arrested their leader together with 100 supporters in an attempt to block
their march to the Indian border yesterday, reports Reuter from Chinari,
Pakistan.
But Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum, prime minister of Pakistan-ruled Azad Kashmir,
denied that Mr Amanullah Khan, leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation
Front (JKLF), had been arrested and said that there had been many fewer
deaths.
The JKLF said that their leader and close aides were snatched by the
security forces after being separated from other activists who had fought
their way close to the border in an attempt to cross it in support of a
Moslem uprising in the Indian-ruled side of Kashmir. Mr Qayyum also said the
militants had agreed to disband the march in return for the release of 40
people arrested earlier.
The JKLF claimed that Mr Khan and 300 of his most ardent supporters had
reached the border village of Chakothi after breaking through a police
barrier 6km from the ceasefire line.
Militants said police occupying the heights above a road sandwiched between
the mountainside and the Jhelum river gorge threw rocks down on
demonstrators, injuring many. Doctors said police shot dead at least three
people.
In India, authorities said Indian soldiers fired at other militants trying
to cross the disputed border, reports AP.

DR Carmen Lawrence, the premier of Western Australia, plans to privatise the

announced yesterday.
Dr Lawrence said the government's Insurance Office would be sold outright
and that 40 to 49 per cent of the R&amp;I Bank would be sold off. However, she
said, the economic environment precluded any immediate sales and the
government would wait until 'the time was right'.
She did not specify whether the two institutions, both of which were
involved in lending to many failed entrepreneurs, would be floated or
offered for trade sale.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S political scene is likely to change significantly following the
success of the Democratic Convention (DC) in recent local government
elections. A loose coalition of opposition parties, the DC did well at the
expense of the governing National Salvation Front in last weekend's polls.
Although only two of the 40 mayors in the counties were elected with an
absolute majority, the results so far indicate the emergence of a democratic
opposition capable of challenging the Front in parliamentary elections.
These are due three months after the second round of local elections on
February 20.
The Democratic Convention, which includes the intellectual-based Civic
Alliance and the National Peasants Party, one of the 'historic parties' of
the 1920s, won an outright victory in Timisoara, cradle of the 1989
revolution which toppled the Ceausescu regime.
In Bucharest, the capital, the DC won 45 per cent of the vote; the National
Salvation Front was next with 31 per cent. It also won the biggest share of
the votes in the Transylvanian cities of Cluj, Sibiu and Brasov.
But in the Transylvanian counties of Covasna and Harghitu, where ethnic
Hungarians are in a majority, local Hungarians were swept into power,
confirming that they will continue to play an important role in political
life.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Bank chief warns on Polish interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE debate over easing Poland's monetary restrictions has been joined by Mr
Andrzej Topinski, acting head of the country's central bank. His warning
that the bank would not agree to a base rate much below the level of
inflation came as a draft budget was being prepared by the government.
The controversy became public as a senior International Monetary Fund team
left Warsaw. The country needs an agreement with the IMF if disbursement of
a three-year Dollars 2.5bn loan facility suspended last year is to be
resumed.
Mr Topinski said in a newspaper interview that the bank would not lower its
base rate to between 25 and 28 per cent as long as the government continued
to run up a budget deficit, which could reach Zl 60,000bn (Pounds 2.9bn)
this year or 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
He appeared to be arguing against Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the senior minister
responsible for the economy, who is looking for ways of reviving Poland's
recession-bound state owned industries without igniting hyper-inflation. Mr
Eysymontt wants to see a base rate at around the inflation rate which he
estimates will reach 35 per cent this year.
The central bank's stance strengthens the hand of Mr Karol Lutkowski,
finance minister, who is arguing that interest rates have to stay around
their present 40 per cent annual level if the budget deficit is to be
financed. The Finance Ministry agrees the inflation rate will reach 35 per
cent this year or half of its 1991 level. Mr Eysymontt would also like to
see an exchange rate 'which would avoid an appreciation of the zloty'. Here
Mr Topinski wants to leave his options open, maintaining that exchange rate
policy should not be strictly linked to the inflation rate but to the state
of 'foreign currency reserve levels', as well as other factors.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Brussels wants cash for action outside EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'IF PEACE breaks out in Yugoslavia, or if the Middle East negotiations
succeed, the European Community will be called on to contribute massively to
reconstruction in those regions', says a senior Community budget official.
'But we have no idea when this might be.'
The official was illustrating the peculiar budgetary problem for the EC in
trying to foresee the unforeseeable five years ahead. Unlike governments
which can fine-tune their national budgets year by year, the Community tries
to lock itself into five-year plans, the second of which was proposed by the
Commission yesterday.
These five-year plans are not set in concrete. The EC's 'financial
perspectives' for 1988-92 has so far been revised five times through a
cumbersome and time-consuming procedure. But all these revisions were
prompted by foreign policy demands on the Community, arising from the Gulf
war, Kurdish refugees' plight, changes in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
These demands have led the Commission to propose:
Creation of a separate major budget category for EC external action. Up to
now cash for this has been lumped in with money for a host of internal
Community policies. The result has often been that the Commission has had to
trade off a request for, say, technical aid to Russia with the European
Parliament's demands for more money for EC transport.
A near-doubling of money for EC external action from Ecu3.6bn (Pounds
2.56bn) this year to Ecu6.3bn (Pounds 4.49bn) in 1997.
A new reserve, which will rise to Ecu900m by 1997, to make provision for
possible default by dubious borrowers like ex-Soviet republics and for
unforeseen foreign crises.
The Community is steadily building financial expectations on the part of its
eastern neighbours. Its so-called Phare programme for central Europe, the
Balkan and Baltic states is mainly project aid and does not carry long term
commitments.
Equally, Brussels has carefully avoided including specific financial
protocols in its recent association accords with Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary.
But these agreements promise the central Europeans 'decisive support' in
their moves to market economies. In addition, the Commission assumes that
the combined needs of the 12 former Soviet republics will be greater than
those of the old Soviet Union, because they will all be self-destructively
pursuing their separate economic policies.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Soviet Union suffered Dollars 14bn capital flight last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE former Soviet Union was forced to stop debt repayment to foreign banks
last year largely because Soviet enterprises illegally kept at least Dollars
14bn, and possibly up to Dollars 19bn, in foreign accounts rather than
repatriate hard currency at an overvalued exchange rate.
'The combination of a Dollars 5bn current account surplus, Dollars 2bn in
net external borrowing and more than Dollars 9bn in sales of gold and
foreign exchange suggests large-scale capital flight in 1991. A large part
of this was probably by enterprises that were reluctant to remit foreign
exchange under the requirement that 40 per cent of hard currency earnings be
exchanged at the increasingly overvalued exchange rate of Rbs 1.7 to the
dollar', according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), the
Washington-based research group funded by international commercial banks.
In its latest report on the former Soviet economy, the institute says that
'monetary tightening to curb capital flight is essential'. While noting that
Russia has taken the lead in economic reform, it states that the programme
'lacks crucial elements, including monetary control'.
It warns that 'retreat from fiscal adjustment, or a failure to reinforce it
with with monetary and structural measures including privatisation, would
risk hyper-inflation, further weakness of the rouble, increased capital
flight and continued foreign exchange shortages.'
The IIF doubts whether a sufficiently comprehensive reform package can be
implemented to secure financial support from the IMF even if membership is
agreed by spring.
The IIF estimates that the convertible currency debt of the new CIS rose to
Dollars 61.5bn at the end of 1991 from Dollars 59.4bn in October. The
now-defunct Soviet state managed to borrow less than Dollars 2bn from abroad
last year. A rise in official lending from Dollars 23.2bn in 1990 to Dollars
36.5bn at the end of 1991 was largely offset by repayments to commercial
banks. The latter 'may have received net repayments of as much as Dollars
11.1bn in 1991, of which Dollars 7bn was in short-term credit,' the report
notes.
Net disbursement by non-bank private creditors amounted to a mere Dollars
0.4bn after taking into account 'at least Dollars 1bn in loans
collateralised against diamonds'. Trade arrears remained 'broadly unchanged'
at around Dollars 4bn to Dollars 4.5bn, the report added.
Looking ahead, the IIF warns that the CIS may find it more difficult to
raise external credit than the former Soviet Union. 'The breakdown of a
unified administrative structure will disrupt traditional trade flows
.shortages of material inputs are likely to intensify. Real net material
product (NMP) may fall another 15 per cent in Russia ..and output may fall
 .by more than a quarter, in several republics.'
In these circumstances, 'access to external credit may be more limited in
1992 ..financing flows may amount to Dollars 10bn in 1992, with official
creditors providing nearly all new disbursements'.
Meanwhile, international institutions are likely to play 'only a limited
financial role'. Credits from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) are unlikely to be above Dollars 50m while it will be
difficult for the IMF and World Bank to reach agreement and disburse funds
this year, the report concludes.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Cresson survives but suffers from growing discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS expected, France's conservative opposition parties failed in their
attempt this week to bring down the Socialist government of Mrs Edith
Cresson, when their censure motion on its handling of the George Habash
scandal fell far short of the required parliamentary majority.
But Mrs Cresson's government cannot easily shrug off the political damage
caused by the controversy over the ostensibly unauthorised hospitalisation
in Paris of the Palestinian leader. The affair has undoubtedly added to the
popular discontent with the administration of President Mitterrand.
Winding up the debate with a combative defence of the government's record,
Mrs Cresson called on her socialist supporters to mobilise 'for the next 400
days', to be ready for the general elections scheduled for the spring of
next year. It was a forceful performance, but the critical date for Mrs
Cresson's government is not 400 days away, but less than 40, in the local
and regional elections of March 22.
At the best of times, the socialists would expect to be handicapped in these
elections, weighted in favour of the rural vote and conservative local
forces.
But to judge from recent opinion polls, that verdict is likely to be severe.
The socialists' share of the vote may slide to below an average of 20 per
cent.
If that happens, they could no longer claim to be the largest single party
in France. The pressure on President Mitterrand to replace Mrs Cresson with,
say, Mr Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, might then
become intense. It might become hard to resist pressure for early general
elections.
Socialist support in the Rhone-Alpes region, according to a survey by the
BVA polling institute, is likely to fall to 18 per cent, 10 percentage
points less than in the previous regional elections of 1986. In the Auvergne
region, the socialist vote could drop from 30.8 per cent to 19.5 per cent.
In the Ile de France region round Paris, the Socialist vote would drop even
further, to 16 per cent, compared with 28.6 per cent in 1986.

FT  13 FEB 92 / CIS may founder over split-up of centralised armed forces:
Russia seems certain to set up its own army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commonwealth of Independent States, the successor to the Soviet Union,
may founder tomorrow in Minsk - where it began a little more than two months
ago. A formal announcement to that effect is unlikely: but another session
of papering over the cracks is probably impossible.
The root problem is army, the only surviving institution of the Soviet state
but one whose future is increasingly uncertain as the individual republics,
including Russia, opt for separate forces.
Fears over the army's reaction to its disintegration as a unified force
representing the CIS were highlighted yesterday when rumuors of a possible
coup attempt against President Yeltsin swept some western stock markets.
They emerged after Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign
minister, said the economic crisis and tensions in the armed forces could
lead to a coup in Moscow.
Such tensions are likely to persist, in part because in the past week, a
succession of statements by the senior military advisors around the Russian
president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, made it clear that they expected the
announcement of the creation of separate Russian armed forces immediately
after the Minsk summit.
Yesterday officials in Moscow said the decree was likely to be promulgated
at the weekend - and that it would envisage an armed force totalling 1.5m
men, becoming a professional force in the course of the next few years.
In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, Col Alexei Tsaryov,
chairman of the defence sub committee of the Russian parliament, said that a
resolution along these lines could be submitted to the parliament today
after authoritative opinion shifted during the past week in favour of a
Russian force.
He warned, however, that the move would run into severe opposition from the
armed forces general staff, headed by Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov.
The general staff has prepared 14 documents calling for a unified command
for the Commonwealth armed forces, with provision for a council of defence
ministers to supervise it. A working group from the Commonwealth states has
over the past two days been discussing these documents in Minsk in
preparation for tomorrow's summit.
'Their conception is for practically unlimited power for the general staff.
There is no place in it for the parliaments of the states. This is
completely unacceptable to us, and it will be to other republics.
The defence committee will propose that the statement on Russian armed
forces should include the following:
Russia will create its own defence capability;
Other states should then decide what association they wish to have with the
Russian forces, especially with the nuclear forces which Russia plans to
monopolise
An interparliamentary commission will be formed to thrash out the share-out.
The latter point is likely to be contentious. The Ukrainian government fears
that the Russians will use the requirement of the treaty on conventional
forces reduction in Europe - due to be ratified within the next two months -
to insist that it gets the lion's share of conventional weapons.
At present, Ukraine has the bulk of the Commonwealth tank forces on its
territory, and has claimed control over them. Russian military strategists,
however, are calling for a redistribution of the forces based on the size of
the republics - thus giving Russia the majority of the equipment.
The disupte between Russia and the Ukraine over the Black Sea Fleet, by
contrast, may be less contentious - since the indications from Ukraine are
that the government may be content to take a small part of the fleet on
condition that the status of the Crimea, once part of Russia and now a
district of Ukraine, will not be disputed.
Coll Tsaryov said that Russia should propose to the other states that they
can 'contract in' to strategic defence provided by Russia - as for example,
the nuclear early warning system - provided they share the costs and allow
their citizens to serve in strategic forces under Russian command.
He said that Mr Yeltsin agreed with the thrust of the thinking for a Russian
command - but had boxed himself in by 'promises he had to make' that Russia
would be the last to create its own forces. This position was now no longer
tenable, he said
He conceded there was as yet no military doctrine for Russia - saying that
the ideas so far produced by experts had 'talked a lot about peace and
co-operation, but did not define who we thought the likely enemy would be.'
However, he said that a team seconded from the Defence Ministry would begin
work with the parliamentary committee next week.
If the Commonwealth leaders do reject a unified military command tomorrow,
and the process of creation of independent forces begins in earnest, the
Commonwealth will have little further content as an executive body.
The best that can be hoped for is that the states can agree a process of
civilised negotiation on military, as well as on economic and other,
cooperation.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Brussels refers Steetley deal back to UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission said yesterday it would allow the UK government to
examine the proposed merger of Steetley and Tarmac's brick, clay tile and
concrete businesses.
It is the first time Brussels has given up its right to investigate a large
EC takeover since new rules on merger investigations came into force.
EC competition lawyers said the decision would help clarify the use of the
specific clause in the 1990 regulations which gives national merger control
bodies the right to ask for jurisdiction over cases being examined in
Brussels.
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, stressed the 'very
exceptional circumstances' of the Tarmac-Steetley joint venture. Officials
played down the significance of the Commission's decision for future EC
mergers, which they said would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
The reference of the merger to British authorities could have an important
bearing on the outcome of a rival Pounds 600m bid for the whole of Steetley
by Redland, another large British building materials group.
The UK Office of Fair Trading is considering whether to recommend an
investigation of the Redland bid by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
(MMC). It will now also consider the Tarmac-Steetley joint venture plans.
Sir Leon said that had he harboured any doubts about referring the
Tarmac-Steetley deal back to London, they would probably have been dispelled
by Redland's bid. 'It is much better for related cases to be dealt with by
one regulatory authority if at all possible,' he said.
A preliminary European Commission investigation into the joint venture had
been triggered automatically because of the large size of the combined EC
turnover, including UK sales, of Tarmac and Steetley.
The Commission said the deal would raise 'significant competition issues' in
the UK market for bricks and clay tiles and threatened to create a dominant
position for Steetley-Tarmac in both sectors.
The merged group's markets, however, would be limited to Britain, and, in
the case of bricks, to a region within 70 miles of the companies' factories,
minimising the merger's effect on the European market, the Commission said.
Mr Peter Lilley, UK trade secretary, now has to decide whether to order a
full investigation by the MMC or clear one or both proposals.
A third option under the 1989 Companies Act would be to require the
companies to give undertakings to dispose of businesses which would give
them an overbearing market position. If undertakings were not forthcoming,
an investigation would go ahead.
Since August 1990 the Department of Trade has asked the MMC to investigate
16 takeover bids. On five other occasions it has allowed bids to go through
after companies gave undertakings.
Mr Gerald Corbett, Redland's finance director said last night: 'We have
always said that we would be prepared to give undertakings if that became
necessary.'
Mr Richard Miles, managing director of Steetley said his company and Tarmac
would discuss with the Office of Fair Trading and the Industry Department
competition issues raised by the EC decision.
On the stock market, Redland shares fell 1p to 464p, Steetley gained 4p to
344p and Tarmac was up  1/2 p to 119 1/2 p.
National authorities have asked for the right to examine large EC mergers
only three times since the merger regulations came into force in September
1990.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Tajiks search for words to market themselves: Gillian Tett
on a republic determined to be heard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Soviet Tajiks do not have a word for 'marketing' in their own
language. In the coming months, though, they may acquire one.
In this mountainous corner of the Soviet Union, the Tajik government has
embarked on one of the most difficult marketing tasks of all - persuading
the international community that remote and beautiful Tajikistan could be a
profitable place for western investment and aid programmes.
They have taken the innovative step of establishing their own western-based
development agency - the first such agency to have been set up by a former
Soviet republic.
The Tajik Development Agency (TDA) is a joint venture between a Tajik
commercial bank, a Finnish trade company and the European financial services
firm EBC Amro. Based in London with a small, largely western, staff, its
brief is twofold: to help the Tajik government identify its development
priorities; and to attract, assist and co-ordinate the investors and aid
agencies needed for this development.
'I think some western businesses think regions like Tajikistan might be
interesting, but they just don't know where to begin. . . . We are trying to
provide an accessible, London-based, structure for them to start with,'
explains Mr Richard Wilkins, ex-accountant and now a director of TDA.
He admits to considerable problems. The republic is virtually unknown in the
west. During the Soviet period, its chief distinction was that its 5m
population consistently ranked as the poorest in the Soviet Union. Since
independence, it has become infamous as the first republic to have a visible
Islamic opposition.
With its leadership still perceived - perhaps incorrectly - as former
hardline Communists, it has not appeared a prime candidate for foreign aid.
Although, entrepreneurs from nearby Moslem countries are already apparent in
the republic, western investment has so far been limited.
According to Mr Wilkins and his colleagues, the opening of the agency has
already triggered business interest, particularly among mining companies
curious about Tajikistan's rich mineral deposits. The republic produces an
estimated 2.5 tonnes of gold annually, has large lead, zinc and silver
deposits, and huge hydroelectricity capacity.
The management consultancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte has been
contracted to prise aid out of the EC, the British 'know-how' fund and other
sources.
Meanwhile, lawyers from the London law firm Berwin Laighton will be going
out to the republic to advise on development of a badly-needed western-style
legal system. The first English Speaking Union in the former Soviet Union
has been set up in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, to train English speakers.
Although TDA strenuously denies that it is intending to set itself up with
exclusive access to Tajikistan's minerals, its position as the official
'co-ordinator' of foreign investment to Tajikistan could place it in a
controversially powerful position within the republic.
And in an ex-Soviet Union where almost anything is now up for grabs - or
dollars - the Tajiks may yet need a word for 'monopoly' in their language,
as much as they need a word for 'marketing'.

<TEXT>
THE FORMER German enclave of Kaliningrad has urged both the Russian
government and foreign investors to support its free economic zone, saying
this was the territory's only means of survival.
Local government and business representatives from the area, once known as
Konigsberg, sandwiched between the Baltic Sea and Lithuania, said the
Russian government was due soon to approve concrete proposals for special
benefits, including lower taxes than in the rest of Russia and an easing of
restrictions on foreign capital.
A joint stock company called the Regional Investment-Financial Company, set
up by Russian investors with initial capital of Rbs1bn, is spearheading
attempts to stimulate investment in the area.
Despite a lack of investment in infrastructure by Moscow and caution among
would-be foreign investors from Germany and other countries, Mr Yuri
Matochkin, head of the local administration, said he expected the free
economic zone to be up and running within the next year or two.
Kaliningrad has a warm water port, a relatively developed transport system,
defence plants in need of conversion to civilian uses, and the potential for
tourism.

FT  13 FEB 92 / Kohl's immigration stance fuels split within cabinet
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's attempts to build an election platform on the issue
of Germany's flood of asylum-seekers resulted yesterday in an unprecedented
cabinet split between the CDU/CSU majority and the liberal FDP coalition
minority.
But his scheme was given a lift by a government-sponsored opinion poll,
conveniently released while the cabinet was at daggers drawn, which showed
that most of the population was behind Mr Kohl.
The poll said that although the threat of unemployment was the greatest
worry in the east, 47 per cent of west Germans said asylum seekers and
immigration were the country's biggest problem. Around 60 per cent of all
Germans backed changes to prevent 'abuse' of asylum laws.
The rift occurred in a debate on the Schengen Accord, a treaty between
Germany and other continental European Community states which will relax
internal border controls and tighten restrictions at external frontiers.
While both party groups approved the accord - and the opposition SPD said it
would not block it - the coalition partners disgreed on its implications.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, CDU interior minister, proclaimed that the asylum clause
in the federal constitution would have to be changed if the treaty were to
be fully effective.
At present, he added, 60 per cent of all people seeking asylum in the EC
were in Germany. Despite this, and for the first time in the history of the
present government, the FDP published a separate and contradictory
post-cabinet statement.
The row followed a CDU/CSU announcement on Tuesday that a constitutional
amendment will be tabled within the next two weeks.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian companies hit by
accounting rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE could be some unpleasant surprises in store for those foreign
investors who have rushed to buy shares on the Brazilian stock market or
take up more than Dollars 2bn in bonds and other paper issued by Brazilian
state companies over the past six months.
Over the next few weeks, many Brazilian companies will be posting appalling
results and surprise losses for 1991. This is partly a result of the
country's harshest recession for a decade, provoked by the tight monetary
policy the government is using to tackle inflation.
The main reason, however, is a new accounting regulation (Law 8200)
requiring companies to revalue assets to reflect the fact that inflation has
been running at a higher rate than previously recorded in official figures.
In effect, companies are having to compensate for the government's
under-estimation of inflation in 1990.
The first victim was Petrobras, the giant state oil monopoly, which
recent-ly announced its first losses.
Mr Antonio Claudio Pereira da Silva, the superintendent of finance, claims
the company would have had a Dollars 1.2bn profit rather than its posted
losses of Dollars 237m were it not for the change in accounting practices.
'The new law is basically an admission that the government has been
manipulating the (official inflation) figures,' says one analyst.
For the past six years of high inflation, successive economic teams have
been giving figures for monetary correction of assets below that of actual
inflation, in an attempt to suppress inflationary pressures in the economy.
This has made corporate profits appear higher, and has enabled the
government to collect more taxes.
The situation reached an extreme in 1990 when there was a 100 per cent lag
between the figures used to adjust reported asset values and actual
inflation.
This caused many companies to show profits when, in fact, they had made
losses in real terms. Many companies went to court refusing to pay tax on
these so-called profits, thus forcing the government to correct the
situation.
Under the new law, companies must now revise their figures for 1990. This is
leading to a huge increase in depreciation costs: by last year, fixed assets
were shown on average at just one-third of their real value.
Companies can also revise their figures for previous years, although they
are not required to and will not receive tax credits.
This option is already causing confusion over what 1991 results really mean.
Petrobras, for example, revised its figures back to 1987 whereas Bradesco,
the largest private sector bank, only went back to 1989.
The average effect has been a 100 per cent jump in net asset values and a
fall in profits to one-third of previous forecasts.
Particularly hit are those companies with large assets such as Petrobras,
Telebras, the state telecommunications company and Electrobras, the state
electricity company, all of which have or are likely to report losses.
Finance directors argue that as this is an accounting change the figures may
be worse on paper than in reality, but Ms Sonia Villa Lobos, a researcher at
Banco Garantia, points out: 'This law is just adjusting net assets to their
real value - what was wrong was their previous results.'
The changes do not affect cash-flow, so there should be no reduction in
capacity to meet obligations.
However, Mr Roger Maudsley, an investment analyst at Banco Bozano Simonsen,
says, 'Brazilian companies are suddenly looking very uncompetitive when one
considers net return on equity.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: BA near its peak level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE
THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST performance among the FT-SE listed stocks came from British
Airways, which jumped 23 to 248p, just shy of its all-time high, after
reporting third-quarter profits well ahead of the most optimistic market
forecasts.
Profits came in at Pounds 100m, against Pounds 20m at the same stage a year
ago. The general range of forecasts had been around the Pounds 50m mark,
although Charterhouse Tilney had predicted Pounds 73m.
Activity in the shares started early, with dealers reporting a 15 rise to
240p in pre-market trading. There was then a rush to buy after the market
opened, sending turnover to a hefty 29m by the close, the highest figure for
nearly five years. The majority of buying came in the morning and business
was more two-way by the afternoon.
Most analysts raised their full-year profit expectations following the
quarterly results. Mr Mike Stoddart, of Charterhouse Tilney, who upgraded
his figure by Pounds 23m to Pounds 275m for the year to March 1992, said:
'The results are better than expected due to cost-cutting and growth in the
North Atlantic market.'
However, he maintained his 1993 prediction at Pounds 370m. Mr James
Halstead, at Hoare Govett, increased his 1992 full-year profits estimate by
Pounds 70m to Pounds 280m.
Vickers active
Engineering and defence group Vickers hardened a penny to 170p early in the
day but eventually eased to end unaltered at 169p as turnover rose to 1.6m.
The word in the market was that Vickers could be a direct beneficiary of a
framework defence agreement signed yesterday between the UK and Kuwait.
There are suggestions in the market that Kuwait may order more than 250
Challenger 2 tanks as part of the agreement. One analyst said yesterday:
'This could be worth Pounds 750m for Vickers.'
BAe upset
British Aerospace (BAe) retreated 13 to 282p after the company said it had
paid a Pounds 79m indemnity to Burwood House Group, a joint venture held
between BAe's Arlington property subsidiary and Asda's Gazeley Holdings.
The market had expected a settlement at a lower figure, and was further
alarmed by confirmation from Asda that it believed it had a right to
exercise a put/call option in the original contract entitling it to sell its
stake in Burwood to BAe at market value or to buy BAe out. British Aerospace
is understood to dispute this and analysts now fear a drawn-out row. One
analyst said: 'The worry now is this thing is not over yet, just like the
situation with Rover.'
Sentiment was further affected by emerging worries over the health of the
civil aircraft order book. Turnover in BAe reached 6.2m by the close.
Thorn weak
US press reports that news of the sale of Virgin Records was imminent left
Thorn EMI lower, as the market reacted coolly to the possibility that the
electrical and leisure group might have been outbid for this profitable
retail outfit, in which it is known to have shown interest. European media
giant Bertelsmann was the reported bidder. However, Virgin Group, owner of
Virgin Records, later denied the reports.
Thorn shares were also under pressure because one leading broking house had
recommended a switch into Rank Organisation. 'Thorn is at the top of its
range,' said one analyst, 'and Rank still looks good value.' Thorn lost 15
to 820p in busy volume of 1.3m shares, while Rank added 7 at 684p.
Pharmaceutical group Glaxo was held back by a cut in profits forecast and
switch recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The house lowered its
estimate for 1991-92 figures by Pounds 60m to Pounds 1.42bn. It cited launch
costs of new products, rising research and development expenditure and
industry-imposed price constraints for the cut. UBS, which has been a seller
of Glaxo for some time, also published a note highlighting the relatively
attractive rating of Astra Holdings.
Glaxo shares were further affected by a forecast adjustment from Goldman
Sachs, which shaved Pounds 30m off its estimate to Pounds 1.42bn. The stock
slipped 3 to 824p with 2.1m shares traded.
ICI rose 13 to 1271p as buyers emerged after last week's decline. UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew was active. MTM responded to positive press comment,
advancing 11 1/2 to 280 1/2 p.
An insurance sector suffering the effects of recent profits downgrades and
forecasts of dividend cuts was hit again after flash floods wrought havoc in
California.
Royal Insurance, viewed by specialists as having the biggest exposure to
expected losses from the latest US disaster, dropped 12 more to 220p, close
to its lowest level for over five years.
Sun Alliance was also mauled, closing 11 off at 269p with 2.32m traded, in
spite of strong support triggered by a comprehensive research document from
Smith New Court. Guardian Royal Exchange lost 7 to 121p, with recent bid
stories almost forgotten.
Smiths Industries fell 9 to 263p after United Airlines, of the US, said it
would reduce its order for Boeing aircraft. Smiths supplies to Boeing.
The losses announced by Amstrad had been well flagged in the market and the
shares edged up 2 to 28p on relatively heavy turnover of 6.6m. Computer
software group Electronic Data delivered another sparkling performance,
surging to close 65 higher at a record 513p in response to a couple of
agency crosses, carried out at 494p and 505p.
BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, lost 6 to 139p
on heavy turnover of 3.2m after suggestions that leading brokers had
downgraded their current year estimates to around Pounds 43m.
Cider taxation threatened to become a contentious issue between London and
Brussels, but the effect on the cider producers was varied. HP Bulmer
advanced 8 to 262p, while USM stock Merrydown fell 25 to 353p.
Analysts suggested that Bulmer has continued to recover from concern that it
may lose UK distribution rights for Perrier water.
Food retailer Argyll was firm, rising 6 to 316p, as BZW remained positive on
the sector's prospects and particularly the quality superstore operators. At
the same time, Kwik Save was muted in the face of a lower profits forecast
from BZW, gaining just a penny to 580p. Profits downgrades by several
brokers led to a weakening of the shares last week.
Hopes of lower UK interest rates in the near future provided general support
for stores, but Burton and Ratners remained under a cloud. Boots moved
forward 6 to 451p and Great Universal Stores 'A' appreciated 10 to 1435p.
Kleinwort Benson advice to switch out of Forte and into Ladbroke lifted the
latter 4 to 215p. Forte managed to gain a penny at 223p.
Textile issues saw unusually thin trade as around 100 analysts attended an
industry conference. However, SG Warburg circulated a note to clients
arguing that the sector would remain weak for the first half but that would
be followed by 'the second leg of the textile bull market'.
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken was slightly more positive in a review sent out
yesterday. Among the stocks it favoured, Courtaulds Textiles firmed 2 to
414p and Campari International gained 5 to 436p.
Buying ahead of today's results continued to bolster Reuters, which closed 8
higher at 1103p.
Tightly-traded Central Independent Television moved ahead 45 to 1233p. SG
Warburg Securities recommended the company in a recent wide-ranging note
which it has been discussing with Scottish institutions this week.
USM-quoted Sherwood Computer Services forged ahead 23 to 175p after
announcing that it had secured contracts totalling more than Pounds 4m in
recent weeks.
