FT  12 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poor volume again depresses equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR trading volume remained the principal feature yesterday of a UK stock
market unwilling, or unable, to move out of its current trading range.
Lingering hopes of an early cut in UK base rates pushed share prices ahead
at first. But FT-SE 2,550, challenged at 8.37am, proved the best of the
day's range and the final reading showed the index some 13 points below this
level for a net loss of 1.3.
A further half-point reduction in base rates is considered inevitable before
the UK general election, which the stock market has pencilled in for April
9. But the latest bout of rate speculation has come from the London money
markets, and has been received with caution in the stock market as it awaits
the latest UK inflation statistics, due at the end of this week.
Uncertainty over both interest rates and impending UK public opinion polls
continued to add to uncertainty in the equity sector. Although there were
many active features in the market, overall business in equities remained
very disappointing for marketmakers.
Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail, or customer, business in
equities fell to Pounds 690.4m on Monday, the lowest daily total since last
November after extracting the half-sessions traded over the Christmas break.
Yesterday's Seaq equity volume, which takes in both customer and
intra-market business, reached only 432.7m shares, little better than
Monday's 426.4m, bearing out traders' comments that 'business was little
better'.
Nervousness over the fall in genuine investment activity has been heightened
this week by reports that another broking operation is up for sale, and by a
further management shake-up at Salomon Brothers, of the US, involving its
London based operations.
Encouraged by Wall Street's firmness overnight and by renewed interest rate
hopes in the money markets, equities added 11.5 on the Footsie scale in
early deals. In the absence of investment support, however, shares soon
backed off and the Footsie struggled to remain in positive territory.
Later, London was helped by an early advance in New York but when the early
gain in the Dow was trimmed to 6 points in UK hours, the London market
shaded lower again.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,537.1, a net loss of 1.3. Traders
now see the London market as caught in a trading range between FT-SE 2,400
and 2,550, or '2,600 on a good day', as one trader put it yesterday.
Until both the domestic political and economic outlooks become more clear,
fund managers appear unwilling to chase stocks, although support yesterday
for ICI and for some store issues indicated that they are selective buyers
rather than sellers of shares. Traders also said that the institutions had
shown interest in second line issues.
There was no immediate response in London to reports that Mr Alan Greenspan,
chief of the US Federal Reserve Board, had told a US bankers' meeting that
the Fed stood ready to ease US monetary policy further if necessary. The
London market remained apprehensive over the outlook for Wall Street and for
the economic situation in the US.
Also overhanging London were doubts concerning the Japanese stock market
ahead of its return to trading today after a national holiday.

FT  12 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow holds up despite receding
rate cut hopes

Wall Street
SHARE PRICES were little changed yesterday after investors shrugged off
comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, which
appeared to rule out another interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 6.49 up at 3,251.57, the
index having rarely strayed from its overnight close all day. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a slight 0.01 easier at 413.76,
while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks failed to hold on to
an early gain, ending 0.76 off at 633.37.
New York SE turnover came to a moderate 200m shares and rises narrowly
outpaced declines by 949 to 753, an indication of the market's underlying
firm tone.
Although investors remain sensitive to changes in monetary policy - recent
gains have been fuelled by hopes of another interest rate reduction - they
chose to ignore statements by Mr Greenspan yesterday which indicated he was
satisfied that the last interest rate move, a one percentage point cut in
the discount rate on December 20, would be sufficient to spur the US economy
towards a solid recovery.
Attention focused on individual corporate stories, in particular on
quarterly results. Goodyear Tire climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 61 3/8
after announcing fourth-quarter income of Dollars 105.1m, a big improvement
on the Dollars 11.6m earned at the same stage of 1990.
Corning Glass declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 and Dow Chemical lost
Dollars 1 to Dollars 56 1/4 as the controversy surrounding the silicone
breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning, jointly owned by the two
companies, continued.
Following a delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side,
Greyhound rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 10 3/8 on the American Stock
Exchange after an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker issued an initial buy
recommendation, arguing that the company, which emerged from bankruptcy last
October, is well positioned to benefit from its role as the only US national
bus operation.
Deere &amp; Co advanced Dollars 1 initially but ended only Dollars  1/4 up at
Dollars 51 5/8 in the wake of an upgrade from Bear Stearns, the broking
house, which now rates the agricultural equipment maker's stock a 'buy'.
First Fidelity Bancorp firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 after Alex
Brown &amp; Sons added the stock to its 'emphasis' list for institutional
clients, citing the group's capital strength, asset quality improvement and
operating efficiencies.
On the over-the-counter market, Medical Graphics jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 16 1/4 in active trading after the US Food and Drug Administration
granted approval for the company's pulmonary function diagnostic system.
Canada
WEAKNESS in commodity prices led to moderate losses in Toronto stocks.
Causing the market to ease further towards the end of the day was the US
Treasury auction of three-year notes, which produced results weaker than
expected.
The composite index ended 10.6 down at 3,597.8, with declining issues
leading advances by 305 to 289. Volume totalled 29.4m shares.
Finning fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 13 1/8 after the company announced a
loss of CDollars 1.3m in the fourth quarter, against a profit of CDollars
4.0m a year earlier.
Alberta Natural Gas reported lower income from continuing operations in the
fourth quarter, but the stock gained CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 13.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rumours hit rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE money markets kept up a fury of speculation about an imminent cut in UK
interest rates yesterday, with short-term money softening during the day.
However, many traders said the market had misinterpreted recent actions by
the Bank of England to stem cash shortages. The decision to leave the market
short today was taken as a sign that the Bank had no intention of easing
policy this week, at least.
Today was expected to be a tight day, and a repurchase offer from the Bank
would depend on continuing interest rate speculation, said one senior
dealer.
The March short sterling contract jumped to 89.86 in the morning, although
it closed at its opening level of 89.80. This implies an interest rate of
10.2 per cent by the time the contract falls due, just one week after the UK
Budget on March 10.
The Budget could provide the best opportunity for a rate cut, said Mr David
Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank. If it boosted the Conservative
party's chances in the forthcoming general election, then sterling could
strengthen. This would give the 'window of opportunity' to cut base rates,
Mr Cocker said.
The market was also increasingly playing with the idea of a  1/4 point cut
in rates to accompany the retail price figures due out on Friday, said Mr
Mark Austin, an economist with Hongkong Bank.
The Bank of England left the market guessing about a rate cut during the
morning, ignoring the relatively small Pounds 250m shortage it had forecast
for the day. By noon, however, it was apparent that the Bank would not act
on rates.
In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 23m in band one bills at 10 3/8 per
cent. Late assistance of Pounds 10m left the market Pounds 217m short, but
overnight rates barely moved.
Overnight money traded at about 10 1/2 per cent for most of the day and
closed slightly firmer at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent.
The key three months interbank rate, which is used as an indicator of
interest rate sentiment, was easier yesterday at 10 3/8 - 1/4 per cent.
In Germany, call rates held steady at 9.55/65 per cent. Liquidity is
expected to come under pressure next week when tax payments for February
fall due.
In the US, the Federal Reserve signalled no change in the funds rate by
draining reserves at 3 7/8 per cent. The presumed target is 4 per cent.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR strengthened against the D-Mark yesterday, spurred by
speculators, rumours and the increasing perception that the Federal Reserve
would not cut rates, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The US unit jumped almost two pfennigs against the D-Mark in the morning,
before Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, spoke to US bankers.
Although he left his options open for a further rate reduction, Mr Greenspan
said he felt existing actions would be sufficient to prompt recovery. The
economic pay-off should come soon, he added.
Bolstering his statement, Washington-based consultancy Johnson and Smick
issued its own view that the Fed would not cut rates in the near term.
The dollar closed in London up two pfennigs at DM1.5905. The DM1.59 rate was
seen as a key support level. In New York it finished at DM1.5955.
The dollar is expected to trade within a fairly narrow range while the
market waits for the next significant economic data from the US. Retail
sales for January, to be published tomorrow, are expected to be flat.
Dollar sentiment was also boosted by talk that the Bank of Switzerland would
not prevent a sharp fall in the Swiss franc. Although the bank denied the
rumours, the damage had been done and the US currency strengthened from
SFr1.4040 to close at SFr1.4240 in London.
The yen weakened against the dollar in line with the D-Mark's fall. At one
stage, the Japanese unit hit Y127.50 against the dollar - close to the level
at which the Fed and the Bank of Japan intervened last month. But the rate
fell back to Y126.85, just 15 basis points above Monday's close. It rose in
New York to Y127.48.
A senior trader said there had been 'good interest' in dollar for yen trade
from Japanese banks.
Sterling also took some heat from a stronger dollar, falling in London from
Dollars 1.8260 to Dollars 1.8015. However, within the European exchange rate
mechanism, the pound appeared undeterred by speculation of a rate cut in the
UK.
It weakened only slightly against the D-Mark, from DM2.8675 to DM2.8650.
'The powers that be would be encouraged by sterling's performance against a
background of rumoured rate cuts,' said one dealer.
Paradoxically, when the Bank of England signalled that it would not cut
yesterday, sterling actually fell 20 to 30 points, the dealer added.
Rumours were rife during the day that the Spanish and British central banks
would simultaneously cut rates at some stage.
The peseta's lead within the ERM is keeping sterling pressed against the
limit of its allowed divergence from the central ecu rate. The pound ended
at Pta 180.68/78, virtually brushing the ERM floor of Pta 180.59.
Spanish inflation figures are to be published tomorrow, which could offer
the opportunity of a rate cut in Spain.

European Community farm ministers have finally started the hard bargaining
needed to get the Common Agricultural Policy reformed, EC officials and
diplomats said yesterday after a two-day meeting of the council of farm
ministers, reports Reuter from Brussels.
'They're into the horse-trading stage ..(Mr Ray) MacSharry's (the
agriculture commissioner) pushing it,' a commission official commented after
a discussion led by the Portuguese chairman, Mr Arlindo Cunha, whose country
holds the EC's rotating presidency.
Mr MacSharry's CAP reform involves streamlining a system that is chronically
prone to costly, subsidised overproduction. The cereals, beef and dairy
sectors continue to be the biggest headaches.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agricultural situation not
sustainable, Major warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AGRICULTURAL industry has to face up to change because the present
situation is simply not sustainable, Mr John Major, the prime minister, told
the National Farmers' Union's annual general meeting in London yesterday.
Pointing to the deadlock in the Uruguay round of negotiations in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as well as the escalating cost of Europe's
Common Agricultural Policy, he said: 'Consumers and taxpayers both spend a
good deal more, and yet what happens to that? Farmers earn less and less,
food is in surplus, trade is distorted, developing countries are damaged,
the pressures on the environment increase and the costs grow out of all
proportion to the benefits'.
The government had intervened so often and so much in agriculture that it
could not wash its hands of the agricultural industry. While both Gatt and
CAP reform were not wholly within the remit of the UK government to solve,
said Mr Major, it would 'be working hard for solutions which do not put an
undue burden on our own farmers and on our own industry'.
Earlier Mr David Naish, the NFU president, attacked governments for
dithering over Gatt and CAP reform, which he described as 'a danger at any
time'. He said: 'With UK farm incomes at rock bottom, they threaten the very
being of our industry'.
Investment was collapsing, and incomes were in long term decline. Each week
250 people left the land, said Mr Naish.
Mr Major - the first prime minister to address an NFU AGM - said that
agriculture had been a distorted market for decades, and the best long-term
answer was to reduce the distortions. Farmers would then have to adopt
business practices to succeed. The future would be more competitive, 'and
those who succeed will be those who adapt and prepare and meet that
competitive market head-on'.
Mr Major said agriculture was not a declining industry, but a changing
industry. 'Acre for acre, crop for crop, and herd for herd we still have the
best farming industry in this country that you can find anywhere in the
world, so you can compete and the opportunities for us to do so are clearly
going to be there.'
Planners, farmers and conservationists will next month attend a government
seminar examining countryside planning controls, the prime minister told the
NFU.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US sued over Chilean fruit ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILEAN FRUIT growers and exporters are suing the US government for Dollars
212m in compensation for the losses they suffered during a three-week trade
embargo against Chilean fruit in March 1989.
Mr Ronald Bown, president of the Chilean Exporters Association, said the
lawsuit would be lodged today in Philadelphia, the main US port of entry for
Chilean fruit.
The US Food and Drug Administration halted Chilean fruit imports three
years' ago after discovering two grapes laced with cyanide in a shipment
that had arrived in Philadelphia. The three-week ban, at the height of
Chile's fruit exporting season, dealt a severe blow to the industry. Chile
is the world's main supplier of fresh fruit during the northern hemisphere's
winter months and about 40 per cent of its produce is sold in the US.
Exporters believe they have scientific evidence to prove that the grapes
could not have been poisoned in Chile. Researchers at the University of
California and Chilean institutes concluded that the cyanide should have
spread to all the grapes in the box. The FDA was unable, however, to detect
even trace amounts of the deadly substance after analysing all the other
grapes in the bunch.
This has led Chilean exporters to believe that the poisoning must have taken
place accidentally at the laboratories of the FDA. The latter vigorously
denies that the grapes were mishandled.
Last year the Chilean fruit industry lodged an administrative tort claim
against the US Department of Health, which runs the FDA. The claim was
dismissed by the Department of Justice. This time round, the claimants -
3,000 fruit growers and more than 100 exporters - will seek compensation
through the US courts.
Mr Bown believes the lawsuit could involve legal fees of over Dollars 2m.
The cyanide scare exposed the fragility of Chile's highly-geared fruit
industry and its overdependence on the US market. Many fruit growers and
exporters went bankrupt. Although exports have recovered and totalled
Dollars 948m last year, the business is now considered a high-risk venture,
whereas before it was seen as a generator of certain profits.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Need for more copper mines
foreseen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER MARKET growth would require another 1.4m short tons (2,000 lb) of new
mining capacity by the year 2000 - equivalent to nine new world-class mines
 -according to Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, the US integrated
metals group.
He suggested at the annual meeting of the American Mining Congress, the US
industry's main trade association, that 'by the middle of this decade the
issues confronting this country and our industry may well be availability
and access to new copper reserves'.
Mr Osborne's forecast was one of the most optimistic to emerge recently from
the copper producers. It contrasted markedly with one from Mr Phillip
Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining
company, who said in December that there should be enough copper at all
stages of its production to satisfy prospective demand. On mine capacity, Mr
Crowson said that 'fears over shortages are not only unfounded but
positively misplaced'.
Mr Osborne suggested that Mr Crowson was taking a less optimistic view than
he of the future role of copper in communications. 'Earlier fears of massive
(market) losses to fibre optics have not materialised,' he pointed out.
AT &amp; T, the US communications group, recently said 2.5m miles of copper wire
and cable would be installed in the US in 1992 compared with 141,000 miles
of optical fibre. 'Growth in both fibre optic and copper communication links
is creating new demand for copper in devices at either end. In 1991 some
286,000 tons of copper was used in all forms in telecommunications in the
US.'
Mr Osborne said he agreed with suggestions that, instead of being replaced
in telecommunications, 'a more likely scenario is one in which copper
'handshakes' with other technologies in economic solutions that meet the
realities of business and consumer demands.'
Mr Osborne pointed out that US copper producers were now among the
lowest-cost in the world but warned that, if they were to continue to play
an important role in the US, they must have access to public lands to
explore for new reserves and must have a mining law that provided the
security of tenure needed to justify investment in new copper properties.
His forecast of mine capacity was based on the assumption that total world
copper consumption, including that in the former communist bloc, would grow
by 2.4 per cent annually to 2,000, increasing 1991's estimated consumption
of 11.9m short tons to 14.7m.
Copper prices would range between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 2,400 a tonne
this year, suggested Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, senior trader at the Sumitomo
Corporation, in a paper prepared for the American Metal Market 1992 Copper
Forum.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Mad cow' disease spreads to
antelopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform
encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope
population, the government has admitted.
Three elands, three greater kudu and an arabian oryx have been diagnosed
with the disease over the past three years. In all, six species other than
cattle have been confirmed with the condition during this period.
The statistics - released in response to a written question from Mr Ron
Davies, a Labour agriculture spokesman - show a disconcertingly rapid
increase in the number of sheep found to have the disease.
A total of 894 cases of sheep encephalopathies or 'scrapie' were diagnosed
in 1991, versus just 348 a year-earlier. However, the government states in a
footnote to the table that the reporting of scrapie in sheep has been
encouraged since 1991 'to obtain material for spongiform encephalopathy
research'.
Since 1989, the condition has also been confirmed in 23 cats and 29 goats.
Mr David Maclean, junior agriculture minister, stressed that naturally
occurring spongiform encephalopathies in species other than cattle were not
notifiable diseases.
He said there was 'insufficient epidemiological data' to 'draw firm
conclusions' as to how the disease might have been contracted in cases other
than scrapie.
Scrapie, he said, was considered to be transmissible 'both maternally and
horizontally'.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: No celebrations over bumper tea
crop / A report on the problems facing Sri Lankan growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SRI LANKAN tea production last year reached a record 240.7m kg, beating the
1990 figure of 233m kg. But the bumper crop was no cause for celebration:
sales were down by 2 per cent and prices by more than 20 per cent.
Mr Michael de Zoysa, chairman of the Ceylon Tea Traders Association,
estimates that sales totaled about 225m kg in 1991, down from 230m kg. And
Mr Sepala Ilangakoon, president of the island's tea board calculates that in
1991 the average price per kilogram fell from 1990's exceptionally high
figure of SLR70.97 (Dollars 1.77) to about R56 (Dollars 1.33 at the
depreciated exchange rate).
Both Mr Ilangakoon and Mr de Zoysa agree that the chaos in the Soviet Union,
a big buyer, Iraq's absence from the Colombo auctions and over-supply were
responsible for the drop in prices. 'Two good crops in 1989 and 1990 led to
an over-supply situation in exporting countries, while importers were also
over-stocked,' says Mr Ilangakoon.
The large 1990 crop, coupled with attractive prices, tended to spoil
producers, observes Mr de Zoysa. Meanwhile, the government exacerbated the
situation by taking measures benefitting private owners of smaller tea
estates, who are less able than the two giant state corporations, the SPC
and the JEDB, to absorb wage increases.
These measures include a reduction in export duties, the tea cess (local
tax) and the sales tax. At the same time a new credit scheme by state banks
offers factory owners easier credit, with the government paying half the
interest for specified projects such as factory modernisation. The
government also adapted an idea from Indonesia to make arrangements with
both the state-run banks to give foreign currency loans at concessionary
interest rates.
Some of these relief measures have been particularly appreciated by the
island's 170,000 smallholders, who own anything from 10 to 50 acres of tea.
The quality of the produce in such estates remains a worry for the
government, however, while an ill-disciplined labour force, given to
absenteeism, is a particular worry for the small producer.
Sri Lankan tea producers were lucky last year, particularly because of the
armed separatist revolt in India's state of Assam, where high-grown quality
tea, comparable with Sri Lanka's Nuwara Eliya or Uva, is grown. Tea
production in Assam has been hit severely by the insurgency.
Meanwhile the World Bank has urged the government to 'commercialise' the
JEDB and the SPC, the two huge state corporations set up by the 'socialist'
government of Mrs Bandaranaike as part of a land reform programme introduced
by her Marxist plantations minister. Each individual's holding was limited
to 50 acres and the vast acreage surrendered by land owners were placed
under two state-run corporations. The labour force was organised by leftwing
trade unions controlled by the Marxist parties. Prolonged strikes and
wild-cat stoppages for higher wages or on some political issue were quite
frequent.
The leader of the largest and the most disciplined union was Mr S.
Thondaman, now tourism minister in President Premadasa's cabinet. The
plantation labour is Indian (rather than Sri Lankan) Tamil. A cheap labour
force numbering nearly 1m was imported from south India by British planters
and large British tea companies before Sri Lanka became independent in 1948.
To please the majority (Buddhist) Sinhalese, the Indian Tamil (Hindu)
plantation workers were made 'stateless', under Indian/Sri Lankan
agreements. The Indian government agreed to the repatriation of 600,000
while Sri Lanka agreed to take back 400,000 of its citizens. The process is
under way but there is still a large number of 'Indian workers' on the
plantations.
Entirely new dangers now threaten the tea lands. When the Aid Sri Lanka
group sponsored by the World Bank, meets in Paris on February 7 one of the
major recommendations is the dissolution of the two state corporations. They
will be replaced by 22 state-owned companies that will be managed by private
companies, local or foreign.
Already 110 have passed 'pre-qualification' tests, British, Hong Kong and
Malysian companies being approved. But the best known are top Indian groups
like Tata Teas, the Chettinad Corporation and Birlas, as well as Brooke Bond
and AV Thomas.
A fiercely anti-Tamil and anti-Indian Sinhala opposition has raised the
bogey of another 'Indian invasion' into the central highlands at a time when
the north and east are ravaged by the separatist Tamil Tiger insurgency. The
local press has highlighted a daring payroll robbery on the tea plantations
recently, for which the press claim the Tigers were responsible. And there
have been reports of the Tigers recruiting Tamil youth on the plantations to
open a new front. The spectre of Assam is haunting Sri Lanka's green tea
lands.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Lack of regulator stalls DTB
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) to expand outside Germany are being
hampered by the country's lack of a central regulator for the securities
industry, said Mr Jorg Franke, chief executive of Germany's screen-based
futures and options market, in an interview with the Financial Times.
Over the past two months, the DTB has held preliminary negotiations with
regulators in France and the UK with a view to establishing terminals in
Paris and London.
The UK's Securities &amp; Investments Board has raised no objections to the way
in which the DTB is regulated by the Finance Ministry in the state of Hesse,
where it is based. However, the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the
French stock market regulator, has said that it will only recognise the DTB
if it is overseen by a federal authority.
DTB's impasse comes less than three weeks after Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's
federal finance minister, introduced a package of measures designed to
increase Germany's attractions as a financial centre.
Central to the package was an unambiguous proposal that the current
regulatory system, which leaves each of Germany's 16 Lander responsible for
supervising securities markets in its own territory, should be replaced with
a centralised supervisory body.
Mr Franke said he was in favour of the Waigel plan but did not want to wait
for it to be put into effect. The process of establishing a structure which
will balance the interests of the Lander with the centre will be
time-consuming and the DTB is hoping that the Bonn Finance Ministry will
take on the job of negotiating with the French authorities.
The decision to let DTB's 72 members have screens overseas is part of an
intensifying struggle with the London International Financial Futures Market
(Liffe) and Matif in Paris to dominate Europe's futures and options markets.
As part of its battle, the DTB is also considering introducing further
products to enhance its share of the market. In the pipeline are a future on
a three-month interest rate, a future or option on a European equity index,
and an Ecu-bond future.
The most vigorous competition between the two-year-old DTB and London has
been over the bund futures contract, a market traditionally dominated by
Liffe. The DTB's market share rose from 6 per cent early last year to over
20 per cent in October and 30 per cent in each of the past three months,
reflecting a concerted effort of the DTB and its members to concentrate bund
futures business in Germany rather than London.
Mr Franke said that, following a meeting of DTB designated market-makers in
November, the big German banks had chosen to support the DTB in a
'whole-hearted' rather than a half-hearted way. 'This has had an important
psychological effect on the whole market,' said Mr Franke.
The surge in business has prompted accusations of unfair tactics, such as
the setting of minimum trading levels by some members.

SINGAPORE's United Overseas Bank (UOB) has set up a venture capital company
to invest in expanding companies in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region,
Reuter reports.
The company, UOB Venture Investments, with an authorised capital of SDollars
1m (USDollars 617m), said it would seek to achieve medium to long-term
capital appreciation through investments in emerging growth companies in the
region.
Singapore's venture capital funds totalled SDollars 2.07bn at the end of
November, up from SDollars 1.25bn at the end of 1990, the state Economic
Development Board said in December.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease as hopes of interest rate
cut recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday after comments from Mr
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, dampened hopes of another
interest rate cut.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year govern-ment bond was up  1/16 at 102
7/16 , yielding 7.781 per cent, but the two-year note was markedly weaker,
down  5/32 at 99 3/4 , yielding 4.992 per cent.
Already unnerved by this week's planned auction of Dollars 36bn in new
government securities, market sentiment took another knock yesterday morning
when Mr Greenspan, addressing a conference of the Independent Bankers
Association of America, said that the 1 percentage point cut in the discount
rate in December should prove enough 'to turn the economy onto the path of
sustained recovery'.
Although the Fed chairman later reiterated his assertion that the
authorities were prepared to ease policy again should economic conditions
warrant it, his earlier comments were interpreted by market participants as
a hint that no further interest rate cuts were in the pipeline.
Since last Friday, when the January employment report showed a much larger
decline in civilian payrolls than analysts expected, the market has been
building its hopes that the Fed would sanction another easing of monetary
policy to assist the ailing economy. Yesterday's comments from Mr Greenspan
put a dent in those hopes.
The reduced likelihood of a policy ease was underlined just before noon when
the Fed intervened in the credit markets with a round of matched
sale-purchase agreements. The Fed's target for the rate remains at 4 per
cent, and yesterday's intervention was intended to pressurise the Fed funds
rate upwards from 3 7/8 per cent, where it has languished since Monday on
hopes of an interest rate cut.
Later in the session, sentiment received another knock when there was a
lacklustre response from investors to the afternoon auction of Dollars
15.02bn in three-year notes. Demand for the sale, the first part of the
three-leg Dollars 36bn refunding programme, was subdued, and the securities
eventually fetched an average yield of 5.54 per cent, below expectations.
The absence of retail buyers at the two-year note auction does not augur
well for the remaining two legs of the refunding, and analysts warned
yesterday that Treasury prices could suffer if tomorrow's sale of 10-year
notes and 30-year bonds runs into similar problems.
FAVOURABLE producer output figures and renewed hopes of a base rate cut
helped the UK government bond market to start the day on a firm note, but
prices drifted back during the day to close slightly lower.
British producer output price growth slowed in January, with output prices
rising 4.5 per cent year-on-year. Traders said the figures provide a
favourable backdrop for the gilt market, pointing to a fall in underlying
retail price inflation and adding to speculation about a cut in the base
rate.
Hopes of an interest rate cut pushed gilt prices higher on Monday and the
rise continued yesterday morning, allowing the Bank of England to sell some
of its new tap stock, the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012.
Traders estimated that between Pounds 300 and Pounds 500m of the Pounds
1.25bn issue was sold.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 98.01 and traded at around 97.26
by late afternoon on average volume. Traders said short-dated gilts closed
higher on the day, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 moving from 101 5/32
to 101 7/32 . The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 was unchanged
at 116 9/32 , yielding 9.33 per cent.
SPANISH government bonds rallied on expectations of lower inflation and a
possible cut in interest rates. The rally was mainly driven by domestic
buying although traders reported some foreign interest.
The January Consumer Prices Index due to be released tomorrow is now
expected to show a 1.5 per cent month-on-month rise rather than the 1.8-2.0
per cent month-on-month increase originally forecast.
The lower inflation forecast fuelled hopes of lower interest rates, given
the strength of the peseta. The 11.60 per cent bond due 1997 rose from
100.95 to 101.15, while the 11.30 per cent bond due 2002 rose from 102.55 to
a high of 102.95 before settling back to 102.85 by late afternoon.
LONG-DATED German government bonds edged up on worries about a shortage of
ten-year paper.
Traders said ten-year bond prices climbed on speculation over whether the
Bundesbank would be issuing much long-term paper before the summer.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 88.14, rose to a high of
88.31 before closing at 88.21.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Stelco and Dofasco slip into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S two biggest steelmakers, Dofasco and Stelco, suffered a combined
loss of more than CDollars 160m (USDollars 136.7m) in 1991, exacerbated by a
sharp deterioration in business conditions towards the end of the year.
Dofasco's loss was CDollars 25m, or 73 cents a share, compared with a loss
after writedowns of CDollars 679.2m, or CDollars 10.64, in 1990.
The bulk of the 1990 loss came from the write-off of the company's CDollars
713m investment in Algoma Steel. Revenues dipped to CDollars 2.06bn from
CDollars 2.36bn.
Stelco suffered a net loss of CDollars 136m, or CDollars 3.05 a share,
against the 1990 loss of CDollars 197m, or CDollars 5.96 a share. Revenues
edged down to CDollars 2bn from CDollars 2.09bn.
Dofasco's fourth-quarter loss was CDollars 1.5m, including an operating loss
of CDollars 24.4m.
Stelco said that an improvement in its financial performance in the first
nine months of last year came to an 'abrupt' halt, which left it CDollars
38m in the red in the final three months.
It blamed the fourth-quarter setback on a sharp price decline caused by the
need to find new markets for higher-value products earmarked for the
automotive industry.
Dofasco said that demand for flat rolled steel dropped by 10 per cent last
year, and 24 per cent below the peak of 1988. Total steel shipments dipped
by 6 per cent in the fourth quarter to 872,000 tons.

<TEXT>
CINCINNATI Milacron, one of the world's biggest machine tool makers,
returned to the black in the fourth quarter, despite declining sales, after
three unprofitable quarters in 1991.
Mr Daniel Mayer, chairman, predicted that 1992 would be profitable, thanks
to lower costs, new products and a sizeable backlog, although he expected a
slow first quarter.
For the fourth quarter, ended December 28, the company had net income of
Dollars 4m, or 15 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 31.1m, or
Dollars 1.15 a year earlier.
The 1990 figures were muddied by special charges which cost the company
about Dollars 1.13 a share. Sales fell 6 per cent to Dollars 201.9m from
Dollars 214.7m.
For 1991, Cincinnati Milacron recorded a net loss of Dollars 100.2m, or
Dollars 3.67 a share, including one-time charges of Dollars 90m, against a
net loss of Dollars 24.3m, or 95 cents, in 1990.
Sales in the year edged 6.4 per cent lower to Dollars 754m from Dollars
805.2m.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Plant sale boosts net at
Goodyear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOURTH-QUARTER net earnings at Goodyear, the last surviving US tyre-maker,
were boosted by a Dollars 43.2m extraordinary after-tax gain from the sale
of an Alabama tyre cord plant. The company also forecast the sale of more
non-tyre assets during 1992.
The Ohio-based Goodyear yesterday reported net profits of Dollars 105.1m, or
Dollars 1.65 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1991, up sharply from the
Dollars 11.6m, or 20 cents of the last quarter of 1990. Fourth-quarter sales
of Dollars 2.8bn were down slightly on the corresponding period in 1990.
Goodyear's fourth-quarter earnings, which were forecast by the company last
month, would have been 97 cents a share without the gain from the Alabama
asset disposal. Lower interest expenses also helped the company's net
result.
For the whole of 1991, Goodyear managed net earnings of Dollars 96.6m, or
Dollars 1.61, against a loss of Dollars 38.3m, or 66 cents, in 1990. The
company last month forecast a Dollars 96m 1991 net profit. Revenues for 1991
were 3.2 per cent lower at Dollars 10.9bn.
Wall Street reacted to the result by marking the shares Dollars  7/8 higher
to Dollars 61 3/8 at close of trading. The share price has benefited in
recent weeks from the bull market in equities and from an intensive campaign
to tell investors and analysts about Goodyear's recovery prospects.
The campaign has been led by Mr Stanley Gault, chairman. He said yesterday
he was pleased with the earnings improvement, although he acknowledged that
worldwide demand for tyres and other motor vehicle products remained weak.
He said the company's efforts to contain selling, administrative and general
costs was yielding positive results. Goodyear was also helped by lower raw
material costs and savings from its restructuring programme.
Mr Gault said that during 1991 Goodyear's debt was reduced by Dollars 1bn,
to Dollars 2.6bn. This was due to the Alabama asset sale and to the sale of
Dollars 582m of Goodyear stock. He said debt and interest costs would
decline in 1992 due to further non-tyre asset sales.
For all of 1991, Goodyear's tyre division had operating income of Dollars
620.8m, compared with Dollars 463.4m in 1990. Revenues in the division were
2.8 per cent lower at Dollars 9bn. Revenues in the general products division
were down by 5.4 per cent.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Implant dispute prompts shake-up
at Dow Corning
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE magnitude of the silicone breast implant controversy has been reflected
in a management shake-up at Dow Corning, the biggest maker of the devices,
which has appointed a new chairman and chief executive to help cope with
growing concerns about the product.
Mr Keith McKennon, a former executive at Dow Chemical, has been named Dow
Corning's chairman and chief executive.
He replaces Mr Lawrence Reed as chief executive and Mr John Ludington, as
chairman. Mr Ludington will retire, but will remain a director of the
company. Mr Reed was named chief operating operator and will retain his role
of president of the company.
Mr Ludington said the changes came after the board decided 'the company must
focus top executive attention to both the complex issues related to silicone
beast implants as well as the ongoing operations of the company.'
Dow Corning is a 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning.
The move comes one week ahead of a Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) advisory
panel meeting to decide if silicone implants are safe enough to remain on
the market.
There has been a moratorium on the devices since January.
Mr Robert Rylee, head of Dow Corning Wright's health care businesses, said
the company was committed to continue 'the research on the safety of the
materials used in implants and report the results to the FDA and the
public,' regardless of the FDA panel's decision.
The recognition of the importance of the implant issue is a significant
change in stance for Dow Corning. When the FDA advisory panel ruled in
November that the implants had not been proved safe, the company said it
strongly disagreed with the decision. Dow Corning later became an outspoken
critic of what it termed 'baseless innuendo and anecdotal claims' made by
critics of breast implants which the company said overlooked scientific
data.
Although the implants contribute less than 1 per cent to Dow Corning's
Dollars 2bn annual sales, the controversy has taken its toll on Dow and
Corning's shares amid growing concern that the company will be swamped with
law suits. Dow's shares fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 56 1/4 yesterday, while
Corning's dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 .

PANCONTINENTAL Mining, the Sydney-based metals company, has staged a big
earnings turnround in the first half to December, following the sale last
year of its stalled Jabiluka uranium prospect in the Northern Territory,
writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The company turned an ADollars 83.73m (USDollars 62.9m) net loss into a
ADollars 57.88m profit on a 17 per cent rise in revenue to ADollars 101.6m.
The turnround came from an abnormal gain of ADollars 67.9m on the sale of
Jabiluka to Energy Resources of Australia, which operates the nearby Ranger
uranium mine.
Mr Lindsay MacAlister, managing director, said the group had offset reduced
earnings from mining operations by cost-cutting and a fall in interest
payments. Net debt fell ADollars 48m to ADollars 173m.
Pancontinental shares have risen strongly in recent months, and yesterday
gained 5 cents to 96 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
NORANDA, the diversified Canadian resources group, blamed lower commodities
prices for a CDollars 133m (USDollars 120.9m) loss last year, and warned
that no recovery was in sight until the second half of 1992.
The Toronto-based group, whose earnings traditionally fluctuate widely in
line with markets for forestry products, metals and oil and gas, posted net
earnings of CDollars 120m in 1990. The per-share loss last year was CDollars
1.04, compared with earnings of 36 cents.
The 1991 setback includes writedowns and other restructuring charges
totalling CDollars 108m.
Revenues fell to CDollars 1.99bn from CDollars 2.29bn.
Earnings from mining and metals plummeted to CDollars 66m in 1991 from
CDollars 301m in 1990, due almost entirely to lower prices. The forestry
division swung to a loss of CDollars 75m from earnings of CDollars 16m, also
reflecting lower prices and mill operating rates well below capacity.
Oil and gas earnings dropped to CDollars 11m from Dollars 59m.
The company, which is controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman
family and their managers, does not expect significant improvement in the
economy in the first half of this year.
However, it predicted that lower interest rates and a weaker Canadian dollar
will lead to improved results in the second half.
It is hoping for a 'reasonable recovery' in 1993.
Long-term debt totalled CDollars 4.5bn on Dec 31 1991, little changed from
the previous year. But net interest payments fell to CDollars 450m from
CDollars 493m.

<TEXT>
BLACK &amp; Decker, the US household equipment-maker and information services
provider, yesterday unveiled a fourth-quarter profit of Dollars 31.9m,
thanks primarily to lower interest expenses and a turnround in earnings from
its Brazilian operations. In the same quarter of 1990, the company earned
just Dollars 6.8m.
For the full-year, Black &amp; Decker made a net profit of Dollars 53m, a modest
improvement on the Dollars 51.1m earned a year earlier. Revenues for the
year fell slightly to Dollars 4.6bn, due mostly to recessions in three big
markets - the US, the UK and Australia.
The company was encouraged by stronger-than-expected domestic fourth-quarter
sales, particularly of its power tools, household products and Kwikset
locks, and by its low inventories.
Black &amp; Decker's figures were well received on Wall Street, and the shares
rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

COMBINED net profits of the 15 Thai commercial banks rose to Bt19.46bn
(Dollars 807.5m) in 1991, up 25.4 per cent from Bt15.52bn a year ago,
according to Bangkok Bank, Reuter reports.
Bangkok Bank said the slower rate of earnings growth, compared with 1990
when profits soared 85.4 per cent, may be due to an economic slowdown, wide
interest rate fluctuations, and higher operating expenses and staff
salaries.
Bangkok Bank said its 1991 record profit of Bt7.3bn accounted for 37.3 per
cent of total net after-tax earnings of all Thai banks.
Bangkok Bank was followed by the Thai Farmers Bank with Bt3.4bn, or a 17.5
per cent share, and the Siam Commercial Bank at Bt2.7bn, a 13.8 per cent
share.
Total Thai bank lending rose a combined 21.8 per cent in 1991, to an
outstanding Bt1,797.4bn at the end of December.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: ITT records 14% decline but
raises its dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday blamed the extended worldwide recession
and the strength of the US dollar for a 14.7 per cent drop in its 1991 net
earnings to Dollars 817m, or Dollars 6.05 a share.
The New York-based group recorded a 1 per cent decline in 1991 revenues, to
Dollars 20.4bn. However, it said that its operating income and financial
strength were sufficient to permit an increase in the annual dividend, from
Dollars 1.72 to Dollars 1.84 a share.
The results appeared to have had little impact on Wall Street as the
company's share price closed unchanged last night at Dollars 59 1/4 .
Net income in the fourth quarter of 1991 was Dollars 195m, or Dollars 1.44 a
share, more than double the Dollars 84m, or 65 cents, earned in the last
quarter of 1990. But the 1991 fourth quarter included after-tax portfolio
gains totalling Dollars 79m at the ITT Hartford insurance group and ITT
financial division.
Fourth-quarter revenues declined by 2 per cent, to Dollars 5.35bn.
ITT said that three of its four service businesses improved their operating
earnings in 1991. These were the Hartford insurance group, the ITT
communications and information services division and the ITT financial arm.
The ITT Sheraton hotel business suffered lower earnings as a result of lower
occupancy rates, which reflected reduced travel in the US and the impact of
recession.
Hartford's investment income and improved US underwriting helped the
insurance business, but non-US operations were affected adversely by
problems in the UK.
ITT's defence division had higher earnings on lower sales due to improved
contract performance. The automotive business suffered a significant decline
in operating income.
Forest products operations had sharply lower operating earnings, reflecting
the industry downturn in pulp pricing. ITT electronic components showed a
loss in 1991 due to restructuring and volume reductions while ITT fluid
technology results were hit by lower margins.

restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FEDERAL Express, the Memphis-based express package delivery company,
yesterday confirmed market suspicions that it is actively looking to
restructure its international operations, although it would notspeculate on
when any decisions might be reached.
After the company's shares shot Dollars 3 1/2 higher yesterday on heavy
volume, Federal Express released a formal statement saying it had been
considering various options aimed at reducing its losses overseas.
These options, said the company, could include restructurings as well as
co-operative or other business arrangements with third parties. Preliminary
talks had been held with various outside parties, it added, but the delivery
company stressed the examination of available options was 'at this stage,
exploratory only'.
It stated 'no conclusions have been reached with respect to any courses of
action the company may take, nor have there been any agreements with third
parties'. On the stock market, final volume in Federal Express shares
totalled 1.54m, against an average daily trading of 166,400 shares.
The bulk of Federal Express's problems overseas have come in Europe and the
UK. Last spring, the company took a Dollars 121m charge against earnings to
cover workforce and other cuts in the UK and a large part of its British
operation has been sold back to Littlewoods, the privately-owned UK
retailer.
But in the second quarter of its current financial year - to end-November -
Federal Express still reported operating losses of Dollars 64.5m, up from
Dollars 54.7m a year earlier and said it was 'disgusted' with the
performance.
Analysts have speculated that, while it would be difficult for the company
to abandon service to European destinations for competitive reasons, it
could try to cut fixed costs by using third party agents or entering into
joint venture arrangements on a regional basis.

<TEXT>
ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian metals producer, yesterday reported 1991
pre-tax losses of NKr528m (Dollars 104.2m), compared with a loss of NKr659m
the previous year. It is passing its dividend for the second year running.
In 1990, group losses included a NKr429m charge for restructuring and
write-downs of assets.
Group sales fell by NKr194m to NKr7.814bn, but operating costs were reduced
by NKr42m to NKr7.624bn. Operating losses widened to NKr209m from NKr35m in
1990.
However, Elkem said that it had made a NKr179m gain on the sale of a 50 per
cent share in Alcoa Nederland but NKr135m had been charged to accounts for
restructuring.
Of the total restructuring charge, NKr60m covered 1991 staff reductions of
1,000 to 6,600, while NKr75m was allocated to cover 1992 measures. Elkem
added that it expected to reduce staff this year by about 300.
Elkem explained that last year it had experienced increased competition in
its main markets, and it warned that current prices in 'real terms' for
several of its products were at their lowest levels in 20 years. The company
suffered from low demand and over-capacity in world markets which depressed
prices.
Elkem is evaluating 'various' measures to strengthen its balance sheet and
to reduce the amount of capital employed, 'including the possible sale of
business units that have limited strategic significance'.
The company also said that it was seeking to co-ordinate changes in the
structure of the ferro-alloys industry with other Norwegian metals producers
and to secure long-term access to raw materials for the production of
manganese and chrome alloys.
The emphasis, the company said, would 'be placed on measures which reduce
costs, utilise economies of scale and secure the greatest possible capacity
utilisation'.

fall

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German metals, mining and engineering company,
continues to suffer from low non-ferrous metal prices but hopes that profits
will improve in the current year, ending September 1992.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, said yesterday that earnings in the
first four months of the 1991-92 fiscal year had been slightly below those
for the same period of the previous year.
Two depressants on prices have been smelting over-capacity in western Europe
and increased sales from stockpiles in Russia and eastern Europe.
In addition to low metal prices, continuing problems with new smelters and
in the motor components industry held profits back.
Last year, group net income dropped 32 per cent to DM179m (Dollars 112m) on
turnover 7 per cent higher at DM21.2bn. Metallgesellschaft is holding its
dividend at DM10 a share. Earnings per share slumped from DM29.7 to DM10.3,
reflecting minority interests
However, the company said cash-flow was expected to increase substantially
this year after a drop of 8 per cent to DM657m in 1990-91.
Included in the results from January 1 this year are the non-paper
activities of Feldmuhle Nobel, which Metallgesellschaft bought from Stora of
Sweden for DM1.45bn. Metallgesellschaft holds 80 per cent, and Deutsche Bank
and Dresdner Bank own 10 per cent each.
These activities comprise Buderus (building materials and stainless steel
goods), Dynamit Nobel (explosives and plastics) and Cerasiv (ceramics and
engineering plastics). Last year, these activities made a pre-tax profit of
DM200m.
One reason that the group feels the bottom has been reached in its downward
profits trend is that its new smelters, with advanced operating and
anti-pollution technology, are starting to contribute to profits after high
start-up costs and some teething troubles.
Also, older smelters operated by rival companies are thought likely to close
gradually for environmental reasons.
Among other group activities, Lurgi, the industrial plant subsidiary, booked
a 40 per cent rise in new orders in the first quarter. Kolbenschmidt, the
motor parts maker, was trying to recover from a profits slump caused partly
by the poor state of the US market.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: A desperate need for hits in an intensive
price war / A look at Amstrad, a 1980s success story, as it reports a
first-time loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN EARLY 1990, after Amstrad had suffered a sharp deterioration in profits,
Mr Alan Sugar emerged from one of the rockiest periods in his company's
history and declared that he had put the bad times behind him.
The next financial year, he stated confidently, 'will be the year to make
money.'
Two years later, in the face of the first loss his company has ever
reported, Mr Sugar is making no such predictions yet.
The group which he built up from scratch into a success story of the 1980s
is facing what could be its most difficult test to date.
Amstrad is having to retreat in main product areas at a time when it has not
yet found the next blockbuster hit to keep the group going.
The PC market, which it depends on for over 40 per cent of turnover, is in
turmoil.
Production of PCs has been halted since last summer in an effort to reduce
stock levels and speculation that Amstrad will pull out of the PC market
altogether prompted a statement by Mr Sugar of his commitment to the
computer market.
Recession in economies throughout the world and the changing market
environment for PCs has forced manufacturers at the higher end of the
market, such as IBM and Compaq, to slash their prices.
Amstrad, which built up a significant market share largely on the strength
of competitive pricing, has been a loser in the price wars which have robbed
it of its main advantage over the larger industry leaders with their premium
brands.
Conditions in its other product markets have been just as dismal in the
prolonged recession. The market for VCRs and home computers have been a
battleground for intense price competition.
In the case of home computers the competition has been such that Amstrad has
had to pull out of the market for games and entertainment computers where it
was faced by the formidable popularity of Nintendo games.
The only areas where Amstrad has maintained resilience are in satellite
receivers and dishes, its second largest consumer product category, fax
machines and word processors.
However, even in the satellite division where sales have been buoyant,
profits have been affected by the slowdown on the continent, particularly in
Germany where Amstrad has been building up satellite market share.
Amstrad's current plight raises the question of whether the group's strategy
of providing consumer electronics and computer products at competitive
prices, is appropriate in the more sober and more competitive trading
environment of the early 1990s.
Its response to the situation so far has been to make sure its house is in
order to weather the tide.
It has introduced management and financial controls, kept inventory control
a priority and strengthened its balance sheet.
If Amstrad can see through the current storm, with the help of its
restructuring program and healthy balance sheet, it is bound to come out of
the recession leaner and stronger than it was when it went into it.
With an optimism only slightly more measured than two years ago, Mr Sugar
points out that the large PC manufacturers have suffered just as heavily
from the price competition and 'once their inventories have been depleted
the market will come back profitably for Amstrad.'
As soon as the recovery comes, Amstrad will be able to ride ahead again on
the strength of its competitive prices and new products.
The group has already proved with its double deck VCRs that it can still
deliver a market hit in the middle of a recession.
Mr Sugar has shown himself to be a tireless source of inspiration for new
ideas for the consumer market and Amstrad is still a flexible enough
organisation to move in quickly to take advantage of gaps in new product
areas and out again when the going gets rough.
The recently announced decision to return to its audio roots and move out of
the computer games business at least for a while, suggest that it can still
play that game well.
The question in the short term is, if Amstrad intends to stick to its
strategy of bringing competitively priced hit products to the market to
stimulate sales, where are those profits likely to come from?
Last autumn it announced a colour laptop computer and notebook PC which it
has been putting considerable effort into developing.
These are likely to be the more popular products this year, but whether or
not they will measure up to the earlier success of Amstrad's PCs is still
open to debate.
The videophone, another product which Amstrad expects to be a hit, is still
very much in the engineering stage and unlikely to be a mass market item
until at least 1993. Even then, unlike Amstrad's previous hit products, the
videophone is a relatively new concept that is going to need to build up
consumer acceptance.
Without the blockbuster hit, a return to the peak turnover level of over
Pounds 600m it achieved three years ago is 'a very distant target,' says Mr
Mark Loveland at Warburgs.
In the long run, Amstrad will need to address the question, of whether its
strategy of providing basic technology to the mass market at the lowest
possible prices is still relevant in a changed environment for many of its
markets.
The philosophy that supported Amstrad's growth from a small one-man
operation to a company with a turnover exceeding Pounds 600m, was to provide
standard products in consumer electronics that were stripped of
unnecessarily complicated gadgets but did the job well enough for the
average consumer.
Its strength was based on its ability to deliver these goods, many of which
were also hit products based on simple but inspired product improvements, at
extremely low prices.
The strategy clearly works when the products that are targeted are based on
relatively new or complicated technology that commands premium prices. In
its high growth period, Amstrad was able to take advantage of demand among
consumers who were willing to forego brand premium for simple and
competitively priced electronics products and more recently, computers.
But once those products become commodity products, subject to price cutting
by manufacturers at the top end of the market, the strategy leaves Amstrad
with little to compete on.
That strategy crumbled under fierce competition that has driven it out of
the home computer sector and raised considerable doubt about its commitment
to the PC sector.
Mr Sugar says that the group has no intention of moving into technology led
businesses or the high end of the market. 'Our vocation is always in the
lower end of the market, especially in recessionary times,' he emphasises.
In order to be profitable with that vocation Amstrad needs to ensure it has
the lower end of the market to itself, or that at least it has a dominant
share of it.
Given the intense pressures facing consumer electronics and computer
manufacturers, it is unlikely that that is a luxury that can be counted on.
But Amstrad can no longer say that it does not know what it is like not to
be alone in its sector of the market.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: British Aerospace pays Asda Pounds 79m -
New row breaks out over option in dispute about joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE yesterday announced that it had paid Pounds 79m to resolve
a dispute with Asda, the supermarket group, over an ill-starred joint
venture.
However, a new row broke out over an option which could force BAe to buy out
its partner, potentially for some Pounds 75m.
Arlington, BAe's property subsidiary, said the option was irrelevant. It
only applied in the event of a default and so it was invalidated by the
payment of the Pounds 79m, it said.
'Any action against Arlington will be vigorously contested,' the company
added.
Mr Paul Dowling, corpor- ate affairs director for Asda Group, said that
Asda's lawyers took a different view. 'Our legal advice is that we have a
put option. It is clear.'
Mr Dowling said that Asda had not decided whether it would exercise its
option. 'We are reviewing the situation,' he said.
It is unclear what value would be placed on a half share of the Burwood
House Group, the joint venture.
However, it would probably be less than Pounds 75m, the equity injected by
both partners when it was set up.
The joint venture was set up two years ago, just before BAe took over
Arlington, partly to help Asda raise cash to finance its acquisition of 61
Gateway stores.
Gazeley Holdings, part of Asda, put 34 of its stores, then valued at Pounds
350m, into the group and extracted Pounds 275m of cash. Arlington injected a
number of shopping schemes, then valued at Pounds 75m.
Arlington guaranteed the value of these development sites when it set up the
joint venture. Its payment of Pounds 79m into Burwood House arose from its
obligation to make good a shortfall in value of the development properties.
'The decision was the most beneficial to British Aerospace after considering
various proposals designed to protect the position of the joint venture
company and the interest of both its shareholders,' it said in a statement
to the Stock Exchange.
It added that the payment avoided 'any question' arising from an option that
would require Arlington to sell its interest in the Burwood House Group to
Gazeley or to buy Gazeley's interest in the Burwood House Group, at open
market value. BAe had already made provision for the payment in its 1991
accounts.
Both companies have been under severe pressure recently. A month ago, Asda
reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 68.8m for the half year to November 9. In
recent months BAe has seen the failure of a Pounds 432m right issues, a
heavy fall in profits and the departure of senior managers.
BAe's share price fell from 295p to 282p. Asda's share price was unchanged
at 38 1/2p.

FT  12 FEB 92 / BA surprises as profits soar to Pounds 100m: UK airline's
shares rise after third-quarter results beat market expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS surprised the City yesterday by reporting pre-tax profits of
Pounds 100m for its third quarter ended December, compared with Pounds 20m
the year before.
The results were double City expectations and sent BA shares higher to close
at 248p in heavy trading, a gain of 23p on the day.
The sharp profit improvement will strengthen BA's hand in negotiations for a
merger with KLM.
The Dutch carrier reported last week a third quarter net loss of Fl 8.9m
(Pounds 2.76m) against a loss of Fl 213.9m a year earlier.
BA also made a Pounds 140m extraordinary net gain from the sale last
December of its engine maintenance plant in Wales to General Electric of the
US.
Pre-tax profits for the first nine months were 16 per cent lower at Pounds
285m, compared with Pounds 340m.
BA's strong financial performance in the current recessionary environment
contrasts sharply with the heavy losses or small profits recently reported
by its main international competitors for the latest quarter.
However, Lord King, chairman, said the airline would have to continue its
cost-saving drive in the face of the uncertain conditions in the airline
business. He added that BA was positioning itself to take advantage of any
economic recovery in its main markets when this happened.
The airline also reported a 12.9 per cent increase in passenger traffic last
month compared with January 1991 when the industry was hit by the Gulf
crisis. However, when compared with January 1990 the increase was 6.7 per
cent.
BA said last month's traffic results continued to reflect the economic
recession with premium traffic still below January 1990 levels.
Third-quarter operating profits of Pounds 111m compared with break-even in
the same period last year.
Group turnover rose 6.1 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn largely because of better
yields and in spite of a 3.1 per cent fall in total passengers. The airline
carried 5.7m passengers in the latest quarter on scheduled services.
For the first nine months the operating surplus was 13.5 per cent higher at
Pounds 319m and turnover was flat at Pounds 3.6bn.
The improvement reflected lower costs and the return to profitability after
the Middle East conflict last year. Group expenditure in the latest quarter
declined by 2.9 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn.
The airline cut its staff by 4,600, or 10.9 per cent, during the past 12
months, increasing productivity by 11.4 per cent. However, pay settlements
increased staff costs 4.7 per cent to Pounds 376m in the latest quarter.
Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose 416 per cent in the latest
quarter to 9.8p from 1.9p in the same quarter the previous year and were
marginally lower at 28p versus 28.3p for the nine-month period.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Amstrad incurs its first-ever loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the electronics and computer group, suffered a loss for the first
time in its history as it was hit by severe price cutting among personal
computer makers and recessionary pressures.
The group reported a loss before tax of Pounds 15.18m in the six months to
the end of December, against a profit of Pounds 40.08m previously.
The interim dividend is held at 0.4p. The results were in line with
expectations and the shares added 2p to 28p on the news.
Mr Alan Sugar, the chairman who also chairs Tottenham Hotspur, the north
London football club, said Amstrad's balance sheet was strong and it planned
to cut costs.
As well as recessionary pressures, the group faced severe competition in two
big markets which was responsible for the sharp reduction in sales volumes.
Overall sales fell 40 per cent to Pounds 196.07m, from Pounds 326.59m.
Sales declined sharply in the games computer business, where it faced
intense competitive pressure from Nintendo, and a sector of the personal
computer market.
Amstrad withdrew from games computers, a division which provided 11 per cent
of turnover previously, as it was not profitable enough. The move accounted
for about 70 per cent of the volume decline in the period.
Amstrad was also hit in the first half by what it called the 'price-dumping'
of personal computers by leading competitors.
Sales of IBM-compatible personal computers in particular, were hit by price
reductions by IBM. Instead of selling below cost, Amstrad had decided to
stand back, it said.
Mr Sugar stressed the group's commitment to the personal computer market.
'We have no intention of giving up our position in the computer market,' he
said.
Although stocks were high, at about Pounds 175m, Amstrad does not expect to
have to make significant inventory write-downs this year as it did at the
last year-end.
Sales in satellite dish television receiver, word processor and fax machine
divisions remained buoyant, Amstrad said.
It is restructuring its distribution in the UK and continental Europe to
further reduce overheads.
The group's balance sheet remains strong, with net cash balances of Pounds
40m. Losses per share came to 1.9p, against earnings of 4.5p last time. Net
asset value per share, however, was nearly twice the share price at 54p,
against 59p last time.

FT  12 FEB 92 / MCC pensioners may have no claim on missing money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSIONERS of Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of the public companies
of the late Mr Robert Maxwell, may have no claim on the company to make good
money missing from the pension fund, Price Waterhouse, MCC administrator,
said last night.
According to legal advice, Price Waterhouse is obliged to prefer the highest
bid for an MCC subsidiary over one that offered to repair the pension fund,
the accountancy firm said.
Price Waterhouse, which is soliciting bids for at least four MCC
subsidiaries, added it had 'a duty to Maxwell Communication Corporation's
creditors but not to its pensioners'.
Law Debenture Trust Corporation, the firm appointed trustee of the MCC
pension fund, is attempting to estimate how much of the fund was raided -
along with pension funds of some other Maxwell companies - to support the
late Mr Robert Maxwell's tottering private companies. Some interested
bidders had proposed to compensate the pensions of employees they considered
essential to the businesses.
Price Waterhouse is seeking bids for Nimbus, the compact disc maker, Panini,
the Italian sports sticker printer, and Maxwell Business Communications
Group, a magazine and exhibition publisher. It has just closed its requests
for bids for MacDonald, the UK book publisher.
Some of the pension funds, including Nimbus's, were kept separate and are
intact. MacDonald, which had turnover last year of Pounds 25m, owed its
parent Pounds 33m at the beginning of 1992. Twelve offers had been received
for at least some of MacDonald's imprints but only two proposed to take over
the company and its staff.
One of its main authors, horror writer Mr Stephen King, had threatened to
begin proceedings to wind up the company, before its directors requested
that it be put into administration.
Mr David Lee, the Price Waterhouse partner heading the investigation into
the disappearance of about Pounds 500m of MCC's assets, said last night he
had not yet asked to interview MCC directors and officers, but would do so.
The firm said it expected to have a 'broad brush' picture of the position of
MCC's creditors by autumn this year.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Gateway directors quit after board reorganisation / A report
on the UK supermarket group's strategy as it cuts 2,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT EMERGED yesterday that two directors quit the Gateway grocery chain last
week following a reorganisation of the company's main board functions.
Mr Iain Wolsey, marketing director, and Mr Martin Meech, property director,
left the company last Friday having agreed a compensation package.
Gateway, which was taken private in 1989 in a highly leveraged buy-out, said
it was decentralising management control to three operational boards set up
to run each of its trading formats: Gateway, Somerfield and Food Giant. This
reduced the need for main board functions, it said.
Yesterday, Gateway continued to face protest about its decision to reduce
its workforce by the equivalent of about 2,000 full-time employees in
response to the recession.
Mr Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition, raised the matter with the prime
minister in a letter expressing his concern at the state of the economy. 'It
is evident that when thousands of redundancies are announced in the food
retailing sector the recession is not only long but deep too,' Mr Kinnock
wrote.
Gateway said it had not yet determined the precise number of redundancies
but planned to minimise them by freezing overtime and recruitment as well as
asking some full-time workers to accept part-time contracts.
'There will be some redundancies, however neither the date nor the number
nor the locations have yet been fixed,' Gateway said.
Discussions will continue with Usdaw, the shopworkers' union. A decision is
expected within the next two to three weeks.
Mr Paul Smiddy, food retailing analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'On our
figures Gateway lost 8.2 per cent in terms of like-for-like volume sales in
the first half of the year and with that level of leakage it cannot keep its
cost base static.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / Gatt urges 'rainforest payments'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL countries should pay nations such as Brazil and Indonesia for the
'carbon absorption services' provided by their rainforests, a report
published today argues.
The report on trade and the environment from the Geneva-based General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says that this would be more effective in
curbing deforestation than attempts to ban trade in logs.
The proposal illustrates a broader concern that trade measures - whether
tariff walls, export bans or duties - are ineffective in tackling
environmental problems. Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director general, warned
yesterday against the environment issue 'being kidnapped by trade
protectionist interests'.
The report is published four months ahead of the Rio 'earth summit', and is
intended to provide a focus for what is expected to be a heated debate on
trade and the environment.
It says rainforest states are 'effectively exporting, free of charge, carbon
absorption services to the rest of the world'.
Gatt says an export ban on timber would not halt deforestation. These
exports account for less than 1 per cent of trees felled in developing
countries, whereas 80 per cent are felled as fuel for people unable to
afford other fuels.
It calls for international agreement on plans to halt deforestation which
would include compensation to countries with large rainforests, employment
promotion policies in these countries and improved access to industrial
markets for their exports.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Clowes receives 10-year sentence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Petre Clowes, who stole millions of pounds from investors in one of
Britain's biggest frauds, was yesterday sent to prison for 10 years.
Mr Clowes, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, founder of the Barlow Clowes investment
group, was found guilty on Monday of eight charges of fraud, and 10 charges
of theft totalling more than Pounds 14m. He was acquitted of one charge of
conspiracy.
Passing sentence at the end of the 112-day trial, Mr Justice Phillips said:
'I do not believe any judge in this country has been called upon to sentence
a worse case of fraud than yours.'
Mr Peter Naylor of Send, Surrey, deputy chairman of Barlow Clowes, described
by the prosecution as Mr Clowes's 'lieutenant', was sentenced to 18 months
imprisonment. He was convicted of one charge of theft of Pounds 19,000, but
cleared of four other charges.
Mr Clowes's sentence is the highest passed as the result of a Serious Fraud
Office prosecution. He was also disqualified from being a company director
for 15 years, but the prosecution made no application for costs or for
compensation from either defendant.
The government has paid out more than Pounds 150m in compensation to
investors who lost money after the collapse of Barlow Clowes in 1988.
The court heard how Mr Clowes 'milked' millions of pounds from investors,
many of them elderly people who thought their money was going into
government gilt-edged stock. Instead it was spent on buying other companies,
and on luxuries including a French chateau and vineyard, an executive jet
and a yacht.
'It was your intention to help yourself to the money and to engage in
schemes to make you rich,' Mr Justice Phillips said. 'What you were doing in
effect was gambling the money dishonestly for your own benefit. The scale on
which you did this was breathtaking.
'Anyone who deliberately carries out the kind of massive fraud you have
perpetrated must face the fact that if he is caught he will go to prison for
a very long time.'
Mr Peter Rook QC, a member of the Serious Fraud Office's five-strong
prosecution team, said yesterday that a second Barlow Clowes trial would not
take place. The prosecution had decided to offer no evidence against Mr
David Mitchell, former chairman of Barlow Clowes's parent company, of
Veyrier, Switzerland, and Mr Ian Crabtree, an accountant, of Bramhall,
Cheshire.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Charter stresses staff rights: Government plans to encourage
legally enforceable contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday issued a 'United Kingdom Social Charter', stressing
rights for the individual at work and new training opportunities.
The main piece of legislation planned in the employment white paper requires
that individual employment contracts give employees more details of their
terms and conditions.
The white paper supplements plans for another round of restrictions on trade
unions in an earlier green paper.
It also aims to make the poaching of skilled workers more difficult.
The government wants to encourage legally enforceable contracts which would
allow employers to recoup some of the cost of training if an employee left
within a certain period. In both areas the government will consult before
legislating.
In the field of training, the main new ideas are to extend the credits
concept to careers advice for adults in work wishing to expand their
employment opportunities and to provide 'open learning' vouchers, in
conjunction with libraries, for the unemployed.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, told the Commons, to Labour
laughter, that the training proposals would be paid for out of existing
budgets. The 'skill-check' credit scheme will cost Pounds 25m over the next
two years and will be launched in 15 Training and Enterprise Councils.
The white paper is a political argument against the employment proposals of
the Labour party and the European Community Social Charter.
However, it implicitly acknowledges the impact of Labour's accusation that
the Conservative employment agenda was merely negative 'union-bashing'.
It also borrows from Labour's new emphasis on individual rights in relation
to the employer, as opposed to the recent Conservative emphasis on
individual rights in relation to the trade union.
Many of the original green paper proposals are still there, including the
right of employees to join the union of their choice regardless of the
Trades Union Congress rulings.
The white paper stresses the superiority of individual dealings with
employers, hence the new detail that employers will probably have to provide
in employment contracts. That detail goes beyond what is required through
adoption of the EC's Directive on Proof of Employment Relationships.
Mr Howard cited as proof that collective bargaining was no longer effective
the fact that people covered by collective bargaining now earned on average
Pounds 7.50 a week less than those not so covered. Pay analysts pointed out,
however, that white-collar pay had grown three times faster than manual pay
in the 1980s.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, criticised the plan to make
employees liable for the cost of their training but said it was 'a
fundamental concession' to the Labour view that a voluntary approach on
training was insufficient.

FT  12 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: GPA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those GPA executives naturally itching to join the millionaires' club would
be advised to wait. The public row between the aircraft leasing company and
its advisers could always be part of a well rehearsed plot. On the
assumption that it is not, investors are now likely to be suspicious of any
flotation price much above Dollars 22 a share.
There are other good reasons for letting the dust settle. Yesterday's news
that net profits jumped 25 per cent in the third quarter is certainly a sign
that earnings may be on a new growth path. But what is most striking is the
fact that 73 per cent of the total came from securitised aircraft sales,
with only 25 per cent from conventional leasing.
Admittedly, GPA's proven placing power is central to the success of both
activities, and the two divisions are well integrated. But the market will
be more impressed by firm evidence that the more reliable stream of leasing
income is recovering, and if GPA holds its fire until after the final
results in the summer, there is always a chance that there will be signs of
recovery in the world economy.

FT  12 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Things have come to a pretty pass for Mr Alan Sugar when he finds himself
making more money from running a football club than from making computers.
On Monday Tottenham Hotspur moved into unexpected profit; yesterday Amstrad
turned in its first ever loss. A quick glance at the interim figures
confirms that there is little danger of Amstrad going bust. For a start, it
has Pounds 40m of net cash, so its balance sheet looks robust enough to
withstand any write-downs that may be needed to clear unsold stock. But the
maintained interim dividend scarcely matters when set against the poverty of
the trading outlook.
The central problem remains the long-term decline in the market for personal
computers. Price discounting by once up-market competitors has continued to
queer Amstrad's pitch at a time when demand for its other products has been
affected by the recession. The group is busy restructuring, but the odds
seem against it recovering the momentum it enjoyed before the debacle of the
PC2386 series of computers two years ago.
The market might appear to disagree with the conclusion that the glory days
are over for a company whose pre-tax profits in 1988 were bigger than its
present Pounds 159m market capitalisation. Amstrad shares rose by 8 per cent
yesterday, but the longer-term performance tells a different story. Over the
last five years, the shares lost 85 per cent of their value relative to the
market. As the old maxim has it, when they fall that far they never come
back.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was caught on the hop yesterday by BA's fivefold increase in
third quarter profits. The company's figures, to be fair, are always
difficult to predict, but in retrospect it was perhaps naive to assume that
passenger yields would not show much improvement compared with a period
depressed by the build-up to war. That said, BA's management has skilfully
avoided an expensive dogfight on fares over the North Atlantic and has once
again kept its promise to cut costs.
Yesterday's 10 per cent jump in the shares was therefore a well-earned
reward. But with American Airlines and United Airlines certain to be back
with a vengeance this summer and European liberalisation likely to take a
few more faltering steps forward at the end of the year, competition
continues to hot up. That is why progress - or the lack of it - in BA's
negotiations with KLM is likely to be the most important influence on the
share price in the coming months.
The prospects for a successful tie-up at this stage remain as obscure as
ever. If noises coming from Amsterdam are to be believed, the principle of a
joint company has now been accepted, but the sticking point could yet be
price. The market value of BA is three times higher than KLM's, but the
Dutch will no doubt be bidding for more than 25 per cent of the joint
action. KLM's declared profits, after all, may be subdued, but its recent
yield figures were superior to, and its prospective cash flow multiple lower
than, BA's. Lord King has a fight on his hands.

FT  12 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A history lesson from the Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,537.1 (-1.3)
Those who believe this recession belongs in the context of a long economic
cycle need look no further than the latest Bank of England Quarterly
Bulletin. The text is full of historic superlatives. The level of UK house
repossessions is without precedent. Last year's nominal growth in UK GDP was
the lowest since the early 1960s. The gearing of the UK personal sector is
at an historic peak. The present UK recession is as long as any since the
war. In the US, capital investment in relation to GDP is the lowest since
the 1940s, while interest rates are the lowest since 1964. German interest
rates are the highest since the war. French unemployment is at a record and
rising.
Given all that, it sounds as if the UK market had better be right in
expecting an imminent cut in interest rates. Yesterday, three-month money
closed below base rate for the first time since November. But electoral
pressures apart, it is not quite clear that the UK's inflation performance
justifies monetary easing. It was announced yesterday that producer price
inflation, though falling, was still at 4.5 per cent in January. The
government has just awarded a pay rise to public employees averaging some
6.4 per cent, the same figure which aroused the ire of the Bundesbank when
granted to German steel employees last week. The Bank of England, while
conceding progress is being made against inflation, is careful to point out
that retail prices of UK services rose last year by 10.5 per cent.
Above all, as the Bank repeatedly reminds us, the UK is not alone in being
crippled by debt. When combined with a level of real interest rates without
precedent at this stage in the cycle, this is the biggest single reason for
the persistence of the world economic downturn. Even in this year's second
half, the Bank says, UK consumption is likely to be flat in real terms. For
those still banking on a consumer-led recovery, the message is simple -
don't hold your breath.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Planned rise in EC revenue may reawaken old quarrels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission last night agreed proposals to raise Community
budget revenue by a third over the next five years. Officials fear the
package could lead to a re-opening of budgetary squabbles between the UK and
other EC members.
Under the Commission plan, unanimously approved last night, EC revenue would
rise from Ecu66bn (Pounds 47bn) this year to Ecu88bn in 1997, at 1992
prices.
The 1993-97 financial plan, which Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president,
is due to present to the European Parliament today, aims to double fiscal
transfers to Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece in order to help them
prepare for economic and monetary union (Emu).
If member states approve the plan, several countries undergoing fiscal
strain will be asked to contribute significantly more than they do now, and
there are clear signs that some will fight hard to shift part of the burden.
Germany, the EC's main paymaster, is straining to finance unification and
pay for its large east European aid programme. It has already asked the
Commission to re-examine the budget rebate the UK has received since 1985.
A senior Commission official said yesterday, however, that this would not
happen until after the UK general election.
The Financial Times has obtained normally confidential details on the net
contributions made by EC governments. These illustrate why some countries
are likely to demand revisions to the budget.
Germany this year is contributing a net Ecu9bn to the EC's budget. The UK -
the second largest net contributor - would contribute just over Ecu5bn but
would receive more than Ecu2bn 'abatement'. This was originally won by Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, the former UK prime minister, because Britain gets
proportionally less than its comparable partners from the farm budget, which
still accounts for 54 per cent of EC spending.
Although contributions from both countries, and from France, the other main
net contributor, are set to rise, Germany wants a redistribution of
financial responsibility. 'It is pretty obvious that we have to talk about
the UK rebate again,' a German official said.
Belgium and Italy, two countries intent on entering Emu in the first wave
later this decade, will be particularly hard hit. Belgium, like Denmark and
the Netherlands, usually fares better under the EC budget than its high per
capita income would justify. Italy's position fluctuates; this year it will
take Ecu600m net out of the budget but in 1991 it contributed a net Ecu400m.
However, both Belgium and Italy face uphill struggles to cut public
indebtedness and budget deficits to meet the stiff Emu conditions by 1999.
The Commission, concerned to contain the budgetary squabbles it fears will
break out, insisted yesterday that the overall benefit of EC membership
cannot be quantified simply in budgetary contributions.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Case against the jury: Lord Roskill tells Robert Rice that
fraud trials need rethinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thanking the jury at the end of the seven-month Barlow Clowes investment
fraud trial on Monday, Mr Justice Phillips, the trial judge, said: 'Until
recent times, no one could have imagined that our legal system could place
such a burden on anyone's time.'
In the light of the abandonment last Friday of the third part of the lengthy
and complex prosecution arising out of the 1986 Guinness takeover of
Distillers, and the collapse yesterday of the second Guinness trial, his
comments will refuel the debate about whether long and complex fraud cases
are suitable for trial by jury.
Yesterday Lord Roskill, the former Law Lord who chaired the three-year
inquiry into the conduct of fraud cases which reported in 1986, added his
voice to growing concern over the issue by calling on the government to
rethink its decision to ignore his advice that complex fraud cases were
unsuitable for trial by jury.
'I'm impenitent about non-jury trials for complex frauds. This view was
right in 1986 and nothing has happened to change my mind.'
This issue was central to the Fraud Trials Committee inquiry. The committee
concluded, with one dissenting opinion, that complex frauds should be heard
by a Fraud Trials Tribunal comprising a judge and two lay members with
experience of business and finance.
Most of the Roskill recommendations, including the establishment of the
Serious Fraud Office and the introduction of special pre-trial procedures
for prosecuting fraud, were adopted by the government in the 1987 Criminal
Justice Act. The government, however, rejected a special Fraud Trials
Tribunal.
The committee's view was that many jurors were out of their depth in complex
fraud cases and that society appeared to have an attachment to jury trial
which was 'emotional or sentimental rather than logical'.
Lord Roskill said in his report that the material he had encountered in
commercial fraud cases had been uniquely complex. Yesterday, he accepted
that the difficulties facing the juries in the recent cases were mainly the
result of the volume of material. The issue of whether 12 ordinary men and
women could understand complex fraud cases or needed to sit through trials
of this length remains unresolved, he added.
A further problem thrown up by the recent trials was their length. Not
enough use was being made of pre-trial hearings to whittle cases down to
manageable proportions before trial, Lord Roskill said.
The Fraud Trials Committee had recommended that a trial judge should be
nominated at the initial stage of a proposed prosecution and given the power
to discharge the defendant at a preparatory hearing or to reduce the charges
on the ground that the prosecution evidence was insufficient. Effective
pre-trial reviews were a vital ingredient of the successful prosecution of
fraud, the committee said.
The system would only work if trial judges subjected the prosecution case to
close scrutiny in pre-trial hearings, the former Law Lord said yesterday.
'The whole object was to cut down the length of the eventual trial.'
The correct use of the pre-trial procedure in the Guinness prosecution had
reduced the length of the first Guinness trial by an estimated 25 per cent,
he said. Even then it had still lasted more than six months.
In the Blue Arrow trial, which started on February 11 last year, a great
deal of time had been spent arguing points in the absence of the jury (which
was out of court for roughly 30 per cent of the total length of the trial).
This suggested that the pre-trial procedures had not been properly used,
Lord Roskill said.
'A very firm line must be taken at preliminary hearings so that the issues
have been streamlined by the time the case gets to trial,' he added.
Lord Roskill's views are still not accepted by the one dissenting member of
his committee. Mr Walter Merricks, a solicitor and assistant
secretary-general of the Law Society, said he had not changed his mind over
the need to maintain trial by jury in complex fraud cases.
He said there was an essential unfairness in distinguishing between
murderers, drug traffickers, burglars and rapists on the one hand and
financial fraudsters on the other. 'Why should the man who stole Pounds 1m
from a bank using a shotgun be allowed the right to trial by jury, while the
man who used a computer is denied the same right?' he asked in the report.
A jury would almost always be more favourable to a defendant than a
tribunal, Mr Merricks wrote. When a defendant was convicted, he would not
say the jury was biased. But a tribunal of professionals could be accused of
bias. If they acquitted a defendant, the public might say they were helping
out their City friends.
The presence of a jury also ensured that the case had to be comprehensible
to the press and the average member of the public. The fundamental issue in
fraud cases was dishonesty, and it was dangerous to entrust the judgment of
this to experts, Mr Merricks wrote in the report.
'I still think it is wrong to single out one type of criminal trial and say
'somehow these cases are special',' he said yesterday. 'In my view you would
never be able to define properly what makes a case so complex that it has to
be heard by a special tribunal. You would end up spending more time in
pre-trial hearings arguing whether it was a special case or not and
appealing it than you would if you just got on and put it before a jury.'
Lord Roskill's call for a reconsideration of the question of a special
tribunal is likely to increase pressure on the government to act.
With further cases pending - alleged frauds concerning the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International and the Polly Peck fruit and electronics group,
and potential charges from the collapse of the Maxwell empire - the
government can no longer afford to ignore growing public concern that the UK
seems to have difficulty in successfully prosecuting the perpetrators of
financial misdeeds.

Could Martin Taylor, one of the vice-chairmen at Lord Hanson's court, soon
be out of a job?
The word is that Britain's tenth biggest company is looking for a
high-powered in-house public relations person to add to its battalions of
outside media advisers.
Hanson already has a director of public affairs - Michael Shea, the Queen's
former press secretary. But along with Lord Glenarthur, a former Tory
minister, Shea spends an unusual amount of time polishing Hanson's political
relations rather than fielding questions from the financial trade press.
Oddly for a company of Hanson's size, this routine duty has been delegated
to Martin Taylor, who should have more serious responsibilities to shoulder.
Somewhat belatedly, Hanson seems to have accepted the need to mend its
public, as opposed to its political, image. Friday's half-day investor
presentation at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre - organised by yet
another well-connected public relations firm, Balfour Harley Associates - is
a start. But Hanson is also looking for a permanent PR flak-fender whose job
would be to ensure Hanson's noble lords more statesmanlike coverage in

Alas, as usual, all Martin Taylor will say is that he never comments on
market rumours.

An unlikely partnership, in the shapes of Labour MP Tom Pendry and Tory MP
Bill Cash, has just got together to launch a no less unlikely project: the
Houses of Parliament All-Party Jazz Group. So far the two co-chairmen have
signed up 30 MPs - the membership card is embossed with a tenor sax -
including Kenneth Clarke and John Prescott, both card-carrying supporters of
Ronnie Scott, and Sir David Steel.
The HoP cats aim to get the government dancing to a three-step programme. A
 -liberalise licensing laws which currently restrict 'unlicensed' premises
to performances by duos. B - get London's Jazz FM radio station to live up
to its title in the music it plays. C - encourage the Arts Council to swing
more money jazz's way.
For the record, it seems that political affiliation has little to do with
musical bent. Not all Conservatives are trad fans - Clarke is a bebopper,
apparently - and Pendry says he was turned on to blue notes by Ted Heath
(no, not that one) in a Ramsgate ballroom.

One has to admire Edmond Safra's latest coup. Hiring the 71-year-old Javier
Perez de Cuellar, the former UN Secretary General, as a non-executive
director for his various banks, will bolster Safra's personal standing in an
industry where image is all-important.
The two men met at a dinner party in New York 10 years ago and quickly
became friends, so much so that the respected diplomat and his wife have
spent holidays at Safra's villa on the French Riviera. The former UN chief
says he won't be accepting any other bank or company directorships, although
his pay for the Safra board jobs is only slightly higher than the standard
Dollars 50,000 a year that other board members receive.
In the secretive world of private banking, trustworthy bankers are more
important than fine margins, and Safra's reputation looks sure to gain from
the recruitment of an internationally respected figure like Perez de
Cuellar. 'A safe pair of hands,' judged one diplomatic commentator, 'even
though he wouldn't make waves if he fell out of the boat.'

When any industry goes through a difficult period, it is inevitable that the
changing of the guard is done at the double. Nowhere is this more apparent
than in Britain's construction industry. In many ways Sir Eric Pountain, the
man who transformed Tarmac into one of Britain's biggest construction
companies, personifies the changeover.
Like Wimpey's Sir Clifford Chetwood, and Bobby McAlpine of Alfred McAlpine,
Pountain is preparing to hand over the management reins to a much younger
generation. Neville Simms, Tarmac's new group chief executive, is just 47.
Nevertheless, there is a feeling that despite the present chairman's
considerable contribution to Tarmac over the years, he should have handed
over earlier.
Pountain is a bit like former Burton boss Sir Ralph Halpern. He was very
good at his job at first, but didn't know when to stop. As a housing man, he
drove Tarmac's profits ever higher on the back of Mrs Thatcher's 1980's
housing boom. This led to an over-investment in land at inflated prices and
Tarmac is now sufferring the hangover. The other strategic error was to
over-expand in the US when other competitors, such as Redland and RMC, were
expanding into Europe.
There is an element of luck in all business decisions, but in 'Our Eric's'
case there is a sense that, despite being the Midlands' most celebrated
businessman, he lived too long on his past reputation.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Fraud trials and justice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S collapse of the second Guinness trial raises fundamental
questions about the administration of justice in the UK in cases concerning
fraud. It comes hard upon the decision to abandon the third trial in the
prolonged Guinness prosecution. It is likely to be followed today by the
verdicts in the Blue Arrow case, in which - after 12 months and a cost
estimated at nearly Pounds 40m - five of the 10 defendants have already been
found not guilty.
By any standards this is not a good record for the Serious Fraud Office
(SFO) which is responsible for prosecuting large fraud cases. Not all the
blame can attach to the SFO or its outgoing director, Mrs Barbara Mills. In
Blue Arrow some of the blame for the trial's inordinate length must go to
the easy-going, non-interventionist style of the judge Mr Justice McKinnon.
And in Guinness Two, it was Mr Roger Seelig's conduct of his own defence
which prolonged the trial to an oppressive degree and threatened his health.
But there is much which can be laid at the door of the SFO in its approach
to fraud trials. In particular, delays of as much as seven years in bringing
cases to trial are clearly unjust. The injustice is heightened when the
charges are withdrawn, as they have been on Guinness Three, after years
under threat of imprisonment - not to mention the damage to income and
employment - for the accused.
Sheer size
Also overdue for change is the SFO's approach of throwing the book at
defendants. The sheer size of the prosecution cases threatens the process's
manageability. Presenting such cases as all-embracing prosecutions, with
dozens of charges, ensures they drag on for months and years and become
complex beyond the grasp of experienced judges, never mind jurors.
As the former appeal court judge Sir Frederick Lawton has recently pointed
out, there is a limit to the number of times an individual can be sentenced
for the same crime. Justice does not require that every dishonest act should
be identified and punished. Sir Frederick commended the advice of the former
Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard that prosecuting counsel should choose the
best six counts and leave the others on the file.
Recent scandals
A rethink in the approach to the prosecution of alleged fraud is required
before the start of the next round of cases arising out of the more recent
crop of scandals. Much of the system - including the SFO - was created after
the publication of the report of the Roskill Fraud Trials Committee. But
Roskill's recommendation that complex fraud trials should be heard by a
tribunal comprising a judge sitting with two expert lay assessors was not
implemented. The argument that many frauds are too complex or too long to be
tried by a jury gains credence from the current failures.
Despite this, it is probably too soon to write off trial by jury in fraud
cases - especially since juries have returned commonsense verdicts in cases
which have reached completion such as Guinness One and Barlow Clowes. Judges
could do more to help juries by simplifying proceedings along the lines
envisaged by Roskill. With a tougher approach during pre-trial hearings to
reduce cases to manageable proportions, it should be possible to complete
most cases in the six weeks Sir Frederick recalled as necessary for his most
complicated case.
Finally, the SFO appears to be under-resourced to deal with major fraud
cases. To judge by its performance, a budget of less than Pounds 15m is
inadequate to tackle the investigation and prosecution of frauds involving
Pounds 4.5bn - or to attract high quality professionals to its staff.
Reflecting the words of Mr Justice Henry yesterday after the collapse of the
second Guinness trial, the present failure to find a just and effective
system for prosecuting serious fraud cannot be allowed to continue.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher leads passing-out parade
of MPs - Ivor Owen on those leaving the Commons at the general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SOME MPs are already packing their bags
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even though the general election is at least eight weeks off. They are the
80 politicians who know they are not returning to the Commons, whatever the
voters decide.
A former prime minister, three former chancellors and an assortment of
panjandrums are among those not seeking re-election at the poll, which is
likely to be on April 9.
Whatever the final verdict on the achievements of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, she
is certain to be remembered as the first prime minister to vacate 10 Downing
Street after being given notice to quit by disenchanted party colleagues.
Two of the former chancellors - Sir Geoffrey Howe and Mr Nigel Lawson - were
closely associated with Mrs Thatcher's successes in the days when opponents
as well as supporters believed she was electorally unstoppable.
Until his resignation speech in November 1990 Sir Geoffrey Howe seemed
content with the mantle of Sir Austen Chamberlain - the Conservative cabinet
minister and leadership contender of an earlier generation - who was said to
have 'always played the game - and always lost it'.
Sir Geoffrey may have failed in his ambition to emulate his political hero,
David Lloyd George, by becoming prime minister - but the 19-minute speech in
which he spelt out the way in which Mrs Thatcher had dispensed with the
concept of cabinet government was the key link in the chain of events that
led to her departure from office.
It was just over a year earlier that Mr Lawson resigned as chancellor when
his policy differences with Mrs Thatcher and Sir Alan Walters, her chief
economic adviser, finally became unbridgeable.
Mr Denis Healey, whose dramatic recall from London Airport to the Treasury
in 1976 as the pound tottered left an indelible imprint on his period as
chancellor, will be absent from the Labour benches when MPs return after the
general election.
He, like the other former chancellors and Mrs Thatcher, seems certain to be
among the dozen or so former ministers heading for the red benches of the
Lords later this year.
They are unlikely to be joined by another prominent politician with a clear
claim to a peerage - Mr Michael Foot, the former Labour leader, who has
frequently called for the abolition of the Lords.
Mr Foot first entered the Commons in 1945 as MP for Devonport. He will leave
parliament at the same time as the current occupant of that constituency, Dr
David Owen, who led the Social Democratic party into oblivion.
It is generally recognised that Dr Owen's persistent but vain attempts to
change the electoral system and end the dominance of the two main parties
seriously aggravated the injuries Labour suffered under Mr Foot's
leadership.
Mrs Thatcher's frequently expressed admiration for Dr Owen reflected her
judgment that, whether by accident or design, he made a significant
contribution to the most spectacular of the three successive general
election triumphs secured by the Conservatives under her leadership - the
majority of 144 in 1983.
Also bowing out from the Commons will be Sir Ian Gilmour, whose background
of Eton, Balliol and the army - as well as an inherited baronetcy - would,
in earlier times, have classified him as the archetypal Tory MP.
Sir Ian was never taken in by what he saw as the exaggerated claims about
the achievements of Thatcherism. Both before and after his dismissal from
the cabinet in 1981 he warned that the so-called economic miracle -
enthusiastically trumpeted by Mr John Major among others - would prove
illusory.
Another notable departure from the Conservative ranks will be Mr Michael
Latham, who at the politically early age of 49 has decided to vacate Rutland
and Melton, which returned him with a 23,022 majority in 1987.
Mr Latham, an Anglican lay preacher, took up the initially unpaid
appointment of executive director of the Council of Christians and Jews at
the start of February.
Mr Bernard Weatherill, the retiring speaker, had a distinction not shared by
any of his predecessors. He presided over the introduction of television
cameras to the Commons - and, with the footage becoming popular in the US,
he has become a familiar figure on both sides of the Atlantic.
His successor as speaker will preside over the biggest Commons membership
since the Second World War. The growth in the electorate of Milton Keynes
has entitled the area to an additional constituency - 651 MPs, instead of
the present 650, will be returned at the election.
Mr Edward Heath, who looked towards Europe in his maiden speech in 1950 and
as prime minister took Britain into the European Community in 1973, will be
the 'father' of the new House.

 -Women
</HEADLINE>

   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCILS would be required to use all the spending that the government
estimated they needed for nursery education, under Labour plans outlined
yesterday as part of an offensive to capture women's votes.
At a press conference to launch 'Woman Today', a magazine pulling together
Labour policies for women, Ms Hilary Armstrong, who speaks for the party on
education, said a Labour government would ensure local authorities did not
underspend on provision for the under-fives to keep poll tax bills down.
If all the money was spent on nursery education, almost 23,000 extra places
could be provided at no extra cost to central government, Ms Armstrong said.
Labour did not have a figure for what this would mean for poll tax bills.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, emphasised that the best providers of
nursery education were Labour authorities, many of which were in areas of
social stress. 'If it can be done there, it can be done in a lot more
places,' he said.
Mrs Ann Taylor, a member of Labour's shadow cabinet, hailed the magazine -
which will be distributed primarily in marginal seats - as the first of its
kind for any political party. It showed 'the relevance of Labour party
policies and Labour priorities to millions of women of all ages throughout
the country'.

seats - Marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR today starts a fresh onslaught on marginal seats in London amid
growing party concern that voters in the capital are failing to turn to the
party in adequate numbers.
One Labour insider has claimed that private polling has revealed that the
'loony left' tag associated with some leftwing borough councils is
continuing to dog its efforts to win the 20 to 25 seats thought crucial for
a national victory.
In consequence the party is believed to have decided to concentrate its
campaigning on the London suburbs and peripheral boroughs where voters
appear more receptive than in the inner city.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, will today visit Brentford and Isleworth.
Tomorrow Mr Bryan Gould, the frontbench leader of Labour's London campaign,
will visit highly marginal Streatham amid speculation that the Tories may
hold the seat in spite of the slim 2,407 majority.
Local Conservatives have taken heart from a by-election in the nearby ward
of Lambeth St Mary's in December which showed a 23.2 per cent swing from
Labour to the Tories.
Mr Gould's visit will be followed by the official launch of Labour's latest
policy document on London. This promises a new Greater London Authority to
be elected by proportional representation.
Next week the entire Labour frontbench economics team, including Mr John
Smith and Mr Gordon Brown, are to tour marginal London seats. Serious doubts
remain, however, about whether Labour can win long-targeted marginals such
as Dulwich, Battersea and Hampstead and Highgate.
A Labour campaigner in London conceded last night that the progress was at a
'gentler pace' than had been hoped. But she went on to add: 'Time and again
at general elections we do far better than in local elections.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / Collapse of the second Guiness Trial: 'I haven't been beaten
by much in my life' - The case that brought a city financier close to
breakdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the sense of incompleteness, with its implication almost of personal
failure, that seems most to concern Mr Roger Seelig about the ending of his
six-year ordeal arising from the notorious Guinness affair.
On the eve of the end of his trial, he said: 'I think we have conducted this
defence very well and it is a great disappointment to me not to be able to
finish it . . . I never failed to complete a bid and I'm very disappointed
to have failed to complete this.
'What I have really had to recognise is that the physical task was just too
great. It is very, very hard to convey that to someone who has not had to do
it. I haven't been beaten by much in my life and it is a great
disappointment to find that you just can't do it.
'I really wanted an acquittal and I'm deeply disappointed at not achieving
that through lack of physical stamina.'
For more than four months, Mr Seelig conducted his own defence to fraud and
false accounting charges. Faced with legal bills running into several
hundred thousand pounds and 'the recognition that the costs are completely
uncontrollable', he decided lawyers were a luxury he could no longer afford.
'The expenses are quite, quite beyond anything that any salaried employee,
however successful, can possibly sustain in trials that go on for a year or
more. To have been represented by a full legal team over the past
two-and-a-half or more years would have cost perhaps Pounds 3m.
'My highest salary at Morgans was only Pounds 110,000 before tax, though
admittedly there were bonuses. The legal aid regulations are not devised for
working professionals. They look at your gross assets without taking into
account your gross debts.'
Had he had any idea of what he was letting himself in for by conducting his
own defence?
'No. I knew it would be a considerable effort but I think I thought that one
would be capable of seeing that through to the end. When I was at Morgans we
really did work all the waking hours, so I thought I could cope with this.
But it is different.'
His typical working day would begin at 8am when he would arrive at the house
of his friend Mr George Devlin. Together they would prepare for the day's
hearing until it was time to leave for Southwark Crown Court. When the court
day ended they would work together into the night.
For much of the trial Mr Devlin, a sometime legal clerk, private
investigator and property businessman, also sat in court as Mr Seelig's
'McKenzie friend' - a term arising from a case in which it was held that an
unrepresented defendant could have the assistance of someone to take notes
and generally help in the conduct of his case.
Mr Seelig seemed surprised to be told there had been general admiration in
court for the way in which he handled his defence, at least in the early
stages. Had he really been as confident as he had seemed?
'No, I felt enormously nervous and apprehensive but strengthened, if you
like, by the amount of preparation we had done and the feeling of being
well-briefed.'
It had been a month to six weeks into the trial when he started to feel the
strain. Apart from the workload there had been the mental tension.
'I have not been depressed - and this is an important statement, I think - I
have not been depressed at all with the way the trial was going, in fact the
opposite: I believe we have been well ahead on points. That has not been
part of the stress factor. What you find is it just physically gets you
down.
'I was literally only putting papers down when I went to sleep. And then if
I woke up in the middle of the night I would go and get them. When I woke up
next morning I would get them before getting out of bed, because there isn't
enough time to do it.
'Another thing is you don't get positive feedback. I used to work just as
hard, in terms of hours, at Morgans, but you'd get successes along the way
in the sense of you'd have a successful bid and there would be a sense of a
completed job well done. This job not only wasn't complete, it seemed just
to stretch endlessly.
'We started off expecting a three-month trial, then it became a four-month
trial, then six months, and the last estimates were going through to March
1993, and even those were predicated on a very limited defence.
'There's a limit psychologically - it's very disturbing being in an endless
tunnel.'
Around the time the trial broke for Christmas he was becoming mentally and
physically exhausted. He went to his GP and a consultant psychiatrist with
the request that 'they find a way of strengthening me to complete the task.
The defence, in my view, was going so well I believed that if I could
complete it I would get the acquittal that I wanted.'
Apart from the strain, had there been any specific cause for his emotional
outbursts that had punctuated the trial?
One factor, he believed, was a deep sense of frustration when
cross-examining former colleagues. 'Perhaps if I had been a QC I would have
found it easier to have attacked those people openly and roughly.
'The whole of my working life I gave to Morgans and made a significant
contribution to the house. And it's a matter of deep feeling that not only
were they not prepared to stand by me but they actually tried to make me a
scapegoat.'
When had he realised that he would be in serious trouble if the trial went
on? He supposed it had been brought home to him on January 29 when he had
had 'a sort of collapse' in court. I'm not a particularly emotional person.
I don't think I have really cried about anything in my life and when you
find that you are unable to control yourself then clearly the body is
telling you something - that you've reached a point of physical and mental
exhaustion. I suddenly realised it was getting worse rather than better.
There was no respite from the work and it was going from bad to worse in
terms of concentration and performance. It's as if you have got a mental
block.'
Had he expected to be arrested?
'No, I don't think I did because I think it goes back to the question of did
I think I had done anything dishonest. I knew there was no question of a
ha'penny of personal gain or benefit. And as I said on the day I left
Morgans, I had only ever tried to do what I believed to be in the best
interests of the client and the house throughout my whole career.
'This was the largest, roughest contested bid there had ever been but one
had tried to operate within the framework as one understood it.' If, he
added, he had been guilty of anything, it had been overzealousness rather
than dishonesty.
How did he see his future?
'The immediate future has to be a rest, but I have absolutely no doubt that
having had a rest there will be no permanent damage in any way - indeed the
doctors have indicated that. I've equally no doubt that the financial world
is absolutely in my blood and in one way or another, whether as principal or
consultant or whatever, I shall have to find a way of participating in it
and earning a living.'

caused concern - The case that brought a city financier close to breakdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS evidence from two consultant psychiatrists that confirmed Mr Justice
Henry's concern - which had been growing since quite early in the trial -
about Mr Roger Seelig's ability to continue to defend himself.
When he discharged the jury yesterday the judge was at pains to give them a
detailed account of the doctors' evidence which, he said, showed that Mr
Seelig might do 'something irrevocable' if the trial went on.
He said: 'The strains on him have been enormous and have proved too much.
His mental condition reached the point where it is no longer possible for
him to conduct his defence adequately.'
The judge spoke of repeated emotional outbursts from Mr Seelig, including
one 'tearful, hysterical outburst' on January 29.
He gave jurors a transcript of that occasion which, he said, showed 'a man
at the end of his health, bewildered at his loss of control and his
inability to think straight, wondering whether his medication rather than
his mental state is to blame, recognising that he seems to have gone funny
yet insisting that he was all right and could go on.'
The court tape recording, which the judge said the jurors could listen to in
their room, was 'even more poignant', he told them.
The psychiatrists believed, as did the judge, that that 'panic reaction' had
been genuine.
The psychiatrists also believed that a slight stroke Mr Seelig had in 1990
might be a factor in his difficulty in controlling his emotions.
The judge said that last November he had recommended that Mr Seelig seek
regular medical help. Mr Seelig had replied that because of carrying out his
own defence he was very short of time.
'Prophetically and significantly', Mr Seelig had not wanted to have the
trial stopped because of his medical condition.
The psychiatrists' opinion was that Mr Seelig was suffering from agitated
depression accompanied by high anxiety. The effect had been to render him
incapable of sustained concentration and accounted for his lack of mental
clarity and impaired judgment and comprehension.
Mr Seelig had described himself as feeling 'detached or distant' when not
actively involved in cross-examination, and as having difficulty in
following what was going on.
He had been acutely conscious of the conflict between his desire to continue
with the case until verdicts had been reached and his fear of doing himself
permanent mental damage if he continued.
On February 4 Mr Seelig had told one of the psychiatrists: 'I have come to
the end of the bloody road and don't like admitting it. I have tried as best
I can but the mountain is too high.'
The judge said he had explored with the psychiatrists a number of
possibilities to enable Mr Seelig to continue defending himself.
They included giving Mr Seelig periodic breaks of up to a month at a time.
But one of the psychiatrists had warned that although that might offer Mr
Seelig temporary relief there was a risk it would fail and that the
additional strain on him 'might lead him to do something irrevocable.'
The judge told the jury: 'In these circumstances it seems to me that
discharging you from giving verdicts in the case of Mr Seelig is quite
inevitable.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / Recovery still expected this year but little evidence yet:
Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England still believes the UK economy will recover this year but
its latest quarterly bulletin offers very little evidence that the upturn is
at hand.
It stresses that the outlook is surrounded by risks, especially in
connection with the private sector's high level of borrowings from banks and
building societies.
Six months ago the Bank said that the UK economy was 'bumping along the
bottom' of recession. Yesterday's bulletin acknowledges that there has been
no recovery in the level of activity.
Instead manufacturing output has continued to decline since the summer.
Service-sector output, which appeared to stabilise in the third quarter,
might have been displaying a 'false dawn'. Construction continues to be
weak.
About the only signs of recovery identified by the Bank are the leading
indicator measures compiled by the Central Statistical Office. These, it
says, 'point firmly to an upturn in output in the course of 1992'.
However, the UK's leading indicators have yet to be taken seriously by most
City analysts or private-sector economists. Moreover, both the longer and
shorter leading indices have turned down in recent months - a fact the Bank
chose not to publicise yesterday.
Perhaps because the Budget and a general election are in the offing, the
bulletin offers no new ideas about policies which might help boost the
economy.
It is cautious about the prospects for an early cut in interest rates,
noting that recent tensions in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the
European Monetary System 'have made further easing of monetary policy
difficult'. It adds that, in any case, interest-rate cuts take time to have
an impact.
The bulletin contains a guarded warning to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
not to indulge in too expansionary a Budget or to adopt short-term
palliatives.
It notes that fiscal policy is already playing a role in reviving the
economy through the automatic stabilisers and through the decision in
December temporarily to suspend stamp duty on house purchases up to Pounds
250,000.
However, it adds: 'But the basis for sustainable growth remains a credible
commitment to the ultimate goal of price stability. This is bolstered by
membership of the ERM and a medium-term target for public spending and
borrowing.'
In its analysis the Bank says two factors have frustrated earlier hopes of a
recovery:
Prospects for growth in the world economy 'have deteriorated sharply over
the last quarter'. The Bank now expects growth in Britain's six main trading
partners to fall to around 2 per cent this year from 3 per cent previously.
Domestic business and consumer confidence has fallen. This, the Bank says,
is 'perhaps the more significant deterioration'.
The Bank believes consumer confidence may have been adversely affected by
sterling's membership of the ERM as individuals realised that monetary
expansion and devaluation were no longer policy options.
The high level of household debt may be an additional brake on confidence in
the circumstances of ERM membership and low inflation. Consumers may be less
ready than before to borrow to finance higher spending because the principal
of the debt will stay high in real terms and new debt will be relatively
costly to service.
The weakness of the housing market could also be sapping confidence while
consumers' expenditure might stay depressed if house prices fall further and
turnover - which is at its lowest level since 1977 - stays low.
Electoral uncertainty and the associated worries about future taxation are
also affecting confidence.
The Bank believes that consumption was flat in the second half of last year
because total income from employment has been flat or falling in real terms
since mid-1990.
A rise in the volume of consumption will require a fall in the savings
ratio, it says. Although the ratio fell in the third quarter it is not yet
clear that it is firmly on a downward path. This would probably require 'a
clear and sustained improvement in consumer confidence'.
Falling inflation is one of the few bright spots highlighted in the
bulletin. The Bank also argues that the narrowing of regional disparities in
house prices and unemployment should assist labour mobility and improve the
quality of the eventual recovery.
In addition it says there is no sign of a credit crunch and banks should be
able to provide sufficient credit to fund recovery when it appears.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Collapse of the second Guinness Trial: Justice the loser as
jury discharged - The case that brought a city financier close to breakdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
though not unexpected - collapse of the second Guinness trial has created a
situation that is unsatisfactory for all concerned.
The judge's decision to discharge the jury from returning verdicts on the
fraud and false accounting charges that the two defendants denied, because
of concern about Mr Roger Seelig's health, means that the charges against
him remain on the file. In theory they could be reactivated if he later
becomes fit to stand trial again, but that is unlikely.
The result is that Mr Seelig, who has throughout declared his innocence, has
virtually no hope of a verdict that would clear his name.
By the same token, the Serious Fraud Office will be unable to establish its
claim that Mr Seelig was guilty of criminal involvement in the share support
operation mounted by Guinness during the 1986 takeover battle for
Distillers.
Lord Spens, Mr Seelig's co-defendant, is faced, with the possibility that he
will have to go through the whole process again
For the eight women and four men of the jury, the past four-and-a-half
months have been wasted, while the administration of justice has suffered
through a situation with which, it would appear, it has no way of coping.
That situation derives from Mr Seelig's decision two years ago, because of
his mounting legal costs, to conduct his own defence.
His early performance was impressive. He had a detailed grasp of his brief -
he, of course, knew more about the events at issue and the inner workings of
the City than anyone else in court - and he quickly picked up the technique
of cross-examination.
One feature of his advocacy was its informality: his questioning of Mr
Olivier Roux, an old friend and former Guinness finance director who was the
first prosecution witness, turned into a sort of 'Olivier and Roger' show,
as the two addressed each other by their Christian names - something which
was repeated as other witnesses took the stand.
Central to the case were allegations of Guinness share supporters being
given undisclosed indemnities against loss, which the prosecution claimed
was unlawful.
Mr Seelig brought out evidence of a number of instances of unchallenged
non-disclosure of such indemnities during other takeovers at around the same
time. He also succeeded in eliciting evidence favourable to his defence from
a number of prosecution witnesses.
However, it became clear that, notwithstanding Mr Seelig's undoubted
abilities, the fact that he was acting as his own advocate was inexorably
lengthening the trial.
He was taking far longer over cross-examinations than a professional
advocate would have done.
The basic problem was that he did not know when to stop. He was
understandably anxious to get the most out of every witness, and this led
him to repetition, a too-great concern with minutiae, asking multiple
questions which then had to be broken down, and asking questions that the
particular witness was not in a position to answer.
Time and again, Mr Justice Henry - who throughout granted Mr Seelig an
indulgence far beyond that which would have been allowed to a barrister  -
had to tell him that a particular witness could not deal with certain
matters and that there would be other witnesses who would be better able to
answer the questions.
For many weeks, the prosecution too was noticeably forbearing. Miss
Elizabeth Gloster QC made far fewer object-ions to Mr Seelig's
cross-examination methods than she would have done had her opponent been a
barrister.
As time went on, however, her protests became more frequent.
Mr Seelig would become frustrated and prone to emotional outbursts - that he
was not a lawyer, that he was doing his best, that he had a right to defend
himself and that the judge was being unfair.
It also became noticeable that Mr George Devlin, a friend of Mr Seelig who
since last spring has devoted his time to helping him to prepare his case,
and who frequently sat with him in court, was increasingly having to try to
exert a restraining and calming influence.
Apart from the strain and frustration Mr Seelig was experiencing in court,
he was setting himself a punishing schedule, having only a few hours sleep
between long hours of preparation for the next day's hearing.
On December 2 the judge told the jury that the trial would not, as had
originally been expected, end around Christmas but would last at least until
Easter.
The hearing adjourned for Christmas on December 20. Between then and last
Monday, the proceedings before the jury progressed by less than four days.
Nearly a week was lost because Mr Seelig, who had been receiving medical
treatment for some while, was suffering side-effects from an anti-depressant
he had been prescribed. A juror's illness delayed the trial for more than a
week.
On January 29 matters came to a head. Mr Seelig's most emotional outburst to
date crystallised the growing doubts about his ability to continue - and
also the justice or humanity of requiring him to do so.
It had become clear that if the trial had continued to proceed at the same
pace - only 10 of about 80 potential prosecution witnesses had given
evidence - it would last at least until the autumn, increasing the physical,
mental and emotional strain on Mr Seelig.
So on Monday the judge decided that the trial should be halted and that he
should discharge the jury.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Collapse of the second Guiness Trial: A model whizzkid of
1980s - The case that brought a city financier close to breakdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER SEELIG's experiences exemplified the 1980s boom years in the City
of London, Neil Buckley writes.
As a flamboyant corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant
bank, he masterminded some of the biggest takeover bids and corporate deals
of the decade. He also helped to make Morgan Grenfell the City's top
takeover bank, involved in bids worth Pounds 13.5bn in one year, at its peak
in 1986.
He was well-rewarded for his efforts, earning more than Pounds 200,000 a
year when six-figure salaries were rather less common than they are today
and gaining the nickname 'Mr Gucci shoes' through his expensive taste in
clothes.
Like many of the 1980s' generation of city whizzkids, he had a reputation
for living fast and working fast, often conducting business over a mobile
telephone from his Porsche, restaurant table or seat at the opera.
'He had a very high opinion of himself,' said one former colleague. 'But he
was very able - one of the very best corporate financiers of his
generation.'
Mr Seelig joined Morgan Grenfell in 1971. He became a corporate finance
director in 1979.
In just seven years he transformed the fortunes of Morgan Grenfell, and the
somewhat grey image of merchant banking.
He pulled off a string of high-profile deals, helping Dixons, the
high-street electrical retailer, to take over arch-rival Currys; building up
Sir Terence Conran's Habitat, Mothercare and British Home Stores retailing
conglomerate; launching the Underwoods chemists chain; and advising Mr
Richard Branson on the flotation of the Virgin group.
The Guinness bid for Distillers was to be the peak of his career. Mr Seelig
played a leading role in persuading Mr Saunders to launch the bid, and in
devising a way of side-stepping the bid's referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
But his career was to come to an abrupt end when he resigned in December
1986, four weeks after inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry
launched their investigation into the Guinness affair.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Signs of housing revival reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSING market may be showing faint signs of recovering from the deepest
depression in its history, the National Association of Estate Agents said
yesterday.
A survey of 150 members of the association suggests viewings and offers by
potential buyers are increasing.
Two thirds of estate agents said offers from prospective buyers in January
were up on monthly levels in the final quarter of last year and 84 per cent
said viewings had increased.
Estate agents in London, the region hardest hit by the property market
depression, say inquiries are up for the first time in many months.
Agents believe house prices will be flat for at least another year, however,
until the middle of next year.
Mr David Ware, president of the National Association of Estate Agencies,
said: 'I am very pleased with the increased activity but I am acutely aware
that we experienced a similar blip this time last year, when the revival
proved to be a false dawn.'
Regions where the signs of a housing market revival are strongest include
the north and north-west of England, the west Midlands, London and East
Anglia.
In another survey published yesterday, private house builders report an
increase in sales in January compared with a year ago.
Firms in the south-east told the House Builders' Federation there had been
the first 'strong upturn' in the market since August 1988.
The federation said the findings suggested a housing market recovery was
under way, 'as the first signs of market improvement normally ripple
outwards from London and the south-east'.
In the survey of builders, 62 per cent said sales had increased last month
compared with January last year. Only 21 per cent said sales fell.
In Greater London, 62 per cent said sales had improved while 33 per cent
said they had remained the same.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Mortgage market monitor urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HOUSEBUYERS' council to regulate the mortgage lending industry and improve
consumer protection and information was yesterday urged by the Catholic
Housing Aid Society.
The charity recommended the move after a study it conducted on repossessions
found that restrictive lender practices, reinforced by a lack of consumer
information, contributed to the rising tide of repossessions. Judges in
county courts were criticised for being unwilling to exercise their
discretion to postpone repossessions.
The housebuyers' council would be responsible for creating a more
competitive and efficient mortgage market by developing 'an appropriate
regulatory and consumer information framework'. Members of the council would
include representatives of government departments, regulators such as the
Office of Fair Trading, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and consumer
representatives.
Its tasks would include:
Registering and regulating lenders - mortgages offered by unregistered
bodies would not be legally enforceable.
Setting a maximum mortgage of 95 per cent of valuation.
Establishing a regional network of independent advice centres for
housebuyers.
Developing and enforcing a code of practice for lenders dealing with
arrears.
The study is based on 60 repossession cases taken from the files of National
Debtline, a Birmingham-based telephone hotline.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the CML, said he would support a more
coherent regulatory framework. He warned, however, that it would not be easy
to create such a framework given the existing legislation on consumer
credit, finan-cial services and estate agencies.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Valuable junk: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cargo of an Asian trading junk, which sank 100 miles off the coast of
Vietnam in the 1690s, is to be offered at Christie's in Amsterdam in April.
It consists of about 28,000 pieces of porcelain produced in China for the
European market.
Christie's expects to raise Pounds 1.5m from the auction. Most of the money
will go to the Vietnam Salvage Corporation, an agency owned by the Vietnam
government, which asked Christie's to dispose of the porcelain. Hallstrom
Oceanics, a Swedish underwater services company which handled the
excavation, is also a beneficiary.
The porcelain is of no great historic or aesthetic value but there is keen
collector interest in items recovered from the seabed. In 1986 Christie's
brought in Pounds 10m from the Nanking Cargo, more than 150,000 pieces of
export porcelain, plus gold bars, recovered from a Dutch East Indiaman which
sank near Singapore in the 1740s. This caught the public imagination and
attracted enthusiastic bidding.
Christie's is marketing the new find, dubbed the Vung Tau Cargo after the
nearest Vietnamese province to the wreck, by dividing the hoard into small
groups of plates, jars, and bowls. Many are estimated at a few hundred
pounds a lot, to attract private collectors. One problem is that American
dealers and private buyers are, in theory, prevented from importing items of
Vietnamese origin.
Unlike the Nanking cargo, the Vung Tau porcelain was acquired for decoration
rather than use. It was bought by the middle classes of Amsterdam, London,
and Paris - and by King William and Queen Mary for Hampton Court.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Complaints to gas watchdog rise by 130%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of serious complaints to Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, rose
last year by 130 per cent, Sir James McKinnon, director-general, said
yesterday.
Sir James stressed, however, that this was due more to the effectiveness of
regulation and growing expectations of service standards among consumers,
rather than any deterioration in British Gas's performance.
Ofgas's annual report detailed 858 complaints, compared with 366 in the
previous year. Sir James said: 'The number of complaints we see is the tiny
tip of the iceberg - people come to us as a last resort. But customers are
increasingly aware of their rights and are more confident about seeking
redress.'
British Gas said that 406 complaints had been referred by Ofgas to the
company, or one for every 45,000 customers. Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing
director, said: 'We have a good record but are not complacent and must
continually strive to improve.'
Sir James said the Citizen's Charter would increase British Gas's
obligations to customers. The new tariff formula, which would take effect in
April, included a scale of service standards which the company had to meet.
During its five-year life the tariff formula will save every household on
average Pounds 200 in real terms, Sir James said, compared with current gas
prices. 'In the longer term, I want consumers to be able to get better
service by choosing their supplier.'
The government plans to introduce competition for domestic business by 1998.
Before that, British Gas must reduce its share of the industrial market to
40 per cent by releasing gas to rivals.
Sir James said talks on the gas release were proceeding slowly. He raised
the possibility that the company could still be referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission if it failed to agree details quickly.
He said gas should be released to the market in a controlled way which could
be clearly monitored. 'We have to pricing . . . and that competitors can get
their gas through British Gas's pipeline system unimpaired.'
Nine companies, supplying 1,900 customers, currently compete with British
Gas. They have about 10 per cent of the overall industrial market.
Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, said complaints had
risen by 5 per cent over the year to 28,389. 'British Gas has a way to go,
but is doing an extremely good job in increasing its standard of service,'
he said.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Index plan to assess council reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'COMMUNITY INDEX' to evaluate the intangible costs and benefits of
reorganising local government is suggested by advisers preparing the
government guidance to be given to the planned local government commission.
The commission, charged with the largest review of local government since
the present structure was established in 1973, will be set up after the
local government bill is enacted in the next few weeks.
The report by CSL Group, published yesterday for consultation with local
authority associations and the Audit Commission, the local government
watchdog, looks both at financial costs and benefits and those which are
less straightforward. Among intangible effects, ministers have emphasised
the need for authorities to have a strong local identity. The report
emphasises accessibility, democracy and responsiveness.
The four elements cover factors such as physical geography, historical
identities, co-ordination of services, high election turnouts and the
adverse effect of losing experienced councillors and officers. Each proposal
for re-structuring would be judged on how it measured up against the index.
While the index is intended to minimise subjectivity in assessing the
intangible effects of changes, the report accepts that where financial and
non-financial effects point in different directions, decisions will be up to
the commission.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Army need for land queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARMY controls training areas in the UK bigger than the county of Gwent,
but the National Audit Office is puzzled about what it does with them.
A report today by the watchdog body, which reports to parliament on the use
of public funds, finds little evidence to support the Ministry of Defence's
arguments for taking over more land to train soldiers.
'The department's view is that there is a significant shortfall of Army
training land,' the report says, 'but the National Audit Office's
examination of the limited information available suggests that existing
capacity is under-utilised.'
Five out of eight training areas and 10 out of 11 firing ranges analysed by
the NAO were used for less than 80 per cent of the available time.
The report says that decisions to purchase more land were based on
'inadequate information'. Between 1985 and 1990 the MoD bought 6,500
hectares, mostly adjoining existing training areas. The MoD concluded that
because of increasing demand, the expansion had not significantly reduced
its land shortage.
The additional space cost Pounds 13.7m. But by selling 400 hectares of more
valuable land in the same period the MoD made a net profit of Pounds 7.3m.
The MoD's training areas and ranges cover 161,300 hectares, about the size
of Hertfordshire. Almost 90 per cent is controlled by the Army.
The NAO complains of 'deficiencies and uncertainties' in assessing training
needs.
The headquarters of UK Land Forces told the NAO 'they would undoubtedly be
able to prove that units had been unable to meet their training
requirements', but the watchdog found no evidence to support this.
NAO, MoD: Management and Control of Army Training Land, HMSO, Pounds 7.10.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Action by Lloyd's Names: Top underwriter bloody but unbowed
 -Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement is significant triumph for those who
acted to recover heavy losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROFESSIONAL reputation of Mr Richard Outhwaite, the 56-year-old
underwriter at the heart of the affair, will be dented by yesterday's
settlement but seems likely to remain intact.
Bearing in mind the way Mr Outhwaite has been pilloried in the press and by
the prosecution in the case, that might be surprising. Mr Anthony Boswood
QC, for the prosecution, said Mr Outhwaite had been responsible for the
City's biggest and most costly act of 'single-handed negligence'.
Yet with the exception of the disastrous 1982 year, when Mr Outhwaite
reinsured the loss-making contracts that are the subject of yesterday's
accord, his record has been an impressive one. His syndicate - 317/661  -
has produced profits in every single other year of its existence.
Names have queued to obtain places on it. Many who are party to the legal
action against him voluntarily remain members of his syndicate.
This year the syndicate's capacity - the amount of premium it can accept on
behalf of Names - will increase from the Pounds 66m of last year.
Ironically, in view charges against him for underwriting asbestosis risks,
Mr Outhwaite has won a reputation as a technically correct underwriter.
In a market where many underwriters are given to undercutting their rivals
in order to increase their share of the market, he insists on setting the
right rate for the risk and has been bitterly critical of under-pricing by
fellow underwriters - which he has labelled 'the very opposite of good
business practice, and economic suicide.'
Yesterday he was to be found - 'subdued and thoughtful', according to a
colleague, at his Lloyd's box (the open-plan office used by all
underwriters) insuring the ships and cargoes in which his syndicate
specialises.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Action by Lloyd's Names: Praise for an individual who
challenged the establishment - Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement is
significant triumph for those who acted to recover heavy losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TENSION of months of negotiation was only just beginning to lift
yesterday morning as Mr Peter Nutting detailed the settlement reached for
members of the Outhwaite syndicate.
The legal dispute pitted him against the Lloyd's establishment. Mr Nutting,
56, is himself an impeccable establishment figure - an old Etonian, ex-Irish
Guardsman, magistrate and Lloyd's council member. He persuaded several
hundred Names to join his action, often against the advice of their
accountants and other consultants.
While others hailed the settlement as a stunning victory for the pressure
group, Mr Nutting himself put it more modestly: 'I think it's a thoroughly
satisfactory outcome of what has been a long and difficult road.'
Many Names heaped praise on him yesterday. One said: 'He's a saint in my
eyes. He did it all and generated the settlement. He saved me from
bankruptcy.'
Another said: 'The legal action was like clockwork.'
But others did not want to talk publicly about the arrangement. 'When all's
said and done it has been a very personal and painful experience,' said one
Name who wanted to remain anonymous yesterday. 'I'm just pleased it is all
over.'
Mr Robert Williams, a businessman with a Pounds 60,000 share of the
syndicate's income, against which he estimates he has already paid out
Pounds 280,000, said: 'My first impression is that the settlement is very
good. I will certainly be buying a magnum of champagne.
Since Mr Williams joined as a Name in 1973 he had expected an average return
of about 10 per cent over the years. 'Outhwaite was a catastrophe far beyond
anything that had happened,' he said.
Mr Nutting took over the chairmanship of the 1982 Outhwaite Names
Association in summer 1988. Within 18 months the action group grew from just
over 400 to nearly 1,000.
Names were persuaded to contribute more than Pounds 2m to finance the legal
fight. Late in 1990 several hundred Names sent Mr Nutting post-dated cheques
to be drawn in the event of a legal defeat.
The problems in determining the size of claims and therefore the value of a
settlement had clearly vexed Mr Nutting throughout the discussions. He said
there was 'formidable difficulty' in establishing the size of the claims.
There was no visible bitterness towards Mr Richard Outhwaite. 'I have paid
tribute to his efforts at damage limitation,' said Mr Nutting. 'He has done
a super job. I very much hope he and his team will continue to be involved
in running the 1982 underwriting year (which has still not been closed). It
would be in all of our best interests.
Some Names, however, were worried about the fact that Mr Outhwaite has not
been able to close the 1982 underwriting year and that claims could continue
to come in. One Name said, 'This is still a running sore.'
'It's a very long hard road to go down. I would say litigation is extremely
unpredictable. With even a good case there's a lot of luck all round.'
Mr Nutting will not be among those dissecting the settlement over the next
few days. 'I'm leaving for a holiday in Barbados at 1pm,' he chuckled as he
left the press conference.

 -Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement is significant triumph for those who

<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement in the Outhwaite case is a
clear victory for the Lloyd's Names who backed the suit.
It is bound to encourage further legal action by other Names - the
individuals whose capital backs the market - who face some of their worst
losses in the 300-year history of the insurance market.
One Outhwaite Name said: 'The message for other action groups is that if
you've got a good legal team you've a chance of getting your money back.'
The settlement ends the biggest legal action at Lloyd's, which has been
dogged by controversy over the last 10 years. With losses from US court
awards to the victims of asbestosis and a wave of natural catastrophes
mounting, relations between Names and their agents, who handle the affairs
of Names and manage syndicates, have been troubled.
In the Outhwaite case, Names took action to recover more than Pounds 125m in
insurance losses stemming from 32 reinsurance contracts assumed in 1982 by
the underwriter of Lloyd's syndicate 317/661, Mr Richard Outhwaite. Overall
losses for the 1,614 Names on the syndicate amount to more than Pounds 200m
and are rising.
The contracts reinsured the exposures of other insurers, mainly other
Lloyd's syndicates, to US liability risks and particularly asbestosis
awards. The Names alleged negligence and breach of contract by the RHM
Outhwaite Underwriting agency, which managed syndicate 317/661, and by 80
other agents who funnelled them on to Mr Outhwaite's syndicate.
The Outhwaite action is one of six legal cases in which Names have alleged
their losses arose because of negligence of agents in four cases, and the
Corporation of Lloyd's in the other.
Four of these cases involving Pulbrook syndicates 90 and 334, Poland 105 and
108 and four Oakeley Vaughan syndicates, are unsettled. Names who have not
yet joined those actions are bound to note that Outhwaite Names who followed
advice against joining the Outhwaite suit now find themselves left out in
the cold by the settlement.
Moreover, the success of the Outhwaite Names' settlement contrasts sharply
with that achieved last week by more than 500 members of Warrilow syndicate
553 who sued their agents for losses of more than Pounds 60m. Their campaign
ran out of steam, forcing the Names to accept a settlement which met about
10 per cent of losses.
Mr Peter Nutting, a Name in the Outhwaite syndicate and the leader of the
campaign to recover losses, said yesterday: 'The size of this settlement may
have the effect of encouraging some people who were hesitant about joining
action groups to to join them.'
His assertion is supported by the experience this week of Mr David Tiplady
of solicitors DJ Freeman, who is acting for about 1,000 Names in three
actions involving Pulbrook and Poland Names.
At the end of last week 280 of the 570 Names on Pulbrook 334 in 1985 were
party to an action against Lloyd's agents. In addition, 330 of the 478
members of Pulbrook 90 and only about 350 of more than 900 Names who were
members of Poland syndicates were backing actions.
Mr Tiplady says he has been 'flooded' with calls in the wake of the
Outhwaite settlement. One managing agent at Lloyd's said yesterday writs
were going to fly 'like confetti'.
The main concern for authorities at Lloyd's must be the position of several
thousand Names on syndicates managed by Feltrim, Gooda Walker, Devonshire
and Rose Thomson Young. These specialised in catastrophe reinsurance and
face losses of more than Pounds 500m as claims roll in from natural
disasters between 1987 and 1990.
Although no liability was apportioned in the Outhwaite settlement, expert
evidence on Mr Outhwaite's behalf by Mr Richard Hazell, a fellow Lloyd's
underwriter and deputy chairman of Lloyd's, may have influenced the defence
to opt for a settlement. Mr Hazell defended Mr Outhwaite from charges of
negligence but accepted that the underwriter had been 'imprudent in some
respects'.
He accepted that Mr Outhwaite had not foreseen the scale of potential losses
when he underwrote 32 run-off reinsurance contracts. Mr Hazell admitted that
many of the alleged shortcomings of Mr Outhwaite's underwriting - such as
poor record-keeping - were typical of the market at the time. 'If Mr
Outhwaite was living in a cocoon we all were,' Mr Hazell said.

FT  12 FEB 92 / GEC Alsthom dispute fuelled by job cut threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDUSTRIAL dispute at a plant of GEC Alsthom, the switchgear company, has
intensified after management told unions it wants to shed a further 157
jobs.
About 430 of the 650-strong workforce at Openshaw, near Manchester, have
been on strike for more than five weeks over the compulsory redundancy of 12
people.
These were part of a shedding of 95 jobs announced in September.
Negotiations on a settlement to the dispute will inevitably be complicated
by the further job losses.
GEC Alsthom had previously indicated that more job losses were necessary,
but unions say that 157 is worse than they had feared. The company may seek
volunteers for the cuts. Unions, however, believe it will seek further
compulsory severances.
Many groups of workers have threatened industrial action over redundancies
in the recession but few have taken it. Strikes on any issue have been rare
in the past year.
The GEC Alsthom strikers will be told by unions today of the management
plans, which also include a reduction in the size of the plant.
The company said yesterday that the workforce reduction was because of
depressed demand for medium-voltage switchgear equipment and the need to cut
costs to compete. Orders had declined further since the 95 redundancies were
announced.
The company said it regretted the compulsory redundancies. Continued efforts
were being made to resolve the dispute before the company suffered
irreparable dam-age.
Mr Larry Brooke, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said
the strikers were not fighting for money but the right to work. Workers from
the plant yesterday demonstrated about redundancies outside GEC's London
headquarters.
GEC Alsthom is owned 50 per cent by GEC and 50 per cent by Alcatel of
France.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Businesses report cost-cutting on company cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DRIVE by businesses to cut the costs of company cars is identified in a
study of 200 companies operating a total of 115,000 cars.
The annual study, published yesterday by the Monks Partnership consultancy
group, found that nearly a quarter of companies surveyed require employees
to cover more than 70,000 miles before their cars are replaced - compared
with 8 per cent the year before - while 31 per cent are keeping their cars
for four years or more, up from 19 per cent in the previous year.
The survey found 85 per cent of surveyed companies were seeking to change
their company car policies in order to cut costs. The figures help explain
the sharp fall in new-car sales which has hit vehicle makers and importers.
They also offer the industry some prospect of an upturn in sales this year
as fleet operators find themselves unable to postpone replacement further.
Three out of four companies surveyed said they were keen to introduce cash
alternatives to company cars.
Meanwhile, in a Home Office survey of car crime published yesterday, 88 per
cent of drivers said they believed manufacturers could do more to improve
car security and 56 per cent admitted they could be doing more themselves.
One in 10 motorists also admitted regularly leaving their cars unlocked,
usually outside shops and homes during the day.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Motor trade moves into surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK motor industry achieved a quarterly trade surplus in the final three
months of last year for the first time since the early 1980s.
According to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, the motor industry trade balance showed a surplus
of Pounds 121m in the final quarter last year, compared with a deficit of
Pounds 167m in the same period the year before.
For the whole of last year the deficit fell by 78.3 per cent to Pounds 1bn
from Pounds 4.6bn in 1990, and a peak deficit of Pounds 6.6bn in 1889.
The motor industry trade balance has been in deficit every year since 1982,
but last year's deficit was the lowest for nine years.
The rapid improvement in the past two years - a significant factor in the
reduction of the overall UK trade deficit - has been driven both by the
recession depressing imports of new cars and commercial vehicles, and by
strong car exports.
But the SMMT warned yesterday there were 'clear signs that the big growth in
exports which took place last year is coming to an end'.
In the final quarter of last year total motor industry export earnings fell
by 1 per cent to Pounds 2.9bn, while the value of exports for the whole of
last year rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 10.7bn.
The rate of decline in the value of imported automotive products also slowed
in the final quarter, with a fall of 10 per cent to almost Pounds 2.8bn
compared with an 18 per cent fall in the whole of last year to Pounds
11.7bn.
The value of UK car exports fell by 8 per cent in the final quarter against
the corresponding period a year earlier, reversing the trend of earlier
months and cutting the year-on-year growth rate for all of last year to 25
per cent.
The growth in light commercial vehicle exports also slowed in the final
quarter, in both volume and value terms.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Conservatives follow Labour lead in focusing on the
individual: Employment White Paper - People, Jobs and Opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR claims to have been first off the mark. To stress its distance from
the old collectivism it has been promising a charter to increase the rights
of individuals at work.
Yesterday - in a white paper entitled People, Jobs and Opportunity - the
Conservative party outlined its plans for 'unlocking the potential of each
and every individual' by widening choice and freedom and, in some cases,
increasing rights. 'There is a new recognition of the role and importance of
the individual employee,' it said.
In the past 13 years individual rights at work have meant, for the
Conservatives, the right to challenge the trade union collective. Labour's
accusation that proposals in the original green paper on employment were
just the 'old agenda' of negative union-bashing appears to have struck home.
For the Conservatives to adopt the theme of individual rights at work will
seem like a bad joke to many trade unionists. They say the labour market
de-regulation of the past decade has stripped workers of rights by, for
example, denying people the right to appeal against unfair dismissal until
they have been employed for two years.
The Conservatives, however, do not have Labour's problem of trying to marry
individual rights with collective ones. Emphasising the continuing
differences with Labour, the white paper rejects the 'increasingly
inappropriate patterns of industrial relations, based on collective
bargaining and collective agreements'.
Labour's backing for ideas such as a national minimum wage and works
councils - and the European Community's attempts to introduce uniform models
of industrial relations - are rejected in favour of a less prescriptive
approach. 'Much depends on the actions of employers . . . the government's
role is to create the framework within which individual choice and
opportunity can flourish.'
The white paper, which in places has the tentative air of a green paper, is
very much a political document. But it includes suggestions for best
practice which employers should follow as well as changes to the law. The
proposals include:
Terms of employment: Laws would be introduced to give every employee working
more than eight hours a week the right to a statement on his or her terms
and conditions of employment within two months of starting work. Employees
going to work abroad would be entitled to receive additional information
before departure.
The statement would include information about pay, hours of work and
holidays and, possibly, training. Any changes would be notified by the
employer directly to individuals in writing. The government proposes to
extend the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals so they are able to decide
complaints about breaches of employment contracts when an employee leaves.
Poaching of trained employees: The government floats the idea of legislation
that would make it harder for employers to poach workers trained by other
organisations. Employers 'may want to offer training under a contract which
provides for the individual to work for a period after training or repay
some of the costs'. The government is considering simplifying the procedure
for training contracts by bringing them within the jurisdiction of
industrial tribunals.
Voucher scheme for careers advice: These will be on offer in some areas from
April 1993 and are aimed at strengthening career information, assessment and
counselling services for adults who are, in the main, already in employment.
The white paper does not detail who will be entitled to the vouchers but the
idea would be to concentrate on the lowest skilled and lowest paid. Young
people are entitled by law to help from their local careers service. The
white paper says provision for adults is 'variable'.
A few of the employer-led training and enterprise councils (Tecs) are
piloting a careers-advice voucher scheme offering credits of between about
Pounds 60 and Pounds 120 to individuals. A total of 15 Tecs will be involved
in extending the scheme and it is intended 250,000 people will benefit over
two years.
Individual training accounts: An individual and the employer would
contribute jointly over time to an 'account' for training. The white paper
makes no specific proposals but says the government 'believes that this is
an approach worth testing further'. Tecs will be asked to organise pilot
projects.
Home study: Vocational 'open learning' materials and back-up services will
be available in local libraries over the next three years. Pilot schemes
will be set up by Tecs to make vouchers available to unemployed people so
they can buy home-study books, courses and support.
Flexible working: The Department of Employment will soon publish a guide on
the benefits of flexible working, providing good-practice guidance on
annualised hours, career breaks and working from home. It will continue to
oppose European Commission proposals to restrict working hours
'unnecessarily'.
Equal opportunities: A government minister will chair a proposed advisory
group to assist in encouraging and disseminating good employment practice
for older workers. The white paper says employers sometimes forget the value
of older workers but says legislation on age limits in recruitment and other
issues would be ineffective. The Employment Department plans guidance on
sexual harassment.
Trade unions: As first outlined in a green paper last autumn individuals
would be given greater freedom to join the union of their choice, a right to
more financial information about it and a right to restrain unlawful
organisation of industrial action in a public service they use. Union
members would be 'protected' against abuses of 'check-off' arrangements
under which subscriptions are deducted from salary.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Ford considers moving European staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, said yesterday that it has considered moving part of
its Ford of Europe headquarters staff from the UK as part of its
restructuring programme.
The company said, however, it had no 'definite plan' to press ahead with
such a move. In a statement to staff it insisted that 'no decisions have
been made to move any activity at this time'.
The Ford of Europe headquarters is at Warley, Essex, the same location as
the base for Ford of Britain.
Ford of Europe fell into loss last year. The company said yesterday that as
part of its overall restructuring programme it was 'leaving no stone
unturned to find ways of improving the international competitiveness' of its
European operations.
Its financial performance in the past two years has been overshadowed by the
resurgent fortunes of General Motors in Europe - under the Vauxhall name in
the UK and Opel on the Continent.
GM reorganised its European operations in the late 1980s. It established a
small headquarters staff in Zurich, Switzerland, as a neutral location away
from its main production and research and development operations in Germany,
the UK, Belgium and Spain.
It is understood that Ford has studied the idea of a similar move.
The company said that recent 'allegations' that it planned to move its
engineering activities from the UK to Germany were 'absolutely untrue'.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Oil workers' group wins recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFSHORE Industry Liaison Committee, the unofficial grouping of North
Sea oil workers, said last night it had been given official recognition as a
trade union.
The recognition, by the government's trade-union certification officer, will
further inflame relations between the committee and other established trade
unions, including the AEU engineering union.
The OILC, led by Mr Ronnie McDonald, was behind the industrial unrest on oil
platforms in the summer of 1990. Mr McDonald described the listing of the
OILC as a trade union as a 'watershed'. It would clarify the authority of
the body at industrial tribunals, for example.
A certificate of independence would be required before the new union could
claim back money spent on balloting, however. Mr McDonald said the group
hoped for a certificate of independence soon.
The OILC hopes to recruit a 'viable operational base' of 3,000 members
within its first year.
Mr McDonald said the new union wanted to affiliate to the Scottish Trades
Union Congress. The long-term aim would be for affiliation to the TUC
itself.

FT  12 FEB 92 / DTI attempt to wind up insurer rejected by judge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday failed in a petition to wind
up Secure &amp; Provide, a Hull-based insurance company, on 'public interest'
grounds.
Secure &amp; Provide traded briefly in early 1991, promoting an unorthodox
'pyramid selling' scheme for personal insurance packages. Its activities
were halted when the DTI appointed inspectors. A provisional liquidator was
appointed by the court last March.
Mr Justice Hoffmann said yesterday he was not satisfied that the public
interest required the company to be wound up. It would be 'unjust' and
'grossly disproportionate' to do so in response to the errors that Mr John
Tyzack, who headed the business, had admittedly made in launching his
scheme.
The judge dismissed the petition and ordered the DTI to pay costs. He
directed that Pounds 40,000 raised from subscribers and held by the
liquidator should be returned to the company. Mr Tyzack said the money would
be released back to subscribers who paid a Pounds 75-a-month premium for a
personal insurance package with an inducement to earn commission by
recruiting others to buy.

ITV faces a serious threat to its Pounds 540m-a-year programme schedule that
could lead to the bankruptcy of some companies, a senior ITV executive
warned yesterday, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and managing director of
London Weekend Television, based his fears on the recession and the high
levels of bids for new franchises.
He said some of the high bidders had assumed the recession would end last
year and had forecast a 10 per cent increase in advertising this year. He
added: 'The choice might well be to bankrupt some companies or reduce the
spending on the schedule.' Both would be a real threat to programme quality.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Harkin has 78% of Iowa Democrat caucus vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Tom Harkin won 78 per cent of the votes in Monday night's Democratic
party caucuses in his home state of Iowa, comfortably exceeding his target
of bettering the 59 per cent score of President Jimmy Carter in 1980.
However, his faltering presidential campaign seemed unlikely to be able to
gain much impetus from this local triumph.
None of the other Democratic candidates had campaigned on Senator Harkin's
home turf, and with fewer than 30,000 people attending the caucuses - barely
4 per cent of registered Democrats - the vote could scarcely be hailed as a
plebiscite.
Iowa's caucuses, the first to be held in each presidential campaign, have
since 1972 strongly influenced the eventual nominations of both parties,
especially the Democrats.
This has probably contributed to a stream of Democratic candidates who were
more dovish and pro-farm than the nation at large.
In 1988, however, both parties' Iowa winners subsequently dropped out of the
race, while Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee demonstrated that a candidate
could ignore Iowa and still build a strong campaign on the cluster of
primaries to be held on Super Tuesday - which this year will take place on
March 10.
Yet Mr Harkin, whose prairie populist campaign has failed to capitalise on a
promising start at raising campaign funds and winning support from trade
unionists and the other traditional Democratic power brokers, yesterday put
a good face on his Iowa victory.
He said the vote would give him the extra momentum needed to win over the
many New Hampshire voters who are still undecided about next week's primary.
Recent opinion polls place Mr Harkin fourth in New Hampshire behind former
Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
Between 10 and 20 per cent of voters are still undecided.
Mr Harkin, who describes himself as the only old-fashioned Democrat in the
race, has compared his position to that of Senator Gary Hart in 1984.
Like many other beneficiaries of what is known as the the Iowa 'bounce',
Senator Hart did not actually win, but fared so much better than expected
that his campaign caught fire, helping him to sweep the New Hampshire
primary a week later.
The Iowa victory will still give Senator Harkin more delegates than any
other candidate, even if he fails in New Hampshire.
Mr Harkin claims good support in Maine and South Dakota, the next two states
to vote, but political commentators believe he will do poorly in the mainly
southern Super Tuesday states.

economy but stands ready to cut interest rates again if growth fails to
materialise, Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, indicated yesterday.
He told bankers in San Antonio, Texas, that the central bank would 'if
necessary, move to an increased degree of monetary ease'.
However, he said he believed the monetary stimulus already in the pipeline
would prove sufficient.
On Wall Street, many analysts expect a small cut in short-term market rates
 -now 4 per cent - within the next week or so. Many traders were surprised
that the Fed failed to respond last week to much worse than expected
employment figures for January. Non-farm payrolls fell 91,000 compared with
an expected gain of about 30,000.
The Fed, however, is thought to believe that last Friday's employment
figures, which fluctuate markedly on a monthly basis, overstated the
underlying weakness in the economy. It is sticking to its view that the
economy is flat rather than declining.
Fed officials are also encouraged by a revival of monetary growth in recent
weeks, although some of the rebound reflects faulty seasonal adjustments.
In recent testimony, Mr Greenspan rejected claims that monetary policy was
ineffectual. He believes the central economic problem is the weakness of
personal and corporate balance sheets caused by an excessive build-up of
debt in the 1980s.
Lower interest rates are providing direct relief by reducing debt service
costs. They have also spurred higher equity and bond prices and thus
encouraged the replacement of short-term debt by equity and bond issues.
However, because the US has not faced balance sheet pressures of this kind
for several generations, it is unclear how long the restructuring process
will take. On several occasions, however, Mr Greenspan has indicated his
belief that the bulk of the adjustment is probably complete. The Fed
continues to expect a mild recovery in the spring.
In speeches Mr Greenspan has said public anxiety about the economy is
excessive in the light of hard data, which continues to be much less
discouraging than in the recessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82. The unemployment
rate of 7.1 per cent, for example, is far below its previous peaks.
Fed officials believe the competitiveness of US industry has actually risen
sharply in recent years. The turning point was the restructuring of
manufacturing industry prompted by the strong dollar in the mid-1980s.
Since then, US manufacturers have benefited from a combination of lower
costs and rapid depreciation of the dollar.

LAWYERS for creditors of the defunct US investment bank Drexel Burnham
Lambert yesterday filed court papers seeking the return of Dollars 250m
(Pounds 136.6m) in bonuses the company paid out to employees just before it
went bankrupt in February 1990.
The lawyers claim the payments hastened Drexel's slide into bankruptcy.
Under US law, a company facing bankruptcy is restricted from making payments
that might be part of a plan to delete assets of the company's estate.
Yesterday's filing follows a report last October by staff of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US watchdog, which said that a bankruptcy
trustee for Drexel would stand a reasonable chance of proving the company
was insolvent when the cash bonuses were paid in late 1989 and early 1990,
and that evidence existed that the payments represented 'fraudulent
conveyance' of Drexel's assets.
Any money recovered from the bonus payments would be distributed among
Drexel's many creditors.

THE US government is holding up the reimbursement of Dollars 350m (Pounds
191m) in export credit guarantees on loans made to Iraq by the Atlanta,
Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
The delay, according to a senior US official, is related to the forthcoming
trial of several BNL Atlanta officials who have been charged with fraud in
connection with more than Dollars 4bn of improper Iraqi loans.
The trial, which will include Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta
branch manager, is likely to be delayed from March 2 until June, in order to
give defendants more time to prepare.
BNL's Atlanta branch provided crucial funds to Iraq, including about Dollars
2bn that helped to finance Mr Saddam Hussein's nuclear missile and chemical
weapons projects.
The Dollars 350m of BNL loan guarantees - which were supposedly made to
support US farm exports to Iraq - are part of some Dollars 1.9bn of
US-backed loans that Iraq has defaulted on.
A spokesman at the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which guaranteed the
Iraqi loans, said the matter 'is being evaluated at the highest levels of
our department.'

MR Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former UN secretary-general, will be named
today to the boards of the US and European banks controlled by Mr Edmond
Safra, the Swiss-based international banker.
The directorships, on the boards of the New York-based Republic National
Bank and the Luxembourg-based Safra Republic Holdings, will mark the first
new appointments to be taken up by Mr Perez de Cuellar since he left the UN
at the end of last year.
The former UN official said yesterday that he had been approached by a
number of banks and companies with offers of directorships, but had decided
to work with Mr Safra because the two have been close friends for the past
10 years.
Mr Perez de Cuellar, who does not plan to accept any other directorships,
said he expects to play an active role at the Safra banks, acting as a
political adviser.
Mr Walter Weiner, chairman of Republic New York, said the former
secretary-general would help the banks assess international economic and
political conditions.
Mr Perez de Cuellar said in an interview with the Financial Times that he
favoured expanding the five-member UN Security Council to include both
Germany and Japan. But, he stressed, other nations such as India, Nigeria
and Brazil should also be admitted to the Security Council.
He was opposed to any fresh US covert action or military intervention in
Iraq that did not have full UN backing.
Responding to reports that the Bush administration may be providing
clandestine support for an uprising against Iraq's President Saddam Hussein,
Mr Perez de Cuellar said he hoped the reports were not correct.
'Juridically, I cannot support any flagrant intervention in the internal
affairs of another country. You cannot allow one country to take individual
action.'

summit'

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS ONE of the world's most protected economies and keeper of the planet's
largest rainforest Brazil will be an interesting setting for the discussion
on the value of free trade for the environment.
The UN Conference for Environment and Development, better known as the
'earth summit', would not justify its grandiose title without such a topic
on the agenda and Rio de Janeiro in June will be the location for what is
expected to be a heated discussion with little substantive results.
Multilateral organisations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade and the World Bank are falling over themselves to produce reports on
the issue which cuts across the areas to be discussed and divides the
developed and developing worlds. Mr Tony Gros of the Global Forum, the
parallel conference of non-governmental organisations, says: 'The whole
question of Gatt and neo-liberal trade policies will be the cornerstone of
the debate both at the official and parallel events.'
At the last preparatory meeting in Geneva for the summit the Group of 77
made clear that it was not prepared to discuss treaties on bio-diversity and
forests unless a commitment to improved terms of trade and transfer of
technology is included. This week the Amazonian pact countries have been
meeting in Brazil with a clear message - there can be no agreement on
conservation without taking into account economic realities. One delegate
said bluntly: 'The first world can't stop us it improves our economic
possibilities and that means ending protectionism in Europe.'
Gatt believes that a multilateral agreement must be reached at the summit to
prevent a kind of green anarchy breaking out, with economic powers such as
the US or Germany setting their own environmental standards and
discriminating in trade terms against those who do not comply. But there is
strong resistance from developing countries to the idea of agreed
international standards or monitoring which is seen as interfering with
sovereignty.
The real talking on this issue takes place before the conference at the last
preparatory meeting in New York next month. One G7 diplomat involved in the
negotiations says: 'They will come up with something for heads of state to
sign in June, but the underlying difficulties are so great and time so short
that chances of a meaningful agreement are diminishing daily.'

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush said yesterday the US will accelerate by five years
the phasing out of substances depleting the earth's ozone layer, agencies
report from Washington.
International plans call for an end to production of ozone-damaging
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000; Mr Bush said the US would
complete this by 1995.
He said the US was acting unilaterally but urged other nations to follow
suit.
The announcement comes a week after the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (Nasa) released a study showing the protective ozone layer in
the Northern Hemisphere was being destroyed more quickly than had been
thought.
The Nasa report said aircraft and satellite studies showed that chlorine
monoxide, a chemical which destroys the ozone layer, reached record levels
over parts of Canada, the US and Europe during some days in January.
In some measurements the chemical was found to be as high as 1.5 parts per
billion, a level that one scientist called 'alarming'.
Mr Bush said current US production of ozone-depleting chemicals was already
more than 40 per cent below levels allowed under the Montreal Protocol, the
international agreement in which industrialised nations had pledged to halt
production of CFCs by 2000.
In the near term, Mr Bush called on US manufacturers to reduce production of
CFCs to 50 per cent of 1986 levels by the end of this year.
In a statement announcing Mr Bush's action, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House
press secretary, cited the recent studies indicating that CFCs are depleting
the ozone layer more quickly than had been believed.
'The president announced that, with limited exceptions for essential uses
and for serving certain existing equipment, all production of these
substances in the United States will be eliminated by December 31, 1995.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: Gatt issues warning against
environmental imperialism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEWARE protectionists who disguise themselves in environmentalists'
clothing: beware the temptation to assume the role of global environmental
vigilante: and don't forget that a set of effective environmental protection
laws will always be better than - and will normally pre-empt the need for -
trade weapons in defence of the environment.
These siren calls provide a haunting chorus throughout the 35-page report on
trade and the environment published today by the Geneva-based secretariat to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
The long-awaited report, delayed by hectic but so far fruitless efforts to
complete the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, is
intended to trigger debate in this controversial area in the run-up to
June's 'earth summit' in Brazil.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, said yesterday these were 'not
Gatt's first words on the subject, nor the last'. They are nevertheless
expected to shape a debate in which advocates of free trade try to persuade
increasingly militant environmental groups that free trade is not synonymous
with providing a licence to pollute the globe.
Among the points made most forcefully by the report are:
The European Community's fiercely protectionist Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) is inflicting serious environmental damage on the globe.
Countries with large forest areas are currently providing 'carbon absorption
services' free of charge. Instead of imposing trade sanctions on them for
exporting logs, they should be properly paid for these carbon absorption
services.
Countries are not clones of each other. They have a sovereign right to
declare different environmental priorities and policies.
Gatt's rules and dispute settlement procedures will not frustrate any
country's efforts to improve domestic environmental standards. While they
might frustrate unilateral 'vigilante' action by one country against
another, they provide a working framework for winning multilateral
agreement.
There is a close link between wealth and improved environmental protection.
Trade barriers that frustrate developing countries' ability to improve
living standards will at the same time frustrate efforts to raise standards
of environmental protection.
Tariff walls are no more justified to protect the competitiveness of
companies that have incurred the cost of meeting strict environmental
standards than they are to protect companies that pay more corporation tax,
or spend more on research and development. On the contrary, such companies
are likely to become market leaders as a result of such investment.
The report's fiercest language is reserved for protectionists in general and
US and European farm policymakers in particular: 'Existing agricultural
protection not only fails to help the environment, but almost certainly is
an important source of environmental degradation,' the report says.
US land set-aside programmes have prompted farmers to aim for higher yields
on remaining land, 'which almost certainly has involved increased per-acre
use of chemicals'. High support prices in land-scarce countries, backed up
by tariff walls, have a similar effect, the report argues. It notes that
countries like Argentina, Australia and Thailand use less than 10 per cent
of the chemical fertiliser per hectare used by Europe's farmers.
The report accuses 'particular producer groups' of having succeeded in the
past 'in manipulating domestic environmental policies to benefit themselves
at the expense of both the rest of the economy and ultimately even the
environment'. It warns environmental groups to be wary of efforts by
protectionist lobbies to draw them into 'implicit or explicit alliances'.
The report queries whether trade measures are ever likely to be the most
effective means of achieving environmental improvements. In a clear call for
the Rio summit in June to gain more multilateral consensus on policies
intended to protect the environment, the report notes: 'If all countries
participated in all international environmental agreements, there would be
nothing more to add.'
There are repeated warnings against unilateral action by governments to
export domestic environmental policies - a clear measure of the Gatt's
anxiety over a tendency, particularly in the US, to resort to trade weapons
to force good environmental practice on other countries.
In a reference to a recent controversial ruling against a US decision to ban
imports of Mexican yellowfin tuna because fishing methods led to the killing
of dolphin that swim above tuna shoals, the report recalled: 'A country may
not restrict imports of a product solely because it originates in a country
whose environmental policies are different.'
If allowed, this would create a loophole allowing any country 'unilaterally
to apply trade restrictions not for the purpose of enforcing its own laws
within its own jurisdiction, but to impose the standards set out in its laws
on other countries'. Such environmental imperialism would be a fast track to
trade chaos and conflict, it argues.
It is in its defence of a country's sovereign right to set its own
environmental priorities that the Gatt wades into deepest controversy:
'Countries are not clones of each other,' it argues. This lays open the
danger that a country might condone poor environmental standards, encourage
the migration of polluting industries - a problem that should be tackled by
open debate in multinational forums, not by vigilante action by
self-appointed guardians of self-defined environmental imperatives.
The Gatt accepts that when pollution does not remain inside a country's
borders, or affects the 'global commons' like the ozone layer or
deforestation, then 'inter-governmental co-operation is likely to be
essential'. It nevertheless insists that unilateral action must be resisted,
and that the cost of action should be skewed both towards those who pollute,
and those who have the ability to pay.
The report is anyway sceptical about the effectiveness of present trade
weapons aimed at tackling problems like deforestation and the uncontrolled
slaughter of elephants to fuel the trade in ivory.
A close examination of efforts to restrict the trade in tropical timber
argues that a ban would do nothing to reduce deforestation: instead it
proposes that the advanced industrial countries, whose carbon dioxide
emissions account for most global warming, should compensate forested
countries for their 'carbon absorption services'. Non-payment for these
services means a country like Brazil 'has little or no incentive to take
such services into account in deciding on the optimal management of its
forest resource'.
While the Gatt is not so brash as to claim that free trade provides a
panacea for solving environmental problems, it contests the view that
liberal trade is a villainous contributor to degradation: 'Conceivably, an
expansion of trade could produce negative environmental effects so large
that they outweigh the conventional benefits from open markets (increased
specialisation, more competition and so forth).
'However, this is possible only if a country lacks a domestic environmental
policy that reflects its environmental values and priorities,' the report
argues. Also, failure to place a proper value on environmental resources
would undermine sustainable development even in a completely closed economy,
it says. Trade could be no more than a 'magnifier'.
Much more likely, expanded trade will lead to greater wealth and a diffusion
of technology - both of which enhance a society's ability to protect and
upgrade its environment. The principal challenge, it concludes, is to
exploit those ways in which open international trade 'can contribute, in
conjunction with appropriate national environmental policies, to the
improvement and protection of the environment'.

Telefonica de Espana, a Spanish telephone company, is to purchase 80 per

The contract was agreed between Telefonica Internacional de Espana, a

The Spanish company says it will invest another Dollars 50m in the Puerto
Rican venture to upgrade its facilities.
The US Federal Communications Commission will have to approve the sale, as
Telefonica de Espana's purchase breaches regulations prohibiting foreign
companies from owning more than 40 per cent of any US telephone company.
The purchase represents Telefonica de Espana's second venture in the Puerto
Rican telecommunications industry. The company already owns 40 per cent of
Telefonica Hispanoamerica, which manufactures telephones and other equipment
on the island. Telefonica de Espana, also has investments in Argentina,
Chile and Venezuela.

France's Socialist government easily defeated a no-confidence motion tabled
yesterday by the centre-right opposition over the controversial hospital
stay in Paris of the Palestinian radical, Mr George Habash, Reuter reports
from Paris.
The Communist party said before the vote it would not support the motion,
ensuring the survival of Mrs Edith Cresson's minority Socialist-led
government. The motion finally mustered 261 votes in favour, 28 short of
what it needed to succeed.
The government has been under pressure since news leaked of the admission to
France of Mr Habash, who aroused no public sympathy because of his
involvement in bombings and aircraft hijackings. Five senior officials were
forced to resign over the affair, but opposition politicians ministers'
heads to roll.
President Francois Mitterrand yesterday agreed to scale down plans to build
a giant new national library in the centre of Paris which critics had
condemned as too grandiose, Reuter reports.
He said in a letter to Mr Jack Lang, culture minister, he had decided to
change the design after studying an independent report on the FFr7.2b
(Pounds 730m) project. The building would be made more cost-effective and
compact by reducing the height of glass towers to be situated at each of its
four corners.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Russia tangled in politics of aid: The divisive symbolism of
foreign bread and butter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CARTOON on a banner displayed at the communist demonstration in Moscow on
Sunday showed a horse labelled 'The New Powers' munching at a pile of
'humanitarian aid'. Hungry citizens at the rear end of the horse received
its droppings.
For the growing numbers on the right and left who oppose the Russian
government, aid is represented as a prop for those in power which gives the
people nothing.
The environment in which it is delivered encourages such a response. The
current airlift of aid is given massive TV coverage - and Russians see it
brought in by westerners who look rich, well fed and well dressed.
The need to guard the supplies has led the European Community, the main aid
provider, to bring over a group of servicemen, including no less than two
generals - one German, one French. General Fritz von Steinseifer is deputy
administrator of the task force overseeing the distribution of the EC aid -
and as a German who fought on the Russian front as a young soldier he
invites comment.
He and his fellows stay at the Lufthansa-owned Olympic Penta, one of
Moscow's few luxury hotels, which costs about Dollars 200 (Pounds 110) a
night for a room - another cause for envy and derision since, on the current
Rbs110-to-the-dollar exchange rate, that is more than most Russians earn in
a year.
In fact, the testimony of those distributing aid is that almost nothing has
been lost to thieves - less because of Gen von Steinseifer, more because of
Russian soldiers who guard the train convoys bringing the meat to the cities
from St Petersburg or Kleipeda in Latvia. The focus of the media, western
and Russian, on the criminality surrounding the operation is mistaken, say
the organisers.
Two senior officials concerned with the distribution of EC aid to Moscow and
St Petersburg under a Ecu200m (Pounds 142.6m) programme, speaking on terms
of anonymity, pointed to the downside.
First, it undercuts the local supply system.
The EC produce is set deliberately below the higher market prices to try to
drag them down. Unfortunately, they say, it is not so much having this
effect as deterring producers of food from selling to the Moscow and St
Petersburg shops - pushing them to conclude long-term contracts with other
republics, or organisations elsewhere in Russia.
The producers are not, they say, profiteering: but their own costs, sharply
up, rule out competition with the EC food. Once the EC aid runs out, in
about two months, and the effects of the airlift are over in two to three
weeks, the two largest Russian cities will have to go back to suppliers who
may be unable or unwilling to sell to them.
Mr Hansjorg Kretschmer, the deputy head of the EC mission to Moscow, said
yesterday that there were 'indications, not yet proof' that the relatively
low prices were deterring Moscow producers from selling - while there had as
yet been few signs of a reduction in price. The EC now prices its butter at
Rbs56 a kg, boned meat at Rbs50 a kg, boneless at Rbs75. The free prices of
butter reach Rbs100 a kg or more, while meat of any quality sells at Rbs120
a kg, or more.
Second, the aid may not be what is needed. In their studies of the food
chain, the officials have concluded that quantities are adequate: the real
problem is equipment at every stage. Many warehouses are inefficient or have
no freezing facilities, transport is ageing, roads are deteriorating. In the
food plants, production lines are subject to constant breakdown and the
shops are often primitive.
This is strongly supported by the experience of consultants from Arthur
Andersen, now concluding a study of bread supply in Moscow. The team, led in
Moscow by Mr Stephen Zatland, has concluded that the supply of grain and
flour is sufficient (though increasingly the grain in the silos comes from
abroad, bought by western credits): the real problem lies in the bread
factories.
Says Mr Zatland: 'The engineers in these factories are the heroes. It's
incredible how they keep machines going which sometimes date from the 1920s.
But if one of them broke down (there are 24 bread plants in Moscow, with an
average of about 120 tonnes a day output), it would be hard to make up its
supply to the shops it serves because everything is stretched so thin.'
But the key recommendation in the Arthur Andersen report - besides the need
to phase a move to market relations in the sector - is: put the bread in
bags. Mr Zatland says: 'This one thing would greatly improve the situation.
At present, a loaf's life is 16 hours. A plastic bag could prolong it to
three days. It would mean the shops had constant supplies, the bread
fresher, the queues shorter, the waste much less.'
In this instance, investment in packaging (a tiny sector in the CIS states)
would save millions and ensure adequate supply of the staple food. Said one
of the aid officials: 'If I had one tenth of the money being spent on aid, I
would know exactly how to spend it to make sure aid wasn't needed.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / US pledge on role in Europe's defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday assured Britain that its military commitment to Europe's
defence would not be affected by disagreements with the European Community
in the Gatt trade liberalisation talks.
Both President George Bush in Washington and Vice-President Dan Quayle, who
had talks in London yesterday with British leaders, stressed there was no
connection between the issues.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said after dinner last night with Mr
Quayle that they had discussed the 'absolutely imperative importance in
making sure the round is completed and completed successfully and as
speedily as possible'.
The confusion about US policy arose out of remarks made by Mr Quayle in
Munich last weekend, when he appeared to establish some kind of linkage
between the Gatt talks and the US military presence in Europe. He later
denied that had been his intention.
In talks yesterday with Mr Douglas Hurd he left the British foreign
secretary in no doubt about the strength of the US military commitment, but
officials declined to say how large it would be. The US is widely believed
to be planning to cut its troop strength to below 100,000.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Lloyd's Names win payout of Pounds 116m in Outhwaite case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A GROUP of Names
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's of London - won
a Pounds 116m settlement in the Outhwaite case yesterday, ending the biggest
of a number of legal actions rocking the insurance market.
The out-of-court settlement, which includes Pounds 2m for legal costs, will
give a major psychological boost to more than 1,000 other Lloyd's Names who
are also involved in legal action against either their agents or the Lloyd's
corporation.
The 987 Names party to the action, including Mr Edward Heath, the former
prime minister, and Mr Tony Jacklin, the golfer, will recover over 90 per
cent of money paid out to date in claims.
The deal was described by Mr Peter Nutting, the leader of the Outhwaite 1982
Names Association, as a 'thoroughly satisfactory outcome to a long and
difficult road'.
The settlement is subject to ratification by all parties involved but is
expected to be approved.
The Names were among 1,614 members of syndicate 317/661 in 1982, which ran
up total losses of more than Pounds 200m as a result of a decision by Mr
Richard Outhwaite to underwrite 32 reinsurance contracts.
Under the contracts he assumed the exposure of other insurers, most of them
Lloyd's syndicates, to US liability business.
Mr Outhwaite's agency, RHM Outhwaite Underwriting, is among the 81 Lloyd's
agents named in the suit. Agents handle the affairs of Names and manage
syndicates.
In the mid-1980s claims from these reinsurance policies climbed at an
unexpectedly rapid rate as a result of court awards to victims of asbestosis
in the US, producing devastating losses for Names.
Syndicate 317/661 is continuing to pay claims emerging from the business
underwritten by Mr Outhwaite and has been unable to complete its accounts
for the 1982 underwriting year.
Future claims are not covered by the settlement, although Mr Nutting says
the Names Association is negotiating an arrangement for the future which
would limit Names' losses.
No liability had been admitted by either party. In their action the Names
alleged that the 81 agents were guilty of negligence and breach of contract.
Hearings, which began in October, lasted for 49 days before Mr Justice
Saville adjourned proceedings on February 3. Negotiations between the
parties were stepped up last week.
The bulk of the settlement will be financed by the errors and omissions
insurers of the 81 agents. These insurers cover agents against legal awards
for negligence. Their involvement in effect recirculates the losses among a
wider group of Names in the Lloyd's market.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Bank damps hopes for lower interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK AUTHORITIES showed no sign of seeking an early cut in interest rates
yesterday despite a sharp fall in inflationary pressures last month and an
admission from the Bank of England that the economy is still in recession.
The Bank's admission in its latest quarterly bulletin contrasts with its
view in November that the economy was recovering. Mr John Smith, shadow
chancellor, seized on this, saying it showed the government's talk of
recovery was 'competely bogus'.
In the Bank's bleak assessment of the economy, inflation was singled out as
one of the few positive developments.
Official figures showed that core inflation, as measured by the price of
manufactured goods at the factory gate, fell from 4.9 per cent in the 12
months to December to 4.5 per cent in January, the lowest level for 3 1/2
years.
The Bank provided the money market with only a small part of its liquidity
needs yesterday, signalling its belief that recent market enthusiasm for a
rate cut from 10.5 per cent has been exaggerated.
In its bulletin, the Bank also drew attention to the difficulties of easing
monetary policy while tensions exist in the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System, in which sterling remains the weakest currency.
While factory gate prices rose quite sharply between December and January,
the latest figures from the Central Statistical Office confirmed the
downward trend which began in the middle of last year.
Last month the price index of all manufactured products rose by 0.7 per cent
compared with a 0.1 per cent monthly increase in December.
The CSO said price increases in January tended to be relatively high as
manufacturers introduced new product price lists. Stripping out the volatile
prices of food, drink and tobacco, core inflation fell to 3.1 per cent in
the 12 months to January - the lowest since August 1969 - and less than half
its high of 6.4 per cent in February 1991.
Bank of England calculations, which take the monthly variations in the index
to produce a three-month moving average, show that output price inflation
was running at an annual rate of just over 2 per cent in the latest three
months.
Last month the cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry
rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.2 per cent against the previous month, after
a 0.9 per cent drop in December.
This left the price index of these materials down 1.1 per cent on the year.
The fall in producer prices was welcomed by the Treasury, which described
the figures as 'excellent news'.
The government believes the fall should feed into lower underlying retail
price inflation and provide the platform for higher business investment and
a recovery later this year.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Major reopens talks on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR succeeded last night in using a meeting he had called on
Northern Ireland security to resuscitate his government's efforts to open
round-table talks on the province's political future.
Unionist and nationalist leaders agreed to discuss how obstacles to formal
talks - which had been postponed until after the general election - could be
overcome.
The outcome of nearly two hours of talks was described by Downing Street as
a 'modest but significant breakthrough'. However, the agreement was in
effect no more than a promise to 'talk about talks', with little to suggest
they would be more successful than past efforts to start formal negotiations
by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary.
Mr Major called the meeting - the first for sixteen years between a prime
minister and all Northern Ireland's political parties - because of the
escalation in terrorist violence in the province. He also appeared swayed by
claims that by putting political talks into abeyance, the government was
creating a political vacuum which could be exploited by terrorists.
The Downing Street meeting came only hours after police found a terrorist
device in a telephone box in nearby Parliament Street. Police sealed off
Whitehall after a telephone warning.
A senior official said the meeting 'needed to make progress to show that
politics can work'. The prime minister has also agreed to meet soon with Mr
Albert Reynolds, the new Irish prime minister.
Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders,
appeared impressed at Mr Major's personal intervention, even though only a
part of the meeting was devoted to their concerns on security. Downing
Street said internment - one of the Ulster Unionists' main demands - was not
discussed.
Mr Molyneaux described Mr Major's role as an 'enormous help'. Mr John Hume,
leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, said the talks
were 'positive'. The leaders were also unanimous in deploring both loyalist
and republican terrorism.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Guinness trial collapses: Judge urges radical solution to
problems of serious fraud cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, ROBERT RICE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND Guinness trial collapsed yesterday with calls for a radical
solution to the problems of long fraud cases and widespread concern in the
House of Commons about the cost to the taxpayer.
Mr Justice Henry, the judge in all four trials arising out of the 1986
Guinness takeover of Distillers, discharged the jury because of serious
concern over the mental and emotional health of Mr Roger Seelig, former
merchant banker.
He told the jury: 'Once again this case has thrown up the problems of long
criminal trials and the appropriateness of our criminal justice system -
whose rules were designed to cater for short trials and simple facts - to
such long and complex trials.
'It seems to me inevitable that we must find a cheaper and quicker way to
deal with serious fraud trials, and the likelihood is we shall need a
radical solution rather than merely tinkering with procedures.'
On Friday the Serious Fraud Office announced it had dropped charges against
Mr Seelig and Mr David Mayhew, a partner in broker Cazenove, who were to
have stood trial in the third Guinness case.
The jury at Southwark Crown Court heard that the strain on Mr Seelig had
reached a point where 'it is no longer possible for him to conduct his
defence adequately'.
The view of two psychiatrists was that continuation might lead to Mr Seelig
'doing something irrevocable'. In the circumstances it would not be right to
continue the trial against Lord Spens, Mr Seelig's co-defendant, the judge
said.
He said the SFO could have a week in which to consider its position in
relation to the case. It is almost inconceivable that Mr Seelig will be
required to face another trial. The position of Lord Spens is more doubtful.
Mr Justice Henry's call for changes in criminal trial procedures was echoed
by Lord Roskill, the former Law Lord who chaired the 1986 inquiry into fraud
trials.
Lord Roskill said the government had been wrong to ignore his advice that
complex and lengthy fraud cases were unsuitable for jury trial. He believed
such cases should be tried instead by a special tribunal comprising a judge
and two lay members with experience of business and finance.
The Blue Arrow case, in which verdicts on the remaining five defendants are
imminent, is likely to be subjected to a critical post mortem.
News of the collapse of the second Guinness trial brought concern from both
sides of the Commons about the costs of the case, and Labour calls for a
review of the way serious fraud cases are handled.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman, said the trial represented
'an appalling waste of public money'. It was, she said, no good just blaming
the SFO. There had to be 'a review of the law to include civil as well as
criminal penalties in frauds of this size'.
'Guinness was a major financial scandal, and for this to be the outcome
makes a mockery of dealing with fraud in the City of London,' she said,
calling on Mr John Redwood, the corporate affairs minister, to make a
statement.
Mr Kenneth Warren, the Tory chairman of the all-party committee on trade and
industry, described it as 'a ridiculously appalling waste of time and
money'.
'I trust that now the lessons learnt from these cases and the experience of
the regulatory organisations will provide security against such problems
arising,' he said.
The climax of prosecutions arising from three big City scandals of the 1980s
have resulted in mixed fortunes for the SFO. The 10-year sentence imposed on
Mr Peter Clowes in the Barlow Clowes trial is the one unambiguous feather in
the SFO's cap.
Mr Seelig, a former Morgan Grenfell corporate finance director, and Lord
Spens, former corporate finance managing director at the Henry Ansbacher
merchant bank, denied fraud and false accounting charges arising from a
share support operation mounted by Guinness during its Pounds 2.7bn takeover
of Distillers in 1986.
Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief who served 10 months in jail
over the Guinness affair, said yesterday that in the light of what had
happened in the second and third trials he would discuss with his lawyers
'what steps can be taken to help me establish my innocence'.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Appointments: Ling moves along
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Ling, who led the growth by acquisition of Haden MacLellan Holdings,
has stepped back into the role of non-executive chairman.
The change in his status at the industrial holding company is accompanied by
the promotion of his long-time partner Mel Hawley from managing director to
chief executive.
Ling, 45, says he had been kept busy when the company was being built up,
'but I have not been that involved in actually running it. Mel has been
doing that anyway.'
As the transactions had thinned out, he had taken on more outside interests.
These included non-executive directorships at P-E International, Emess and
Ibstock Johnsen, as well as investments in small private businesses.
He and Hawley first teamed up in 1982 at London and Midland Industrials. LMI
was taken over by Williams Holdings, but Ling bought back some of its
subsidiaries. Haden MacLellan was formed in October 1987 with the merger of
Haden and Haleworth with the quoted P&amp;W MacLellan.
The 1987 crash roughly halved the share price but it then rose for two
years, to a high of 257p. The waning of the share price - down to 107 1/2 p
last night - has limited the scope for acquisitions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the wake of management changes set in train by the imminent departure of
Sir Roland Smith as chairman of Senior Engineering, David Cotterill, a
director and divisional chief executive, is leaving to head Renold, the
Manchester-based chain-maker.
Cotterill, 48, has been in charge of the construction services and mining
equipment divisions, the former generally regarded as one of Senior's best
operations. But as a consequence of Don McFarlane's move to fill Smith's
spot in May, another divisional chief, John Bell, head of engineering
products, rises to group managing director.
Renold, whose order book has been severely dented by the recession, says
that the departure of Trevor Grice, who came in as chief executive in 1987,
is unconnected with recent losses. It had been clear that Grice, 51, who
lives on the other side of the Pennines and adds a 140-mile drive to a long
day in the office, did not intend to do the job for more than five years.
Before going to Senior, Cotterill had been managing director of Fenner
International; this gave him specific experience in power transmission,
Renold's speciality.

and a workforce of 180 making hygiene products for the catering, industrial
and healthcare markets. Pal's success and sterling work in the CBI's East
Midland region have propelled Brucciani, aged 46, into the post of chairman
of the CBI's Smaller Firms Council.
This is an important job because it helps establish the CBI's credentials as
a representative of small business - though many outsiders find it hard to
believe that the organisation's big company members, who pay most of its
bills, do not still call the shots.
Brucciani, whose grand-father came to England in the 1860s, says he did not
leave the family firm because of a disagreement but because he realised
retailing was not for him. He quickly moved Pal into manufacturing and has
fac-tories in Malta, Paris and Burnley as well as his headquarters in Oadby,
Leicestershire. Pal has come through the recession well, meeting its 20 per
cent annual profit growth target; this is because 45 per cent of sales are
overseas and because food processing hygiene is an expanding market,
Brucciani says.
He believes the British do themselves down when they say they are not good
at manufacturing; they are actually quite good but don't encourage their
best people to go into it.
A keen amateur pilot and 'unskilled' but enthusiastic violin player,
Brucciani has two years in which to put his message across.

UNCERTAINTY over the prospect of a fall in UK interest rates unsettled stock
index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened firmly at 2,570, the March contract soon retreated as
independent traders who had taken on long positions overnight led the
selling activity. The contract had fallen to 2,551 by mid-morning.
The release of wholesale price inflation figures in line with analysts'
forecasts briefly curtailed March's downward direction and in fact produced
a brief rally. However, selling pressure returned and was only eased later
in the afternoon by a firm Wall Street. But this did not last.
March closed at 2,550, around three points above the estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 10.
In traded options, turnover reached a meagre 17,173 contracts. British
Airways, which produced better than expected results, was the busiest stock
option. It traded 2,970 lots, with the July 260 calls the busiest series.
This was followed by British Aerospace with a day's total of 2,250. The May
330 calls were particularly active. Hanson was the third busiest stock
option, trading 1,030 contracts. BTR and Lonrho were also active.

FT  12 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: No damages for late pay-out
</HEADLINE>

ITALIA EXPRESS
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: February 6 1992
AN ASSURED under a fixed-value marine insurance policy is entitled to
recover only up to that value for loss of the vessel; and where payment is
delayed he is entitled to interest, but cannot claim unliquidated damages
for loss of income or increase in capital value which would have been earned
by a replacement vessel, or for hardship, inconvenience and mental distress.
Mr Justice Hirst so held when dismissing a claim by the assured, Mr
Apostolos Konstantine Ventouris, for damages for delayed payment of an
insurance claim by Lloyd's underwriters, represented by the defendant, Mr
Trevor Rex Mountain, in respect of the sinking of the Italia Express. It was
held that claims for expenses arising out of the sinking were covered by the
policy.
HIS LORDSHIP said that Mr Ventouris claimed against the underwriters under a
War Risks insurance policy in respect of Italia Express.
The vessel had been given to Mr Ventouris in January 1988. Two months later,
on March 24 1988, she was sunk by explosives at Drapestona, outside Piraeus
harbour.
Four days after the sinking, Mr Ventouris served notice of abandonment on
the underwriters, and demanded Dollars 4m for total loss.
The underwriters did not dispute that the loss fell within one of the
insured perils. Their sole defence was that the loss was caused by Mr
Ventouris's wilful misconduct.
On the 37th day of the trial the underwriters withdrew those allegations,
and submitted to judgment on liability. The very serious charges against Mr
Ventouris thus disappeared and he was vindicated. He left the court without
a stain on his character. Judgment was entered in his favour on December 19
1991 in the sum of Dollars 4m, which was the insured value of the vessel,
and Dollars 1.61m interest was awarded.
The present issues related to damages claimed by Mr Ventouris.
First, he claimed special or general damages for (a) loss of income which
would have been earned by a replacement vessel; (b) loss of increase in
capital value of a replacement vessel; and (c) damages for hardship,
inconvenience and mental distress.
The underwriters contended that such damages were irrecoverable in
principle, and that those claimed under (c) were in any event not
sustainable.
It was common ground that a contract of insurance was an agreement by the
underwriter to hold the insured harmless against loss or damage from the
insured peril, and that the remedy for breach was in damages, not debt (The
Fanti (1991) 2 AC 1).
Mr Tomlinson for Mr Ventouris submitted that the underwriters' primary
obligation was to indemnify him to hold him harmless against the loss, and
if the Dollars 4m was not paid immediately following demand for payment,
then at that stage the underwriter was in breach of contract and his
secondary obligation came into being to pay damages at large, not limited to
the Dollars 4m indemnity.
Mr Clarke for the underwriters submitted that the underwriters' agreement to
hold the assured harmless was broken the moment he suffered loss from the
insured peril. Therefore, he said, the assured had a right of action the
moment the loss occurred, no prior demand was necessary, and no separate
subsequent breach was constituted by failure to respond to demand.
Section 67 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 provided that '(1)The sum which
the assured can recover . . .to the full extent of the insurable value . . .
is called the measure of indemnity.' Section 68 provided that where there
was total loss '(1) If the policy be a valued policy, the measure of
indemnity is the sum affixed by the policy'.
In The Fanti Lord Goff rejected the proposition that a condition of prior
payment was, at Common Law, implicit in a contract of indemnity.
In Irving v Manning (1847) 1 HLC 287 Mr Justice Patteson said a policy of
assurance was not a perfect contract of indemnity, in that 'the parties may
agree beforehand in estimating the value of the subject assured, by way of
liquidated damages'.
In Chandris v Argo Insurance (1963) 2 Lloyd's Rep 65 Mr Justice Megaw said
that in the absence of special contractual provisions, an assured could
bring his action without alleging that demand for payment had been made on
the insurer. He held that the cause of action arose when the loss occurred.
In India v Lips Maritime (1988) AC 395 Lord Brandon said: 'There is no such
thing as a cause of action in damages for late payment of damages.'
Section 67 of the Act together with section 68 in total loss cases, was
conclusively definitive of the extent of the insurer's liability for loss of
the vessel under a valued policy.
That in itself was sufficient to defeat Mr Tomlinson's argument in marine
insurance cases.
While Fanti was a liability insurance case, Lord Goff's statement of the law
was of general application, extending to property insurance cases also. The
two classes of insurance were not different in their essential character,
namely that once the loss was suffered, the indemnifier was in breach of
contract for having failed to hold the indemnified person harmless.
In Irving v Manning the judges meant precisely what they said. Chandris also
seriously undermined Mr Tomlinson's argument since, if he were right, a
demand would always be a necessary prerequisite in property insurance cases
for the cause of action to arise.
As a matter of law, Mr Ventouris's claim for loss of the vessel under the
policy was limited to the value fixed by the policy, namely Dollars 4m. He
was not entitled to any additional special or general damages.
The claim was a claim for damages for late payment of damages, contrary to
the principle in Lips.
As to the claim for hardship, inconvenience and mental stress, there could
be little doubt that Mr Ventouris had suffered very serious hardship,
inconvenience and mental distress, as a result of the underwriters' refusal
over nearly four years to make payment under the policy, and in consequence
of the defence against him. He had suffered, not least, a spell of several
weeks imprisonment under very unpleasant conditions in Greece.
However, it was well-settled that such damages in contract were only
recoverable in the case of a contract to provide peace of mind or freedom
from distress.
A marine insurance contract was not of that character, not only because of
the very nature of the contract itself (to provide financial indemnity for
commercial loss), but also because in the vast majority of contracts the
assured was a company which could never invoke the 'peace of mind' test.
The claim under subparagraph (c) would therefore have been rejected on that
further ground.
Second, Mr Ventouris claimed indemnity in respect of a number of
liabilities, costs and expenses arising in relation to the sinking of the
vessel.
Under the Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;I) clause in the policy the insurance
covered any P&amp;I claims 'as would be paid under the entry of the insured
vessel with any insurer scheduled hereto'. And in the event of there being
no club entry, 'the vessel shall be deemed entered' for all P&amp;I risks with
the Britannia Steam-Ship Insurance Association (BSIA).
The vessel was entered with the British Marine Mutual Insurance Association
(BMM), but that was not recorded on the schedule.
Mr Tomlinson submitted that the club with which the vessel was actually
entered applied. Mr Popplewell submitted that in the absence of insertion in
the schedule, the applicable club was the Britannia.
In the P&amp;I clause, 'entry' of the vessel was a matter of established fact;
insertion of the insurer on the schedule was no more than an administrative
requirement.
As a matter of construction, the applicable P&amp;I club under the P&amp;I clause,
was that with which the assured was in fact entered,ie BMM.
Under BMM Rules, Mr Ventouris would be entitled to recover for wreck charges
if properly levied by the Piraeus Port Authority, and for wreck removal. A
'pay to be paid' clause in the Rules was not incorporated in the P&amp;I clause,
in that the purpose of the P&amp;I clause was to define and delineate the risks
covered.
Had the Britannia Rules applied there would have been no bar to a claim and
again, Mr Ventouris would have come within their scope.
For the underwriters: Christopher Clarke QC and Andrew Popplewell (Ince &amp;
Co).
For Mr Ventouris: Stephen Tomlinson QC and Stephen Hofmeyr (Hill Taylor
Dickinson).

FT  12 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Foreign capital flows into Brazil on
inflation hopes - For the second consecutive month this emerging market is
the best performer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Optimism about inflation and hopes that the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) would approve a Dollars 2.1bn standby facility made Brazil the best
performing emerging market in January for the second month in a row,
according to indices published by the International Finance Corporation
(IFC), part of the World Bank.
Brazil rose 37.6 per cent in dollar terms last month, compared with a 44.9
per cent advance in December. Ms Else Derrick, head analyst for Latin
America at London-based investment managers Latin American Securities, says
that no less than Dollars 122m of foreign capital flowed into the Brazilian
stock market in the first few days of January and that average daily
turnover topped Dollars 100m during the whole month.
According to the dollar-adjusted Bovespa index, the market came off the
month's high on profit-taking on the news that the IMF had signed the
proposal for Brazil. By January 28, the day of the IMF approval, the local
index had climbed 64 per cent; but it closed the month with a 47.8 per cent
gain.
Ms Derrick says the market has been losing ground in February, and that
average daily volume has halved to around Dollars 50m. However, the outlook
for the market is still favourable. Equities have been supported by
President Fernando Collor de Mello's recent decision to appoint three
members of the liberal PSL party as his ministers, thus strengthening his
power base in congress.
Furthermore, the government's tight monetary policy and forecasts of a good
harvest this year make it plausible that inflation will be in single figures
by the end of the year, compared with an estimated 25 per cent in January.
However, Ms Derrick believes that the government's forecast of 2 per cent
inflation in its letter of intent to the IMF is too optimistic. Investors
are also hoping for good news from this month's negotiations with the Paris
club grouping of creditor governments.
The worst performer was Pakistan, which fell by 13.4 per cent in dollar
terms, partly eroding December's 30.4 per cent record-breaking advance.
Karachi fell steadily last month on news of unrest in the southern province
of Sind, and continues to weaken.
Rumours of a build-up of troops on the border last week interrupted India's
recent rise to new peaks. According to the IFC, India rose by 20.6 per cent
in January in dollar terms.
The only other faller on the month was Portugal, down 6.8 per cent in spite
of the government's attempts to make the market more attractive.

FT  12 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong loses ground on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Tokyo closed, sentiment around the Pacific Rim was mixed yesterday,
with profit-taking and consolidation leading a number of the markets off
recent highs.
HONG KONG lost ground on profit taking: the Hang Seng index closed 59.04
down at 4,674.52 in turnover of HKDollars 2.4bn (HKDollars 2.87bn). Strong
activity in the covered warrant market continued: on Monday it accounted for
some 20 per cent of market turnover.
Two stocks which bucked the downward trend were Hong Hong &amp; China Gas and
Swire Pacific, both gaining 20 cents to HKDollars 12.60 and HKDollars 25.80
respectively. The property sector declined: Cheung Kong was down 40 cents at
HKDollars 21.30.
AUSTRALIA reversed recent losses, with the All Ordinaries index putting on
20.6 or 1.3 per cent to 1,615.5. Turnover was ADollars 341m (ADollars 245m).
News Corp, expected to announce good interim profits tomorrow, rose 18 cents
to ADollars 15.78. Analysts are forecasting half-year profits to December of
between ADollars 220m and ADollars 250m following a reduction in the group's
interest bill and improved operating costs.
There was strong interest in the mining sector, with Western Mining up 27
cents to ADollars 4.89 on rumours of stake-building in the company. BHP
advanced 20 cents to ADollars 13.52.
NEW ZEALAND firmed, with the NZSE-40 index moving ahead 9.62 to 1,467.92 in
turnover of some NZDollars 26m. Telecom put on 6 cents to NZDollars 2.36 but
Fletcher Challenge shed 2 cents to NZDollars 3.42.
TAIWAN fell for the fourth consecutive day, the weighted index ending 132.51
or 2.6 per cent lower at 5,072.04 in turnover of TDollars 47.4bn. All
sectors were affected, with investors concerned at reports that the
government might increase the capital gains tax on property.
SINGAPORE slipped back on profit-taking as investors turned their attention
to Malaysia. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 2.50 to 1,523.92 in
volume of 56.4m shares (69.1m). The hotel and property sector saw most
gains.
KUALA LUMPUR rose in late trading, the composite index closing 1.10 up at
604.45. Volume declined to 91.6m shares from 95m. Resorts World dipped 20
cents to MDollars 11.30 and Malaysian International Shipping shed 15 cents
to MDollars 9.00. Kedah Cement was the most actively traded stock and rose
15 cents to MDollars 2.90.
MANILA fell in quiet trading, although brokers said the market could move
ahead again following the International Monetary Fund's approval of the
government's economic programme. The composite index was off 21.74 at
1,212.79.
SEOUL retreated sharply on profit-taking. The composite index lost 12.86 to
674.32, the first time below 680 for two weeks. Analysts said concern that
small companies were facing financial problems was driving the market down.
JAKARTA was easier on profit-taking and a feeling that the time had come to
consolidate. The Jardine Fleming index slipped 1.03 to 63.94. Banks were
actively traded.
BANGKOK was boosted by activity in property shares, trading in Bangkok Land
and Krisda Mahanakorn accounting for some 40 per cent of turnover. The SET
index climbed 6.65 to 786.91.

FT  12 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses take their cue
from a variety of sources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses moved for a variety of reasons yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff. Special situations in Paris vied with sector analysis in Frankfurt
and Amsterdam, interest rate hopes in Zurich and Madrid and sheer relief in
Stockholm.
PARIS saw some volatility, but a slightly easier close, the CAC 40 index
losing 1.49 to 1,864.06 in relatively light turnover of FFr1.8bn.
Perrier continued to advance on continued hopes of a counterbid. Dealers
reported big buyers but only small amounts of stock on offer, which drove
the price up by FFr29 to FFr1,530 with 67,100 shares traded, less than half
the volume seen on Monday. Other gainers included Pechiney CI's which rose
FFr11 or 3.8 per cent to FFr301 with 104,000 units exchanged on 1991
turnover in line with expectations.
Dealers also reported big turnover in Esso, the subsidiary of Exxon Corp,
which jumped FFr23 or 3.4 per cent after a newsletter reported that Saudi
Arabia's state oil company, Saudi Aramco, was in talks with Exxon for a
stake in its European oil refining and marketing operations. But some
analysts said the Saudi story sounded unlikely and attributed the rise to
hopes of an increase in the 1991 dividend from FFr25 to FFr40.
Eurotunnel slumped FFr1.85 or 4 per cent to FFr44 with 2.2m shares traded in
a delayed reaction to Monday's news of a delay in the tunnel's opening.
FRANKFURT moved chemicals after a shift of recommended weightings within the
sector by Deutsche Bank Research.
DBR took Bayer, traditionally highly priced, down from overweight to
underweight and the shares fell DM2.90 to DM302.70. BASF, up DM1.50 to
DM248.50, was moved from underweight to neutral, and Hoechst (up DM1.70 to
DM253.80) from underweight to overweight. DBR added, however, that it
expects Bayer to hold its DM13 a share dividend, and those from BASF and
Hoechst to be cut, each by DM2 a share, to DM11 for 1991. Hopes of
maintained dividends all round were advanced as the reason why the whole
sector rose on Monday.
Otherwise, the market was mired in a narrow trading range, the FAZ index
rising 2.19 to 688.72 at midsession and the DAX only 1.42 to 1,683.55 as
volume rose from DM4.5bn to DM5.4bn.
AMSTERDAM rose marginally, the CBS Tendency Index up 0.6 at 121.9. KLM
gained on the back of strong British Airways third quarter results: it rose
Fl 1.30 to Fl 39.20 with foreign buying evident. ING, the insurer, fell Fl
0.60 to Fl 51.10 after news that it was looking at cooperation with the
Belgian Banque Bruxelles Lambert rather than stakebuilding.
The trading group, Borsumij, put on Fl 4.70, or 8 per cent to Fl 62.70 after
indicating a 70 per cent fall in 1991 net profits on Monday. News that the
group had been released from a distribution contract for the Benelux and
that a new interim management was in place boosted the shares.
KBB put on Fl 4.00, or 5.7 per cent, to Fl 73.00: investors took a positive
view on the reorganisation of its Hema division.
ZURICH ended an active session ahead on easier short-term interest rates and
a firmer Swiss bond market. The all-share SPI index rose 6.7 to 1,127.1. The
average yield on Swiss government bonds has fallen to 6.01 per cent from
6.20 per cent at the end of January, but dealers said yesterday that some
investors were now switching funds from money market and bonds into shares.
STOCKHOLM reacted favourably to Ericsson's 1991 result, despite a 67 per
cent drop in pre-tax profit. Having discounted the worst earlier, Ericsson B
closed SKr2 higher at SKr117 after peaking at SKr123, in turnover of SKr98m.
The Affarsvarlden General index put on 3.5 to 957.4 in turnover of SKr405m.
Meanwhile Astra, the pharmaceutical company, saw its restricted A shares
rise SKr4 to a new all-time-high of SKr559 after a London note on its
relative attractions compared with Glaxo.
MADRID firmed with interest rate speculation and a more positive feeling
over tomorrow's January inflation figures helping to boost the market: the
general index closed up 2.90 at 259.04. Construction was active, analysts
commenting that local investors were probably looking for short-term
profits.
MILAN was marginally easier in dull trading with dealers reporting little
activity ahead of the monthly options expiry today, apart from some selling
in Ifil savings shares which lost L33 to L2,825. The Comit index fell 0.74
to 541.21 in turnover estimated at less than Monday's L79bn.
Among leading industrials. Fiat fell L5 to L4,975 while Olivetti rose L76 or
2.7 per cent to L2,816 in technical trading. Burgo, the paper stock,
continued to weaken, losing 1.9 per cent or L175 to L8,715.
BRUSSELS saw the electronics stock Barco rise FFr30 to FFr1,136 in unusually
heavy volume of 30,800 shares. The Bel-20 index closed down 0.60 at
1,163.96.
HELSINKI's Hex index hit a new closing high for the year, closing 7.10
higher at 895.07 after two major companies reported 1991 results, and
interest rates fell.
Kone reported profits down, but in line with expectations, and its free-B
shares rose FM15 to FM435. Enso closed unchanged; it was hit by exchange
rates and reported a higher than expected loss of FM950m.
VIENNA rose to its highest level in 1992 in a lively session. The 18-share
ATX index added 7.02 to 1,024.15.
ISTANBUL fell to its lowest level since the end of December, the index
closing off 275.83, or 6.2 per cent, to 4,182.96. The fall was attributed to
heavy selling due to a tight lira, as well as a delay in the preparation of
a government plan to develop the capital markets.

Tin ended near six-month highs on the LME, supported by the scarcity of
quality metal and tightness of April supplies. Brazil's recent absence as a
seller was underlined by the high Dollars 100-a-tonne premium being asked
for Mamore brand tin. Straits metal in Rotterdam was also steady, at a
Dollars 20 premium. Copper was lower for most of the day in London before
gains in New York helped the market to rally. Overall trading was subdued
due to a holiday in Japan and this week's industry event in New York. Nymex
platinum futures were slightly lower at midday, weighed down by early losses
tied to a decline in overseas prices. In Chicago wheat prices were plunging
by midday on thin commission house selling. Brisk buying buoyed wheat and
oat prices early but a slide in oats sparked swift selling in wheat as well,
traders said. 'The market was overdone,' one broker said of Monday's rally
which propelled wheat and corn contracts to new highs and lifted oats limit
up. New York's arabica coffee futures were modestly ahead at midday. News
that Colombian president Gaviria had urged Brazil's president Collor de
Mello to support an international coffee agreement had little effect on
trading, analysts said.

Thailand's sugar output in the first three months of the 1991-92
(November-May) cane crushing season rose 19 per cent from a year earlier,
according to the cane and sugar office of the industry ministry, reports
Reuter from Bangkok.
It said 45 of Thailand's 46 sugar mills processed 20.02m tonnes of sugar
cane between November 5 and January 31, compared with 16.82m tonnes from all
46 mills in the 1990-91 period.
The mills operating since November produced about 1.91m tonnes of sugar, up
from 1.45m tonnes.
The cane and sugar office said each tonne of cane yielded an average 95.33
kg of sugar in the current season, compared with 85.94 kg in 1990-91 a year
ago.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Counting the cost of cleaning
up - Andrew Fisher examines the progress being made in bringing eastern
Germany up to western environmental standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems like an almost impossible task. By the start of the next century,
Germany hopes to bring its economically ailing and underdeveloped eastern
states - now part of a united country for only 16 months - up to the
environmental standards of those in the west.
Some experts say it just cannot be done. Others are confident that the
necessary financial, industrial and political muscle will be brought to bear
on the problem and that east Germany will become an environmental showcase.
The end result is likely to be somewhere between the two. Germany's
unification treaty stresses the importance of raising environmental
standards in the east both to improve the quality of life and as part of the
whole economic reconstruction process. More than DM60m (Pounds 21m) has been
spent on studies alone to assess what needs to be done and what is feasible.
What the experts do not dispute is that the whole process will be extremely
costly; the Ifo economic research institute in Munich estimates around
DM200bn, though others go much higher. The old east Berlin government
treated the issue of pollution with notorious disdain, forbidding concerned
citizens to seek out the real facts. The environment was a taboo subject.
What was important was economic success and self-sufficiency in industrial
and energy production. 'Nature was exploited,' says Karl Eugen Huthmacher,
an environment ministry official.
Today, it is apparent that progress in clearing up east Germany's
environmental mess is being made. For anyone going to east Germany for the
first time after the border was opened in November 1989, one important
change is obvious - the air smells cleaner. Heavy use of lignite (brown
coal) for domestic and industrial power gave the air an unpleasant tang
which has now been lessened as the worst plants have been shut.
Improvements of this kind were inevitable as outdated industrial factories
were closed, either because they were dangerous or filthy or both, or
because they could not keep pace with the demands of the free market
economy. Emissions of noxious fumes have fallen dramatically, as has the
pollution of rivers and lakes by waste chemicals. 'The main successes have
come from economic restructuring rather than an active environmental
policy,' comments Huthmacher.
Two of the worst industries in pollution terms were chemicals and metal
processing. Bitterfeld, the town which housed one of east Germany's biggest
chemical complexes, became a byword for the industrial fouling of the land,
air, and water. The name symbolised east Germany's environmental ills all
too aptly; as well as the mouldering chemical plant, a factory producing
lignite briquettes also contributed to the stench and dirt.
Bitterfeld lies in the heart of the industrial complex between Leipzig and
Halle, both historic cities which suffered from the weight of industrial
development. Not far outside Leipzig is an opencast lignite mine, which
devastated a vast area of landscape as the coal was brutally scooped off the
ground by huge excavators. From the air, it looks like an arid moonscape
where life never existed.
Centred on Halle is a huge chemicals complex, which accounted for half of
east Germany's toxic waste and 30 per cent of its water and air pollution.
Slightly to the west is Eisleben, the headquarters of the Mansfeld metals
complex. Scattered around the countryside are big slag heaps. In the shadow
of one, near a collection of tumbledown outhouses where ducks waddle among
old pieces of machinery, is an arresting little reminder that western
standards are being introduced. In a neat row stand six containers - blue
for wastepaper, grey for cans, yellow for plastic, and white, green, and
brown for glass.
Ironically, notes Ifo, east Germany did specify the protection of nature in
its constitution, one of the few countries to do so. But it is only in the
past two years that environmental consciousness has been allowed to develop.
Because of past neglect, the clean-up job looks forbidding:
Air. East Germany had the worst air pollution in Europe, mainly because 80
per cent of electricity was produced by sulphur-rich brown coal. Power
plants had no filters. By 1996, the government's aim is to reduce sulphur
dioxide pollution by 4.2m tonnes a year and that of dust particles by 1.3m
tonnes. This will mostly be the job of the utility companies which are
investing heavily in the east. Nearly 280 large power plants will have to be
modernised.
In the state of Saxony-Anhalt, containing the bulk of the chemical industry,
sulphur dioxide emissions have been cut by 30 per cent and of dust by 40 per
cent, says Huthmacher. By 2005, the plan is to lower the amount of carbon
dioxide in east Germany's air by 40 per cent.
Water. With 45 per cent of rivers too heavily polluted for use as drinking
water and only 35 per cent capable of being brought into such use with
complex, expensive technology, the water problem is one of the most acute in
east Germany's environment. Industrial closures and modernisation have led
to a steep drop in the chemical pollution of the River Elbe, which flows
graciously through Dresden - its mercury content has been halved - but
further progress will be costly.
One disadvantage for east Germany is that its water lies at a lower average
level than in the west, thus putting it closer to the sources of pollution
and reducing its capacity for self-purification. Only 75 per cent of the 16m
population is connected to a sewage system and less than 60 per cent to
treatment plants. Several thousand miles of sewage pipeline will thus have
to be built to accord with west German standards.
In the lakes, only 1 per cent the water is suitable for drinking. Names like
Silver Lake, near Bitterfeld, and Sweet Lake, near Eisleben, belie the real
state of their contents. With its imposing shoreside castle, Sweet Lake was
an important tourist area under the old regime. But the lake has suffered
from sewage and heavy use of fertiliser. A study of the Mansfeld area
commissioned by the government described the water as being in 'an extremely
endangered state'.
Ground. Here, the problem encompasses contamination by industry, mining,
uncontrolled waste disposal on open dumps, and by troops, East German and
Soviet. Altogether, some 28,000 sites have been identified as possibly being
contaminated. Ifo reckons the clean-up cost could be DM10bn. This does not
include cases like the uranium mines and enrichment plants, agricultural
sites, brown coal pits which need recultivating, demolishing the closed
nuclear plant at Greifswald, or the 280,000 hectares which Soviet troops
occupied. These could cost an extra DM170bn.
At present, only the worst industrial sites are being cleared, partly in
preparation for new investment. To keep former employees busy, at least
temporarily, many are now helping clear the sites where they once worked.
Heinrich Bonnenberg, a director of the Treuhand privatisation agency, says
it will be impossible to spend as much as DM200bn for total soil
decontamination - 'these are fantasy figures'. The east German states, still
short of money, will only be able, with Bonn's help, to tackle areas of
highest priority.
Even when these have been identified, the task of cleaning up has to be
linked with new investment prospects, decisions on which industries or
sectors can survive and which must close, and local employment needs.
Investing companies do not want to be saddled with huge expenses caused by
past pollution. On the other hand, the government and the Treuhand want to
ensure that they bear at least some of the environmental costs.
Encouragingly, some of the most notorious regions have turned out to be not
as polluted as feared. In the Mansfeld metalworking area, for instance,
experts have discovered that ground pollution is confined mainly to the
smelting sites and has not infected nearby rivers and streams.
On the other hand, there is plenty to be done. High concentrations of
arsenic, cadmium, and zinc have been found near an old lead smelter. Helmut
Wopkemeier, the head of the Mansfeld group, says it could cost up to DM2bn
to remove the waste caused by copper mining and processing. Attracting new
investment is also proving hard.
The same is true at Bitterfeld, though Bayer, the west German chemicals
group, is among several companies moving into the area. As with Mansfeld,
the number of jobs that survive will be only a fraction of those employed at
the old East German kombinats (conglomerates). 'We are dealing with abstract
figures,' says Volkmar Kayser, also of the Treuhand, 'but the human and
social dimensions are enormous.' Among these are the state of the
environment. Here, at least, change in east Germany can only be for the
better.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Garbage guru wastes no time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Garbology is a curious-sounding academic discipline which the uninitiated
might think involves the study of Greta Garbo films. Unfortunately for its
adherents, garbology lurks at the other end of the glamour spectrum; it is
the knowledge of garbage.
Its proponents claim that much can be learned from the study of fresh
garbage, and Professor Bill Rathje, the field's leading expert, talks about
the topic with near-missionary zeal. Whenever more than three people gather
to talk about domestic waste, it seems, up pops Rathje to rail against the
popular misconceptions and regulatory ignorance that surrounds the topic.
A voluble American with greying hair and expressive eyebrows, Rathje has
become something of a fixture at environmental conferences amusing delegates
with tales of derring-do among the detritus of the modern world.
The author of several books on the subject - including Rubbish] and the
History of Garbage - Rathje takes his subject seriously. And his studies
serve a serious purpose. How can politicians regulate to reduce waste if
they do not know what it consists of, he asks.
Rathje and his team from the University of Arizona adopt a scientific
approach to their subject. They extract a vertical cross-section of a
garbage tip by use of an adapted drilling rig, sift and sort the waste and
evaluate its composition. They have unearthed some surprising discoveries.
'I am an archaeologist, which means I was trained to look at ancient
societies by looking at very old garbage. In 1973 I started looking at fresh
garbage. We can learn something new about ourselves,' he told a recent
conference.
Most people assume that garbage - or rubbish as it's known east of the
Atlantic - consists largely of fast food containers, packaging waste and
soiled nappies. People make a natural conceptual extrapolation that what
looms largest in their own garbage cans must represent the bulk of landfill
sites. Many believe polystyrene foam accounts for 25 to 40 per cent of all
waste.
Not so, according to Rathje. From his studies of 15 North American landfill
sites, he has found that all forms of disposable food packaging make up only
0.5 per cent of total waste. The vast bulk is accounted for by paper
products and construction waste.
Surprisingly, he suggests that it is wrong to see paper as a benign form of
waste. A common feature of landfill sites is that the sheer weight of the
garbage squeezes out the oxygen and water necessary for micro-organisms to
exist and prevents raw materials from degrading. As garbologists are fond of
observing: 'Biodegradability is the biggest myth since Santa Claus.'
The European Commission would perhaps do well to consider Rathje's
conclusions when framing the final draft of its packaging waste direc-tive.
His findings may do something to alleviate the pressure on the packaging
industry, which is unfairly regarded as one of the great scourges of the
modern 'throw-away' society.
But no one should underrate the scale of the waste problem. Rathje said that
when he was at school he learned that the biggest man-made structure in the
New World was the Temple of the Sun in Mexico, built around 2,000 years ago.
But he has since calculated that a single landfill site overlooking San
Francisco bay is almost five times as big.
In spite of his enthusiasm for his subject, Rathje accepts that a career in
garbology does have obvious drawbacks. He swears that you do not notice the
smell of a landfill site after 10 minutes of breathing in the fumes but
admits that the odour stays with you. 'I took my crew to a Pizza Hut for
lunch and cleared it out in five minutes. The manager came up to me and
said: 'For you guys we'll deliver'.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Activity muted as market awaits Ecu
sector deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issue activity continued at a slow pace in the international bond market
yesterday, although syndicate officials are expecting substantial deals in
the Ecu sector later this week.
The European Community is expected to raise Ecu490m later this week or early
next week to finance loans to eastern European countries. Many syndicate
managers are expecting the EC to re-open its Ecu190m seven-year issue,
launched by Warburg Securities last month.
In addition, Credit Foncier, the French public sector housing finance
agency, was thought to be considering a deal of up to Ecu500m at around the
10-year maturity.
Elsewhere, the launch of two high-yielding Australian dollar issues
underlined the sharp correction this sector of the market has seen this
year.
The ADollars 100m 10-year deals, by State Bank of South Australia and the
Victorian Public Financing Agency, both carried an 11 per cent coupon. At
the end of last year, bonds issued by borrowers of comparable credit quality
carried coupons of little more than 9 per cent.
The higher yields are attracting some of the retail buyers who deserted the
market last year when Australian interest rates and bond yields fell
sharply. The lead managers of yesterday's deals, Hambros and Merrill Lynch
respectively, reported buying from continental European banks with retail
clients and Far Eastern investors.
In addition to higher yields, many outstanding Australian dollar bonds are
coming up for redemption and investors are re-investing some of the
proceeds. Bonds worth around ADollars 2bn mature during this month and next.
However, the demand for Australian dollar debt securities remains much less
than in the recent past. The two deals launched almost simultaneously
yesterday proved too much for the market to digest at once.
Both deals traded down from issue price to stand at or around a discount
equivalent to full fees by the close.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: International stock trading
falls at LSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trading of international stocks in London fell last year from its peak
recorded in 1990, according to figures published yesterday by the London
Stock Exchange.
The value of overseas share transactions reported to the exchange during the
year was Pounds 275bn. This was down from the record Pounds 294bn of 1990.
Apart from foreign currency adjustments (all shares are traded in their
local currency), the decline reflects the fact that London's share of
international equity business may have peaked.
Greater competition from other financial centres, particularly in Europe,
has begun to stem the flow of business to the City, according to the
exchange's figures.
The UK domestic stock market, by contrast, had a better year in 1991.
Customer turnover (not including trades between market makers) rose by 14
per cent to Pounds 234bn.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Parliament approves Taurus
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL changes needed to bring in the UK's planned paperless settlement
system, Taurus, finally received parliamentary approval on Monday night, a
year after they were originally due to be adopted.
The completion of the legal process opens the way for British companies to
seek the support of their shareholders to 'dematerialise' - that is,
transfer their shares on to the new system. However, the timing of the
regulations means that it is too late for many of the British companies that
have annual meetings early this spring to seek shareholder support this
year.
The London Stock Exchange said it was talking to a number of companies which
it hoped would be in the first wave to move on to Taurus at its planned
launch in April 1993.
The law changes are necessary to reflect the way title to shares passes in a
paperless stock market, rather than under the existing system.
Amending company law proved far more complex than had been expected, and led
to substantial delays before draft regulations were able to be published
last summer. These met considerable opposition in the investment industry,
and were subsequently simplified before being put to Parliament.
Much of the detail contained in the original draft regulations is due to be
reproduced in a separate stock exchange rule book, expected to be published
in draft form in May. Mr Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange chairman, said this
would 'allow greater flexibility in the future than would have been possible
if everything had been contained within the regulations'.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Exchange stakes out fresh
index territory - The CME is expanding its list of index-related products in
an effort to become the world's top derivatives market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange, flush with success, is launching a new
product this week aimed at institutional investors and has plans to offer a
spectrum of index-related products.
The exchange, home to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index future, the world's
most widely traded stock index contract, last year traded a record 108m
contracts, up 5 per cent over 1990, while trading volumes declined at other
American futures and options exchanges.
The exchange will start trading tomorrow in the S &amp; P MidCap 400, the index
composed of 400 middle-capitalisation growth companies. The Commodity
Futures Trading Commission approved the contract yesterday.
The CME's launch will be co-ordinated with the American Stock Exchange,
which will trade the cash market options on the MidCap 400. This will expand
its business in foreign stock indices, which began in 1990 with the Nikkei
225.
Another possible addition, is a future on Germany's DAX index of 30 leading
companies. A memorandum of understanding has yet to be agreed between US and
German regulatory authorities.
These new products are part of the fresh territory being staked out by the
exchange. Mr William Brodsky, the CME president whose background is in the
securities industry, said: 'We hope to have a whole panoply of index
products.'
With the large and medium stock indices in hand, the CME's next goal is to
capture the rights to futures on the Russell 2,000 stock index, the most
followed index for small companies and one that has become popular with
institutional investors during the last year or so.
The average market capitalisation of Russell 2,000 companies is Dollars
100m.
Mr Brodsky and Mr John 'Jack' Sandner, who has been re-elected CME chairman
for the eighth time, believe that indices trading is the direction of the
markets, particularly for institutional investors.
'People who three to five years ago wouldn't even consider using stock index
futures are now using them,' said Mr Brodsky.
Pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors are
increasingly matching their holdings to the indices. Since it was launched
in mid-1991, the MidCap 400 has drawn Dollars 3bn in indexed assets.
The recent performance of the smaller indices is a big incentive. The MidCap
400 index increased in 1991 by 46.59 per cent, the Russell index by 43.68
per cent.
These rates are far ahead of the S &amp; P 500 index, composed of large
industrial companies, which rose by 26.31 per cent last year.
Besides stock index futures, the CME is looking at the new Goldman Sachs
commodity index, which begun last year and includes oil, wheat, metals and
soft commodities such as coffee and sugar, as the basis for a possible new
contract.
All this effervescence has a strategic point. The CME wants to position
itself as the world's leading derivatives exchange.
To do so, it is doggedly courting the institutional segment of the investing
community and it has taken aim in particular at managed futures funds, which
Mr Sandner estimates hold some Dollars 30bn. Managed futures 'will go the
way of mutual funds', says Mr Sandner. Currently, the net assets of US
mutual funds total Dollars 1,350bn.
To accommodate institutional investors the CME has taken or proposed several
new trading rules.
Last year, it put in place a large order execution rule, known as Lox,
comparable to the block trade rules at leading US stock exchanges. Under
this rule, a CME member wishing to buy or sell 300 or more S &amp; P 500 futures
can, in essence, pre-arrange the trade off the trading floor.
Mr Sandner wants to expand the rule to the exchange's rapidly expanding
currency futures business, where EuroYen and EuroMark contracts are under
consideration.
To further facilitate large orders, the exchange recently won approval from
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator, to
lift position limits on its EuroDollar and leading currency futures and
futures options.
It has also proposed an average pricing system for large orders. Under such
a system, CME members can provide such big investors an average price for a
single order or series of orders executed at different prices. The proposal
is awaiting CFTC approval.
The exchange plans to bring into use an extra trading floor to cope with the
new business. The current floor has become so overcrowded that vertical
boxes have been built so that brokers and traders can better see what's
happening amid the mass of people in the pits.

Subject to approval by Swedish and Japanese authorities, the Tokyo branch is
expected to commence activities during the second half of 1992, it said.
Initially, the branch will focus mainly on foreign exchange and money and
capital market transactions, the bank said.
S-E Banken has had a representative office in the Japanese capital since

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Horsham earnings advance to
Dollars 61m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HORSHAM Corp, the gold, petroleum and real estate holding company controlled
by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk, lifted net earnings to USDollars
61.4m, or 68 cents a share, last year, from Dollars 58.2m, or 66 cents a
share, a year earlier.
The increase was due to a 53 per cent jump in the contribution of American
Barrick, the gold producer in which Horsham has a 20 per cent stake.
Barrick contributed Dollars 18.4m in earnings as well as a fourth-quarter
dilution gain of Dollars 15.5m stemming from a public issue of shares at a
price above Horsham's carrying value. A similar dilution gain of Dollars
17.6m was posted during 1990.
Horsham also has a 60 per cent stake in Clark Oil &amp; Refining, a St
Louis-based petroleum refiner and distributor. Clark contributed Dollars 23m
to Horsham last year, down from Dollars 27.7m in 1990.
The fall was due to a maintenance programme at one refinery as well as
slimmer retail margins.
Horsham bought 195 hectares of undeveloped land on the outskirts of Berlin
last September, which it plans to develop into a commercial and shopping
centre.
A company official said yesterday that the project was still in the planning
stage, but that the aim was to start construction by the end of the year.
The spokesman added that Horsham was also looking at other properties in the
Berlin area.
DONOHUE, the Quebec newsprint producer, had a final fourth-quarter loss of
CDollars 38.5m, or CDollars 1.20 a share, including special charges,
compared with a profit of CDollars 7.9m, or 24 cents a share, a year
earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Sales fell to CDollars 110m from CDollars 155m last time because of lower
pulp and newsprint shipments and weak prices.
For all 1991, Donohue's loss was CDollars 58m, or CDollars 1.82 a share,
against a profit of CDollars 29.1m, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier, on
sales of CDollars 470m against CDollars 611m.

COMPAQ COMPUTER, struggling in a personal computer price war, is believed to
be planning to diversify its product line to include a broader range of
computers and printers.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive who is visiting
Europe this week, said that the US company was formulating its strategy for
the 1990s.
'I don't consider a PC-only strategy as . . . the most promising long-term
corporate business strategy,' he said.
Compaq is developing a new line of computer products based upon the reduced
instruction set computing (Risc) technology used primarily in computer
workstations from companies such as Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.
Compaq said it would bring out a new range of low cost personal computers
this year to compete with lower priced clones.
Industry executives in the US say Compaq is hiring engineers to form a laser
printer division and that the personal computer company aims to launch new
printer products later this year.
That would place Compaq in direct competition with Hewlett-Packard, the
laser printer market leader. Compaq declined to comment.
After nine years of rapid growth, Compaq recently reported its first decline
in year end sales and earnings. Revenues for 1991 fell 9 per cent to Dollars
3.3bn and profits dropped 71 per cent to Dollars 131m.
Compaq cut its prices aggressively last year, but competitors have recently
made even deeper price cuts.

DAEWOO, the South Korean conglomerate, has been given the go-ahead to set up
joint ventures in North Korea, Reuter reports from Seoul. It is the first
time the South Korean Unification Ministry has approved a request from a
conglomerate to do so.
The ministry said: 'Daewoo has been given the approval to do joint ventures
with the north. But they have yet to receive approval on what kind of joint
ventures they will be doing with the north.'
It said Daewoo would be required to submit details of its plans and of each
proposed joint venture. 'This is just permission for the company to go ahead
with their plans for joint ventures. Daewoo would need approval again after
plans for specific kind of joint projects are submitted.'
Mr Kim Woo-choong, Daewoo chairman, discussed joint ventures in Pyongyang
during his recent visit to North Korea.

A SHARE offering by Riyad Bank, representing the biggest flotation in Saudi
history, was oversubscribed by more than three times, Reuter reports from
Manama.
Sheikh Ahmed Abdul-Latif, managing director, said 689,000 Saudi investors
had applied for shares worth SR12.6bn (Dollars 3.34bn). The bank, the second
biggest in the kingdom in terms of assets, offered 8m shares worth SR3.8bn
to the Saudi public last month.
Shares were priced at SR475 each, compared with trading levels of about
SR750.
Established in 1957, Riyad Bank has assets of about SR44bn. It posted a net
profit of SR248m in 1990.
Sheikh Ahmed said share trading on Saudi Arabia's unofficial stock market
would continue to boom because of high liquidity and a lack of other
investment opportunities.

loss

<TEXT>
CANADA'S two biggest steelmakers, Dofasco and Stelco, suffered a combined
loss of more than CDollars 160m (USDollars 136.7m) in 1991, exacerbated by a
sharp deterioration in business conditions towards the end of the year.
Dofasco's loss was CDollars 25m, or 73 cents a share, compared with a loss
after writedowns of CDollars 679.2m, or CDollars 10.64 a share, in 1990.
The bulk of the 1990 loss came from the write-off of the company's CDollars
713m investment in Algoma Steel. Revenues dipped to CDollars 2.06bn from
CDollars 2.36bn.
Stelco suffered a net loss of CDollars 136m, or CDollars 3.05 a share,
against the 1990 loss of CDollars 197m, or CDollars 5.96 a share. Revenues
edged down to CDollars 2bn from CDollars 2.09bn.
Dofasco's fourth-quarter loss was CDollars 1.5m, including an operating loss
of CDollars 24.4m.
Stelco said that an improvement in its financial performance in the first
nine months of last year came to an 'abrupt' halt, which left it CDollars
38m in the red in the final three months.
It blamed the fourth-quarter setback on a sharp price decline caused by the
need to find new markets for higher-value products originally earmarked for
the automotive industry.
Dofasco estimated that demand for flat rolled steel dropped by 10 per cent
last year, and 24 per cent below the peak volumes of 1988. Its total steel
shipments dipped by 6 per cent in the fourth quarter to 872,000 tons.
Both companies expressed cautious hopes for an improvement in 1992. But
Stelco noted that, for the time being, 'steel prices show no sign of
firming, let alone embarking on any upward trend.
CAMPEAU, the property company, has become Camdev Corp, shorn of its former
US retail units and most of its Canadian and US commercial buildings, writes
Robert Gibbens. The Ontario courts approved the last steps in the
restructuring of Campeau into Camdev, 60 per cent controlled by the
Reichmann family.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines said it would make new mainframe computer
models available several months ahead of its planned schedule in a move to
boost sales.
The new mid and low-range models, which were announced last year, extend
IBM's latest ES/9000 range of computers.
IBM executives said delivery dates had been advanced because improvements in
manufacturing processes enabled the company to move more quickly.
Demand for IBM's most powerful mainframe computers has not declined, despite
economic trends, company executives said.
Competitors say, however, that IBM has been offering steep discounts to
customers in order to boost sales.
Four new mid-range models are available now, IBM said, and a fifth would be
available at the end of June. Upgrades for older IBM models will also be
available sooner than expected. IBM also announced two new low-end
mainframes.

COMBINED net profits of the 15 Thai commercial banks rose to Bt19.46bn
(Dollars 807.5m) in 1991, up 25.4 per cent from Bt15.52bn a year ago,
according to Bangkok Bank, Reuter reports from Bangkok.
Bangkok Bank said the slower rate of earnings growth, compared with 1990
when profits soared 85.4 per cent, may be due to an economic slowdown, wide
interest rate fluctuations, and higher operating expenses and staff
salaries.
Bangkok Bank said its 1991 record profit of Bt7.3bn accounted for 37.3 per
cent of total net after-tax earnings of all Thai banks.
Bangkok Bank was followed by the Thai Farmers Bank with Bt3.4bn, or a 17.5
per cent share, and the Siam Commercial Bank at Bt2.7bn, a 13.8 per cent
share.
Bangkok Bank's 54.7 per cent earnings growth was the highest among Thai
banks, while three medium-sized and small banks posted annual profits
between 3.3 per cent and 32.3 per cent lower than a year ago.
Total Thai bank lending rose a combined 21.8 per cent in 1991, to an
outstanding Bt1,797.4bn at the end of December. Bangkok Bank's credits
accounted for 27.7 per cent of overall bank loans, followed by Krung Thai
Bank at 14.5 per cent, Thai Farmers at 13.4 per cent, and Siam Commercial at
10 per cent.

Stanbic advance 23%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A WIDENING interest margin helped Standard Bank Investment Corp (Stanbic),
South Africa's second largest banking group, increase attributable earnings
by 23.6 per cent to R510.7m (Dollars 183.7m) in the year to December.
The results were heavily influenced by difficult economic conditions and
tight monetary policy maintained by the Reserve Bank.
To the bank's advantage, weak demand for credit increased liquidity, and
hence lowered the bank's cost of funds and raised its interest margin.
However, the bank had to increase its specific provision for bad debts by 86
per cent to R329.4m.
Net interest income rose by 31 per cent to R2.03bn, while other operating
income was 21 per cent higher at R1.28bn. Operating expenses were 26 per
cent higher at R2.52bn, and operating profit was up 29 per cent at R794.2m.
Attributable earnings were up less because of lower income from associated
companies.
Although total assets grew by only 10.7 per cent to R50.4bn, Mr Eddie
Theron, managing director, said loans and advances had actually increased by
16 per cent. He said this was a 'very satisfactory' performance, given the
weak corporate demand and lack of big projects.
Another notable figure was the increase in the return on assets, to 1.04 per
cent from 0.93 per cent.
Mr Theron said the ratio of bad debts to advances, of 0.75 per cent, was
similar to that of the difficult years of 1985 and 1986. He noted, however,
that while then many large companies got into serious difficulties, this
time around the bulk of bad debts was being incurred by personal customers,
small businesses and farmers.
Earnings per share rose by 20.1 per cent to 507 cents, and the dividend was
lifted by 20.3 per cent to 160 cents per share.
Domestically, Mr Theron said the bank had maintained market share in all its
main divisions. Internationally, it had applied for a banking licence in the
UK, and was expanding into Africa in a 'measured' fashion.
Although the group had not seen any signs of a pick-up in business, it was
still budgeting for improved earnings in the current year, he said.

FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: UAL scales back aircraft order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Airlines, one of the three largest US carriers, plans to take
delivery of only 156 new aircraft between 1992 and 1995, compared with the
278 it had on order or option.
The cost of the scaled-back deliveries will amount to Dollars 12.2bn,
compared with Dollars 18.9bn had the full order been purchased.
Boeing, the Seattle-based aerospace manufacturer, will bear the brunt of the
cutbacks. United said 'the focus of the change' would involve a reduction of
44 Boeing 737s and 60 Boeing 757s.
Boeing's response was to point out that no firm orders, nor any options, had
actually been cancelled by United; rather that delivery dates had been
delayed until after 1995.
It said that while the 'rescheduling' had affected some Boeing 737s on firm
order, in general United's reduced fleet purchases between 1992 and 1995
affected aircraft which had only been under option.
Boeing said the effect of the reductions had been anticipated when it
announced plans to cut the production rate of its 737 aircraft from 21 a
month to 14, beginning in October 1992.
United, for its part, stressed that it intended to take the full 1992
complement of 66 aircraft - a mixture of Boeing 747s, 757s, 767s and 737s.
After reporting its largest-ever quarterly loss of Dollars 252.6m, United
last month warned of capital spending cuts of at least Dollars 2bn, blaming
the sluggish economic outlook.
Its rescheduling of aircraft deliveries follows similar moves by American
Airlines, which decided last year to defer some options, allow others to
lapse, and extend delivery dates for some aircraft on firm order.

Bornholmerbanken is a local bank for the Baltic island of Bornholm. It was

Large loss provisions exhausted its equity capital, which on June 30 stood

Lannung Bank, a small Copenhagen investment bank which closed last week when
it went into receivership, has re-opened after the intervention of a group
of wealthy private investors.
The bank was was owned by Accumulator Invest, the investment and property
company dominated by Mr Klaus Riskaer Pedersen, the Danish Euro MP. Berliner

BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's second largest bank, is negotiating an
agreement with two shareholders on insurance products. A co-operative deal
between BBL and the shareholders could squeeze out a counter-proposal from
Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance
group.
ING, which owns 5.9 per cent of BBL through a Belgian subsidiary, was at the
centre of press speculation last year that it was poised to launch a paper
and cash bid for BBL which would have cost the Dutch company the equivalent
of more than Fl 3bn (Dollars 1.65bn). It declined to comment on the reports
at the time.
Responding to Belgian press reports yesterday, BBL said talks with two
insurance companies - Royale Belge, 47 per cent of which is owned by Union
des Assurances de Paris, and Winterthur of Switzerland - were
'well-advanced', and could involve 'very limited' movements of shares. UAP
controls 9.35 per cent of BBL, and Winterthur 4.8 per cent.
The bank played down the significance of the talks. 'It's quite normal that
we should want to sell insurance products and that we should discuss this
with shareholders,' the Belgian bank said.
ING countered by saying that its proposal would enable all the various
insurers who own a stake in BBL to participate in a partnership, with the
exact level of involvement determined by the size of their shareholdings.
The Royale Belge-Winterthur proposal, by contrast, would exclude all other
BBL shareholders, including ING, which is keen to bolster its presence
around Europe.
ING also confirmed that last week it had informally raised the possibility
of arriving at some form of co-operation in banking to BBL.
It denied that these talks centred on ING expanding its stake in BBL.

A NEW grouping in the speciality textiles business is being formed through a
deal between Chargeurs Textiles, a subsidiary of the Chargeurs group of
France, and Fincori, a privately-owned Italian textiles group, writes Haig
Simonian in Milan.
Under the transaction, Chargeurs is selling Delcer, a leading French
producer of knitted textiles for sports and leisure use, to Sgat Italia, a
specialist maker of outer wear owned by Fincori. In return, Chargeurs
Textiles will take a 35 per cent stake in Sgat Italia.
The acquisition follows Fincori's purchase last December of Sitel, a French
company which is the leading manufacturer of textiles for winter sports
wear.
Adding Delcer to the grouping will create Europe's leading producer of
speciality textiles for sports and leisure wear. The group is expected to
have annual sales of around L175bn (Dollars 145m) and almost 700 employees.
Terms of the deal, which is being conducted via a rights issue by Sgat
Italia, have not been revealed.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday bought 51 per cent of
Linjeflyg, the Swedish domestic airline, in a move to consolidate its
position in the Nordic market.
The deal involved SAS reacquiring a half-share in Linjeflyg that it had sold
only 17 months ago to Bilspedition, the Swedish transport company, while
gaining another 1 per cent from ABA, the other main shareholder in Linjeflyg
and one of the owners of SAS.
Terms were not disclosed, but Bilspedition said it would make an accounting
loss of SKr150m (Dollars 25.7m) on its share of Linjeflyg, which it had
purchased for SKr475m in September 1990.
Although Linjeflyg would remain an separate airline, SAS said it would
closely co-operate with it and appoint a project group to rationalise their
business activities.
SAS hopes that its takeover of Linjeflyg will increase its market share of
domestic flights within Scandinavia from the current level of 57 per cent to
at least 70 per cent.
Mr Jan Carlzon, the SAS president, said the airline needed to strengthen its
domestic market position in anticipation of the deregulation of European air
transport in 1993.
'In contrast with almost all of our European competitors, SAS competes with
a number of other local operators in its home market,' said Mr Carlzon, who
noted that KLM controlled all Dutch air traffic.
Domestic competition between SAS and Linjeflyg would have led to losses for
both companies if it continued, Mr Carlzon contended.
The government, which has promised to increase business competition, said it
approved the SAS deal, although it was criticised by the country's
anti-trust authorities. The government owns half of ABA, which controls 43
per cent of SAS.
SAS sold its half of Linjeflyg in 1990 amid predictions that deregulation of
Sweden's air traffic market would reduce the carrier's profits.
At the time, Bilspedition viewed Linjeflyg as a means to expand its air
freight services. However, a 25 per cent fall in domestic passenger traffic
and rising operating costs made the venture an unprofitable one.
In return for selling its share of Linjeflyg, Bilspedition will acquire the
Jet Pact express service for SKr30m. Jet Pact is owned by SAS and Linjeflyg.

<TEXT>
ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday said a combination
of weak demand and restructuring provisions had pushed pre-tax profits for
1991 down by two-thirds to SKr1.6bn (Dollars 274.4m).
Ericsson warned that demand for telecommunication products would continue to
be 'very weak' during the first half of this year, mainly because of planned
cuts in capital expenditure by telephone operating companies.
It added that the 1992 profit figure - which was 'highly dependent upon
sensitivity to economic conditions' - was expected to be low.
Orders last year fell by 9 per cent to SKr44.7bn, while sales were virtually
unchanged at SKr45.8bn, against SKr45.7bn in 1990. Fully diluted, earnings
per shares dropped from SKr14.66. However, Ericsson is holding its dividend
at SKr3.50.
While order bookings increased by 26 per cent during the fourth quarter of
last year to SKr13.82bn, the group's pre-tax profit for the period fell by
97 per cent to SKr93m.
However, the final three months showed a significant recovery over the
third-quarter performance, which left the company facing a SKr194m loss.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, said the company intended to continue
with its investment development plans despite the recession. He insisted
that 'strong development programmes coupled with cost effectiveness' were
enabling the company to maintain and strengthen its international market
shares.
When the economy begins to recover, Mr Ramqvist added, the company would
return to a 'good level of profitability'.
Part of last year's profit decline is due to the SKr600m being set aside by
the company for its continuing restructuring. Last week, it announced that
1,000 jobs were to go mainly at its Swedish operations, where 14,000 are
employed.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 57,000 first half deficit at Elbief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite an upturn in the second quarter Elbief ran into a loss of Pounds
57,000 for the half year ended October 31 1991, and is passing the interim
dividend.
Sales of the Elite range of clocks, mirrors and photoframes had varying
fortunes; the US was badly hit by recession but Europe and other export
markets increased. Sales of handbag frames continued to decrease.
Overall, turnover dropped 8 per cent to Pounds 2.27m after being 27 per cent
down in the opening three months. Despite cutting overheads and other cost
savings, the group was unable to avoid the loss, which compared with a
profit of Pounds 55,000 previously.
Losses per share worked through at 0.04p. Last year there were earnings of
0.043p from which an interim dividend of 0.181p was paid.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cost cutting measures and 'sensible adjustments' to activities helped Dudley
Jenkins Group return to profit in the half year to October 31.
This USM-quoted list broker and supplier of mailing lists to advertisers
recorded a pre-tax profit of Pounds 254,000. That compared with Pounds
376,000 last time and marked a recovery from losses of Pounds 36,000
incurred in the second half of last year.
In particular, list broking activities recovered in terms of trading and
profitability.
Further measures in respect of rationalisation, new product development and
efficiency were in hand.
Sales fell to Pounds 4.73m (Pounds 4.88m). Earnings per 5p share came to
2.54p (3.7p) and the interim dividend is stepped up to 1.35p (1.3p).

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: West Trust moves to diversify
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST TRUST is taking the first step of its planned diversification into the
food industry and is at the same time reducing its exposure to textiles.
It is buying Bart Spices, a high added-value herb and spice packing business
which supplies most of the leading UK supermarket chains, for Pounds 2.5m,
and selling Indo African Exports, an importer and merchant of grey cotton
and polycotton cloth, to its management for Pounds 2.9m cash.
The group also announced interim figures, showing a reduction in profits
from Pounds 191,000 to Pounds 36,000 for the six months to September 30.
There is no interim dividend but the board intends to pay a final of 0.25p;
last year the interim was 0.25p but there was no final. Earnings per share
were 0.06p (0.35p).
Margins were eroded because of the economic climate and Indo African had to
provide an estimated Pounds 136,000, of which Pounds 54,000 is included in
the half year, for a doubtful debt. Indo African requires a high level of
working capital and its borrowings represent about 80 per cent of total
group indebtedness.
The consideration for Bart will be satisfied as to Pounds 250,000 cash and
the issue of 54.4m shares. The vendors will retain 16.9m shares and the
balance, plus a further 33.43m shares raising Pounds 1.3m, will be offered
to shareholders on a 13-for-10 rights basis at 4p each. The total of up to
87.8m shares being issued represents 61.69 per cent of the enlarged capital.
Vendors have guaranteed Bart's pre-tax profit at not less than Pounds
212,000 for the nine months to September 30 1991.
All proposals are subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary
meeting on February 27.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pathfinders in reverse takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ELECTRICAL wiring business built up by the former joint head of Thomson
T-Line is coming to the main market via a Pounds 15.2m deal with Pathfinders
Group, a small media recruitment company.
Mr Hugo Biermann, who will become chairman of the new group, and his partner
Mr Nicholas Toms, are bringing in their two companies, Cables &amp; Flexibles in
the UK, and Seacoast in the US. They and another director will end up with
26 per cent of the enlarged group by taking the payment in shares.
Considerations total Pounds 9m and another Pounds 6m-plus is being raised to
repay debts. The transactions include a share placing and 1-for-1 rights
issue, both at 8p, to raise Pounds 7.42m. Pathfinders' shares were suspended
on the USM two months ago at 10p.
Cables &amp; Flexibles, a distributor, was acquired in 1987 by Thomson T-Line.
Mr Biermann's aim was to build up an industrial distribution group.
Along the way Vernons, the football pools business, was bought as a cash
generator. This brought Thomson to the notice of Ladbroke Group, which
acquired it for Pounds 186m in February 1989.
Mr Biermann carried on with a previous Thomson plan to acquire Seacoast, and
then in March last year bought back Cables &amp; Flexibles from Ladbroke.
He said the new group, which will be called Maddox Group, aimed to
distribute, install and service wiring systems. This would initially involve
small bolt-on acquisitions, with a larger one planned later this year.
Pathfinders is being used as a shell. Its biggest shareholder, Mr Stephen
Hargrave, bought nearly 24 per cent of the equity 18 months ago, at 3 1/4 p
per share, from Mr Stephen Worth and his wife Ms Andrea Rose.
For the six months to September 30 it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
83,000 on turnover of Pounds 183,000. In the five months to that date Cables
&amp; Flexibles made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 277,000. Seacoast made Dollars
2.2m (Pounds 1.21m) trading profit and Dollars 893,000 pre-tax in nine
months.
For 1992, Williams de Broe, the company broker which is underwriting the
rights issue, is forecasting that the group will make Pounds 2.6m pre-tax on
turnover of about Pounds 40m, with earnings per share of nearly 8p. On net
assets of Pounds 5.5m, initial group gearing is expected to be 25 per cent.
At 8p, the market value will be Pounds 18m.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Manchester Ship lifts operating profit 23%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER Ship Canal reported a 48 per cent fall in annual profits as an
improvement in port operations along the 36-mile canal failed to offset an
85 per cent drop in income from exceptional property dealings.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 amounted to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 20.7m), but the
previous year's results included nearly Pounds 12m of exceptional net income
from the sale of canalside land near Warrington for waste disposal.
Port operating profit expanded 23 per cent to Pounds 5.25m (Pounds 4.27m) on
turnover almost unchanged at Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 19.8m) and less tonnage
handled.
Mr Robert Hough, chairman, described the results as 'very satisfactory'
because profits before exceptional income and expenditure were a record
Pounds 9.62m (Pounds 9.55m). With property income only marginally up at
Pounds 4.65m, investment income 38 per cent down at Pounds 1.43m and
interest charges higher, the improvement came from better port operations,
where staffing costs and operating charges have been reduced by 27 per cent
in four years.
About two thirds of the company's shares are now owned by Peel Holdings,
whose chairman, Mr John Whittaker, took control of the canal through a
private company after a bitter takeover battle in 1987.
Mr Whittaker's original policy was to plough back all profits, but
Manchester Ship eventually returned to the dividend list last year. The
dividend is unchanged at 4.5p.

<TEXT>
YRM, the architecture and building design company, announced a 40 per cent
contraction in interim profits as the recession in the construction industry
continued to bite.
The pre-tax outcome for the six months to October 31 amounted to Pounds
534,000, against Pounds 888,000 last time, on turnover down to Pounds 10.2m
(Pounds 12.3m).
Mr Tim Poulson, chief executive, said: 'the year ahead will be as difficult
as any we have faced so far, but we are in good shape to face it.'
The group has fared better than some of its competitors, partly because it
is broader based and partly because it has cut costs aggressively. Staff
numbers have been reduced by about 30 per cent since 1990.
It has been appointed consultant for the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development in London, and has also won the commission for the New
Museum of Scotland.
Directors hope that overseas business, which accounted for 3 per cent of
turnover, could be lifted following the opening of an office in Berlin and a
joint venture in the Middle East.
Mr Poulson said overseas earnings would increase to 5-10 per cent of total
turnover this year. The company has a longer term target to lift that figure
to 25 per cent, he added.
Earnings dropped to 2.54p (4.1p) but the interim dividend is maintained at
1.65p.

fraud charges

<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the former chairman and chief executive of Polly Peck
International, the fruit and electronics group, was yesterday committed for
trial at the Old Bailey, some 14 months after his arrest at Heathrow Airport
in December 1990.
Mr Nadir faces 66 charges of theft and three of false accounting brought by
the Serious Fraud Office for amounts totalling Pounds 100m.
A second defendant, Mr John Turner, the former Polly Peck group chief
accountant, is charged on 10 counts of false accounting, totalling Pounds
7.4m.
The case now goes to the Old Bailey, but it is not expected to open before
the start of 1993.
Mr Nadir's bail conditions were slightly eased yesterday. Sir David Hopkin,
the chief metropolitan magistrate, maintained a requirement for Mr Nadir to
report to Savile Row police station each week, but lifted a year-old ban on
Mr Nadir contacting a list of persons from whom statements have been taken
but who are not now expected to be prosecution witnesses.
Pannone March Pearson, Mr Nadir's solicitors, said there was still no
evidence to refute the findings of defence accountants supplied to the SFO
many months ago.
'The Polly Peck companies continue to trade successfully and we shall press
for the earliest possible hearing date,' the statement said.

A vehicle fleet subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation has been
placed in administration after more than Pounds 1m was removed from a bank
account in early December, following the death of the publisher Mr Robert
Maxwell.
Mr Peter Dunn, of Latham Crossley &amp; Davis, appointed joint administrator on
Monday, said Maxwell Fleet &amp; Facilities Management's failure stemmed from
cashflow difficulties. MCC removed more than Pounds 1m, in several
transactions, from an account designated MCC re Maxwell Fleet &amp; Facilities
Management for the purposes of group financial support, he said.
The withdrawals were authorised by individuals other than the company's two
working directors, who say they were unaware of the transactions at the
time.
The company was established by Mr Maxwell to provide in-house fleet
management and parcel distribution. It later expanded to service companies
from outside the group, and handled more than 3,000 vehicles.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Tarmac chairman gives up day-to-day control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ERIC Pountain, for more than a decade chairman and chief executive of
Tarmac, is to give up the day-to-day running of Britain's biggest
construction and building materials group.
He is to remain as chairman but will be replaced as chief executive by Mr
Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac's construction division.
Mr Bryan Baker, group managing director, will become deputy chairman.
Tarmac, which grew dramatically during the 1980s, has seen its profits fall
sharply during the past two years as a result of recession in the UK housing
market and a downturn in US construction markets.
The share price, which has fallen by almost 60 per cent during the past 12
months, last night closed 1p down at 119p compared with a peak of 282p last
March.
Sir Eric, who will be 60 next year, denied that management changes had been
prompted by dissatisfaction with the company's recent performance.
He said: 'Both Bryan Baker and myself reach the company's official age for
retirement next year. It was important that management succession was
assured. We would have taken this decision irrespective of the position of
the company. Mr Simms is 47 and is extremely able, having run a highly
successful construction business.'
Tarmac's pre-tax profits between 1978, Sir Eric's first year as chief
executive, and 1988 rose from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 393.1m.
During that period the group became Britain's biggest housebuilder,
constructing more than 11,000 homes a year.
In 1990, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 190.7m. Stockbrokers' recent
forecasts suggest that pre-tax profits could have fallen to between Pounds
40m and Pounds 60m last year which could put the final dividend under
threat.
During the 1980s Tarmac developed a decentralised management system which
gave divisional chief executives the freedom to develop their businesses
during a period of high growth in construction demand.
Mr Simms said that during the past 12 months Tarmac had been taking a
greater degree of central control over divisional strategy, investment and
performance. That had been in response to the harsher trading conditions in
the 1990s.
He said: 'I expect to continue this policy which is in line with the
approach I have taken in the management of Tarmac's construction division.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GPA may delay flotation until after June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS PEAT Aviation, which yesterday reported a 32 per cent increase in
after-tax profits for its third quarter, is considering putting off its
international flotation until after it publishes its year-end results in
June.
The Irish Republic-based aircraft leasing group made after-tax profits of
Dollars 73m (Pounds 40.1m) for the three months to December 31, compared
with Dollars 55.5m in the comparable period of 1990.
Net profits for the nine months were Dollars 196.5m, only just ahead of the
corresponding 1990 figure of Dollars 195.8m, but the group is confident of
record earnings in excess of Dollars 261m for the full year. Earnings per
share were Dollars 1.69 (Dollars 1.65).
GPA had hoped to bring forward its international share offering - worth
between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn - to early April, to take advantage of
the buoyant US stock market.
However, the group now believes it may be prudent to wait until after June
when it publishes its year-end results. This would strengthen its argument
in favour of pricing the new shares closer to Dollars 30.
Some of its advisers still believe GPA should press ahead with its share
offering in April, but only if the GPA board accepts its recommendation to
price the new ordinary shares at between Dollars 20 to Dollars 25, with the
emphasis on the lower price.
At a meeting last Friday at Shannon, GPA's advisers, which include Nomura,
Schroders and Goldman Sachs, narrowed their recommended price range for the
new shares to between Dollars 20 and Dollars 22.
Mr Tony Ryan, chairman, yesterday said: 'We have now recaptured the net
profit decline of the first half of the year and the increase of both
operating and net profit over the third quarter of 1990 show we are
recovering from the impact on air travel of the Gulf conflict.'
Two thirds of the third quarter profits were generated from the sale of
aircraft to investors. For the three months to December, aircraft sales
accounted for 73 per cent of net profits compared with 63 per cent last
year. Leasing accounted for 32 per cent (25 per cent) of earnings.
The US has now replaced Japan as GPA's most important market in aircraft
sales.
Mr Maurice Foley, chief executive, said it would be 'unfair' to question the
quality of net profits because of the growth of the sale of aircraft to
investors.
He added that in the aftermath of the withdrawal of the Japanese investors
in the recession, the business of selling aircraft to investors had
recovered faster than GPA's leasing division.
In a final word of warning, Mr Foley said it would be wrong to assume that
GPA was about to report quarterly net profit increases of about 30
percentage points. 'The worst of the recession is over' he said. 'But we do
not want to hype it up too much.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: AES announces rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Energy Services, the construction, household goods and industrial
equipment group, shares of which have been suspended on the USM since
November, yesterday unveiled a rescue plan together with an interim loss of
Pounds 287,000.
Turnover for the half year to May 31 was slightly ahead at Pounds 1.15m
against Pounds 1.29m, but operating losses increased to Pounds 280,000
(Pounds 63,000).
Losses per share were 1.04p (0.25p).
The rescue plan involves a combination of capital restructuring and
expansion via the acquisition of Guardian Foundations (Southern), a
specialist underpinning company, and Cellular Communications Network, which
distributes mobile cellular equipment.
The purchase of Guardian (Southern) will be satisfied by the issue of 66.2m
new shares, representing approximately 69.8 per cent of AES' enlarged share
capital.
The acquisition of Cellular is for an initial nominal Pounds 1 and a
deferred profit related payment not exceeding Pounds 499,000.
A reconstruction and reduction of the share capital is also planned.
The reconstructed capital will consist of 94.9m shares of 1p each.
The proposals require shareholders' approval. An extraordinary meeting is
scheduled for March 5.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Conrad Black interested in Maxwell
newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CONRAD BLACK, chairman of the Daily Telegraph, fresh from his acquisition
of the Fairfax group in Australia is interested in the New York Daily News.
The future of the tabloid daily taken over by Mr Robert Maxwell in March is
uncertain following the death of Mr Maxwell and the collapse of his empire.
The loss-making newspaper, which was part of the private Maxwell businesses,
filed for protection against bankruptcy in December.
Mr Black confirmed yesterday that he had expressed a general interest in the
Maxwell newspaper properties and added that it was 'conceivable' that he
could become a serious contender for the Daily News.
Mr Black, who owns 85 per cent of the Daily Telegraph group, said last night
that the Daily News 'used to have a franchise. I'm not sure it still does.'
The paper had been on strike for four months before Mr Maxwell was given
Dollars 60m by its previous owners, the Tribune Group, to take it over.
During the strike a non-union paper was produced, but circulation fell from
1m to about 300,000.
Following the Fairfax deal, Mr Black is interested in looking at any
significant newspaper property that comes on the market.
Apart from Ma'ariv, the Israeli daily, Mr Black has registered a general
interest in Mirror Group Newspapers. As the owner of a Conservative
broadsheet newspaper, he does not regard himself as a likely or even
particularly credible proprietor for a Labour-supporting tabloid.
The Telegraph chairman's main interest lies in the Scottish titles of MGN,
which include the Scottish Daily Record, the Sunday Mail and a chain of
weeklies. A serious Black interest in the former Maxwell Scottish titles
would also cause less monopoly problems.
At the moment, however, Arthur Andersen, the administrators of the private
Maxwell interests including a 51 per cent stake in MGN, are insisting that
the shares are not for sale and that when they are sold, it will be a single
group.

<TEXT>
BRYANT, the housebuilder, yesterday reported a 5 per cent profits increase
in a market dogged by the sluggish economy and a lack of consumer confidence
ahead of the election.
The West Midlands-based company is expecting confidence to remain depressed
until after the election.
'The cost of buying is not a problem at the moment,' said Mr Andrew
Mackenzie, managing director. 'There is a concern in the marketplace about
the possibility of increased taxation.'
Pre-tax profits in the six months to November 30 rose from Pounds 9.3m to
Pounds 9.8m on sales up 14 per cent at Pounds 163.5m. Earnings per share
were 0.3p lower at 2.5p; the interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p.
Mr Michael Chapman, finance director, said operating margins had only fallen
from 9 per cent to 7 per cent despite the worst recession for years.
Gearing fell from 5 per cent to 2 per cent on debt of Pounds 4m at the
period-end. The group said it would continue to acquire land at the right
price but would not raise gearing beyond 25 per cent by the year-end.
Mr Chris Bryant, chairman, said that despite a further downward drift in
selling prices, the group managed a 20 per cent increase in the number of
completions during the period to 1,140 units.
Bryant was placing greater emphasis on the three to four-bedroom house
market which would raise the sale price per unit.
COMMENT
Bryant has successfully maintained sales volumes through aggressive pricing
and with low gearing it is also well placed to be rebuild its landbank at
favourable prices. But with the property and construction divisions unlikely
to provide any excitement, strong recovery depends on the unpredictable
housing market. It does not take a wildly unlikely scenario - slower than
expected economic recovery and/or the return of a Labour government - before
the dividend begins to look vulnerable. This year the dividend, if
maintained at 4.8p, is barely covered by earnings of 5.3p on anticipated
profits of Pounds 20m. At a multiple of about 19, Bryant is looking fully
priced although it will be supported by its above average yield for the
sector.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GPG escapes a second share suspension

<TEXT>
GPG, the London-registered investment vehicle of Sir Ron Brierley, narrowly
escaped having its shares suspended on the New Zealand Stock Exchange when
it met a second deadline to file an annual report.
The company, whose shares remain suspended in London, was given a warning on
January 31 for failing to supply accounts, and set the new deadline. Sir Ron
Brierley, chairman, blamed the delay on the company's adoption of new
British accounting standards.
In December, GPG reported pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 10.8m
(Pounds 4.7m) for the year to September 30.
Earnings per share rose from 1.49p to 3.38p. No dividend is declared.
This is the first set of annual results after the formation of the company
from a rump of the Guinness Peat financial services group. GPG, which
started as a shell company with Dollars 115m in cash a year ago, now holds
25 stocks.
GPG lifted its investment in listed companies to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 23m).
Its Australian listed holdings had a market value of Pounds 19.6m (Pounds
9.7m) invested in the rest of the world. The market valuations compared with
a purchase price of Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 7.63m).

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Possible French connection for BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is understood to be considering investing in a minority
stake in Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT), the French regional airline
which is this year planning to launch a big expansion in European services.
TAT, which operates a fleet of 50 aircraft and is one of the main
beneficiaries of French airline deregulation, yesterday said it was talking
to several potential airline partners.
Although it declined to confirm specific talks with BA, the UK airline is
believed to have been approached by TAT to invest in the French independent
carrier.
BA, which yesterday reported a substantial increase to Pounds 100m in third
quarter pre-tax profits, and is currently involved in negotiations to
link-up with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, said it never commented on
speculation about mergers or acquisitions.
TAT's search for a strong international partner follows the disposal last
year by Air France, the French national airline, of its 35 per cent stake in
the regional carrier.
Air France sold its TAT stake as part of its agreement with the European
Commission to enable it to take control of Air Inter, the French domestic
carrier, and UTA, the independent French long-distance airline.
The French national carrier also agreed to give up several routes to
independent airlines in return for EC approval to take over in 1990 its two
main domestic competitors, Air Inter and UTA, giving it a 97 per cent share
of the French market.
Mr Michel Marchais, founder and main shareholder of TAT, indicated last week
he would be prepared to sell 20 per cent of his family's 72 per cent
controlling interest in the airline to a new industrial partner.
The other big shareholder is Credit National, the French state credit
institution, which acquired its 25 per cent stake from Air France.
TAT was founded 20 years ago but because of its association with Air France
was until now largely considered as a subsidiary of the national flag
carrier. In spite of last year's airline industry slump, the regional
carrier has continued to operate profitably.
It employs about 3,100 people, has annual sales of about FFr2.4bn (Pounds
240m), and is involved in the express freight, airline maintenance and pilot
training businesses as well as operating regional airline services on 30
routes.
But it is now poised to launch a big expansion of European services as a
result of the French government's redistribution of airline routes. It plans
to start 15 new services during the next 12 months, including services from
Paris and Lyon to London Gatwick next month.
Other new European services include flights from Paris to Copenhagen,
Munich, Geneva, Milan and a summer schedule of flights from French regional
cities to London's Stansted airport.
However, the airline clearly feels it will be in a stronger position to
compete head-on against Air France if it can forge a partnership with a big
European carrier like BA.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Battling against a basket of troubles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, Mr Bob Willett, chief executive of Gateway Foodmarkets, the UK
supermarket group, addressed a food retailing conference in London. He
depicted the Gateway business as valiantly battling its way back into
prosperity. He even criticised the 'flawed' trading strategy of his bigger
rivals, which he said were overpaying for sites in their quest to open new
space.
Yesterday, a rather different aura surrounded Gateway as Usdaw, the
shopworkers' union, attacked the company's plans to shake-up its labour
force.
The furore of the job cuts, coupled with last Friday's departure of two
directors from Gateway, set the City talking about a flare-up of disruption
at the company reminiscent of the departure of Mr David Smith and Ms
Elizabeth Hignell as directors of the Isosceles parent company last
September.
These developments compounded the bad news of the previous month when
Gateway said its sales had suffered severely in the recession. The company
yesterday admitted it had seen no easing of those pressures in the weeks
that have followed.
Some City observers have begun to wonder whether Isosceles, which took
Gateway private in a Pounds 2.1bn debt-heavy deal in 1989, will be able to
achieve its declared aim of returning to the market within one to three
years.
Any delay would only add to the discomfort of Wasserstein, Perella, the Wall
Street leveraged buy-out specialist which owns 40 per cent of Isosceles'
equity. The stake accounts for about one-third of the firm's investment
portfolio.
Others observers have questioned if Gateway has a future at all or whether
it will fall victim to the voracious appetites of its high-spending rivals.
Although such fears are easily exaggerated, Gateway is indeed looking
perilously exposed. Its Isosceles parent company is still saddled with
Pounds 1.3bn of borrowings and has been unable to complete the
desperately-needed disposal of Herman's, its US sportswear subsidiary.
Gateway itself is strapped for cash and struggling to make sense of its
portfolio of 682 small stores which have been starved of investment for
years and which have seen their trading position eroded by competitors
opening superstores. 'Gateway has got a lot of very vulnerable real estate
out there but food retailing is an odd industry. Companies do not go 'phut'
overnight and fascias can change,' said one analyst.
Mr Willett has undoubtedly done much to shake up the sleepy Gateway culture
and he has worked hard to give the company a viable strategy for the future.
In the two years he has headed Gateway, Mr Willett has ruthlessly cut
head-office costs and swathes of management. He has introduced a range of
900 own-label products and a programme of cultural change. He has recruited
about 150 'aggressive' executives in the past 18 months and 100 new store
managers since Christmas.
His response to what he sees as a segmenting food retailing market has been
to launch two new formats in an attempt to seize market share.
The group has researched a new style of high-quality high street stores  -
called Somerfield - which ideally trade in market towns.
The group has rolled out 14 of these stores but is accelerating the process:
by April a further 13 will have been added. By the end of the year the
company aims to have 50 stores with 1m sq ft of trading space. The response
to these stores has been encouraging with an average basket sale of Pounds
16.30 compared with Pounds 8.80 at the core Gateway stores.
Gateway has also launched a chain of 15 Food Giant discount superstores,
which sell 10,000 lines including many fresh products. The concept of Food
Giant was originally a matter of expedience. Although Gateway sold 61
superstores to Asda for Pounds 705m in 1989 it was left with a rump of 14
underperforming superstores which 'were an unmitigated disaster', according
to Mr Willett. But it is believed that Gateway now has bigger ambitions and
has developed plans to open 26 Food Giant stores by April 1994 looking at
sites previously owned by Lowndes Queensway, the failed furniture retailer.
But in spite of Mr Willett's efforts, there remain doubts about his room for
manoeuvre. 'Gateway has got a capital budget of Pounds 100m a year and that
is a severe constraint on the scale of its aspirations,' says Mr Tony
MacNeary, food retailing analyst at County NatWest.
Last week, Mr Willett said: 'The market is polarising and will become very
difficult for weak and non-focused retailers.' Many industry observers
agree; but they place Gateway firmly in the category of the weak.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Staff rights stressed in white paper: Government wants
employees to have more details of terms and conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday issued a 'United Kingdom Social Charter', stressing
rights for the individual at work and new training opportunities.
The main piece of new legislation planned in the employment white paper
requires that individual employment contracts give employees more details of
their terms and conditions.
The white paper supplements plans for another round of restrictions on trade
unions in an earlier green paper.
The white paper also plans to make the poaching of skilled workers more
difficult.
The government wants to encourage legally enforceable contracts which would
allow employers to recoup some of the cost of training if an employee leaves
within a certain period. In both areas the government will consult before
legislating.
In the field of training the main new ideas are to extend the credits
concept to careers advice for adults in work wishing to expand their
employment opportunities and to provide 'open learning' vouchers, in
conjunction with libraries, for the unemployed.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, told the House of Commons, to
derisive Labour laughter, that the training proposals would be paid for out
of existing budgets. The 'skill-check' credit scheme will cost Pounds 25m
over the next 2 years and will be launched experimentally in 15 Training and
Enterprise Councils.
The white paper is a highly political argument against the employment
proposals of the Labour party and the European Community Social Charter.
However, it implicitly acknowledges the impact of Labour's accusation that
the Conservative employment agenda was merely negative 'union-bashing'.
It also borrows from Labour's new emphasis on individual rights in relation
to the employer, as opposed to the recent Conservative emphasis on
individual rights in relation to the trade union.
Many of the original green paper proposals are still there, including the
right of employees to join the union of their choice regardless of the
Trades Union Congress rulings.
Other green paper proposals in the white paper are a right to more financial
information about unions (including the salaries of top officials) and
protection for union members from abuse of 'automatic check-off' of union
dues.
The white paper stresses the superiority of individual dealings with
employers rather than 'distant negotiations between employers and a trade
union', hence the new detail that employers will probably have to provide in
employment contracts.
That detail goes beyond what is required through adoption of the EC's
Directive on Proof of Employment Relationships.
Mr Howard cited as proof that collective bargaining was no longer effective
the fact that people covered by collective bargaining now earned on average
Pounds 7.50 a week less than those not so covered. Pay analysts pointed out,
however, that white-collar pay had grown three times faster than manual pay
in the 1980s.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, criticised the plan to make
employees liable for the cost of their training but said it was 'a
fundamental concession' to the Labour view that a voluntary approach on
training was insufficient.
Mr Howard said that he expected that poaching employers would 'buy out' an
employee from a contract.
However, in this and other areas where individual contracts will become more
important, the white paper envisages a greater influence for industrial
tribunals.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Letter: Opposition doubts UK government commitment to aid
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANN CLWYD MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lynda Chalker, you report, says that, 'where human rights are
systematically abused, or where aid is feeding corruption rather than
mouths, we shall have no alternative but to cut it' ('Chalker coy of making
aid commitment', February 7). Coming two days after the Indonesian foreign
minister's visit to Britain, the statement could not have thrown into
starker relief the yawning gap between the Conservative government's many
words on 'good government', and its lack of action.
Last November's Dili massacre by the Indonesian army in East Timor, horrific
enough in itself, hardly came out of the blue. It was, in Amnesty
International's recent words, part of the 'long-standing and continuing
pattern of human rights violations in East Timor and Indonesia'. It was a
pattern I witnessed first-hand when I visited three years ago, and one that
continues. The Indonesian reaction to the Dili massacre has itself consisted
of yet further violations, including imprisonments, torture and
extrajudicial executions.
If this does not measure up to Lynda Chalker's yardstick of 'systematic
abuse' of human rights, I fail to see what does. And yet she and the prime
minister still refuse to withhold British aid to Indonesia, which last year
grew to Pounds 22.7m.
While the intense pressure of world opinion has forced the British
government to make disapproving noises about the massacre, they have bent
over backwards to accommodate the Indonesians. Lynda Chalker, for example,
gave dangerous credence to the Indonesian government-appointed national
commission of inquiry by describing it repeatedly in parliament as
'independent'. Dominated by high-ranking military and government figures,
the commission was discounted from the outset by genuinely independent
observers like Amnesty, which this week stated that it was 'fatally flawed
and that its findings are unacceptable'.
The truth, of course, is that, while the pious rhetoric of 'good government'
has grown of late, short-term commercial and political expediency continue
to dictate government policy in practice - just as it did when it allowed
the sale of arms to Saddam Hussein's Iraq or supported the factions fighting
side-by-side with Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Letter: Shock to competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J D RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The commentary on electricity prices for large industrial customers in
the Lex column (February 5) missed the vital issue. The recession is only an
aggravating factor; the main concern of large users is the impact of
electricity price increases on their international competitiveness.
By the middle of this year, large users will have seen their electricity
prices increase by roughly 50 per cent since 1987. In most other west
European countries prices have shown little change in that period.
For most large industrial customers product prices are set in international
markets. In the short term, they have the choice of losing business or
losing profit margins as a result of electricity price increases. In the
long term, an uncompetitive cost structure means factory closures and job
losses at home and new investment abroad.
A strong manufacturing sector, as the government knows, is vital for the
future health of the UK. As large energy users, we must urge support for our
international position.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Letter: US not 'softening' chip agreement with Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CARLA A HILLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the US-Japan semiconductor agreement ('Fresh cracks in
US-Japan chip pact', February 6) was incomplete. You quoted my statement:
'If the market share is 19 per cent, that will not necessarily be a breach
(of the agreement)'. However, you failed to include the latter part of my
statement: 'And if it is 21 per cent, that will not necessarily mean
compliance.'
The Bush administration is not 'softening' its support for the agreement.
Rather, I have told Japan that we expect full implementation. The level and
growth of foreign market share are of great importance in assessing whether
the arrangement has been fully implemented.
In accordance with the arrangement, we intend to pay 'particular attention'
to market share. In this regard, we are greatly concerned with the apparent
flat trend in foreign market share in the Japanese semiconductor market over
the past year.
The arrangement also calls on the two governments to consider other
'quantitative and qualitative factors'. We regularly review such factors,
including the development of foreign semiconductor design-ins, and other
long-term relationships between Japanese and foreign companies.
The Bush administration will continue to act forcefully to open the Japanese
market for US and foreign semiconductor producers.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr RICHARD BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Employers face transfer fee for poached staff', (February
10) raises interesting questions in an EC context. The practicality (which
is highly questionable) of such a fee aside, it seems likely that the
ability to inhibit employees from changing jobs would prima facie contravene
articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty of Rome requiring the removal of obstacles
to the free movement of workers. Indeed, this has already been debated in
the European Parliament, Commission and Court of Justice with regard to an
Italian footballer. Attempts to resolve the 'poaching' problem are welcome,
but the price of introducing new rigidities into the labour market is too
high.

<TEXT>
Sir, Vanessa Houlder is wrong to assume (Property Market, February 7) that
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors will back away from a radical
approach to future market needs.
The profession has an excellent record of change. Without the protection of
statute or registration systems, it has prospered by serving clients' needs.
In the last 30 years, the profession has expanded by merger, by entering
overseas markets, and by extending the applications of its skills. RICS
rules have changed to permit practice with limited liability, to permit
qualification overseas based on property law and practice in other
jurisdictions, and to delegate academic examinations to higher education
institutions.
In a body of 67,000 qualified professionals - and 22,000 working for
qualification - each set of changes needs analysis and explanation. A
recession which has hit property and construction heavily may make members
more cautious. But the profession's leaders will press for constructive
changes now as in the past and will put the needs of the profession's
clients and members first, and the institution's structure second.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Foreign Affairs: All Atlanticists now - A close and more
balanced partnership between the US and Europe will cement the alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Danforth Quayle has cut a more impressive figure on his current European
tour than the bumbling image long projected in the US and elsewhere. Last
weekend I heard him deliver a spirited address, quite different from the
text issued in advance, to the Munich Conference on Security Policy, and
then field questions with a coherence and punch that President George Bush
might well envy.
As one US observer who was also present put it: 'People are always surprised
that he can walk and chew gum at the same time. He's no genius, but you
can't go through a swing door in Congress without knocking into several
people dumber than Dan Quayle.'
Mr Quayle did not threaten, as newspaper headlines (including the FT's)
suggested, that the US would pull out of Nato if the EC failed to make
concessions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Some of the Republican legislators present came closer to it. Senator
William Cohen, for instance, warned of a 'prevailing and popular view in the
United States that Nato is no longer relevant, necessary or affordable'.
Senator Richard Lugar, a former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,
interpreted a statement made the previous day by the Dutch foreign minister,
Mr Hans van den Broek, as meaning that Europe had come together on the
'lowest common denominator' in the Gatt talks, 'and this put them further
away from the US'. This, Mr Lugar said, 'will undermine all that we are
talking about in terms of the US and Nato . . . Americans will not stay
where they are not wanted'.
Compared with this, Mr Quayle's remarks were very positive. He did say that
the Gatt round was 'critical to the security of Europe, the security of the
United States (and) the security of Asia', because a world fragmenting into
trade blocks with no 'comprehensive understanding' between them would be a
less secure one. He did say that the compromise framework proposed by Mr
Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt secretary-general, represented the way to go. People
on both sides 'are going to nitpick that', he added, 'but friends, we have
to get on with it'.
It is hard to imagine any American official saying less than that to a
European audience in present circumstances; and, so far from threatening a
withdrawal from Nato, Mr Quayle went out of his way to play down the
importance of isolationism and protectionism in American politics.
Unlike Mr Cohen, who had warned that 'many would like to retreat into a
continental cocoon and zip out the rest of the world' and that more
statesmanlike attitudes would not be rewarded by the electorate, Mr Quayle
said: 'Protectionism may in some districts be advantageous to getting
elected, but I'm telling you that is not the way to get elected president of
the United States.'
He claimed it had backfired against both Mr John Connally in 1980 and Mr
Dick Gephardt in 1988, and that in the current New Hampshire primary Senator
Bob Kerrey had withdrawn a protectionist TV commercial, admitting it was a
mistake. It was in reply to this that Mr Lugar - perhaps playing hard cop to
the vice-president's soft one - said that 'the tides towards isolationism
and protectionism, even though beaten back, are very strong'.
After listening to all this it seemed quaint to hear Mr Martin O'Neill,
defence spokesman of the British Labour party, declare at the same Munich
conference that the 'single largest threat' to the Atlantic alliance was
'the uncertainty created by the floating of the concept of a Franco-German
force'. This, Mr O'Neill said, 'creates problems going to the very heart of
the alliance'.
How, he asked, would it relate to Nato's command structure, in which Germany
at present participates while France does not? Who, he went on - apparently
supposing that Bonn and Paris were bent on a complete merger of their entire
armed forces - would have responsibility for French nuclear weapons? And he
concluded with a solemn warning that 'those who use their Europeanism to
cloak their continental chauvinism do no service to either cause'.
Very strange. Mr O'Neill, spokesman of a party which has often been critical
of US leadership, and which now regularly accuses its Conservative opponents
of being half-hearted about European integration, appeared to be supporting
Mr Richard Perle, the ultra-hawk or 'prince of darkness' of the Pentagon
during the Reagan years. Mr Perle had warned that 'French policy is aimed at
the destruction of the alliance which has served us so well', and chided the
Germans for their apparent unwillingness to lead the resistance to this
Gallic iniquity.
The explanation is, no doubt, that the Labour party is so terrified that it
might again be portrayed as 'weak on defence' in the UK election campaign
that it is determined to appear more royalist than the king, or in this
instance more Atlanticist than the president of the United States. (Mr Bush,
after all, signed a Nato declaration last November welcoming 'the developing
European security identity and defence role'.)
Not surprisingly both General Klaus Naumann, inspector-general of the German
armed forces, and Mr Serge Boidevaix, the French ambassador in Bonn, leapt
to the defence of their countries' plans, protesting that so far from being
a threat to the alliance these represented a sincere attempt to strengthen
it, which they hoped other European countries would join.
More interesting was the reaction from Mr Jacques Baumel, a veteran Gaullist
leader, who said that the changes now in progress had removed the grounds of
General de Gaulle's original objections to Nato's integrated command
structure back in the 1960s. France, he said, already took part in numerous
Nato groups and committees, and had 'no ambition to be the Albania of the
western alliance'.
As for Franco-German friendship, 'one of the post-war miracles', this was
the last thing anyone should be reproached for. The vast majority of French
people wanted the Americans to stay in Europe. 'But the Europeans can play a
bigger role in the alliance. It would be very unfortunate if the
Atlanticists and the Americans were to reject this gift that they're being
offered.'
It is a pity that the French government, which has to make policy on the
basis of nods and winks from the ever inscrutable President Francois
Mitterrand, does not express itself so clearly on this issue. If the British
Labour party is now more Atlanticist than the Americans, one could perhaps
say that the French Socialist government is now more Gaullist than the
Gaullists. For while it frequently proclaims its support for the alliance
and its desire to see the US remain involved in Europe, it also gives the
impression that it fears American hegemony and wants to see Europe develop a
political and military identity completely independent from the US.
To that extent Mr Perle and Mr O'Neill are right. Where they are wrong is in
failing to understand and support the efforts of the Germans, and more
generally of France's European partners, to wean France away from this
anachronistic attitude and engage it in building Europe on the only
realistic basis, which is that of a close, even if more equally balanced,
alliance and partnership with the US.
In accepting the role of the Western European Union as defined at Maastricht
last December, the French have in fact come a long way in that direction.
They should be encouraged, not rebuffed.

In London, dissatisfaction with the capital's transport, planning and
environment is growing and, with it, support for an elected city-wide
council. On Thursday, the Labour party will announce its plans for an
elected Greater London Authority.
Paris acquired just such an authority - the Ile-de-France regional council -
six years ago, to add to its already powerful city council, and the region
is now debating a new strategic plan for the French capital. London has much
to learn from recent Parisian experience.
London is larger than Paris - by about 11m to 10m people (taking the
comparable metropolitan populations) - and the cities have their own
inherited strengths and weaknesses. Last year's report of the London: World
City project* rated Paris ahead in transport and planning control, but
London better on culture, commercial accommodation and greenness (it has
five times more central parkland).
Nonetheless, similar concerns pervade both cities: inadequate public
transport, urban decay, congested roads, development and fears for the
quality of life. Both cities have their urban black spots, and neither has
escaped the past decade without serious street riots. That said, Paris is
engaging in more serious - and more public - strategic thinking than is
London. It has also done more to improve itself, and has far more ambitious
plans for the next decade than can be found across the Channel.
The contrast is most evident in public transport. Paris has significantly
enlarged its Metro and suburban rail networks over the past 15 years:
inner-city travellers can now find a Metro stop on average every 560 metres,
with a train passing every 90 seconds at peak hours, rising to two minutes
on the main suburban line. (The best London's prestige Victoria line can
manage in the rush hour is a train every three minutes.) The new Paris
regional plan envisages construction of two city Metro lines, a suburban
line and rail links between the five new towns encircling Paris.
The French capital has underinvested in motorways over the past decade - the
peripherique ring road is no M25, and the average time a city dweller spends
in traffic jams has risen fourfold. The regional plan addresses this by
proposing a fourth ring road and a series of underground motorways, some to
charge tolls.
It might sound like a pipe dream, but it isn't. The region's planners stress
that the transport schemes - FFr260bn (Pounds 26.6bn) over 25 years - would
only lift infrastructure spending as a percentage of regional gross domestic
product to less than half the level achieved in the 1960s.
In London, by contrast, the past decade has seen only one important public
transport extension - the notorious Docklands Light Railway, which is being
virtually rebuilt to meet capacity. The Heathrow airport-Paddington express,
Crossrail (from Paddington to Liverpool Street mainline stations) and the
Jubilee Underground line extension (to Docklands) are due to open in the
next decade, but that is the extent of projected expansion. Since London
Regional Transport and British Rail project capital spending separately, and
only three years ahead, there is no 'public transport plan' for the next
decade.
As for roads, London's prospectus of new links to Docklands, an upgrading of
the M25 and North Circular, and a shelving of road pricing (for three years
at least) is a poor match for the Paris plans. There is no statutory body to
consider the pan-city transport interests of London's councils. The London
Boroughs Transport Committee has concerned itself mainly with the Greater
London lorry ban, and not all boroughs participate in that scheme or the
committee.
Ile-de-France region and the French government are putting the final touches
to a comprehensive 25-year planning document, which sets development
guidelines for a range of subjects from the environment, through property
development, to public transport. This will replace the first plan of its
type, agreed in 1966, which laid down a timetable for the completion of the
five new cities, the construction of the La Defense business district and
the peripherique. 'We recognise that you need 25 years minimum to change the
face of a city,' says Mr Pierre Pommellet, director-general of Iaurif, the
body responsible for drawing up the regional plan.
The two cities approached their prestige edge-of-city-centre developments -
Docklands and La Defense - in a similar way, with a special public
corporation working to a government brief in each case. But Docklands
excepted, the London-Paris contrast is stark. Within Greater London, each of
the 32 constituent boroughs has - or will soon have - a separate unitary
development plan (UDP).
Each plan must have regard to 'strategic guidance' from the environment
secretary. The London Planning Advisory Committee, an inter-borough body, is
charged with advising ministers on matters of common interest. But the
committee has proved relatively weak, and central influence on the content
of UDPs has been patchy. Large-scale proposals, like the 'east London
corridor', have depended crucially on initiatives by environment secretary
Mr Michael Heseltine, who is responsible for everything from poll tax to
pollution.
Development control is a matter for the boroughs acting within the broad
remit of their UDPs. Boroughs have the advantage of proximity to those
affected by developments; but they are in a poor position to gauge city-wide
interests. Their decisions can be overriden by the environment secretary,
but the appeal process is cumbersome. The project to redevelop nearly 50
hectares of derelict land at King's Cross, for instance, has now been before
Camden's planning committee for nearly three years, with a hard core of
councillors opposed to the very principle of development. It is typical of
what Dr Michael Hebbert, of the London School of Economics, calls 'the
borough effect - an absurdity, a perfect recipe for delay and inefficiency'.
The contrasting transport and planning regimes are a product of the two
capitals' radically different structures of city government (see graphic).
Most of the Ile-de-France region has four elected tiers of government:
state, region, department and commune. Most French commentators agree there
is one executive tier too many: 'We have too many criss-crossed
responsibilities and areas of financing. It's hell,' says Mr Jean Chevance,
head of staff at the regional Conseil Regionale. But even if one of the
lower three were axed, Ile-de-France would still have a layer more than
Greater London.
Ile-de-France, one of the 22 elected regions set up by the first Mitterrand
government in 1986, embraces 10.7m people, and extends beyond the built-up
metropolis by about 60km south and east, 40km west and 30km north of the
city centre. The City of Paris, the largest of the departmental councils
beneath it, covers 2m city-centre residents - those living, roughly, within
the limits of the Metro/Underground system. The comparable area of London is
covered by 12 London boroughs, with the City of London by far the smallest.
It would be wrong to view the authorities as a strict hierarchy. With a 1992
budget of FFr18.7bn, the City of Paris spends twice as much as the regional
council. The City has had but one mayor since it was created in its present
form in 1976: Mr Jacques Chirac, national leader of the RPR neo-Gaullist
opposition party and twice prime minister. The president of the regional
council, Mr Pierre-Charles Krieg, is one of Mr Chirac's senior followers.
Moreover, the Ile-de-France region is both more and less than a strategic
authority. More, because it has a direct service-providing role. The
provision and upkeep of lycees, for instance, lies with the region, and Mr
Krieg is keen to branch out into universities - a central government
responsibility - and other services.
But also less, since final decisions on most important issues - from the
regional plan to Metro fares, which are half London's thanks to state
subsidies - lie with the government.
The state exercises its authority through a web of state corporations, and
through its appointed prefet for the region, Mr Christian Sautter, formerly
President Mitterrand's most senior adviser. Mr Sautter's appointment in 1990
was widely seen as a bid to re-assert central authority in the capital
which, like most of the French regions, is under the political control of
the opposition. Says Mr Krieg: 'We are in an ambiguous position. Broadly,
the decisions belong to the state and our powers are financial.'
But discard memories of the bitter battles between Mrs Margaret Thatcher and
the former Greater London Council, led by Mr Ken Livingstone, in the 1980s.
Controversy there is: the region objects to financing a large share of the
city's public transport investment budget, while Mr Chirac is battling
against a significant cut in his government grant caused by the Socialist
government's policy of favouring more 'deprived' councils. Mr Krieg has
recently challenged central authority by withholding cash for
environmentally unpopular road schemes, and by building private Catholic
lycees.
Yet these are mere skirmishes. Daily relations between state, region and
city are businesslike. Mr Sautter's office is in the same building as Mr
Krieg's and the right-wing regional president maintains friendly relations
with his Socialist colleague.
The Socialists look set to get a thrashing in the March 22 regional and
local elections, so Mr Krieg, who holds minority control in the regional
assembly, can expect a second term. But whatever the political complexion of
the Ile-de-France, it is unlikely to suffer the violent policy changes to
which London has been subjected. On policy, inter-party differences are
paper thin. 'The Socialists might want to spend more, but we always end up
agreeing on the main investment issues,' says Mr Henri Paul, the region's
finance director.
The consensus derives partly from the exigencies of inter-party
co-operation, but at least as much from the city's administrative culture.
Senior officials of both the region and the city are seconded high-flying
national civil servants (something inconceivable in Britain), enjoying close
professional and social relations with colleagues in central government.
Typically, they will have been to the same elite civil service colleges and
share similar views on the government's responsibility for providing
services and infrastructure. Ile-de-France is privileged in that respect,
and the concentration of resources and skills there is a perennial sore
point with provincial regions.
The state, in other words, has its own regional dimension in the
Ile-de-France, and had it long before elected regions were introduced in
1986.
Voyons loin, vivons mieux (look far, live better), is the Ile-de-France
slogan. Paris has its problems, but if London had a government - national or
regional - with the capacity to look farther, Londoners might at least be
sure of catching a train on time.
* London: World City, HMSO, Pounds 24.95.
This is the first of three articles comparing planning and public services
in Paris and London.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PARIS
Has four main tiers of government
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Central Government:
 has the final say in most strategic matters affecting city, and
 controls public transport through appointed boards. Directly
 represented in the Ile-de-France region and each of its departments by
 a prefet with advisory and supervisory powers.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Region:
 The Ile-de-France region embraces all the continuously built-up
 metropolis, plus the other suburbs. Advisory power over planning,
 direct responsibilities include aspects of education and transport.
 Annual budget: FFr 9.5bn (Pounds 970m).
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Departments:
 8, with broad reponsibility for service provision, of which by far the
 largest (with 2.1m citizens) is the City of Paris - which is also the
 lowest executive tier in its territory. Budgets: Paris: FFr 18.7bn
 (Pounds 1.9bn), others: about FFr6bn (Pounds 614m).
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Communes:
 1,300 across region, powers over primary schools, police, some roads,
 some local services. Within City of Paris, arrondissements have a
 mainly advisory role.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON
has two tiers of government since abolition of Greater London Council
in 1986
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Central Government:
 Ministers have direct powers over all strategic issues in the capital,
 and control public transport through appointed boards. No equivalent to
 the prefet for the capital
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boroughs:
 Greater London area divided into 32 boroughs, plus the tiny City of
 London. Broad responsibility for local services, planning, council
 housing, education and most roads. Typical annual borough budget:
 Pounds 200m

FT  12 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Trade and the environment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE environment a high international priority, trade policies can be no
more exempt from environmentalist scrutiny than any others. But the dangers
of that scrutiny must not be ignored. Well-meaning environmentalists could
find themselves in an unholy alliance with hypocritical protectionist
lobbies. The outcome would not only be slower growth than is desirable, but
postponement of the day when governments forge the needed global consensus
on environmental policy.
The Secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has today
published a report on trade and the environment intended to limit the
potential damage. Its fear is that environmentalist pressure to bar exports
from countries that do not meet what are deemed suitable environmental
standards, or to restrain imports that are not made in environmentally
suitable ways, would play into the hands of domestic protectionist lobbies.
The secretariat argues persuasively that trade weapons - be they tariff
walls, trade bans, or countervailing duties - can rarely be more than
palliatives for the problems that concern environmentalists. Worse, where
such measures are not being exploited by industries anxious to fend off
foreign competition, they are being used by rich countries to force weaker
ones to mirror their policies.
The use of trade sanctions for environmental reasons is bound to alienate
developing countries. Furthermore, the imposition of environmental standards
can be an unjustifiable intrusion into the right of countries to set their
own priorities. Countries are not clones of each other. Their environmental
priorities may differ for valid reasons.
Multilateral action
Where such policies result in degradation of a country's domestic
environment, without international or global spillovers, two options remain.
One is to leave the country to wallow in its blighted policies, until it
discovers the error of its way. The other is to galvanise multilateral
action. A parallel would be international agreement to impose sanctions on
South Africa. Naturally, such action would have to be exceptional to be
acceptable.
Where policies have a spillover effect on to nearby countries - like acid
rain or river pollution - or, worse still, where they threaten the 'global
commons', like the ozone layer or the world's forests, international action
becomes necessary. But even then trade sanctions would rarely be the 'first
best' strategy. Unilateral 'vigilante' action is likely to be
self-defeating. Multilateral agreement would be far better.
Vast bulk
Above all, the cost of repairing the environment ought to fall on those
responsible for the lion's share of the environmental damage, who are also
those with the wealth and the technology to deal with it. Industrial
countries should remember, as they preach the 'environmentally correct' path
to developing countries, that they have no claim to the moral high ground.
They, not the poor, are responsible for the vast bulk of the world's
pollution, especially for those problems - global warming and damage to the
ozone layer - with worldwide effects.
Since there is a link between rising incomes per head and enhanced
environmental standards, the rich industrial countries should also adopt
policies that will accelerate economic growth among developing countries.
Claims of European and American companies for compensation for the costs
incurred in cleaning up their manufacturing processes, and for protection
against Third World manufacturers who gain comparative advantage by
maintaining cheaper, but dirtier technologies, must also be rejected. Those
differences in preferences are sources of comparative advantage.
Compensation is no more appropriate than it would be for different tax
rates, salary levels, land costs and so on.
The secretariat is convinced that the Gatt is ill-suited to settlement of
genuine environmental problems or disputes. Its report, published just four
months ahead of the Rio 'Earth Summit', is intended to press the case for a
multilateral agreement on environmental policies, instead. The environment
is important. But this concern should not be allowed to pollute the course
of world trade, so denying those who are poor the opportunity to enjoy what
the rich take for granted.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: Bingham String Quartet - Purcell Room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current Park Lane Group series is entitled 'String Quartets Plus . . .';
on Monday the quartet was the Bingham team, and their 'plus' the pianist
Andrew West (for Shostakovich's Piano Quintet). Though the PLG's first
objective is to promote contemporary music, represented here by Elizabeth
Maconchy's Quartet no. 6 (1950) and Iannis Xenakis's recent Tetora, they aim
also to promote younger artists who are seriously attuned to new music.
Hence the Bingham Quartet, whose faithfully searching accounts of Maconchy's
quartets from no. 5 to no. 8 have already been committed to a
Unicorn-Kanchana CD.
Truth to tell, the best Bingham performances by a long way were of the
Maconchy 6th and the Xenakis. In the former they have been coached to
excellent purpose by the composer herself, and they made its sinewy lines
tell plainly. An extra touch of astringency in their address would still
have been welcome: a bracing, downright Roman virtue in all 13 of Maconchy's
quartets is the leanness of their arguments, and nothing is gained by
softening their edges. Everything is open to the ear (and mind) - they say
candidly what they mean, but never stoop to ingratiate themselves. That's
why I think that her conveniently concise quartets are likely to find
permanent niches in the repertoire.
The Xenakis Tetora - Dorian for '4', apparently - prompted the gutsiest,
most full-blooded Bingham playing. Tetora belongs to the composer's 'ethnic'
vein, not to the actuarial fantasies that first made his name. Its
workings-out are dense but always folkish, and they sustain a steady
pressure of raw, earthy feeling even while they rotate the material in tight
little circles. In Shostakovich's fine Quintet, however, only the pianist
West appreciated its extrovert dimensions - grandly rhetorical at the start,
exuberant and unbuttoned in the Finale  - and he was audibly at pains to
trim his scale to the wan, respectful Bingham measure.
We'd had enough of that already in their Haydn, the B minor quartet from his
op. 33, where they managed to reduce every bright thrust (there are many,
some of them gypsy-inspired) to juiceless pantomime: as if they took the
piece to be Eminently Worthy, but of course not much fun to play or to hear.
Haydn would have been astonished, and probably insulted. There were moments
of curdled pitch, too, and the leader's exposed sallies too often squeaked
and wheezed.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: The Cutting - Bush Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maureen O'Brien is an actress whose first stage play displays an actorly
delight in the linguistic possibilities of the theatre. She stretches
silences and kneads language into unearthly stop-start rhythms. The Cutting,
apparently based on a true story, weaves this language around a series of
meetings between a middle-aged male psychiatrist and a young female prisoner
on remand for apparently murdering her mother and feeding her, bit by bit,
to the birds.
Dominic Dromgoole's staging is by contrast brutally unpoetic. For much of
the first act, Sian Thomas' Judith stands mute and unblinking in the dingy
prison set, staring out of an imaginary window and wearing the patience of
both psychiatrist and audience wafer-thin. The shrink's job is to coax an
explanation from Judith of her mother's macabre death, thus releasing her
from both the physical limbo of detention and the psychological limbo of her
silence.
Just as he is about to abandon her as a hopeless case, Judith begins to
speak. Bit by bit, the job becomes a mission and professional interest
becomes personal affection. Paul Freeman, watery blue eyes uncannily
focused, is not given much of a progression beyond the obvious one from
exasperation to love, but he keeps attention pinned on the subject of the
play, whose personality unfurls with her story.
The fascination of this woman lies in her resistance to facile
categorisation. Thomas' cut-glass diction, and Judith's capacity to soar
from fractured monosyllables into metaphorical speech, make it impossible to
pop her into any of the obvious social - or theatrical - pigeonholes. At
best she becomes the figment of a wholy original imagination, while at
worst, like the play, she seems precious and stagy.

<TEXT>
Public understanding of Aids has been thwarted by the determination of so
many campaigners to pursue political correctness rather than truth. If it is
thought the facts may offend homosexuals or black Africans then everything
is done to suppress the facts. Most recently desperate efforts have been
made to conceal the latest figures concerning heterosexual Aids in Britain
because those figures do not support the apocalyptic predictions of 1990 and
1991.
On the contrary, they show that heterosexuals with the disease are still
limited almost exclusively to those who have had sexual relationships with
drug abusers, homosexuals and sub-Saharan Africans.
One public information source with a good record of thinking for itself on
this is Dispatches where two previous programmes made by Joan Shenton have
questioned the received wisdom.
Today's edition (9.00 C4) queries the efficacy of AZT, the main drug so far
prescribed for the treatment of Aids.
BBC1 begins a new series of QED with an international competition among
engineering students to build waste collecting machines from junk (9.40).

FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: Big business versus creativity - Television
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening of the winter Olympics, so clearly devised for television, was a
collectors' item worthy of recording on tape and storing alongside those
early editions of the Eurovision Song Contest in which Norway used to get
'Nul pointes'. Somebody had clearly decided that since the whole thing was,
metaphorically speaking, a big pantomime, it might as well be literally
that. So each team was led into the stadium by a girl fitted from neck to
knees with a huge plastic fishbowl full of swansdown (we know it was
swansdown because David Coleman told us so) which she flicked about with her
hands to create the effect of a snowstorm toy. Then the teams were greeted
by the Broker's Men - actually a man speaking French and a woman speaking,
er, English - with rhyming couplets: 'From Latin America signor,
signorina/Please welcome the athletes from Argentina'. The shade of
McGonagall must have been squirming in pleasure. 'With a startling speed
they cover the miles/The team from the Dutch West Indian isles'. Jets
performed aerobatics, massed roller skaters swayed to Beethoven's Ninth, and
the French president looked appropriately sheepish, probably digesting the
French version of 'In summer and winter it's coastal and hilly/So welcome
the team that's come here from Chile'.
*****
Since it was used for the title, the phrase The Lost Language Of Cranes was
presumably centrally important to BBC2's Sunday night drama. Did every
viewer except me understand the significance? Who was the small boy who
copied the movement of the cranes outside the high rise flats? Given that
his behaviour was being studied by a social worker, was he supposed to have
behaved like Lorenz's geese and modelled himself on the first thing he saw
after birth? If so, what had this to do with homosexuality? Were we supposed
to think that young Philip became a homosexual because he modelled himself
on his homosexual father? Or what? I think we should have been told. Ironic
that, in a drama where virtually everyone in sight was a male homosexual,
the best acting came from Eileen Atkins, playing the heterosexual Rose.
*****
For any viewer who is not entirely cynical about television, and who values
high quality programmes, the 'resignation' of David Plowright from Granada
is an ominous if not entirely surprising event. His enforced departure is
the clearest sign yet that we are indeed going to be subjected to that
downward-swirling vortex which some of us predicted when the asinine
Thatcherite plans for broadcasting were first mooted. Those plans are now
putting the accountants on top. Television is, of course, big business and
needs accountants, but it is also a creative industry and once the
Plowrights are driven out the prospects for any more Bridesheads, any more
Worlds In Action, look pretty thin. Writing in the FT in October, Samuel
Brittan, who served on the Peacock Committee, said:
'There is indeed scope in a civilised society for the provision of
programmes in the arts, sciences, humanities, news, documentaries, and many
other fields which cannot pay their way either by advertising or by
subscription. Bodies such as BBC2 and Channel 4 exist for this very purpose;
and Peacock proposed a much broader Arts Council of the Air. There is
nothing, however, to support a grey in-between mess in which the BBC feels
it has to compete in the mass market for pulp, while commercial
entrepreneurs have to go through the motions of providing a due ration of
what the regulators would regard as quality.'
It can be argued, on the contrary, that there is everything in 46 years of
the BBC/ITV duopoly to support the brilliant in-between mass, achieved more
by guess than by god, which offered British viewers such a richly varied
diet. That richness and variety resulted largely from ITV's efforts to win
some of the BBC's kudos by making public service programmes, and the BBC's
efforts to win some of ITV's popularity by creating more appealing comedies,
drama series, and journalism. The system was not broke and did not need
fixing, it was producing some of the most enjoyable (and, according to
market research, most enjoyed) television in the world. It was envied the
world over. Yet doctrinaire political thinking and hostility to television
journalism in the last Thatcher administration ensured that the industry was
well and truly fixed. Future historians may well conclude that one of
Britain's more successful undertakings in the latter part of the 20th
century was ruined for malicious reasons, and the departure of David
Plowright may be seen as the beginning of the end.
*****
Television is not a medium in which the use of language very often strikes
you as expressive, and the odd thing is that on the rare occasion when it
does, the programme almost always seems to be a comedy. Les Dawson on one of
his higher flights of fancy can be both hilarious and linguistically rich,
and the best examples currently available are in BBC2's repeats of Victoria
Wood As Seen On TV. Her monologue for Patricia Routledge last week was so
splendid that you needed to hold your breath and contain your laughter in
order not to miss anything: 'I was in that mood when you eat dry Weetabix
and watch the Open University . . . I'd left me cue-lottes on the
Underground and it was apprentice day at the bikini waxers . . . I still
can't polka without wincing but we're spunky in Cheadle, we totter on . . .'
The only television regulars who can match Wood in this area of genteel
suburban pretensions are Barry Humphries in his Dame Edna persona and Alan
Bennett. It is doubtless not sheer coincidence that Bennett has used
Routledge to deliver some of his best lines. She is so good at it.
Talking of language on television, when did you last hear the word
'philippic' on the box? It cropped up in an unusually quirky and enjoyable
item from David Sells on Newsnight last week. He took a train from Moscow to
Kiev, crossing one of the new frontiers, and his piece reminded you of the
great days of reporting by people such as James Cameron and Rene Cutforth.
You suddenly realised what the 'Birtian revolution' is denying us.
*****
Isn't Michael Gambon wonderful?
Well, yes, he is a rather impressive actor.
A better Maigret than Rupert Davies?
Surprisingly similar, really, given the 32 years between their series.
Doesn't Budapest stand in amazingly well for 1950s Paris?
Amazingly.
And wasn't it funny seeing James Cellan Jones taking off his
producer/director hat to play the waiter and even giving himself a line?
Terribly droll. Just like Hitchcock. You say he took off his hat but did he
take off those sandals that he's always worn, even when he was head of plays
at the BBC? You couldn't see his feet.
At least you must admit there were no steam trains in this episode.
True, but there were moments when you thought 'Oh dear, there's that
spotless vintage motor again'.
Why are you so grudging about this new ITV series, isn't it precisely what
British television does so well, and just the thing for Sunday nights?
Certainly it's awfully well done, but if you polled the viewers on what
television drama needed most do you think they would say 'Another detective
series, please, preferably period'?
Does that mean you think it will get poor ratings?
No, but the law of diminishing returns must set in eventually. We already
have Spender, Taggart, Miss Marple, Poirot, Morse, Van der Valk, and more.
There must be a limit. Mustn't there? Surely . . .
*****
We can hardly begrudge Dan Maskell his retirement, after all he is 83, will
be 84 in April, and in 43 years (he began his commentaries on radio in 1949)
has never missed a day at Wimbledon. And yet, for fans of televised tennis,
the prospect of getting through this year's Wimbledon without him is
dreadful. He is still the best tennis commentator, being clear, calm though
enthusiastic, urbane, and extraordinarily knowledgeable. It is difficult to
think of any other sport with a commentator as good. He promises he will be
at Wimbledon this year as a spectator; couldn't the BBC persuade him to pop
into the commentary box occasionally, just for six or seven hours a day,
say?

The first performance of Benedict Mason's BBC Symphony Orchestra commission
was originally planned for last year, but postponed for mysterious
scheduling reasons. The delay brought its own rewards, however, for in place
of the premiere the BBCSO performed Mason's immensely attractive Lighthouses
of England and Wales from 1988, which was subsequently recorded and released
as a CD single. The large, enthusiastic audience that gathered in the
Festival Hall on Monday night for the BBCSO's unveiling of the Concerto for
the Viola Section, conducted by Lothar Zagrosek, might well have been more
familiar with Mason's music than a year ago, and known perhaps if not what
to expect, then at least what not to expect.
The new concerto shares at least one property with Lighthouses - an approach
to orchestral writing that pays fond homage to 19th-century traditions,
while coming up with a grammar and sense of continuity that are very much
post-modern. In the earlier orchestral piece it was the impressionist view
of the sea that lay behind so many of the textures; in the Concerto it's a
whole history of orchestration ranging across 19th-century romanticism that
informs its workings. It is essentially a work about scoring and about the
role of the violas in the middle of a traditional string texture, sometimes
defining the pulse of the music, sometimes sharing its melodic contours, yet
rarely finding themselves in the spotlight.
In the concerto the violas are amplified and rise through the textures as if
the orchestral balance had suddenly been turned inside out, while Mason sets
up an extraordinary series of inventions, conceits and musical jokes around
them. There are six movements, alternating fast and slow with fond yet
oblique references to the viola's orchestral past in all of them. The huge
orchestra, with percussionists hovering over everyone from the choir stalls,
contains all manner of exotica, as well as a pair of singers among the wind
sections who masquerade as instrumentalists until their moments arrive.
At first hearing the overall structure was not entirely convincing; one
wonders whether the work does justify its length and proportions. But there
are wonderful ideas along the way, some of them arising directly from the
extra-prominence of the viola line, others purely inspirational: textures
coloured by swanee whistles at one point, synthesiser at others, and the
soprano soloist unwinding some exquisite vocalise. Setting these surreal
events within a soundworld that audibly derives from the 19th-century gives
the concerto a crisply defined character and very positive tang.
*****
Dominic Muldowney's Percussion Concerto, which the Bournemouth Sinfonietta
introduced to London in the Queen Elizabeth Hall a week ago, is the latest
in the line of works in which Muldowney has utilised his techniques of tempo
layering, setting up ratios of metronome speeds between the sections of an
ensemble to produce highly complex yet perfectly playable rhythmic patterns.
The most ambitious exploration of these ideas promises to be his Violin
Concerto, due to be heard in Liverpool next month, but in the meantime the
percussion piece seems the most successful and cogent example so far.
The single-movement piece was written for Evelyn Glennie, who plays it with
wonderful flair and accuracy. The percussionist stands at the centre of the
platform with the chamber orchestra divided into groups around her; players
take their lead from either the soloist or the conductor, so that the music
builds up complex polyrhythmic layers as it runs through the precisely
geared tempo ratios. The idea may sound dry and cerebral, but isn't at all
in performance; the music is a glistening web of ever-changing textures and
motives, tinged occasionally with echoes of popular song and jazz accents.
There is a good deal of repetition, of material revisited from a different
perspective, hence the work's Birtwistle-like subtitle, 'Figure in a
Landscape'. From that point of view it seems to be Muldowney's most
Birtwistlian piece for some time: full of intriguing possibilities, flashes
of revelation, and the strange, hidden rituals so characteristic of his
former teacher.
Muldowney conducted the performance, which was part of a concert for the
Arts Council Contemporary Music Network. Tamas Vasary took charge of the
rest of the programme, which brought the London premiere of James
Macmillan's diffuse and overlong Tryst. It also included Stravinsky's Danses
concertantes (written 50 years ago) and Prokofiev's Classical Symphony (75
years old); just what are those works doing in a touring programme
supposedly devoted to 'contemporary' music?

FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: La Boheme - Royal College of Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a greatly appealing student production. Its attractive qualities
start with the youthfulness of the cast - professional performers of La
Boheme (like those of Eugene Onegin) seldom manage to combine vocal aptitude
and visual verisimilitude. But the pleasures don't stop there: the
production by Mike Ashman proposes a fresh statement about the piece, and
the singers, orchestral players and conductor (Michael Rosewell) invite us
to respond to it with equal freshness.
Ashman, an erratic and sometimes wilful opera director for the bigger
British companies, has done some of his best work in the RCM's wonderfully
intimate Britten Theatre - I remember his Paul Bunyan and Onegin with
particular affection. He and the designer Bernard Culshaw have here found a
method of updating that comes across as a quickened imaginative response to
the musical and verbal text, not a lazy-minded gimmick.
The stage design is abstract, the dress modern, the narrative unfolding
elliptical; quick switches of lighting (by John Bishop) underscore the
emotional patterns. This is a production devised to make young performers
(including a splendidly controlled mixture of Christmas Eve revellers, adult
and children) feel at home, which sets up vital lines of connection between
past and present, Puccini's day and our own.
Of the first-night cast (there are three alternating sets of principals for
the six performances) the stand-out figure was the Rodolfo of an
astonishingly gifted young Chinese tenor, Ya-Lin Zhang. He needs to improve
further his Italian diction (which stood out the more because of the
impressively natural delivery around him), and to master much greater
flexibility of stage presence; his steady, supple tones, beautifully
unforced and romantic-sounding, hint at a remarkably bright future.
The Marcello, Richard Croft, shows himself a born singer-actor, alert in his
instincts, a natural point of focus on stage; the Musetta, Elizabeth
Davidson, shares the same quality. Other cast-members prove less noteworthy,
though no-one lets down the prevailing high standard. It's sometimes
difficult to know how to 'rate' enjoyable student opera-productions; at
least by the side of last autumn's dismal Glyndebourne Touring Boheme, this
one seems to me a plain triumph.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Jobs: Time for advertisers to find a new joke -
Psychologists' research paints portrait of Britain's most tediously jibed-at
profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Jobs column couldn't help feeling a mite dis-appointed with the Royal
Air Force on seeing the results of this year's British
recruitment-advertising awards. Given the RAF's traditions, I would not have
expected it to choose such a soft target for the ad for trainee pilots and
navigators which has just won it the topmost prize.
The picture shows a small boy running about, arms outstretched, having a
game of aeroplanes. The headline says: Can you honestly remember anyone
playing chartered accountants? The award-presenters comment: 'This
advertisement communicates a sentiment that all of us recognise.'
True enough . . . but one would have thought that the RAF's ad agency, J
Walter Thompson, could have recommended a more original butt for the joke.
After all, I can't honestly remember anyone playing corporate finance
directors, or even journalists either.
At the same time, however, the announcement of the award and my jaded
reaction to it have left me in an ambivalent position. For today I am at
last able to deliver on a promise I made almost two years ago, on March 28
1990 to be precise.
My topic that day was a study by two psychologists in Northern Ireland,
Jackie Granleese and Timothy Barrett, of accountants' personalities. And
while it shed instructive light on the popular image of its subjects, as
exploited by the RAF, it had the defect of a limited scope. Besides being
all men, the accountants covered by the study were solely of the Irish
chartered sort, albeit coming from both north and south of the isle.
So knowing that the two shrinks were using the same psychological yardstick
 -the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire - on men belonging to the chartered
institutes of Scotland and of England and Wales, I promised a further report
in due course. The findings arrived just the other day.
The only trouble with them, in the light of my reaction to the RAF's ad, is
that they confirm the popular image aforesaid. As in Ireland, so in England,
Wales and Scotland, the typical personality of the male chartered accountant
is one which most other brands of workers would see as matching the comedian
John Cleese's description of the species as 'irrepressibly boring and dull'.
In the two psychologists' words, the characteristic make-up shown by their
tests on 100 or so members of each of the three institutes is 'the socially
confirming, stable introvert'. They then add:
'Such an individual is typically calm, even-tempered, controlled and
unworried. Quiet, introspective, reserved, fond of books rather than people,
he is someone who tends to plan ahead and who distrusts the impulse of the
moment. He does not like excitement, takes matters of everyday life with
proper seriousness and likes order in his life. He is reliable, somewhat
pessimistic and he places great value on ethical standards.'
Moreover, the shrinks say that such comparable evidence as exists on
accountants in the United States and Canada shows that there, too, the
typical male member of the profession has much the same traits.
Even so, what's wrong with that? OK, he may not be the life and soul of the
party. But, given the value he places on ethical standards in particular,
we'd surely all benefit from having a lot more of him around elsewhere.
NOW to the table below which is drawn from the Day Associates consultancy's
latest three-monthly survey of pay and perks in City of London banking. The
figures are based on data supplied by over 90 international banks and
investment houses, and the full report covers 214 different jobs at various
levels. Anyone wanting it should contact Day's Joe Clark at Suite 2.31, 75
Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; telephone 071-375 1397, fax 071-375 1723. The
VAT-inclusive price is Pounds 141 to concerns which take part in the survey,
and Pounds 200 to others.
My extracts, which provide at best a loosely approximate guide to the real
state of pay, are confined to 17 fairly senior positions. First we have
basic salaries - the lower quartile referring to the person a quarter way up
from the bottom of a ranking of all in the same type of job, the median to
the person mid-way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down.
Next comes the average salary followed by the percentage of it typically
received as a bonus. The last two columns show the percentage of the
job-holders whose perks include a car, and its average price.
FINALLY, a reminder about my last week's announcement of Bowater's
initiative in sponsoring, along with the FT, the trial run of an
advertisement in our pages in which unemployed executives may offer their
services at Pounds 50 apiece.
In the trial, due to run the week after next, the chance is limited to
people with business-development skills, and there's room for only six
self-ads of at most 60 words each, including the person's real name.
Those to appear will be chosen at random from entries reaching me here by
the deadline for copy, which is February 19. Even so, three impressive
looking starters have already arrived at the gate.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Management: Poachers turning gamekeepers - Recruitment /
David Goodhart considers whether employees should pay a transfer fee to
change jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Football clubs do it, the armed services do it; so why shouldn't companies?
Putting a value on employees and insisting that they or a future employer
pays something when the staff member leaves is not entirely foreign to
British traditions.
So why not use the idea to help combat the poaching of highly trained
employees, as the government suggests in yesterday's Employment White Paper?
Fear of poaching is thought to be part of the reason for under-training in
British industry. Curiously, little empirical work had been done to show the
real extent of the problem but the fact that it is widely perceived to be a
problem is sufficient to make it one.
It may be that employers are merely finding an excuse for inadequate
training; surveys have shown that more than one-third of employers cite
poaching as a reason for not training. It is also true that training tends
to be high in industries where transferability of skills is low, such as in
the nuclear industry or teaching.
Employers' organisations used to run anti-poaching pacts, but such
agreements and the organisations themselves have now gone out of fashion.
With heightened awareness of the importance and expense of training, the
cost of poaching is a current concern. Greg Clark of the Business
Performance Group at the London School of Economics has calculated that the
average cost of losing a middle-ranking employee is Pounds 70,000. He
arrives at that figure by adding up the cost of recruitment, formal and
informal training, and an employee's learning curve.
Sig Prais at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research points
out that the easiest way to stop poaching is to follow the example of
Germany and to pay trainees low enough wages to make it economically
worthwhile for companies to over-train.
But as that seems to be impossible, erecting barriers against the training
free-riders is the best alternative. The Labour Party's idea is a training
levy, under which employers who did not spend 0.5 per cent of their wages
bill on training would have to pay that sum to a special fund.
But the government wants to examine how employers could extract some of the
cost of training from employees who leave before a specified period of time
has elapsed after training.
The government says that the legal uncertainty which currently plagues
attempts to do just that must be cleared up and the procedure brought within
the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals.
Michael Howard, the employment secretary, is a recent convert to the idea
that more must be done in this field. As recently as last month, he was
arguing that employers already have the means to bind people until some of
the cost of training has been repaid.
And recent legal precedent seems to support his original argument. In 1990,
a US company, Electronic Data Systems, won a battle in the High Court in
London to make an employee honour an agreement to pay Pounds 4,500 of his
training costs if he left within three years of completing a course. Such
contracts are common in the US, and although less common in the UK, they can
be found in sectors like information technology.
Viewing training as a loan which has to be repaid is a concept supported by
Clark. He says that companies like British Aerospace could specialise in
training and supply smaller companies which could not afford the cost of
expensive training equipment.
In such cases, it would presumably be the small employer who would pay, or
perhaps a combination of the small employer and the employee. Clearly, when
employers want to poach badly enough, they will simply 'buy-out' an
employee, as Goldman Sachs did recently when it paid Pounds 10,000 for a
Treasury economist.
However employers seem relatively cool towards the idea of greater use of
training contracts. The spring industry, based in Redditch, suffered badly
from poaching when the economy was booming. People trained as statistical
process controllers were often using their certificates as a ticket to a new
job.
But Michael Parkinson, chairman of Airdale Springs, says that restrictions
must not be put on people's career paths, adding that poaching is 'an
attitude problem not susceptible to legislation'. Edward Roberts, chairman
of Heath Springs, echoes that view, saying: 'Employees won't be poached from
good companies'. Peter Ashby, senior consultant of Fullemployment UK, does
not like the idea of 'transfer fees' believing that it is bad for the
employees. He prefers the idea of individual training accounts, already used
in many companies, where employees share in the cost of their training,
especially where it is of no immediate benefit to the employer.
One growing problem that transfer fees cannot deal with is the disincentive
to training in large organisations. An economist working in one of the
clearing banks has pointed out that since training budgets have been
devolved local managers want to train only for their immediate technical
needs and not send staff on general management courses.
But the new emphasis on repaying training costs ought to be welcomed by one
large part of the economy, the public sector, which has always over-trained
to the benefit of the private sector.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Management: Why youngsters are taking their parents to work
 -Childcare / Lisa Wood investigates the part played by Tecs in encouraging
the provision of nursery places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not until Kay Coleman became a director of her local Training and
Enterprise council (Tec) that she realised something was amiss in her own
company.
'One of the issues that kept coming up at Tec board meetings was nursery
provision in the Oldham area,' she says.
With an eye to recruitment at the medium-sized clothing company which she
runs, she decided to open a nursery. Because of the recession, she found
that hiring staff was less of a problem than she had expected.
However the nursery - which opened in 1990 and offers 30 places - is paying
off in other ways.
'We are getting increased productivity from mothers who bring their children
to the nursery. They tend to come in earlier, stay longer and appear more
settled.'
Oldham Tec may have provided the inspiration for the nursery but it provided
no money. But Oldham, along with the new network of 81 other Tecs, is
seeking to play a part as a partner and catalyst in the provision of
nurseries and child - care.
This is part of a wider brief of promoting opportunities for women -
including paying childcare costs for single-parent trainees. It is a role
most Tecs appear to be taking seriously, albeit in varying ways.
Some Tecs, including Hertfordshire Tec, are helping to set up nurseries in
partnership with employers and local authorities.
Others are training unemployed people to set-up after-school clubs.
As with other Tec activities, results vary in quantity and quality,
depending in part on how long a Tec has been established.
Many of those Tecs with the most progressive policies have female chief
executives, such as Olivia Grant at Tyneside Tec, or confident women board
members, such as Coleman at Oldham Tec.
A survey conducted last summer by The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations (NCVO) and Daycare Trust-The National Childcare Campaign
showed that:
More than one-third of the 50 Tecs that responded had a specific policy on
childcare. More than half had a strategy or statement on childcare.
More than half had an advisory group which considered childcare issues as
part of its remit.
Forty per cent had a staff member with responsibility for childcare issues.
Half had discussed with other agencies the development of local childcare
facilities, for the under fives, for after-school care and for holiday play
schemes.
A quarter had encouraged collaboration between employers and local
authorities on out-of-school and holiday childcare schemes, with a further
36 per cent proposing to do so.
The authors of the report said the seniority of members of staff with
responsibility had a direct influence on the extent to which childcare
issues were taken seriously.
Olivia Grant of Tyneside Tec said childcare was important from the start.
'It was a message we got from the community and was raised by several
employers too,' she says.
The Tec appointed an officer to investigate local childcare. Her
investigations showed patchy provision in the area, although some local
authorities, notably North Tyneside borough council, provided good
facilities.
She concluded that the greatest immediate need was after-school and holiday
care.
A pilot programme - called the Kids Club Enterprise Course - is being set
up, under which the Tec is training people to provide local childcare
facilities.
Places are funded under the Employment Training (ET) scheme for the
long-term unemployed.
The programme will be run by a local enterprise agency in partnership with
the Kids Club Network, a charity working to promote after-school care of
children.
Courses will include advice on developing business plans and how to acquire
premises.
The Tec believes its money is best used training people who want to work
with children rather than investing in bricks and mortar.
'We do not want to be an alternative social services department,' says
Grant.
As part of the aim to help individuals, the Tec will consider offering them
its Enterprise Allowance which gives financial help to unemployed people who
want to set up their own businesses.
Tyneside Tec, which has has a women's advisory group drawn from the local
population, has a number of other initiatives, including one to support
training courses for ethnic minority women who want to be child minders.
'We have not got all the answers but people are helping us to ask the right
questions and frame solutions which we hope will be effective,' says Grant.
This is the final article in the series on childcare. Previous articles
appeared on January 13, January 17, January 31 and February 10

Prime Minister's Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT SHELDON (Lab, Ashton-under-Lyne), a former Treasury minister,
highlighted the growing number of company failures in an attack on the
government's mismanagement of the economy yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
In Commons' question-time exchanges he asked Mr John Major, the prime
minister, if he had seen the three pages of advertisements in Tuesday's
Financial Times by the receivers and administrators of failed companies.
'This exercise is repeated in the Financial Times three times every week,'
he said.
He told the prime minister that it was the government's failure which really
needed to be brought to account.
Mr Major replied that the 'essential basics' for getting the economy right
included keeping inflation down, keeping interest rates down, having the
right tax structure and maintaining the improvement in industrial relations
attained in recent years.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown steps up efforts for
constitutional reform - Liberal Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday stepped up his efforts
to change Britain's political system - saying reforms would be 'at the
heart' of the party's election strategy.
Launching a campaign intended to raise the constitution as an issue, Mr
Ashdown emphasised that if Liberal Democrats were to form a post-election
pact in a hung parliament it would have to involve two parties working 'in
government'. This was Mr Ashdown's strongest hint yet that his party is
seeking at least one ministerial post.
He believes two parties working together would change the culture of British
politics and be popular with voters. Liberal Democrats are also proposing
home rule for Scotland, a bill of rights and a freedom of information act.
Mr Ashdown confirmed that in all 'foreseeable circumstances' he would vote
against a government on the Queen's speech - which sets out legislation for
the new parliament - if it did not back a fairer election system. That could
trigger a second general election. He also wants agreement on a four-year
programme of government.
Party strategists have deliberately not specified which ministerial posts
they would want, possibly reflecting a fear that too much speculation about
tactics would distract from main campaign themes. However, the party has
decided to make clear its basic position for a hung parliament.
Mr Ashdown would not commit himself to voting automatically against a
government that did not support proportional representation - in case
external factors meant it would not be in the national interest.
He also made clear that Liberal Democrats would be prepared to negotiate
with other parties on some of their demands, saying he should be allowed at
the time to decide 'what stroke to play'.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Birmingham plans rail station switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM'S main city-centre railway station will be replaced by a Pounds
50m out-of-town terminal under proposals put forward by British Rail and the
city council yesterday.
The new terminal would be built 1 1/2 miles north-east of Birmingham New
Street station in the redevelopment area administered by the Heartlands
Development Corporation.
All InterCity trains and some suburban trains using New Street would switch
to Heartlands, leaving New Street as a local station of half its present
size.
The Heartlands station, which would have road links with the nearby M6,
would have parking for 4,000 cars. It would be connected to the city centre
by local rail services and the planned Midland Metro light rapid-transit
network.
A substantial part of the cost of the project would be met by the
redevelopment of the city- centre land released by the shrinkage of New
Street station.
New Street is handling more than 600 trains a day - twice the number it was
designed for - and congestion is limiting plans for big increases in local
rail services.
Birmingham City Council said the project would not only produce a national
'gateway' station worthy of the city but provide for the next logical step
in the development of the city centre.
The proposed Heartlands terminal would be served mainly by existing tracks.
British Rail believes the project could be completed by the end of the
decade.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Action by Lloyd's Names: Expression of relief as settlement
is achieved - Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement is significant triumph for
those who acted to recover heavy losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAMES WHO joined Mr Peter Nutting in taking action against Outhwaite joined
yesterday in praising his role and the financial relief the settlement would
provide.
But many did not want to talk publicly about the arrangement. 'When all's
said and done it has been a very personal and painful experience,' said one
Name who wanted to remain anonymous yesterday. 'I'm just pleased it is all
over.'
Mr Robert Williams, a businessman with a Pounds 60,000 share of the
syndicate's income, against which he estimates he has already paid out
Pounds 280,000, said: 'My first impression is that the settlement is very
good. I will certainly be buying a magnum of champagne.
'My reaction is one of extreme pleasure and gratitude to Mr Nutting. Nobody
else took the slightest interest in our plight.'
Since he joined as a Name in 1973 he had expected an average return of about
10 per cent over the years. 'Outhwaite was a catastrophe far beyond anything
that had happened.
'For the last five years I have been waking up with a cloud over my head and
thinking I'll be bankrupted. There is no price you can put on the extreme
pain and suffering I suffered. It was like a creeping paralysis. I had to
sell my business, cash in my life insurance and borrow large sums.'
But he struck a note of caution about the decision. 'The big unknown is the
quantity of future losses. Until it is all capped one has to be very
cautious.'
Other Names were worried about the fact that Mr Outhwaite has still not been
able to close the 1982 underwriting year and that claims could continue to
come in. 'This is still a running sore,' added another Name.
Mr Geoffrey McLean sold his construction company to Tarmac in the 1970s and
invested some of the proceeds in becoming a Name. In spite of being one of
the beneficiaries of the settlement, he regrets that decision.
With a Pounds 25,000 line on Outhwaite he stands to recover more than Pounds
100,000 to set against losses incurred more recently.
'As the affair unfolded we could see we couldn't lose - the risks were
stupid. The idea of insurance is to spread the risk. Outhwaite concentrated
it.'
But the affair has 'soured his faith' in Lloyd's. 'I suppose I joined
because of a bit of greed, maybe something to do with the cachet. I'd have
been better off without it.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / DTI fails in attempt to wind up insurer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday failed in a petition to wind
up Secure &amp; Provide, a Hull-based insurance company, on 'public interest'
grounds.
Secure &amp; Provide traded briefly in early 1991, promoting an unorthodox
'pyramid selling' scheme for personal insurance packages. Its activities
were halted when the DTI appointed inspectors. A provisional liquidator was
appointed by the court last March.
Mr Justice Hoffmann said yesterday he was not satisfied that the public
interest required the company to be wound up. It would be 'unjust' and
'grossly disproportionate' to do so in response to the errors Mr John
Tyzack, who headed the business, had admittedly made in launching his
scheme.
The judge dismissed the petition and ordered the DTI to pay costs. He
directed that Pounds 40,000 raised from subscribers and held by the
liquidator should be returned to the company. Mr Tyzack said the money would
be released back to subscribers. Subscribers paid a Pounds 75-a-month
premium for a personal insurance package - including health, accident,
medical treatment, world travel and personal liability - with an inducement
to earn commission by recruiting others to buy.
It was not alleged that any aspects of Secure &amp; Provide's marketing scheme
contravened the 1973 Fair Trading Act regulating pyramid selling, and there
was no evidence that the company misapplied any premium money.
In launching his scheme in January last year, Mr Tyzack ran into problems
when Lloyd's pulled out and he had to try to arrange underwriting from other
insurance companies. This was after a brochure had been printed describing
the scheme as 'underwritten at Lloyd's'.
The DTI alleged that this and other statements put out about the company
amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation by Mr Tyzack.
But the judge said he accepted Mr Tyzack had acted in good faith.
Until mid February 1991, Mr Tyzack honestly believed that the main elements
of his scheme were underwritten by Lloyd's, and he did not intend to
deceive, said the judge.
The judge added: 'Once Lloyd's had withdrawn, Mr Tyzack took steps to ensure
that customers were made aware that cover would not be with Lloyd's and gave
anyone who was dissatisfied with the change the opportunity to ask for his
money back. After that date he also made it clear that alternative cover was
in negotiation and not yet settled.'
The DTI said later that yesterday's case was only the second 'public
interest' petition it had lost in recent years. The first time the DTI
failed to get a winding-up order was in 1987, but it won that case on appeal
a year later.
The DTI has not yet decided whether to appeal against yesterday's judgment.

<TEXT>
THE Pakistan army yesterday stopped Moslem militants crossing the ceasefire
line in the disputed state of Kashmir, averting a flare-up in which Indian
and Pakistan defence forces could have been involved.
Members of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) came as close as 1
km to some parts of the ceasefire line in their threatened attempt to cross
it yesterday, but most were prevented from getting anywhere near.
Observers from the Indian side of the line saw small groups of JKLF
volunteers pushed back at many points, and officials in New Delhi reported
no one had got across.
There were reports that the JKLF would make another attempt today but Indian
officials do not take these seriously. This is because Pakistan has conveyed
to the Indian government that no crossing would be permitted.
Commanders of the two armies were in constant touch with each other to
ensure that any attempt at crossing the line did not escalate.
Mr SB Chavan, Indian minister for home affairs, expressed his satisfaction
at the turn of events, including Pakistan's 'positive approach' in
preventing the militants crossing.

BEIJING-controlled China Resources has dropped plans to participate in a

Kong. Li confirmed the decision and said: 'We will continue to study our
future strategies for developing banking business.'
The takeover of the local subsidiary of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, led by The Hongkong Chinese Bank, has been persistently
delayed by snags centring on an expected Abu Dhabi guarantee for unrecorded
liabilities.
China Resources, which has diverse Hong Kong holdings, had shown interest in
taking a 30 per cent stake in the consortium which agreed to buy BCCHK's
assets and recorded liabilities from the government last November.
No-one would comment at Hongkong Chinese Bank, part of Indonesia's Lippo

THE International Monetary Fund will approve resumption of the remaining
Dollars 250m (Pounds 138m) of a standby facility in support of the
Philippines' economic stabilisation programme, it was claimed in Manila
yesterday, Jose Galang writes from Manila.
President Corazon Aquino said the IMF management was circulating a staff
report on her government's request for the financial support among its
executive board. Mr Jose Cuisia, central bank governor, said approval by the
IMF executive board in early March would be a formality.
IMF approval should trigger separate talks with Manila's commercial bank
creditors on restructuring Dollars 5.3bn debt, and with the Paris Club of
donor countries and multilateral financing institutions in March.
The IMF management's approval came after Manila won new revenue measures
from congress last week before it wound up its last session under the Aquino
administration. The new tax measures helped the government to produce fiscal
targets within ceilings sought by the IMF.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Democratic rivals begin to fear Tsongas: Lionel Barber sees
the Massachusetts long shot on the New Hampshire campaign trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PALACE Theatre was packed with students, anti-nuclear activists, a woman
in a Spitting Image mask of Margaret Thatcher, and a cross-section of the
earnest, well-informed voters of New Hampshire. The candidate, a slightly
built man who turns 51 this week, shuffled on stage to a huge burst of
applause.
Former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts is enjoying his 15 minutes of
fame in the Democratic presidential campaign. With less than a week
remaining until next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Mr Tsongas, the long
shot, has drawn level with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early
favourite dogged by accusations of adultery and draft-dodging during the
Vietnam war.
'When I entered the race 10 months ago, George Bush stood at 91 per cent in
the polls. Today he is in the mid-40s. I have done one hell of a job for
this country,' says Mr Tsongas, the candidate whom Richard Nixon describes
as 'too responsible' to become the Democratic nominee.
The rise of Mr Tsongas, the self-styled pro-business liberal, is one of the
more improbable stories of the 1992 election campaign. A Greek American from
Massachusetts, he is a cancer survivor who cannot raise money, a candidate
who three months ago stood at barely 2 per cent in the national opinion
polls, the man who has turned dourness into a political virtue.
'For most political analysts, I don't compute,' he says, showing the
self-deprecating humour which has become his trademark. 'But I know what it
will take to turn this economy round. I am not afraid to tell the truth.'
More than 450 people gathered at the Palace Theatre on Monday night to
listen to Mr Tsongas. He cast himself as the man who can make America
competitive in the international market, restore manufacturing and create
new jobs. In New Hampshire, which has suffered more than most states during
the recession, this is the message which sells.
The gospel according to Paul is one of economic austerity. He dismisses the
middle-class tax cut favoured by other Democratic candidates as a gimmick;
he wants to reduce the Dollars 400bn (Pounds 220.9bn) federal budget deficit
(although he is vague on how he would cut spending); he supports a capital
gains tax cut and relaxing anti-trust laws to make US corporations more
competitive with Japanese and German counterparts. He is unashamedly in
favour of free trade.
Asked to condemn the Bush administration's proposed North American
free-trade pact with Mexico on the grounds that American jobs 'will go
south', Mr Tsongas says: 'I don't wish to compete with Mexico, Thailand and
Indonesia. I want to compete with Japan and Germany. I want high wages and
high value-added products.'
President Tsongas - which almost sounds as remote a prospect as President
Dukakis, his fellow Greek American from Massachusetts defeated by George
Bush in 1988 - would spend most of his time running USA Inc. 'My job is to
figure out what works, how do you compete?' he says.
It is a narrow vision of the presidency which reduces the world to one long
economic struggle; it offers little clue as to how he would handle, say, the
role of commander-in-chief. Recognising this, Mr Tsongas tried on Monday
night to spell out a more expansive vision.
In a moving speech about his battle with cancer, during which he suffered
radiation equivalent to being within a mile of Hiroshima, Mr Tsongas spoke
of the strength of purpose and obligation which it has brought to his life.
It was an effective performance.
Still, large questions loom over the Tsongas candidacy. By his own
admission, he is desperately short of cash. He may not be able to withstand
the rigours of a long campaign, although a recent television advert shows
him swimming vigorously to underline his physical recovery. More important,
his appeal outside his home base in the north-east looks limited.
These weaknesses suggest it is too early to write off Mr Clinton, who raised
more than Dollars 500,000 at a New York dinner on Monday night, despite
lingering suspicions that he has been badly wounded by the 'character
issue'.
His supporters insist that Mr Clinton does not need to win New Hampshire to
remain a viable candidate, but they have yet to find a way to inoculate him
against further allegations of marital infidelity. And other Democratic
candidates have begun to smell blood.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose campaign remains
stalled in third place behind Mr Tsongas and Mr Clinton, said on Monday:
'One of the worst attributes of politicians is when they begin to feel sorry
for themselves.'
The latest opinion polls suggest that one in two voters in New Hampshire
remain undecided. So far Mr Tsongas has escaped attack; but now he is
jockeying with Mr Clinton at the head of the Democratic pack, it is only a
matter of time before he comes under the same scrutiny as Mr Clinton.

build the hardware based on Vancouver's Skytrain.
The 40km Bangkok system, due in operation in 1997, will have 37 stations,

The cost has risen more than Dollars 500m since the original bid in 1988.
Since then the Thai government has changed and Lavalin, the original
Canadian consortium member, went bankrupt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EIGHT Amazonian Pact countries have signed a charter which demands
financial and technological help from the industrial world for environmental
protection and blames developed countries for environmental degradation.
Known as the Declaration of Manaus, it spells out their joint position for
the Earth Summit to take place in Rio in June. Its tough language seems a
further indication that the conference will turn into a showdown between the
developed and developing worlds.
'The solution of environmental problems is intimately linked to a new
attitude of international co-operation, which means increased financial
resources, greater access to technology, augmenting trade flow and measures
to resolve the foreign debt problem,' the accord said. It was signed during
a meeting in Manaus of presidents or representatives of Brazil, Colombia,
Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Surinam, Peru and Venezuela.
The document pledges the countries to preserve the Amazon, the world's
largest rainforest, but insists that they will not accept conditions imposed
by the first world. Brazil's own position paper rejects any international
monitoring of the Amazon and calls for a global environment fund to be
administered by the World Bank.
During the conference's opening ceremony, Brazil's President Fernando Collor
de Mello lashed out at the 'super-rich' nations which, he said, were
'embarrassed but still not penitent for the damage they are doing to the
planet, themselves and future generations'.
He warned: 'As long as poor countries are restricted from access to capital,
technology and better living conditions they will be forced to interfere
with the environment,' adding 'we can't have an environmentally healthy
planet and a socially unjust world'.
Brazilian monthly inflation hit almost 26 per cent last month - its highest
level for almost two years. The figure, released by Sao Paulo university,
was a disappointment to Economy Ministry officials who had been hoping that
their continuing tight monetary policy would result in a stabilisation
around the December level of 23.25 per cent.

<TEXT>
SRI LANKA'S donors and the World Bank have pledged Dollars 825m (Pounds
456m) in aid for 1992. 'We requested Dollars 800m,' said Mr D G Wijetunge,
the prime minister, who is also the minister of finance, after his return
from the annual Paris meeting of donors. Japan led the league of donors,
followed by the World Bank and the US.
Three EC countries and Canada in particular were critical of the
government's human rights record.
After the visit of a Canadian parliamentary team, Canada had argued for a
cut or suspension of aid as in the case of Kenya, where aid has been
deferred for six months. However, the World Bank's view that the government
has made a serious attempt to address human rights issues was endorsed by
the leading donors, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank.
The World Bank report stressed that an end to the decade-long war against
separatist Tamil rebels was crucial for economic growth.
Sri Lankan growth, which exceeded 6 per cent in 1990 was 5 per cent last
year. This compares to 2 per cent growth in the previous three years.
Recent policy reforms have yielded results, the report added. Inflation has
fallen from 20 per cent in 1990 to 9 per cent. The rapid growth of
non-traditional exports has offset the impact of lower tea prices. Garments
and gem stones are now top exchange earners.
While commending the government on its privatisation programme and cuts in
the budget of a huge civil service, the report urges reforms in the
plantation sector (tea, mainly) and two large state banks. Opposition and
trade union protest on both issues is mounting.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Kuwait defence pact lifts UK hopes of sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK-KUWAITI defence agreement signed yesterday should produce 'valuable
orders for British industry,' according to Mr Tom King, British defence
secretary.
He indicated that he had discussed supplies of equipment including Vickers
Challenger 2 tanks and GKN Warrior armoured fighting vehicles.
Kuwait is also thought to be interested in naval vessels from the Vosper
Thornycroft shipyard, which is supplying minehunters to Saudi Arabia.
Vosper is part of a British consortium with the construction companies
Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey which has been selected to rebuild and upgrade
Kuwait's main naval base. This contract alone is expected to be worth up to
Pounds 200m.
Kuwait is awaiting delivery of 16 Tucano trainer aircraft from Short
Brothers which it bought before the 1990 Gulf crisis and is thought to be
interested in British Aerospace Hawk jet trainers.
However, UK hopes of orders totalling some Pounds 1bn are tempered by the
certainty of strong competition. Sheikh Ali Salah al-Salem al-Salah, the
Kuwait defence minister, said yesterday a similar defence pact was planned
with France and other countries. One has been concluded with the US.
'In due time you might hear about other agreements,' the minister said.
Yesterday's memorandum of understanding, which Mr King said would be 'the
father of other understandings' in specific areas, also covers training
assistance and joint exercises, the first of which is due to take place in
early May involving the UK navy and Royal Marines.

<TEXT>
THE KUWAITI government is going ahead with plans to build a Dollars 1.8bn
(Pounds 990m) power plant - the largest construction project since the Gulf
war ended a year ago.
Mitsubishi of Japan, the lead contractor on the project, is likely to supply
boilers and turbines worth about Dollars 1bn.
The company has been in delicate negotiations with the Kuwaiti government
over the cost of the deal, which is expected to be finalised within the next
few months.
Mitsubishi originally won the contract in 1989 but the project was put on
hold because of the Iraqi invasion the following year. The Kuwaiti
government has since been trying to hold Mitsubishi to prices agreed under
the 1989 contract.
Mr Ahmed al-Adsany, minister for electricity and water, said yesterday the
government had already committed a substantial amount to the project,
including a KD54m (Pounds 101m) advance payment to Mitsubishi and smaller
sums to sub-contractors. Agreement had been reached with a group of Turkish
companies to build the plant's foundations, roads and other installations,
Mr al-Adsany said.
Kuwait's power stations were severely damaged during the Iraqi occupation.
The government has decided against repairing one of its five plants, which
was virtually destroyed.
Repairs to the other four have so far restored less than one-third of
Kuwait's pre-war capacity of 7,200MW, but this is enough to meet current low
levels of demand.

<TEXT>
US environmentalists see Gatt as dominated by business, and Gatt
pronouncements as the inevitable output of an organisation which has no
mechanism to balance the competing interests of business and environment.
Mr John Audley of the Sierra Club sees little possibility of developing an
international consensus on effective rules to limit environmental damage.
'Environmental rules rarely have broad support. Rules have costs,' he said.
The scientific evidence demonstrating the need for them is often
controversial. The tendency is for those who have to pay the costs to put
downward pressure on the standards. International environmental compacts are
rarely effective because they lack enforcement mechanisms, he said. Gatt is
saying, 'environmental leaders can no longer lead because they have to wait
for the rest of the world to follow'.
Ms Lori Wallach of Public Citizen scoffs at the assumption that a country
which industrialises will put new revenues into an environmental clean-up.
'Unless there is some mechanism to direct revenue into environmental
activity, the evidence is it absolutely won't happen,' Ms Wallach said,
citing as an example the Maquedora region - the environmental scandal of the
US-Mexico border. Mexico and the US have just begun funding environmental
programmes there because the governments want passage of a North American
Free Trade Agreement.
Mr Rick Hind of Greenpeace views the Gatt trade and environment report as
consistent with the 'generally undemocratic approach' of an organisation
'subservient to multilateral corporations' and says that it is dangerous to
estimate environmental costs in purely economic terms.
'The native Americans, who are not signatories to the Gatt, have it right
when they say we must consider the effect of everything we do seven
generations hence,' Mr Hind said.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: Ivory sale ban fails to halt
poaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAN on world trade in ivory is insufficient to stop elephant poaching, a
report from the World Wide Fund for Nature re-vealed yesterday. Other
independent research goes further, arguing that as a trade measure the ban
will provide short-term relief at best.
Its success in curbing trade in ivory is due to the raised awareness created
by publicity around the ban, and should not lull those concerned over the
plight of elephant populations into concluding that the ban itself is likely
to be effective.
The need for dramatic action was accepted by all parties when in October
1989 signatories to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered
Species (Cites) voted for an indefinite ban on trade in elephant products.
In the decade to 1988, Africa's elephant population had fallen from 1.2m to
600,000. Annual exports of unworked ivory had risen from 200-400 tonnes a
year in the 1950s to an average close to 1,000 tonnes in the 1980s, earning
between Dollars 35m-Dollars 45m (Pounds 19.4m-Pounds 25m) for ivory
exporters.
Yesterday's World Wide Fund for Nature report remains committed to the need
for a total ban - but says better park protection and further financial
assistance are needed 'in order for the ban to be effective in most parts of
Africa'.
'While the ban may have played a role in reducing illegal hunting, other
factors such as additional law enforcement and financial assistance may have
more directly contributed to a reduction in poaching,' the report argues.
There is consensus that the trade ban has led to a collapse in demand for
worked ivory, particularly in the US and Europe.
But Dr Richard Luxmoore at the Wildlife Conservation Monitoring Centre in
Cambridge argues this fall is perhaps due more to enhanced awareness about,
and concern over, the threat to elephant populations than it is to the ban.
He points to a similar collapse in demand for fur products in the US and
Europe, which has been achieved without any comprehensive ban.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: Incentives needed for clean
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Gatt report argues that in general positive incentives to comply with
international environmental agreements will be more effective than trade
sanctions.
Such incentives are a key feature of proposals to introduce a system of
tradeable pollution permits to combat global warming, now being studied by
the Geneva-based United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(Unctad).
This system, proponents claim, could control global emissions of carbon
dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, while allowing developing countries to
continue industrialisation - a process that involves more use of fossil
fuels and so CO emissions.
At the same time, Third World nations would have an incentive to grow more
'cleanly'.
Under the plan, outlined in a report to be published by Unctad this spring,
each country would be allocated a quota of tradeable carbon emission
entitlements (TCEEs).
Worldwide, these would add to whatever CO emission targets were set by
international agreement, for instance, in any protocol to the framework
convention on climate change due for signing at the UN earth summit next
June.
However, developing countries would be allocated more permits than they
needed, while industrialised countries would get fewer.
Surplus permits would be tradeable on an international exchange, so
providing poor nations with finance to speed development. It would
nevertheless pay developing countries to invest the money in clean
technologies, so as to minimise the number of permits needed to 'cover' CO
emissions.
Rich countries would also benefit from the scheme by comparison with
alternatives, Unctad argues.
It would bring on board an international agreement big potential polluters
like China and India, with huge fossil fuel reserves.
Both have said they cannot accept constraints on growth imposed by a global
warming accord without massive transfers of aid and technology. The scheme
would also minimise the economic costs of limiting carbon dioxide emissions
in the industrialised world, by ensuring that reductions are made first
where the cost of doing so is least.
This is because countries have an incentive to cut CO emissions wherever it
costs less to do so than buying a permit in the market.
The report adds that an international system of trade-able permits is
compatible with any domestic mechanism for tackling carbon dioxide
emissions.
In addition to the conventional regulatory approach, the United States is
experimenting with pollution permits under the 1990 Clean Air Act, while the
European Community has plans for a carbon tax.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: EC plan for carbon tax may become
test case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's plan to introduce a carbon tax could become an
important test case in the mounting conflict between trade and environmental
interests.
The plan is still in its early stages, but Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC's
environment commissioner, has made clear that he wants to have a firm
proposal to display at the Rio earth summit in June. He expects that event
to provide a forum for thorough debate of the issues. The tax is by far the
most ambitious environment measure ever contemplated. It will affect 350m
people and drive up the cost of the most basic industrial commodity, energy.
Its fate is therefore a focus of intense environmental interest.
The tax would be imposed on all carbon fuels - oil, gas and coal - and on
other fuels in proportion to their energy content. The aim is to cut harmful
emissions and help combat global warming, in addition to encouraging energy
saving. The tax would be introduced at the rate of Dollars 3 a barrel of
oil, and increased by Dollars 1 a year until it reached Dollars 10. Mr Ripa
di Meana hopes to start it next year, but that schedule may prove too tight
politically.
The tax would affect trade in two ways. First, it would unilaterally raise
the cost of EC exports and thereby blunt the Community's competitiveness in
world markets. For this reason it is strongly opposed by a wide swathe of EC
industry.
Second, as non-EC countries see it, it would create a kind of invisible
trade barrier by adding to the entry cost for outside businesses seeking to
set up production plants within the EC. This barrier would be especially
high for companies from the third world who had not adjusted their
technologies to the rigours of a highly taxed market. Because of all these
conflicting pressures, prospects for the tax are far from clear. In its
favour, a wide range of EC ministers - finance, economic, environmental and
energy - have supported it in principle. They could hardly do otherwise
because of the tax's self-evidently worthy aims.
Mr Ripa di Meana's dilemma is that he is keen to win approval for a measure
that will show that the EC is serious about safeguarding the environment.
But he also knows that, by itself, the EC's carbon tax would make little
difference. At the moment, the EC accounts for only 13 per cent of world
carbon dioxide emissions, and many large sectors of EC industry like steel
and cement would be exempt.
It will only have meaning if the EC's example prompts other countries to
follow suit. That means mainly the US and Japan, but the chances of either
of these two enacting a similar tax are very remote. The US has a deep
antipathy to energy taxes, and Japan argues that its pollution regulations
are already tough enough and it does not need any taxes on top of them.
Similarly the third world does not appear ready to enact energy taxes; many
countries take the view that this is the responsibility of the gas-guzzling
industrial countries.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: Malaysia ridicules enemies of
timber trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DR Mahathir Mohammed, the Malaysian prime minister, devotes a good deal of
his time these days to ridiculing western environmentalists and criticising
their attempts to restrict trade in tropical timber.
At last month's summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in
Singapore, he pointed out that the rich industrialised countries, having
deforested their own land, were now causing most of the world's pollution
while begging developing countries not to cut down trees.
He disputed the idea that tropical forests were a common heritage of the
world and - perhaps letting his imagination get carried away - claimed that
wealthy, technologically advanced nations could plant even deserts with
tropical hardwoods and so triple the area of tropical timberland within a
century.
More forests can be saved by preventing forest fires or putting them out
quickly, Dr Mahathir added, than by boycotting the export of tropical timber
or advocating that forest dwellers remain in the forest, eating monkeys and
suffering from all kinds of tropical diseases.
Malaysia has good reason to be defensive about the timber trade. It accounts
for nearly half the world's recorded exports of tropical timber, compared to
26.7 per cent for Indonesia and a mere 2.4 per cent for Brazil.
That Brazil - the most notorious environmental villain to ordinary,
green-thinking people - should account for so small share of the trade is
perhaps the best illustration of the lack of correlation between
deforestation and timber exports.
The Gatt report on the environment takes up this theme with enthusiasm,
saying that a ban on trade in logs and processed tropical timber would have
a miniscule effect because such exports amount to less than 1 per cent of
the trees felled in developing countries. Those calling for restrictions on
tropical timber exports have an especially unconvincing case for trade
restraints on environmental grounds, the report says.
Environmentalists would be the first to agree that general deforestation is
usually the result of farming or tree-cutting for fuel (as wood or charcoal)
rather than logging.
Nor would they dispute the Gatt report's assertions that deforestation could
be slowed by compensating lower-income countries for preserving large
forests and by promoting employment and income growth for the rural poor.
But they note that loggers build roads which allow others to encroach on
virgin forest (even if it is true that the - all too rare - responsible
logging enterprises protect their concessions from illegal loggers for their
own financial benefit).
The environmentalists also say that the arguments deployed by the likes of
the Malaysian government and the Gatt report tend to lump trees together as
if they were all of the same species.
The problem is not just one of deforestation, they say, but the
indiscriminate harvesting of rare hardwoods which need decades to regenerate
themselves.
With a logging ban announced, if not enforced, in Thailand, Thai
entrepreneurs have taken to plundering the teak and other hardwood trees of
Burma, Laos and Cambodia, a trade which also allows them to disguise
illegally felled Thai trees as imports from neighbouring countries.
I don't know how you can control that if you don't put controls on trade,
says one environmentalist in Bangkok.

CABLETRON Systems, a US-based manufacturer of computer networking hardware,
is to establish a European manufacturing base in Ireland this year,
following a rapid growth in sales over the past three years, writes Tim
Coone from Dublin.
The IPounds 12m (Pounds 11.17m) manufacturing facility will be located at
the Plassey Technological Park in Limerick, a focal point for electronic
industry development in the west of Ireland.
The project is being part-funded by Ireland's Industrial Development
Authority (IDA), and will also be able to take advantage of Ireland's low
corporate tax rate of 10 per cent.
The company, founded in 1983, manufactures 'intelligent hubs', which enable
computers of diverse design and architecture to link together into local
area networks.
Its projected world sales for 1992 are Dollars 290m (Pounds 160.2m), 25 per
cent of which will be for the European market.
There are now about 250 electronics companies located in Ireland, employing
26,000 people.
Exports of electronic equipment and parts now comprise approximately 20 per
cent of Ireland's total exports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE Serb irregulars and one Croat guardsman were killed yesterday in the
most serious single violation of the five-week-old ceasefire in Yugoslavia,
writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
Belgrade radio said the three Serbs were killed and two were wounded around
Vukovar and Vinkovci, eastern Croatia, when Croat forces fired on
Serb-controlled positions. According to Croatian radio, the Croat soldier
died and two were injured in an artillery attack launched by Serb fighters
in the same region of eastern Croatia. Croat leaders have vowed to reclaim
the eastern Croatian region of Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srem currently
controlled by the Serb-dominated federal army.
A western diplomat yesterday said: 'It is not yet clear if the most recent
violations are just isolated incidents in eastern Croatia where the truce is
most fragile. The danger of renewed clashes increases the longer it takes to
deploy the (United Nations) peacekeepers. This delay, coupled with the
apparent Croatian build-up and its more aggressive stance, could seriously
jeopardise the ceasefire.'
Meanwhile, Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, said an extra 25 unarmed
UN liaison officers had arrived yesterday, bringing to 76 the number
bolstering communications in crisis zones.
UN officials last week said the ceasefire was stable enough to despatch a
force of 10,000 peacekeepers. But consistent opposition from Mr Milan Babic,
president of Krajina, a Serb enclave in Croatia, has delayed the deployment
of UN forces. Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president, has also raised
objections over police control of Krajina and other Serb-held territories in
Croatia.

FT  12 FEB 92 / MEPs vote for tobacco advertising ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Parliament voted yesterday to back a Commission proposal to ban
all tobacco advertising, except at the point of sale, reports David Gardner
from Strasbourg.
It was passed in spite of intense lobbying by the tobacco industry to water
down the measure.
The proposal will now go before a meeting of EC health ministers in May,
where it has still to overcome a blocking minority of member states formed
by the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. This minority was weakened when
Denmark recently changed its position.
The ban was backed by 150 out of 285 Euro-MPs who voted, with 123 against
and 12 abstentions.
The Commission's support centred on the majority of the socialist group, the
largest bloc in Strasbourg, backed by MEPs from the Greens, Gaullists, and
the group made up largely of the former Italian Communist Party.
Christian Democrats, Tory MEPs, and German Social Democrats voted against
the ban. The latter argued that it was contradictory to prohibit advertising
of a legal product.
The MEPs voted through a series of amendments which in general would stiffen
the Commission proposal by allowing member states to take even tougher
action, and by tightly circumscribing any possibility of getting round the
directive by resorting to indirect advertising.
As often occurs in the European Parliament, a potentially contradictory
amendment - put on the agenda by the UK Conservative group - also got
through. This would allow all advertising except where public health is at
risk.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Election fever gains sway over political parties in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTION fever is beginning to overtake political horse-trading in Bonn's
corridors of power, as the April polling day in two key regional elections -
in south-western Baden-Wurttemberg and northern Schleswig-Holstein - looms
closer.
Yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), served
notice that they will table within two weeks a controversial amendment to
the German constitution to restrict the sweeping right of refugees to
political asylum. The move is a blatant pre-election manoeuvre, for it will
not be put to the vote before the polls.
At the same time the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are set to reject the
government's tax reform package on Friday, in the upper house of the German
parliament, in a counter-attempt to gain electoral advantage.
The SPD also announced yesterday it will not vote in favour of ratification
of the EC Treaty of European Union, signed in Maastricht on Saturday,
without improvements being negotiated. It hardened its charge against Mr
Kohl that he had failed to gain an adequate deal on political union to match
concessions he made on monetary union.
Most of the manoeuvring has an air of shadow-boxing, yet it does concern the
most contentious issues of the day.
The CDU's trump card for the elections is public indignation at the rising
tide of asylum-seeking and immigration. The SPD and the Free Democrats
(FDP), junior partners in the coalition government, reject anything so
drastic as a constitutional change to restrict rights of asylum. The CDU and
CSU argue anything less will fail to stem the tide coming from eastern and
southern Europe, and the third world.
The state of the economy, and above all the rising burden of taxation to pay
for unification, is the focus of the SPD's campaign. Its leaders are
hammering away at Mr Kohl, saying he won the unification election - in
December 1990 - with a 'tax lie,' that he would not raise taxes to pay for
it.
The government's current proposal, for an increase in value-added tax from
14 to 15 per cent next year, is presented as another back door tax rise to
pay for unification.
Baden-Wurttemberg is critical for Mr Kohl. It is the last western state
ruled by the CDU, after a series of disastrous regional defeats in recent
years, and a bad result would gravely undermine the credibility of the
federal government.
However resentment at the rising flow of asylum-seekers into the prosperous
south-west should help him.
In Schleswig-Holstein, the SPD is on the defensive. The party's national
chairman, Mr Bjorn Engholm, is state prime minister. His image is one of a
likeable intellectual who does not really want to be chancellor, an image he
needs to allay with a decisive victory.
So the CDU is tabling radical reforms on asylum which stand no realistic
chance of being approved (both the SPD and FDP oppose them), and the SPD is
opposing a tax package the central element of which - the VAT rise - seems
certain to get eventual acceptance.

FT  12 FEB 92 / UK may face court action if it continues EC passport checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is set to warn Britain soon that it faces court
action unless after the start of next year it ceases checks on travellers
arriving from other EC states.
If the warning is issued by June, it could coincide with a sensitive UK
general election campaign. If it comes after June the UK will have taken
over the EC presidency.
The Commission's work programme for 1992, which will be presented to the
European Parliament today states the warning will be made 'shortly'.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the internal market commissioner, said this week he
will have ready next month the legal opinion in favour of doing away with
all passport checks on travellers crossing internal EC frontiers.
This legal opinion will be on the implications of the 1986 Single European
Act's definition of the internal market as 'an area without internal
frontiers'.
Most continental EC states (which have themselves formed the Schengen free
travel accord) agree with Brussels that the Act requires abolition of all
intra-EC border controls. But the UK, with some backing from Denmark and
Ireland, contends the act still gives it the right to control non-EC (and
thus in practice EC) citizens and to undertake anti-terrorist and drug
checks at sea and airports.
Most of the Commission's 1992 programme confirms the current change in the
EC executive's role, from architect to manager of the single EC market.
Thus, apart from completing legislation on financial services, public
procurement, corporate tax, data protection, food and drug marketing, much
of the emphasis is on monitoring the application of existing single market
directives. There are, for example, 60 of these affecting agriculture, and
Brussels says it needs a new veterinary agency to implement the animal
health measures.
Accompanying policies to improve and free up telecommunications, energy and
transport networks are also given high priority, while in the
non-legislative field Brussels says it will be gearing up to help bring
monetary and a common foreign policy about.
While the Maastricht treaty has heightened the Commission's ambitions
further, the treaty's clause on 'subsidiarity' or states' rights has
apparently made it wary about how it achieves these ambitions.
The EC executive promises to 'resist over-legislation and intervention' in
policy areas which can be dealt with at national, regional or local levels.
Perhaps fearing a backlash from member states, the Commission even admits
that 'its future existence depends on' it fully complying with the principle
of subsidiarity.
The Commission wants to do nothing to upset ratification of the Maastricht
treaty this year by the 12 national parliaments. It therefore plans to keep
member states better informed of its more sensitive actions. As the 1992
programme says, 'an efficient early-warning system will be particularly
important to avoid ruffling national feathers as a new era dawns for
Europe'.

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE previously well-integrated nuclear network of the former Soviet Union
has been thrown into disarray by disagreements between the recently formed
republics. The most immediate and dangerous result is the difficulty Ukraine
now faces disposing of its nuclear waste.
Yesterday, directors of Ukrainian nuclear power stations were in the Russian
region of Krasnoyarsk to salvage a deal allowing them to continue shipping
nuclear waste to the sparsely-populated region.
Traditionally, the 10 VVR1000 nuclear reactors in Ukraine have stored their
waste in Krasnoyarsk. But this year, according to Ukraine's industry
minister, Mr Viktor Hladush, the region attached food supplies to the issue.
In exchange for guarantees that Ukraine will supply butter and sugar at 1991
levels, Mr Hladush believes Krasnoyarsk will take the waste. Ukraine has
undertaken to supply the Russian republic but Krasnoyarsk leaders are
insisting on a separate agreement.
Mr Hladush warned that as the Soviet economy disintegrated each link in the
Soviet nuclear power chain was fragile. 'From Zhovti Vody (in south-eastern
Ukraine) to Krasnoyarsk, every region could put forward a similar
ultimatum,' he said.
He added that Ukraine had also to find new purchasers for uranium and heavy
water because cuts in the Soviet nuclear arsenal had reduced domestic
requirements. The problem, he said, was that 'we cannot sell to those
countries who want to buy'. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry has highlighted a
new source of tension with Russia over the division of conventional forces.
An official said Russia was demanding two-thirds of all land-based hardware
belonging to what was once the Soviet army and three-quarters of all
aircraft.
Ukraine insists on keeping all military hardware, apart from nuclear
missiles, stationed on its territory.
Some of the best hardware is stationed in Ukraine. It would also be
difficult to transfer the conventional forces from Ukraine without the
republic's consent because nearly half of all Soviet soldiers stationed
there have sworn an oath of allegiance to Ukraine.
A Ukrainian defence official said agreement with Russia was close on
strategic forces, which had been viewed as the more contentious issue.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S new prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, yesterday replaced eight
of Mr Charles Haughey's 14-strong cabinet, and moved three others.
The most significant change is at the Foreign Ministry, where Mr Gerry
Collins has been replaced by Mr David Andrews. Mr Collins has been a central
figure in Anglo-Irish talks on Northern Ireland and had a good working
relationship with Mr Peter Brooke, the UK Northern Ireland secretary. The
failure to make any political breakthrough, though, had left his cabinet
post in doubt, and Mr Andrews' appointment clears the way for possible new
initiatives. Mr Andrews has held front-bench posts since the 1970s, and was
a junior foreign minister from 1977 to 1979.
Mr Bertie Ahern stays at finance, reflecting Mr Reynold's concern to assure
the markets of continuity in economic policy. The two posts held by the
Progressive Democrats, the coalition partners, are also unchanged - Mr Des
O'Malley at industry and Mr Bobby Molloy at energy.
Senior ministerial posts have been given to former environment minister Mr
Padraig Flynn, and Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn and Mr Michael Smith, both
junior ministers sacked with Mr Reynolds by Mr Haughey last November. Mr
Flynn takes over the justice portfolio from Mr Ray Burke, and will be a key
figure in talks on Northern Ireland. Mrs Quinn has been given transport and
telecommunications, Mr Smith environment.
Also dropped from the cabinet are Mrs Mary O'Rourke (health), Mr Michael
O'Kennedy (agriculture), Mr Brendan Daly (social welfare), Mr Rory O'Hanlon
(environment), Mr Noel Davern (education), Mr Vincent Brady (defence).
Other new faces in the cabinet are Mr Brian Cowan at labour, Mr John
O'Connell at health, Mr Joe Walsh at agriculture, and Mr Charlie McCreevy at
social welfare. A cheer went up in parliament at the announcement of Mr
McCreevy's name. He is a long-standing opponent of Mr Haughey and led
efforts to oust him in the early 1980s.
Mr Noel Dempsey, a young backbencher at the forefront of the most recent
rebellion against Mr Haughey, has been appointed Fianna Fail chief whip.
Mr Reynolds was sworn in yesterday as prime minister after having been
elected 84-78 in parliament.
In a final statement as premier Mr Haughey said: 'If I were to seek any
accolade. . . . it would simply be: He served the people, all the people, to
the best of his abilities'.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Menem to assure Europe of Argentina's growth potential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina is describing his visit to Europe this
week as a publicity offensive, 'to explain to the Europeans why Argentina
has become a country of stability and growth'.
He is anxious to dispel doubts about the depth and sustainability of
sweeping economic liberalisation that reduced inflation and helped the
economy grow 5 per cent last year.
Monthly inflation, down to 0.6 per cent in December, rose to 3 per cent in
January, threatening an economic strategy that seeks to hold inflation down
to international levels.
Mr Menem's trip, during which he will not sign any significant agreements,
will include his first official visit to the European Community headquarters
in Brussels tomorrow. It will end in Paris next Tuesday after Mr Menem has
met President Francois Mitterrand.
He is unlikely to make headway in Argentina's overriding trade dispute with
Brussels: the Community's subsidised farm exports. Cheap EC exports have
undercut Argentina's grain and beef exports.
None the less, Argentina clearly wants to develop its trade, investment and
political ties with the Community. The EC is Argentina's largest trade
partner, buying Dollars 3.7bn worth of Argentine goods in 1990, almost
one-third of its exports.
Moreover, Mr Menem wants to convince European multinationals to invest in
Argentina and take part in its privatisation programme. So far it has only
attracted second-rate European state-owned companies, which now run the
national airline and telephone network.
Argentina plans to sell control of all its state companies for Dollars 3.5bn
by the end of this year and is determined to attract a better class of
investor. Mr Menem also intends to realign foreign policy, which he tilted
heavily towards Washington after taking office in 1989, reversing
Argentina's traditionally pro-European policy.
Mr Menem said: 'Our relations with Europe have always been excellent, while
our relations with the US used to be terrible, so everyone thinks our
policies privilege them and maybe the Europeans are upset about that.'

the pace of reform and said the direction was irreversible.
He also brushed aside criticism that he had pulled back from rapid
rationalisation and privatisation of the bloated public sector. 'It is a
limited problem. We have got over many problems of this kind, and this too
will be no exception.'
However, he was frustrated that Indian officials and trade unions had been
alarmed by aspects of the rapid privatisation process in Pakistan.
'I do not know what privatisation means. If it means that we give full scope
for private enterprise to come in, I have no difficulty on that. . . Instead
of talking about a word, it is better to talk about substance.' The
substance consisted of throwing areas open to the private sector.
On security issues, the premier said India held to its rejection of a
proposal for five-nation regional talks on nuclear weapons, insisting it was
only sensible to talk about nuclear disarmament in a global context.
'We have an action plan from 1988. We adhere to that, and say that with
necessary modifications it should be adopted. From one country to another,
there may be a difference in the timeframe of bringing down arsenals, but
eventually the objective should be absolutely clear that it is to be total
and complete disarmament.'

FT  12 FEB 92 / Euro Disney tries to end dispute with contractors

EURO DISNEY is trying to defuse an acrimonious row with its contractors by
agreeing terms for a settlement with a group of companies which worked on
the construction of its theme park outside Paris.
Euro Disney, which plans to open Euro Disneyland at Marne La Vallee on April
12, has been beset by a storm of complaints from disgruntled building
companies claiming it has been too slow in paying their bills.
Yesterday Euro Disney announced it had reached an agreement with a group of
40 companies, all of which had worked on the park as sub-contractors of
Gabo/Eremco, a company contracted directly by Euro Disney.
The 40 sub-contractors should have been paid by Gabo from the FFr110m
(Dollars 20.3m) it received from Euro Disney. However Euro Disney said it
had been forced to dismiss Gabo for 'mismanaging' the project and that Gabo
subsequently filed for bankruptcy. As a result the sub-contractors were not
paid.
This has left some in a fragile state. Euro Disney has agreed to make a
special payment to them so they can pay essential bills to avoid having to
file for bankruptcy.

FT  12 FEB 92 / Bonn rejects pleas from Moscow for more compensation

<TEXT>
GERMANY appears set for a nasty spat with the new Russian regime over
compensation costs for its departing troops.
Hard on the heels of a hefty bid for increased German contributions for
ex-Soviet soldiers' housing, the once-Soviet commander in former East
Germany yesterday put a figure on his demand for a massive pay-off for the
decaying barracks, crumbling camps, and polluted exercise grounds his troops
will leave behind.
Col-Gen Matvei Burlakov told Stern magazine he was looking for no less than
DM10.5bn (Dollars 6.6bn) for military buildings and housing. He was prepared
to accept a cut of DM2.5bn for 'ecological damage' which had not been
repaired by his final departure at the end of 1994.
That demand comes on top of the call by Gen Pavel Grachev, the Russian
defence minister, for Germany's DM14bn for soldiers' housing back in the
former Soviet republics to be increased by another DM7bn for Russia alone  -
because that is where most of the troops are heading.
Gen Grachev's request was flatly dismissed yesterday by his German
counterpart, Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg.
Gen Burlakov's demand was also dismissed yesterday by the German Finance
Ministry as pure fantasy. Officials quoted a variety of prices which showed
how far from reality the claims are.
For four barracks in Schlotheim, near Gotha, the general was demanding no
less than DM70m. The highest commercial bid for the property was DM180,000.
As for a housing complex at Beeskow, outside Frankfurt on the Oder, the
Russians were asking for DM5.7bn, whereas the local council was only
offering DM60,000.
The Soviet military installations are in a decrepit physical state, and vast
scrap metal dumps, waste oil lakes, and devastation of military exercise
grounds appears to far outweigh any notional value they may have.
A joint working group has been attempting to reach an agreement, which
German officials suggest might simply amount to both claims cancelling each
other out.

FT  11 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Successful rebound in modest trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market rebounded successfully yesterday after being
initially driven down to its nearest support levels by uncertain
performances from Wall Street and Tokyo and new warnings of the depth of the
economic recession in the UK. Buyers came in fairly readily at mid-morning
when the FT-SE Index had fallen to 2,506, and by the close the market was
21.2 ahead on the Footsie scale.
Some optimism was triggered by the London money markets, where the Bank of
England's operations were regarded as encouraging hopes for an early cut in
UK base rates. However, such optimism was damped down as sterling remained
subdued.
Overall, trading volume in equities was not particularly impressive and
strategists remained cautious. UK stocks were helped by a firmer opening to
the new session on Wall Street, which was 9 Dow points ahead when London
closed. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,538.4, a net gain of 21.2
on the first day of the new equity trading account.
The session opened in depressed mood in the wake of the 30-point setback in
the Dow on Friday's worrying US employment statistics, which had been
followed by a fall in the Nikkei average to below the important 22,000 mark.
Bad news from closer to home included reports that a Confederation of
British Industry survey had suggested that small businesses in the UK were
seeing no sign of an economic recovery. Selling from Europe focused on
Eurotunnel after the disclosure that it will not meet its June 1993
completion deadline. Among brewing stocks, Bass suffered further selling in
response to its law suit in the US.
However, there was not a great deal of selling pressure and trading volume
remained low until the market bounced as it approached the Footsie 2,500
area. Traders regard FT-SE 2,480-2,500 as a 'safe level at which to buy', as
one leading dealer phrased it.
The stock index futures contract anticipated the arrival of the buyers who
did indeed come into the market to pick up selected blue chip issues. The
underlying stock market quickly followed suit, with RTZ and Glaxo among
those to attract buyers from across the Atlantic.
The stock market swung into positive territory and gains were sharply
extended when Wall Street opened in firmer vein. The advance carried through
to the close, when share prices were only a shade below the day's best
levels.
Seaq trading volume fell to 426.4m shares from the 596.2m of the previous
session. Retail volume on Friday was worth Pounds 1.02bn, according to Stock
Exchange statistics, indicating a significant sell-off at the end of the
trading account.
In spite of yesterday's rally, which more than replaced Friday's losses,
equity strategists sounded uncertain of the market's prospects. Clouds still
hang over the progress of the economic recession, both in the US and the UK.
Oil shares, heavily weighted components of the Footsie, did well as worries
over dividend policies at British Petroleum lifted a little. Firmer oil
prices, which would benefit sterling, are believed possible following this
week's Opec meeting, but the longer term prospect for world crude prices
remains suspect in view of the prolonged recession in the leading
industrialised countries.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Appointments: RBS lands a big Fish
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Bank of Scotland is understandably proud of its latest US catch.
It has landed Lawrence Fish, one of US banking's better-known
trouble-shooters, to head Citizens Financial, its US banking operation.
Larry Fish, a 47-year-old Harvard MBA, joins Citizens Financial as
president, but will take over as chief executive when George Graboys retires
at the end of the year. Raised in Chicago, Fish spent 18 years with the Bank
of Boston, where he first made his name as an international banker with
stints in Tokyo and Hong Kong.
But since 1988 he has been trying his hand at rescuing troubled financial
institutions, first with Columbia Savings and Loan on the west coast, and
more recently with the Bank of New England.
US bank analysts have a high regard for Fish's talents as a 'crisis manager'
 -there is therefore some surprise that he has been recruited to run
Citizens, whose financial health is considerably better than most of its
com-petitors.
It is a much smaller institution than either Columbia or the Bank of New
England and it is hard to see how it can prove as big a challenge.
There must be a worry that Fish may be tempted to move yet again if a more
tempting offer is made, or that he will try and expand Citizens Financial
too quickly - the commonest reason why so many foreign banks in the US have
lost money. The new top management at RBS obviously feels it is a risk worth
taking.

FT  11 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns lower on
opposition by-election victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES weakened in thin trading as last Friday's fall on Wall Street
and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in an upper house
by-election at the weekend depressed sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei average closed 287.60 down at the day's low of
21,819.52 after opening at the session's high of 22,054.11. The index
finished below 22,000 for the first time in three trading days.
Volume fell to 137m shares from 200m, as market participants refrained from
activity ahead of the national holiday today. Declines outnumbered advances
by 747 to 208, with 165 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks declined 14.48 to 1,612.94, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.34 to 1,230.89.
The victory for the opposition in the House of Councillors Nara prefecture
by-election, in eastern Japan, raised uncertainty over the progress of the
budget bill which is currently being debated, and the upper house elections
in July.
Mrs Mineko Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse, said: 'The
instability of the LDP will affect stock prices.' However, Mr Jason James,
equity strategist at James Capel, said the political stall could increase
pressure from the LDP on the Bank of Japan to cut the discount rate.
Minolta Camera dropped to Y486 before closing down Y15 at Y500, following
last week's US district court's ruling ordering Minolta to pay Dollars
96.35m to Honeywell, the US technology company, for patent infringement.
Other precision makers also lost ground, with Olympus Optical falling Y30 to
Y1,380.
Weakness spread to other high-technology stocks, with Matsushita Electric
Industrial retreating Y50 to Y1,400 and Sony Y30 to Y4,250.
Clarion, a speculative favourite, advanced Y30 to Y1,100 on active cross
trading. Some individual investors were noted trading the stock for quick
profits.
Nippon Steel lost Y4 to Y350. Traders said the stock was being neglected due
to fears that institutional investors would liquidate holdings ahead of the
March book closing.
QP, a leading mayonnaise maker, weakened Y30 to Y1,260 on profit-taking. It
had gained last week on news of lower egg prices.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 209.47 to 23,481.73 in volume of 56.1m
shares. Trading was limited to window dressing ahead of the March book
closing. Chemical and machinery stocks lost ground while engineering and
transport equipment firmed.
Roundup
KUALA LUMPUR and Hong Kong stood out in a generally mixed Pacific Rim
yesterday, one closing at a six-month high and the other achieving its third
consecutive record peak.
HONG KONG shook off an early bout of profit-taking and closed at another
record high. The Hang Seng index advanced 22.19 to 4,733.56 and turnover
remained heavy, at HKDollars 2.88bn after Friday's HKDollars 2.80bn.
While property counters declined modestly, utilities and the commercial and
industrial sector registered solid gains. Banks were narrowly mixed.
KUALA LUMPUR extended last week's rise on strong support from institutions.
The composite index closed above 600 for the first time since August 1,
ending 13.51 or 2.3 per cent up at 603.35 in volume of 95m shares (55.8m).
Renong was the most actively traded, firming 2 cents to MDollars 1.18 in
volume of 7.6m shares.
SINGAPORE closed mixed as investors concentrated on neighbouring Malaysia.
The Straits Times Industrial index recouped a five-point deficit to end 0.13
up at 1,526.42, in turnover of SDollars 167.4m (SDollars 145.5m).
MANILA fell back on fears that International Monetary Fund approval for its
economic plans might fail after the senate rejected a tax proposal. The
composite index relinquished 19.04 to 1,234.53 in turnover of 146.9m pesos.
SEOUL eased after the suspension of an electronics group believed to be
seeking protection from creditors. The composite index dipped 4.30 to 687.18
in turnover of Won416.4bn. Construction shares registered gains on good
business outlook.
TAIWAN surrendered an early advance and ended lower, the weighted index
losing a net 13.08 at 5,204.55 after an intraday high of 5,290.27. Turnover
rose to TDollars 51.02bn from Saturday's half-day TDollars 37.19bn.
BANGKOK concentrated on Bangkok Land and Krisda Mahanakorn which accounted
for more than one-third of turnover. The SET index closed 0.18 higher at
780.26 on turnover of BT8.75bn. Bangkok Land lost Bt4 to Bt177, its first
fall since its debut on February 5, with Bt1.92bn worth of shares changing
hands.
AUSTRALIA rose after earlier falls: the All Ordinaries gained 4.0 at
1,594.9. Commonwealth Bank put on 21 cents to ADollars 7.12 after denials
that further rights issues were being considered. News Corp fell 16 cents to
ADollars 15.60: its interim profits are due on Thursday.
NEW ZEALAND recovered some losses, having been depressed by falls in Telecom
and Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE-40 index shed a net 8.82 to 1,458.30 in
turnover of NZDollars 15m. Telecom lost 4 cents at NZDollars 2.29 and
Fletcher Challenge 5 cents at NZDollars 3.44.
BOMBAY rallied strongly as fears receded over a border dispute with Pakistan
after reports of a build-up of troops on the border. The BSE index gained
78.99 or 3.60 per cent at 2,273.47. KARACHI also recovered after the
government banned a planned march by Kashmiri militants. The index rose
14.32 to 1,410.72.

FT  11 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Perrier jumps 7.5% as stock
comes back into play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAPER stocks were weak across the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS concentrated on takeover target Perrier, which was re-quoted for the
first time since its suspension on January 20. The stock jumped FFr105 or
7.5 per cent to FFr1,501, with a heavy 157,925 shares exchanged in two-way
trading as some investors took their profits and others sought to get a
piece of the action. Dealers said the stock was also being kept above
Nestle's offer of FFr1,475 to prevent the Swiss group from picking up
Perrier cheaply.
The day's biggest gainer was construction company SAE, which jumped FFr183
or 19.9 per cent to FFr1,103 with 10,975 shares traded. The shares were
re-quoted yesterday following CBV's approval on Friday of a FFr1,110 a share
bid from its fellow builder, Fougerolle.
The CAC-40 index closed up 3.94 at 1,865.55 in turnover estimated at a light
FFr1.6bn. Dealers were surprised that Eurotunnel only fell FFr1.10 to
FFr45.85 with 993,000 shares traded in spite of news of a delay in the
tunnel's opening.
Also on the decline was Elf which lost FFr3.60 to FFr355.40 with 292,500
shares traded on reports that its chairman had mentioned a possible capital
increase during a radio interview.
FRANKFURT was supported by a tentative move into chemicals, and there was a
sprinkling of price fluctuations - mostly on the downside - elsewhere,
partly attributed to thin trading as volume slipped from DM4.6bn to DM4.5bn.
Hoechst led the big three chemicals up with a DM3 rise to DM252.10. Mr Alex
Magona of Paribas Capital Markets said that investors were attracted by the
high dividend yields and the sector's recovery prospects.
Falls included PWA, the papermaker, down DM7.50 to DM227 on domestic reports
that the paper industry sees no immediate prospect of a cyclical upturn;
Metallgesellschaft, DM16.70 lower at DM410.10 ahead of today's annual news
conference, with the word out that the occasion will not be a happy one; and
Hochtief, the construction group, down DM28 to DM1,200 on profit-taking
after a period of relative strength.
Deutsche Babcock rose DM5.40 to DM174.50. Rumours that Siemens's KWU power
generation unit was about to take a stake in Babcock were denied after
hours.
MILAN fell in reaction to last Friday's fall on Wall Street and the
overnight decline in Tokyo. The market was also weakened by technical
considerations as chartists expected the Comit index to meet resistance at
550. The Comit index fell 5.63 to 541.95 in turnover estimated at a light
L90bn after L98bn on Friday.
Burgo, the paper group, came under pressure after an unusually prescient
domestic broker forecast that the company would have a bad 1992 because it
would be unable to pass on the rise in pulp prices to its customers. The
stock fell L360 or 3.9 per cent to L8,890.
Ciga, the hotels group, fell L47 to L1,902 after news that it remained in
the red in 1991 while turnover was little changed at L490bn. Some brokers'
expectations of a turnround in 1993 gave little support to the stock.
Sip and Stet, which have started a joint campaign to deter the government
from opening up the cellular telephone market, were relatively firm; Sip
eased L20 to L1,456 while Stet lost only L4 to L2,380.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed with the paper and packaging sector worst hit: VRG,
the paper wholesaler, closed down Fl 3.00, or nearly 7 per cent, at Fl 42.80
following Friday's announcement of a lower-than-expected net profit for
1991. This slide carried over to Buehrmann-Tetterode, the printing machinery
group, which slipped Fl 0.90 to Fl 43.90.
The CBS Tendency Index was unchanged at 121.3. Ahold failed to announce an
acquisition at its news conference and declined Fl 0.10 to Fl 80.90.
ZURICH closed steady in moderate trade, the SPI index edging 0.2 higher at
1,120.4. Blue chips gained more, with the SMI index of leading shares up 5.8
at 1,785.1.
Dealers noted good demand for the chemicals group, Ciba-Geigy, seen as
undervalued by some. Its bearers rose SFr50 to SFr3,330. Among banks, Swiss
Volksbank firmed SFr20 to SFr990, although it cut its dividend yesterday on
a 38 per cent drop in profits.
STOCKHOLM fell on Friday's Wall Street declines, and nervousness ahead of
today's results from Ericsson. The Affarsvarlden General index ended 12.9
lower at 953.9 with Ericsson B SKr3 lower at SKr181.
Procordia B fell another SKr11 to SKr181, down from a 1992 high of SKr220
and paying the price for merger plans with Volvo which failed to get
government support.
MADRID was flat ahead of Thursday's publication of January inflation
figures: analysts are looking for a rise of between 1.7 and 1.9 per cent.
The general index closed up 0.03 at 256.14. Telefonica continued firm, with
brokers reporting strong US interest: it gained Pta30 or 2.5 per cent, to
Pta1,220. The banks were generally weak with Banco de Santander's weekend
results being discounted: it slipped Pta25 to Pta4,605.
ISTANBUL eased again following a two-day recovery due to lack of new cash
and pessimism caused by the delay in the implementation of the capital
markets measures announced in mid-January. The index closed at 4,458.79,
down 117.34 or 2.6 per cent.

FT  11 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises on hopes of one
more rate cut

Wall Street
US SHARE prices rose yesterday on continued speculation that the Federal
Reserve would cut interest rates one more time in the wake of last Friday's
bad unemployment news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 19.68 up at 3,245.08, near its high
for the session. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 2.68 to 413.77. The Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks, however, ran into sustained selling
and finished 0.82 off at 634.13. New York SE turnover was light by recent
standards at 188m shares.
Disappointment on Friday that the Fed did not ease following worse than
expected employment data had faded by the time the market opened yesterday,
and hopes remained high that the authorities would lower interest rates to
boost the economy. Investors were uncertain, however, about the timing, and
equity price rises were restrained by the consensus opinion that the Fed
will not move until the completion of the big Treasury auctions this week.
Time Warner lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 93 1/8 in active trading after the
entertainment group reported fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 45m, compared
to a loss of Dollars 34m a year ago. Included within the figures, which did
not surprise the market, were a decline in earnings from the publishing
operations but record profits from the film and Home Box Office divisions.
Security Pacific slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 and BankAmerica shed
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 3/4 amid continued concern among investors that
the banking groups' planned merger could be scuttled by challenges from
Washington state legislators.
Motorola advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 81 and Northern Telecom moved
forward Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 after the two groups announced the
formation of a cellular telecommunications joint venture.
American Cyanamid fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 in turnover of 1m
shares on the news that the Justice Department is investigating allegations
that a company official tampered with drug data.
Hercules rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 48 1/8 after Merrill Lynch raised its
investment rating on the chemical group's stock and increased its profits
forecast for 1992.
On the over-the-counter market, MGI Pharmaceutical plummeted Dollars 10 3/4
to Dollars 11 5/8 after the company halted phase three clinical trials of
MGI 136, its protective agent used for chemotherapy treatment.
Argonaut climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 27 1/2 in the wake of reports that
some industry analysts believe the insurance group's stock is undervalued.
Software Technologies declined Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 6 3/4 after reporting
fiscal third-quarter net income of just 5 cents a share, well below the 15
cents a share expected by the consensus of analysts' forecasts.
Canada
TORONTO ended moderately firmer but in quiet trade as investors stayed
cautious ahead of this week's US Treasury refunding and Friday's US producer
price index.
Canadian biotechnology stocks ended stronger, escaping from profit-taking of
their US counterparts after a press article said the sector may be due for a

FT  11 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar recovers some ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday recovered some of its recent sharp fall as dealers
moved to cover short positions, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The US currency gained just over one pfennig on Friday's DM1.5595 close in
London to finish yesterday at DM1.5705. During the day the dollar had two
brief surges, hitting a high of DM1.5785. In New York the dollar ended at
DM1.5781.
Traders said there had been some outright speculative buying which had
helped briefly to boost the US currency.
Generally, however, it appeared the market was shrugging off talk of an
imminent rate cut in the US - preferring instead to concentrate on the
depressing economic pictures broadcast by Germany and Japan.
One senior dealer even suggested that a rate cut in the US would be good
news for the dollar. 'The market would see an early rate cut as evidence of
the Fed's determination to get the economy moving,' said Mr David Cocker of
Chemical Bank.
He added that investors were looking for excuses to buy the US currency, but
so far they had been thwarted by depressing data. 'In the present
environment, the market does not like the look of Germany and is not keen on
Japan . . . if there is a piece of good news (from the US), you will not see
the dollar for dust,' he said.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist with Yamaichi International, said he
expected the interest rate differential to move in the dollar's favour by
the end of the year, pushing the US currency as high as DM1.80.
The generally pessimistic view on the Japanese economy, and short covering,
gave some strength to the dollar against the yen. The US unit jumped from
Friday's close of Y125.20 to finish at Y126.70 in London. In New York it
rose to Y126.78.
Political scandal, economic weakness, and even talk of an earthquake have
conspired against the Japanese currency.
Mr MacKinnon suggested that Japan could announce a rate reduction before the
end of the month, when the government publishes its Tankan survey covering
manufacturing investment plans and business confidence. 'There is evidence
from monthly figures to suggest that the Japanese economy is decelerating
quickly,' he said.
The D-Mark also strengthened against the yen, moving from Friday's close of
Y79.96 in Frankfurt to its highest for a month at Y80.60.
The German currency's gains against the yen did not disturb the European
exchange rate mechanism. As usual, sterling remained stubbornly at the
bottom of the grid, pinned down by a strong peseta.
Spanish consumer price figures out later this week will do little to
encourage authorities to cut rates there.
The pound closed unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.8675, and weakened
slightly against the dollar at Dollars 1.8260 from Friday's close of Dollars
1.8380.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip as market suffers from
auction jitters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NERVOUSNESS ahead of this week's big Treasury auctions left US bond prices
weaker yesterday at both ends of the market.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 102
3/8 , yielding 7.781 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged, however, at
99 29/32 , yielding 4.908 per cent.
The approaching injection of supply was the dominant influence on sentiment
as the market opened for the week. The Treasury is scheduled this week to
auction Dollars 36bn in three-year notes, 10-year notes, and 30-year bonds,
and investors as well as dealers were reluctant to trade actively before the
fresh supply hits the market.
The short end was initially firmer, due primarily to hopes that the Federal
Reserve, in the wake of last week's bad unemployment numbers, would cut the
Fed funds rate by 25 basis points. The two-year note fell back, however,
after the Fed intervened to drain reserves from the banking system - a sign
that it had not eased policy.
RENEWED hopes of a base rate cut pushed UK government bond prices higher
across the range of maturities.
The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 97.16 to 97.27 by late afternoon
on a modest volume of about 18,500 contracts. Gilts traders reported
interest from both domestic and international buyers, with short-dated gilts
gaining over a quarter of a point. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent due 2003/07
rose from 116 1/32 to 116 7/32 .
GERMAN bunds drifted lower in dull trading as participants awaited news on
the wage front. The Liffe bund futures contract traded down to 88.09 from
Friday's close of 88.16.
Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch government bonds rallied after favourable January
inflation figures, released on Friday. Dutch year-on-year inflation was 4.1
per cent in January compared with 4.9 per cent in December.
JAPANESE government bond prices fell back yesterday, mainly as a result of
dealers liquidating long positions ahead of today's holiday. The yield on
the benchmark No 129 JGB, which opened at 5.385 per cent, closed at 5.445
per cent.

FT  11 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: FNB plans R550m rights issue
to fund growth
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third largest bank, plans to raise
R550m through a rights issue to capitalise on domestic and foreign growth
opportunities.
Mr Viv Bartlett, senior general manager, said yesterday the timing of the
issue, details of which will be announced next week, was closely related to
FNB's share price. He said the stock market would not necessarily stay at
current levels, while FNB felt the market was now rating its shares more
fairly than in the past. They stand on a price/earnings ratio of 11, and are
currently trading at R58 having been as low as R28 last year.
On the domestic front Mr Bartlett said the bank wanted to become more
aggressive, to regain some of the market share it had deliberately shed in
1989-1991. He said this was particularly true in the home loans field. FNB
was unsuccessful last year in its attempt to take over Allied, one of the
country's largest building societies, and is now pursuing organic growth.
In terms of international ambitions, Mr Bartlett said one option would be to
set up a London subsidiary whose main function would be the financing of
trade flows and foreign exchange trading. He said FNB was not that sure how
receptive the UK market was to new entrants.
FNB also needed capital for its Swiss finance company and to finance its
recent entry into the Botswana market.

inquiry

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals group, is
facing a probe by US government authorities over allegations that false data
was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for several new
animal drug applications.
Dozens of American Cyanamid's veterinary drug applications have been halted
while the FDA checks the research data. The Justice Department is
investigating an American Cyanamid employee, believed to have altered the
research results, and the FDA is exploring if Cyanamid's management knew of
any data falsification. The news spurred trading in American Cyanamid's
shares, which fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 at close of trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Leonard Bogner, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said most of the
suspended new product applications were linked to Cyanamid's Cygro chicken
feed supplement which had estimated US annual sales of only Dollars 2m
before it was withdrawn in 1990. Cyanamid's Cydectin and BST products were
not included in the list, and most analysts did not expect its human
healthcare products to encounter any regulatory problems. The FDA said
yesterday the safety of Cyanamid's products was not in question, although
the effectiveness of the Cygro products is being investigated.
The company said it was reviewing internal controls in the animal health
area 'to assure that applicable regulatory requirements are followed and
that scientific data meets the highest possible standards'.
The FDA's ability to monitor scientific data has been questioned by the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. A GAO study,
said weaknesses in the FDA's two main controls over data submissions might
impede its ability to detect fraud in animal drug data.

Petroleum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILLIPS Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based energy and chemicals group, announced
yesterday it planned to sell off a 51 per cent stake in its gas gathering
and processing subsidiary, writes Nikki Tait.
Shares in the business, which will be known as GPM Gas Corporation and is
the largest domestic producer of natural gas liquids, will be sold to
investors via an initial public offering. This will probably take place in
April.
Phillips said yesterday the subsidiary had operating revenues of just over
Dollars 1bn last year and the proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce
GPM's debt to Phillips. GPM will be headed by Mr Bill Thompson,
vice-chairman of Phillips.
The US parent company announced plans for a significant sale of assets last
autumn - a move which was seen as a further response to tough times in the
oil industry, prompted by weak natural gas prices and the recession.
Phillips shares rose  3/8 at midday on yesterday's news, finaly closing at
Dollars 23 1/2 , for a gain of  1/2 .
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, later placed Phillips' debt on
credit watch, with a view to a possible upgrade.
It said that operating performance for the gas gathering and processing
business had been 'fairly strong over the past two years' and noted recent
stock offerings in this industry segment had attracted 'attractive
valuations'.

FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bougainville Copper hurt by
political instability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Bougainville Copper, the Papua New Guinea copper and gold
group, have declared a large loss for 1991. The result reflects write-downs
of the group's mothballed mining operations on Bougainville Island.
The company, which was forced by civil unrest to abandon its mining
operations in March 1990, slumped to a K313.2m (Dollars 328.8m) loss for the
year, compared with a K14.6m loss previously.
The loss reflects a K350m provision for deterioration of the mine assets,
offset by a K40.8m tax write-back. Directors said it was impossible to
calculate accurately the required write-down without access to the mine
site.
'While directors have made this provision in good faith, based on the
limited information available to them, it must be recognised that the actual
extent of the necessary write-downs can only be established when access to
the mine site by appropriate company personnel is again possible,' they
said.
However, they had not given up hope of a return to the mine site. While
considerable uncertainty surrounded the future of the mine, there had been
some encouraging progress on restoration of government services on
Bougainville Island.
'Considerable funding will be required to recommence operations. These
funding requirements cannot be forecast accurately, but could be in the
range of K300m to K450m if access becomes available by early 1993.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Boeing hit by United's move to
cut deliveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Airlines, one of the three largest US carriers, said yesterday that
it planned to take delivery of only 156 new aircraft between 1992 and 1995,
compared with the 278 which it had on order or option for this period.
The cost of the scaled-back deliveries will amount to Dollars 12.2bn,
compared with Dollars 18.9bn had the full 278 aircraft been purchased.
Boeing, the Seattle-based aerospace manufacturer, will bear the brunt of the
cutbacks. United said that 'the focus of the change' would involve a
reduction of 44 Boeing 737s and 60 Boeing 757s.
Boeing's response was to point out that no firm orders, nor any options, had
actually been cancelled by United; rather that delivery dates had been
delayed until after 1995.
The Seattle company also said that while the 'rescheduling' had affected
some Boeing 737s that were on firm order, in general United's reduced fleet
purchases between 1992 and 1995 affected aircraft which had only been under
option.
Boeing added that the effect of the reductions had been anticipated when it
announced plans to reduce the production rate of its 737 aircraft from 21 a
month to 14, beginning in October 1992.
United, for its part, stressed that it intended to take the full 1992
complement of 66 aircraft - a mixture of Boeing 747s, 757s, 767s and 737s.
After reporting its largest-ever quarterly loss of Dollars 252.6m, United
last month warned of capital spending cuts of at least Dollars 2bn, blaming
the sluggish economic outlook. Yesterday's announcement was designed to
provide further detail, the airline said.
Its rescheduling of aircraft deliveries follows similar moves by American
Airlines, which decided last year to defer some options; allow others to
lapse; and extend delivery dates for some aircraft on firm order.
On the news Boeing shares shed Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 48. UAL,
United's parent company, fell  7/8 to Dollars 144 1/4 .

MITSUI, the Japanese trading company, has joined forces with a group of
investors, including a fund controlled by the Pritzker family of Chicago, to
invest an initial Dollars 100m in Savoy Pictures, a new film distribution
company, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
Among the investors and managers of Savoy Pictures will be Mr Victor
Kaufman, former chief executive of Columbia Pictures, and Mr Lewis Korman,
former chief operating officer of Columbia. Both left Columbia after it was
acquired in 1989 by Sony of Japan.
Savoy is Mitsui's first investment in the US film industry, but the Japanese
company is a minority investor. The largest single equity stake is held by
GKH, an investment fund controlled by Mr Jay Pritzker. Also investing is
Allen &amp; Company, the investment boutique, and Mr Andy Vajna, one of the
founders of Carolco Pictures, the independent film company.
Mr Korman said Savoy's aim would be to distribute around 15 films a year by
1995. He said Savoy would also help film-makers to arrange finance.

CONRAIL, the US railroad, has turned in a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars

This leaves the group with a net loss for the year of Dollars 207m or
Dollars 3.59. For the previous year Conrail earned a profit of Dollars 247m
or Dollars 5.10 a share, with Dollars 76m or Dollars 1.78 coming in the
fourth quarter. Revenues for the latest fourth quarter were Dollars 847m

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL yesterday announced an advance in after-tax profits to Dollars
170m for 1991, compared with Dollars 72m in 1990, despite a declining market
in the US for major home appliances and flat European demand.
In the fourth quarter of the year alone, Whirlpool - the world's largest
maker of leading domestic appliances and now the full owner of the former
Philips' businesses in Europe - made a net Dollars 40m, against a Dollars
54m loss in the same period of 1990.
Whirlpool shares gained Dollars 3 to Dollars 43 1/2 on the news.
Mr David Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman, claimed the year had been 'very
good' under the circumstances and attributed part of the advance to
reductions in working capital and costs and increased market share.
Sales for 1991 overall totalled Dollars 6.55bn, compared with Dollars 6.42bn
in 1990.
Profit comparisons between the two years are slightly muddled by
restructuring charges and other one-off items. In 1990, Whirlpool took a
Dollars 52m charge related to the refrigeration operations, partly offset by
a Dollars 22m gain on the sale of a floor-care business; in 1991, there was
a Dollars 20m charge for the Italian compressor facilities.
The Brazilian interests also showed an improvement, contributing equity
earnings of Dollars 3m, against a loss of Dollars 33m in 1990, although
Whirlpool warns that the situation here remains 'volatile'.
The company said its North American shipments rose by more than 5 per cent
in the last quarter, but declined by over 5 per cent during the 12 months.
Mr Whitwam predicted a 5 per cent rise during 1992 overall, but suggested
the gain would come in the second half.
In Europe, Whirlpool said shipments were flat in the last quarter but up by
1 to 2 per cent for the year. This year, shipments are estimated to increase
by 1 per cent. The US company has been using dual branding - combining its
own name with that of Philips - but says it is now phasing out the Philips
name from UK advertising, a move which will be replicated in other markets
early this year.
The finance subsidiary made net profits of Dollars 31m, up 15 per cent from
1990.

HONEYWELL, the US controls manufacturer that was last week awarded Dollars

Honeywell said it would launch the fund with its own contribution of Dollars

The plan is for a Dollars 10m fund that would assist small businessmen and

The fund would be replenished from legal fees awarded or negotiated as
patent disputes are resolved, according to Mr Christopher Steffen, Honeywell

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, the north London football company which recently returned
from Stock Exchange suspension after a financial rescue, yesterday announced
its first pre-tax profit for two years.
In the six months to November 30, which includes most of the close season,
it made Pounds 810,000 pre-tax, compared with a loss of Pounds 2.14m.
The share price gained 8p to close at 90p yesterday. This is above the 75p
per share that Mr Alan Sugar, head of Amstrad and Tottenham chairman, and Mr
Terry Venables, team manager turned chief executive, paid for control last
summer, but below the recent 125p rights issue level.
Turnover improved to Pounds 9.22m (Pounds 8.9m), although the continuing
football-related business showed a 43 per cent advance. Since the first half
of last year, clothing and other non-core activities have been closed or
sold.
Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said that cup runs, fees for televised
games, increased attendances and the first year of the Umbro kit sponsorship
deal had all helped. Interest costs fell from Pounds 1.19m to Pounds
750,000, as rates came down.
The rights issue, announced in December and largely underwritten by Mr
Sugar, brought in Pounds 7m, reducing bank debt to Pounds 5.9m.
Mr Sandy said it had since been cut to less than Pounds 5m. This would be
wiped out if the planned sale of Paul Gascoigne, the injured international
player, goes ahead at the end of May after a medical examination.
Profits on the sale of other players, including Gary Lineker, were partly
offset by the purchase of Gordon Durie, leaving Pounds 274,000 (Pounds
249,000) net.
Earnings per share were 8p (losses 21.2p) on 10.2m shares in issue. The
4-for-7 rights issue will add 5.82m shares for just over four months to the
full-year figures.
No tax was charged because of previous losses.
The lack of distributable reserves prevented an interim dividend being paid.
Tottenham said it was planning to restructure the balance sheet to allow a
final payment.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Imro authorised BIM despite shortcomings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL services regulators were uneasy about authorising Mr Robert
Maxwell's fund management companies, but did so nonetheless and made no
special efforts at oversight afterwards, a Parliamentary select committee
was told yesterday.
Mr John Morgan, chief executive of the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (Imro), told the Select Committee on Social Security that there
had been unease about authorising Bishopsgate Investment Management in
February 1988. 'But there were no sustainable grounds for denying membership
in Imro.'
Although Imro - the industry's self regulatory body - was aware of a 1971
Department of Trade and Industry report which said Mr Maxwell was not fit to
run a public company, the report was 17 or 18 years old and no action was
taken,' he said - and the fact that bankers and investors had backed Mr
Maxwell since then aided his credibility.
It was only after Mr Maxwell's death last November that Imro became
concerned about the fund management companies.
Terms of the Financial Services Act of 1987 required firms such as BIM and
another Maxwell company, London and Bishopsgate International Investment
Management, to be authorised by Imro to conduct investment business.
BIM, a company ultimately controlled by Maxwell-run charitable trusts in
Liechtenstein, had the Maxwell company pension funds as its sole clients.
And despite the apparent disappearance of about Pounds 300m of Maxwell
pension fund assets managed by BIM, Mr Morgan said he still believes current
regulatory arrangements are satisfactory.
Mr George Nissan, Imro chairman, added 'the only way to prevent this is to
have a regulator in the office of all of our members all the time'.
Shortcomings had been found at BIM in assessment visits, but these were not
considered serious, said Mr Robin Clark, director of Imro's member
assessment unit.
These shortcomings included the failure to keep dealing slips showing
records of transactions and the failure to require staff to disclose all
personal share dealings.
Mr Clark said Imro had received written assurances from BIM that procedures
had been corrected and saw no need for verification.
Similarly, after accountants qualified the reports for LBII, Mr Morgan said
Imro relied on assurances from accountants that shortcomings had been
corrected.
Mr Clark also said that Imro was well aware that BIM invested assets
connected with Robert Maxwell but felt satisfied that these were disclosed
to pension fund trustees. Failure to disclose such self-dealing could be
grounds for disciplinary action.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Aitken Hume sells back Bachmann to its
founder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AITKEN HUME International, the financial services and investment group, is
to sell back Bachmann Group, the Guernsey-based financial services operation
which it bought in 1987, to Mr Peter Bachmann, its founder.
The deal releases Aitken Hume from deferred payment commitments made when
the 1980's economic boom was at its height.
Under the terms of the now superseded 1987 deal, Aitken Hume would have had
to pay Pounds 16.1m in new shares over the next 18 months.
Uncertainty over the form in which Aitken Hume would pay for the remainder
of the price caused Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte to qualify the company's 1990
accounts.
'We are absolutely delighted at this resolution of the problem,' said Mr
Ziad Idilby, chairman and chief execu-tive of Aitken Hume yester-day. He
said the two sides had been negotiating a settlement.
Though Bachmann is nominally being sold for Pounds 17.8m, this amount will
be offset by the return of a 23.9 per cent stake in Aitken Hume from Mr
Bachmann and his companies. Net cash from the sale for Aitken Hume will be
Pounds 1m.
Bachmann Bank, which was established by Aitken Hume but renamed after it
bought the Bachmann group, is not part of the sale. The agreement includes
clauses to ensure that its client business is not disrupted by the sale of
the other Bachmann companies and it will continue to operate from Bachmann
premises.
Aitken Hume made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m in the year ended March 31
1991 after a Pounds 1.7m exceptional charge; in the six months to Sept 1991
it reported profits of Pounds 2.6m.
Bachmann Group recorded turnover of Pounds 4.8m and pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.74m in 1991.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Leisure side behind rise to Pounds 2.28m at
Baldwin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALDWIN, the holidays, printing and properties group, lifted pre-tax profits
by 8 per cent to Pounds 2.28m in the year to end-October 1991.
The improvement was achieved in spite of a Pounds 616,000 loss at a
subsidiary where operations have since been discontinued.
The outcome was largely due to Baldwin's leisure division, which made
profits of Pounds 1.49m against Pounds 1.08m a year ago.
The division's share of overall profits increased from 49 per cent to 65 per
cent.
Keycamp Holidays, which specialises in mobile home and camping holidays in
France and Spain, increased sales by 17 per cent.
Looking ahead, directors said the leisure side was continuing to prosper and
that currently, bookings were substantially in excess of the previous year.
Group turnover fell slightly to Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 27.9m). This reflected
depressed performances from the printing division, where profits fell to
Pounds 271,000 (Pounds 405,000), and from property, down from Pounds 347,000
to Pounds 218,000.
Basic earnings per share emerged at 8.3p (7.8p) and a proposed final
dividend of 1.4p makes an unchanged 2.8p total.
The company has accumulated more than Pounds 5.5m in cash and has looked at
a number of possible acquisitions, although no substantial new purchases
were made during the year.
Baldwin will continue to look for acquisition targets if they have good
prospects for growth, directors said.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Problems of meeting the all-seater deadline
 -Soccer club funding following the Taylor Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO SOONER has West Ham United football club announced considerable
sweeteners to help sell its unpopular bonds, than another first division
club is contemplating putting its toe in these uncertain waters.
Leeds United, lying second in the first division, is considering raising
Pounds 3m by selling bonds at Pounds 500 each.
The amount is modest compared with the Pounds 16.5m sought by Arsenal and
the Pounds 11m to Pounds 15.5m target at West Ham.
It will hope to follow in the footsteps of Glasgow Rangers, so far the only
football bond scheme to nearly sell out. But the experience of West Ham,
where little more than 1,000 of the 19,300 bonds have been sold, shows how
this form of fund-raising can run into trouble.
Debenture bonds give fans the right to seats at favourable prices - but
still at rather more than they pay to stand. They have been issued mainly to
raise money for stadium improvements required after the Taylor Report into
the Hillsborough disaster.
It has been estimated that the building work could cost the 93 clubs in the
English league a total of Pounds 360m. Grants from the Football Trust are so
far expected to total about Pounds 150m.
With a ceiling of Pounds 2m on individual grants, the shortfall at Arsenal,
for instance, is more than Pounds 20m.
The Hammers Bond was the third such scheme launched by a football club. It
followed success at Rangers, but a cool reception for Arsenal's Pounds 16.5m
effort, which is 40 per cent sold after eight months.
In West Ham's case, not only did the original offer flop, but the protests
included a large and angry demonstration on the pitch after one Saturday
afternoon match.
Mr Graham Watson, a financial adviser to all three issues, as well as to the
Pounds 36.7m Murrayfield debenture for the Scottish Rubgy Union, said: 'West
Ham went into a period of playing badly and the bond has become a scapegoat
for all sorts of things.'
It illustrated the 'intangibles' that had to be taken into account when
setting up these issues. 'You learn from each one. There were bound to be
some teething troubles.'
West Ham's original scheme differed from the other two in some important
respects. At 19,300, the number of bonds far outstripped the other issues
and they accounted for a high proportion of the average gate of 23,000.
The plan was to spread the cost of redeveloping Upton Park across all the
fans, throughout the ground. Both Arsenal and Rangers attached their bonds
to particular stands.
The Hammers Bond was, however, cheaper than the other two at between Pounds
500 and Pounds 975, whereas Rangers' was Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,650 and
Arsenal's Pounds 1,100 or Pounds 1,500.
To a West Ham or Arsenal supporter, paying perhaps Pounds 6 to stand behind
the goal, these sums looked high. Rangers, on the other hand, put a new tier
on the stand at the side of the pitch, cashing in on an excess demand for
better seats.
With average gates below the ground capacity, neither Arsenal's nor West
Ham's bond offer could exert anything like the pull of, say, England's
international rugby programme.
At Twickenham, which has just put another 11,000 bonds on sale at Pounds
2,000 each for 10 years (much shorter than the football clubs'), more than
200,000 applications are received for 60,000 tickets to see big
internationals.
Arsenal has the advantage that new impetus may be provided next season when
construction work will reduce the capacity to 29,000, below the 33,000
average gate.
Mr Watson said that this should provide a new impetus to the bond, which has
suffered because of delays in getting planning permission for the new stand.
The amounts that both Arsenal and West Ham are attempting to raise always
looked ambitious. Manchester United, the best supported club in England,
raised less than Pounds 5m from the public as part of its flotation last
year.
Tottenham Hotspur's change of ownership and rescue has sucked in more than
Pounds 10m, but most of it came from the traditional source of a rich
individual's pocket.
Nevertheless, the normally cautious Bank of Scotland was prepared to
underwrite 87 per cent of Arsenal's issue and 75 per cent of West Ham's.
To breathe new life into its scheme, West Ham is now offering bondholders up
to Pounds 100 off season tickets. Leeds has gone for this approach from the
start, proposing this level of reduction for seven years.
As Manchester United has pointed out, however, this means sacrificing future
revenue. Its burden will instead be the dividend payment.
For smaller, less profitable clubs, public or private share issues seem
impracticable. West Ham said the short time limit on acceptances and the
need to meet a minimum subscription level meant these options were not
viable.
The problem gains urgency against the background of losses made by many
clubs and their existing debt. Mr Simon Pitt, a management consultant, has
just published a survey which puts the combined debt of the English league
clubs at between Pounds 90m and Pounds 130m.
Mr Watson said that the 'harsh facts of financial life' had yet to come home
to many clubs. To find the money for stadium redevelopment, either players'
transfer fees and wages would have to come down or fans would have to pay
up.
Assuming that the growing lobby for a relaxation of the Taylor requirements
does not succeed, bonds will in fact remain one of the less difficult ways
for clubs to raise some money over the couple of years that remain before
the all-seater deadline.

Top Granada executives yesterday gave formal commitments that the company
will remain a producer of properly funded programmes.
The undertaking were given by Mr Alex Bertstein, chairman of Granada and Mr
Gerry Robinson, chief executive, at a meeting with Mr George Russell,
chairman of the Independent Television Commission and Mr David Glencross,
ITC chief executive.
The meeting followed widespread concern after Mr Robinson sought the
resignation of Mr David Plowright, executive chairman of Granada Television.
The ITC said last night that the Granada executives confirmed that the
company would remain a producer-broadcaster, making rather than
commissioning most of its work. Programme commitments would also be properly
resourced.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Exco's future settled via placing with
institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Exco, one of the City's leading money brokers, was finally
resolved last night with news that the majority of its shares are to be
placed with a group of investment institutions.
Exco's future has been uncertain since the collapse nearly two years ago of
its parent, British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial services group. Attempts
by the B&amp;C administrators to float the group or find a buyer came to
nothing.
Mr Stephen Adamson of Ernst &amp; Young, one of the group's administrators, said
that more than 50 per cent of the company's shares were to be sold to 'half
a dozen' institutions assembled by NM Rothschild, the merchant bank.
The expected sale price, which has yet to be concluded, was not disclosed.
However, it is thought to value the money broker at considerably less than
the Pounds 100m the administrators might have hoped to receive had the sale
taken place at a more favourable time.
Mr Adamson said the administrators had kept an undisclosed number of shares
in Exco for sale in future when conditions improve.
The B&amp;C administrators also said that they were close to paying out more
than Pounds 200m to creditors of B&amp;C, which was brought down by losses at
its Atlantic Computers leasing subsidiary.
Following a scheme of arrangement agreed by B&amp;C creditors, and subject to
court approval, Pounds 170m will be paid out in April to creditors of the
B&amp;C holding company and its finance subsidiary, B&amp;C Group Finance. This
would be the first payment, and would amount to 5p in the pound for
creditors, together with 12p interest, Mr Adamson said.
Creditors of the holding company should eventually receive back 23p in the
pound, while the finance subsidiary is expected to pay 37p in the pound, he
said.
Also, the administrators are close to paying out more than Pounds 60m to
creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth Merchant Bank, equivalent to 20p in the
pound. These creditors have already received 45p in the pound.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Ratners' chief unveils plan to restore
sparkle in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES McAdam, who last month became executive chairman of Ratners Group,
has wasted little time in setting a new course for the struggling jewellery
company.
Yesterday, he announced a move to restructure the UK jewellery operations
under a single management board, resulting in the departure of Mr Victor
Ratner as deputy managing director responsible for buying and merchandising.
Mr Gerald Ratner, Victor's cousin and former chairman, will resume a more
direct executive role by chairing the new UK jewellery management board. Its
aim will be to co-ordinate the operational activities of the Ratners, H
Samuel and Ernest Jones chains more efficiently.
The City reacted favourably to the news and analysts suggested the move was
an encouraging sign that Mr McAdam was already getting to grips with the
business.
But Mr McAdam stressed he was not stamping his authority on the company for
the sake of it. 'We have created a sensible operational structure. Gerald is
driving the business forward at the sharp end. That is what he likes doing
and does best.'
Mr McAdam said the decision was amicable and had been fully supported by Mr
Gerald Ratner: 'He is as supportive of this decision as I am. We are
together on this'.
Mr Victor Ratner will be compensated for loss of office but will remain as a
consultant on a three-year contract. 'He has been with the company for 13
years and has a lot of experience in buying. That expertise will still be
available to us as required,' said Mr McAdam.
'What one reads between the lines is that Gerald is taking a more active
role in the business and the company cannot afford to employ two Ratners on
large salaries,' said one analyst, who pointed out that Mr Victor Ratner's
consultancy contract would presumably prevent him from setting up in
competition to Ratners Group.
Mr Masarrat Hussain, 57, the administration director who has worked at
Ratners for more than 30 years, will at his own request also retire from the
company at the next annual meeting.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN Gray, a former director of Thorn EMI, has been appointed chief
executive at Brown &amp; Jackson, the discount retail chain.
Mr Gray, who had run Thorn's HMV and Rumbelows chains as well as its UK
rental division, replaces Mr Andrew Reid.
Mr Reid's resignation had been sought by a group of institutional
shareholders who had been concerned over his role in the acquisition of the
former ATI subsidiary.
ATI was purchased in 1988 from a group which included Mr Brian Duffy, then
Brown &amp; Jackson chairman, in a transaction ultimately valued at Pounds 18m.
Over the 1991 year, ATI incurred an estimated net loss of Pounds 2.3m and a
recently completed review by Brown &amp; Jackson's financial advisers found that
some of its earlier profits may have been questionable.
Mr Gray said that he would seek a refinancing of the company, probably
through a rights issue.
He dismissed speculation that the company would sell its Poundstretcher
discount retail chain, saying he would take over direct management of its
operations.
'The future of the company will be built around Poundstretcher,' he said.
Mr Christopher Roshier and Mr Gerald McLeod have joined Brown &amp; Jackson's
board as non-executive directors, while two former directors, Mr Robert
Dowds and Mr Charles King, have resigned.
Mr Michael Kerrison, finance director and Mr Henry Bliss, corporate
development director, remain on the board.
Institutional shareholders had said they would not agree to a rights issue
unless the company disposed of the ATI subsidiary and brought in a new
management team.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: The unembroiling of the broiler market -
Hillsdown's plucking of Unigate's chicken wing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY CAN a single business deal have pleased everybody in an entire
industry as much as yesterday's announcement that Hillsdown Holdings is to
relieve Unigate of its deeply troubled JP Wood chicken operations.
For Mr Ross Buckland, who joined Unigate as chief executive 15 months ago,
the deal is a much-needed opportunity to make good on pledges to improve the
dairy group's flagging fortunes by stemming an increasingly heavy drain on
profits.
For Hillsdown, the acquisition provides the means to discipline a competitor
which seemed to be running out of control. And for the rest of the UK
poultry industry, it raises hopes of an end to the chronic excess capacity
and vicious price-cutting which plunged the market into turmoil.
Behind the Wood debacle lies an extraordinary story of over-ambitious
expansion, commercial misjudgments and sheer bad luck which began three and
a half years ago, when Wood opened the UK's biggest chicken plant in the
industrial wasteland near Scunthorpe, on Humberside.
The idea behind the Pounds 55m plant was straightforward enough. By using
production-line techniques to achieve big scale economies, the plant would
drive down unit costs and squeeze less efficient rivals out of the highly
fragmented industry. Almost from the outset, the idea proved misconceived.
Initial plans had been to export to the Continent most of the planned output
of 1m birds a week. But they were soon abandoned after it turned out that
Germany was the only sizeable EC country which was a net importer of
chickens - and others were already competing hard for its market.
When Unigate shifted its sights to the UK, the predictable result was to
create a production glut and falling prices in a market where supply
totalled about 10m birds a week. The glut was made worse when some
competitors responded, not by scaling back capacity, but by expanding it.
From that point on, the miseries multiplied. In 1989, the US drought pushed
up feed prices, and with them the plant's costs. Then the salmonella scare
dented consumption and added still further costs in the form of special
government-imposed inspection charges.
The final blow was the Gulf war. French poultry producers, which depended
heavily on Middle East export markets, diverted large volumes of chicken to
the UK. By selling at what the British industry considers ruinously low
prices, they captured 15 per cent of the market last year.
According to Ministry of Agriculture figures, volumes of poultrymeat
production rose last year by 3.7 per cent to a record 1.05m tonnes. However,
the value of output slipped Pounds 3m to Pounds 878m.
Some critics doubt that the Scunthorpe plant could have been profitable even
without so many setbacks, arguing that it was also critically handicapped by
inexperienced management and the wrong product mix.
Half its current production of 750,000 broilers a week are frozen birds,
commodity items which command lower prices than fresh and partially prepared
chickens.
Unigate considered trying to move the plant upmarket into 'value added'
products, such as coated or stuffed chicken. However, that would have
brought it into direct conflict with leading customers which supplied such
products themselves and who would have responded by cancelling orders.
Wood, which also includes two smaller plants in Wales and associated
hatcheries, rearing and growing businesses, lost Pounds 6.6m in the year to
March 31. Unigate says the rate of loss has since accelerated, and City
analysts were recently putting it at Pounds 15m for this year.
Small wonder that one of Mr Buckland's first decisions after he moved in at
Unigate was to seek a buyer for what has been unkindly dubbed the 'kamikaze
chicken' business. Talks with Hillsdown, long considered the only serious
candidate, began last summer.
Most analysts agree that Hillsdown was obliged to buy Wood if it was to stay
in the poultry business. Indeed, some suggest that Unigate may even have
kept the operation running at an uneconomically high level of output - and
thereby contributing to a general weakness in poultry prices - partly to put
pressure on Hillsdown to do a deal. 'It seems to have been, quite literally,
a game of chicken,' says one.
Hillsdown is estimated by Henderson Crosthwaite, the stockbroking company,
to have made a Pounds 12m operating profit on its chicken business in 1990.
However, Henderson believes that this turned into a Pounds 8m loss last year
despite cuts in production, particularly of frozen birds.
Hillsdown needs swiftly to apply its skills at cost-cutting and
rationalisation to the merged businesses if it is to avoid a steadily rising
stream of red ink. Though it declined to spell out its plans yesterday, they
seem certain to include extensive plant closures, though the Scunthorpe
facility is expected to survive.
Some analysts were suggesting that industry excess capacity is so acute that
Hillsdown may need to reduce the merged businesses to not much more than the
size of its existing operation, if they are to be profitable.
Sir Harry Solomon, Hillsdown chairman, sounded confident yesterday, pointing
out that the protracted negotiations on the deal have allowed the company
plenty of time to work out exactly what needs to be done. 'We believe this
deal will enable us to compete with anyone,' he said.
Hillsdown's timing may also be opportune. A recent reduction in broiler
chick placings - an important leading indicator - suggests that the chicken
cycle may at last be bottoming out, while French producers are said to be
re-orienting their export drive back to the Middle East.
Longer term, Sir Harry expects demand for chicken to continue developing:
'It's a very cheap food, and the British eat a lot less of it than do the
Americans. Of all the markets Hillsdown is in, this is one of the fastest
growing.'
However, even if yesterday's deal paves the way for a return to more stable
market conditions, the chicken industry is likely to remain a relatively
low-margin business, increasingly dominated by supermarkets' cut-price
private label products.
For Hillsdown, more is at stake than just the future of its chicken
business. Once a City high-flyer, it has steadily lost popularity there,
particularly since a failed rights issue last autumn.
The deal offers the company an opportunity to regain favour by demonstrating
one of its strongest suits, an ability to turn round troubled acquisitions.
The market will doubtless form its own judgment about whether Hillsdown has
been right to double its stake in the chicken business - or whether it would
have been more prudent to have called it quits.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CH Bailey, the ship repairing and diversified engineering contractor, cut
its pre-tax losses from Pounds 807,209 to Pounds 305,604 in the 28 weeks to
October 11 1991.
The company said, however, that the results - where turnover fell 28 per
cent to Pounds 2.1m - reflected the 'pessimistic comments' in the last
statement.
Losses per share were reduced to 0.47p (1.44p) after another period when no
tax was levied.
The company expressed concern that another bill had been presented to
parliament for approval to build a barrage across Cardiff Bay, thereby
making ship repairing at Bailey's Bute Dry Dock impossible without
'substantial capital expenditure and long-term guarantees of tenure'.
Also the head office and the woodworking company would have to be relocated,
the company said.
Bailey is petitioning against the bill.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cattle's to seek listing for Rosebys
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CATTLE'S (Holdings), the financial services group, is to seek a separate
listing for Rosebys, its household textiles, curtains and accessories
retailing subsidiary, later this month by way of a placing.
The additional capital will allow Rosebys to repay its indebtedness of
Pounds 2.6m with Cattle's and provide for continued expansion. Cattle's
would receive total net funds in excess of Pounds 7m and retain about 45 per
cent of Rosebys' enlarged capital.
Cattle's believes it can achieve a price for the shares it will sell which
adequately reflects Rosebys current value and prospects. For 1991, Rosebys
is expected to produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m.
A special interim dividend of 0.5p, for 1992 only, will be declared by
Cattle's, to be paid with the final dividend for 1991.

FT  11 FEB 92 / US business turns leaner and meaner: Moves towards financial
health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The euphemisms vary but the song remains the same: whether it is called
'restructuring', 'downsizing' or 'reshaping to better meet the challenges of
the 1990s', corporate America is swallowing a medicine-chest full of special
charges aimed at improving its long-term financial health.
A succession of large fourth-quarter restructuring charges have been
reported over the past few weeks by companies as varied as Bethlehem Steel,
the second largest US steel producer; United Technologies, the aero-engine
manufacturer; Du Pont, the chemical group; CSX, the railway operator; Kodak,
the photographic group; and Xerox, the image reproduction company.
And one of the biggest is yet to come: General Motors, the largest company
in the US, is expected to take a pre-tax write-off approaching Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.6bn) over the next week or two when it reports a huge 1991 loss.
The fourth quarter of any year is traditionally the time of heaviest
write-offs, but the previous quarters of 1991 have also produced some big
hits against earnings.
In the third quarter, for example, they came from companies as varied as
Citicorp, the bank, American Express, the charge-card business, Tenneco, the
industrial conglomerate, and the Union Pacific Railroad.
In short, 1991 will go down as a record year for charges by corporate
America. But why, and what does this tell us about the future
competitiveness of US business?
First, some statistical history: charge-offs by US companies last showed a
big upward leap in the mid-1980s, peaking in 1987 when the companies which
make up the Standard &amp; Poor's Index of 500 large US businesses collectively
wrote off a net Dollars 2.65 a share, compared with reported earnings of
Dollars 17.50, according to estimates compiled by securities house Shearson
Lehman Brothers.
The causes were many and complex, and included bank write-offs of Third
World loan losses, big restructurings by heavy manufacturing industry and
telecommunications, the restructuring of the chemicals sector and Dollars
4.9bn of charges from oil company Texaco, stemming mainly from a legal
battle with Pennzoil.
The level of charges dipped in 1988 but have been on an upward trajectory
every since, reaching Dollars 3.17 a share in 1990, compared with earnings
of Dollars 21.34, and are expected to end at around Dollars 4.70 a share for
1991.
The figures include charges from many factors other than corporate
restructurings. Over the past two years, for example, banking and securities
industries have had to write off many bad loans made to the property sector
and leveraged buy-outs in the late 1980s, and there have been some big
provisions for settlement of legal disputes.
Furthermore, from 1991 companies have begun taking big charges because of a
change in the rules on their accounting for health benefits for retired
staff.
These charges do not involve any drain of cash and neither do many of the
big write-downs taking place to cover plant and equipment. So, while
corporate America is paying out large sums in redundancy, the figures being
reported by many companies are somewhat misleading in terms of cash flow.
And this helps explain why the stock market tends to shrug them off, or even
buy a company's shares on restructuring news.
There seem at least six intertwined reasons for this degree of
restructuring.
First, and probably most important, such action is hardly surprising at this
point in the economic cycle: the US has been in or near recession for more
than 18 months, and many companies which face severe competition and price
pressures, or have lost market share, need to improve their productivity.
The fat they were able to carry in the 1980s, during the longest US economic
expansion on record, is now simply too heavy.
General Motors is a prime example of this. During the 1980s its share of the
US car market plunged from around 47 per cent to 35 per cent but its
financial strength in a booming market allowed it to put off the
rationalisation this loss of customers demanded.
Now it has to bite the bullet, and the charge it is likely to make this
month will help cover the cost of cutting 70,000 jobs and closing 21 plants.
Second, the restructuring charges of the past few years are a response to
the takeover wave of the 1980s. During the second half of that decade
companies which looked vulnerable to a bid by corporate raiders set about
improving their efficiency, as well as erecting a panoply of anti-takeover
devices.
The takeovers which did occur, whether launched by raiders or industrial
bidders, left the merged companies with plenty of scope for rationalisation.
The takeover wave ebbed dramatically in 1991, but the year nevertheless
produced a succession of banking mergers which led to large restructuring
charges, as well as AT&amp;T's takeover of computermaker NCR, which produced a
Dollars 4.2bn charge.
Third, restructuring charges in some sectors stem simply from secular
decline. This is particularly so in the US defence industry, which is having
to adjust to an era of rapidly shrinking Pentagon equipment budgets.
Fourth, many companies are restructuring because of growing foreign
competition as world markets become more global. Again, the Detroit motor
industry, under increasing pressure from Japanese rivals, is a prime
example.
Fifth, technological changes are forcing companies to adapt. Bethlehem
Steel, for example, has made more than Dollars 1bn of charges in the past
two years to cover the restructuring of businesses where it is no longer
competitive with mini-mills, which use more efficient production methods.
Sixth, unlike the restructurings of the mid-1980s, this one is hitting
America's service industries - ranging from banking to fast-food outlets -
which are expected to face big productivity pressures through the 1990s.
For example, the large charges by the railroads are mainly to cover a change
from three-man crews to two-man crews.
All this would appear to bode well for corporate earnings over the next few
years. Most of corporate America should emerge from recession leaner and
fitter.
Mr Michael Sherman, chief investment strategist at Shearson Lehman, says:
'If we're right about recovery this summer, we will see a large remission in
terms of write-offs.'
He also points out that the US has hardly been ignoring capital investment
during this period, which has far outstripped write-offs in terms of dollars
per share. Furthermore, many companies may be taking larger write-offs than
they need immediately to cover trouble they see ahead.
'They think that if they're going to disappoint shareholders with earnings
now, they might as well go the whole hog,' says David Blitzer, chief
economist at Standard &amp; Poor's.
The lesson for the rest of the world, then, is that US industry is likely to
emerge from recession a tougher competitor.
Mr Neuhauser of KPMG Peat Marwick argues that many US businesses which have
restructured are now in a better competitive position than foreign rivals,
especially those in Europe, where he sees large amounts of under-used plant
and assets.
'My assessment,' he says, 'is that we will see a lot more of this coming in
Europe.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / Ultramar directors to share Pounds 6.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the independent oil exploration company, announced it had paid Pounds
6.7m to seven Ultramar directors, in one of the biggest post-takeover
payments in British corporate history. The payment was made to terminate the
contracts of the directors after Lasmo took over the diversified oil and gas
group in December.
Lasmo will also pay Pounds 1.4m to top up the directors' pension funds.
Lasmo has already paid Pounds 886,000 in compensation to former chairman, Mr
John Darby, and Lord Remnant who resigned from the board at the end of
October amid controversy over directors' remunerations.
Most of the compensation is understood to have gone to Mr David Elton, Mr
Peter Raven, former finance director, and Mr Eugene O'Shea who all resigned
from the Ultramar board at the end of January.
Mr Jean Gaulin, Ultramar chief executive, and Mr Nick Di Tomaso, senior
vice-president in charge of refining and marketing, received a payment for
terminating their Ultramar contracts, but have agreed to remain with the
company on new contracts with a month's notice.
Two non-executive directors share in the pay-out: Mr Ronald Utiger and Mr
Bernard Ness.
The payments include Pounds 4.8m for terminating contracts, Pounds 1.9m for
pension contributions, Pounds 35,000 for loss of office and Pounds 67,000
for other benefits.
Lasmo said the settlement was not as large as it could have been because
directors were accepting two and a half years' salary rather than three to
which they were entitled.
The company still has to agree a deal with Mr Lloyd Bensen, former chairman
who had remained on the board and resigned in October. His pay-out could be
as much as Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.6m).
Mr Robert Bland could qualify for a payment of more than Dollars 1m, but
agreed to remain with Lasmo to work on the Indonesian operations. Mr William
Sheptycki will work on Lasmo's North Sea operations until he retires in
April.
The company has added the directors' payments to the cost of its Pounds
1.1bn takeover of Ultramar together with provisions for severance and
redundancy payments to other employees as a result of the restructuring of
Ultramar's operations. The company said it had made progress in integrating
Ultramar.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Swiss Volksbank falls due to MCC provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PROVISION to cover a Dollars 73m (Pounds 39.9m) loan to Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC) was among the main factors contributing to a
slump in the 1991 profits and a dividend cut at Swiss Volksbank,
Switzerland's fourth largest commercial bank.
Total provisions soared to SFr393.8m (Pounds 154m) from SFr157m in 1990. Mr
Walter Ruegg, president, did not mention the Maxwell loan specifically, but
he said provisions were 'much larger than we forecast in the autumn'.
The bank's cash-flow rose 27 per cent to SFr382.9m, but net income plunged
38.3 per cent to SFr68.4m. The directors proposed a dividend of SFr40 per
share, down from SFr75 last year.
Volksbank's provisions do not include any allocation for its Dollars 35m
loan to a Maxwell private company last November, and against which it
received 13 per cent of the shares of Berlitz, the language school
subsidiary of MCC, as collateral.
MCC had previously agreed to sell its holding in Berlitz shares to a
Japanese company. Volksbank said yesterday that its loan to the Maxwell
private company had been liquidated and the Berlitz shares were being held
until a buyer could be found.
Last week, Berlitz adopted a 'poison pill' scheme to deter an unwanted
change in the control of the company as a result of sales by Volksbank and
other banks holding large blocks.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Wace focuses on Parkway share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WACE GROUP said yesterday its internal inquiry since the sudden departure of
its managing director Mr John Clegg 10 days ago had revealed 'potentially
unlawful dealings' in the shares of Parkway Group, one of its largest and
most ambitious acquisitions.
'Neither Wace nor any members of the existing board was a party to these
share dealings,' the printing services company added.
The inquiry now focuses on dealing in Parkway shares in the weeks before
August 1, 1990, when Wace announced its bid of 28p cash per Parkway share,
double the the previous day's price.
Parkway, Wace's largest rival in 'pre-press' services which prepare text and
graphics for printing, was named USM company of the year in March 1989. But
within 15 months it was highly indebted and its value had fallen from Pounds
110m to less than Pounds 10m.
It has become clear, however, the insider dealing unit of the London Stock
Exchange looked into share dealing in the Parkway takeover, but it is
understood it failed to find evidence to support the suspicions. The
exchange declined to comment yesterday.
It is illegal under the Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 to
deal in shares of a quoted company when in possession of private information
that, if public, would materially affect the share price.
The exchange's inquiries are understood to have prompted wider questions
about the history of Wace's funding. Mr Clegg left after a week of
speculation about the funding of his original Pounds 700,000 investment in
Wace. He denied allegations the company was under investigation for
connections with the IRA.
Wace said yesterday it had found 'no evidence of any link between the
company or its existing or past directors and the IRA or any other terrorist
organisation'. Security sources had already said they found no evidence for
the allegations.
Yesterday another clue emerged to the original investment. Mr Richard
Thomas, a former finance director of Helical Bar, the quoted property,
development and investment compnay said Mr Clegg's family made a profit of
around Pounds 260,000 on buying and selling a stake in the company in 1982.
He said about 26.7 per cent of Helical's shares were bought for Pounds
220,000 by Mr Michael Clark but the shares were registered in the name of
Miss Jayne Wright, said by Mr Clegg to be his cousin. The Wright
shareholding was later sold for a total of Pounds 480,000.
Mr Clegg bought into Wace Group soon afterwards and has repeatedly said the
money came from Miss Wright's family inheritance.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Hillsdown to buy Unigate's chicken operation for Pounds 37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings, the diver-sified food group, has agreed to buy JP Wood,
Unigate's loss-making chicken operation, for a maximum of Pounds 36.7m.
The deal will make Hillsdown Britain's largest chicken producer, with almost
a quarter of production, and will end Unigate's involvement in the industry.
Hillsdown, which already owns the Buxted poultry business, is expected to
start restructuring the merged operations. This is likely to involve
substantial cuts in output.
Hillsdown will pay Pounds 18.5m immediately in cash and a further Pounds
8.2m over three years, subject to a working capital adjustment. In addition,
it has agreed to pay up to Pounds 10m if the merged businesses meet
specified performance targets in the three years after the merger. The
company plans to fund the purchase out of the proceeds of a Pounds 280.7m
rights issue made last autumn.
The deal marks the completion of a nine-month search by Unigate for a buyer
for the JP Wood business, which lost Pounds 6.6m in the year to March 31.
Unigate said yesterday that the losses incurred since then and the
write-down of assets resulting from the sale were covered by an Pounds 87.9m
provision for divestments taken in last year's accounts.
JP Wood, Britain's largest poultry producer, operates three plants in
Scunthorpe on Humberside, Anglesey and Clwyd, in Wales. It also owns
hatcheries, rearing, laying and growing farms and two feed mills.
The Pounds 55m Scunthorpe plant, opened in 1988, is the biggest in the UK
and was intended to be the most efficient in the industry. However, it never
attained the ambitious goals set for it and was unable to achieve
profitability.
Construction of the plant was assisted by grants from the European
Community. Unigate said yesterday that it had been assured by the government
that none of the grants would have to be repaid as a result of the sale.
Mr Ross Buckland, who became chief executive of Unigate in October 1990,
announced plans to dispose of the business soon after he took up the post.
Hillsdown has been caught up in turmoil in the UK poultry market, which has
been aggravated by a surge of cut-price imports from France. The company
reported in September that its operating profit on poultry fell Pounds 12.3m
in the first half to Pounds 13.5m.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Sharp response to Quayle on trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER, FRANCES WILLIAMS and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, GENEVA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WARNING by Mr Dan Quayle, US vice-president, that a failure to conclude
the Uruguay Round trade talks could fuel protectionism in the US and
encourage those wanting to pull all US troops out of Nato, drew a sharp
response yesterday from European Community agriculture ministers.
The reaction came as Mr Quayle said his remarks had been misinterpreted.
The agriculture ministers were meeting in Brussels to discuss plans to
reform the EC's Common Agricultural Policy and farm subsidy reductions
within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalisation
negotiations - the main obstacle to conclusion of the Round.
Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, said: 'There's been too much of
this megaphone diplomacy. This kind of behaviour is not very helpful. There
is a lot at stake, in a sensitive negotiation, which has to be between equal
partners.' He added that 'no doubt it was something he (Mr Quayle) was not
properly briefed on'.
The UK is among the minority of member states having little difficulty with
the farm subsidies formula drawn up by Gatt in December, which the EC as a
whole is seeking to renegotiate.
France has led efforts to limit the degree of liberalisation in farm trade
sought by Gatt, whereas most of its partners want amendments to make the
subsidy cuts compatible with EC farm reform.
Mr Quayle's damage limitation exercise was undertaken at a news conference
in Geneva. He denied any specific linkage between a breakdown of the Gatt
talks and US troop levels in Europe, but he stressed that there was
inevitably a link between economic and military security.
The US vice-president sought to distance himself from more forthright
remarks by other prominent US participants at an international defence
conference in Munich on Sunday, who underlined the military consequences for
Europe of a failure in the Gatt talks.
Stressing that he wanted to correct a 'misimpression', Mr Quayle said that,
unlike the other speakers at the Munich seminar, he was speaking for
President George Bush and the US administration when he said there was no
linkage between the Gatt talks and US troop levels in Europe.
However, he followed up these soothing words with an another stern warning
that a breakdown of the Uruguay Round of trade talks could trigger 'mindless
spending' on subsidies, which the US would feel obliged to match. 'The US
will certainly meet any subsidies with an in-kind response,' he said.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Wakeham lobbies for coal contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Wakeham, the energy secretary, has been lobbying regional
electricity companies in an attempt to win contracts for British Coal and to
achieve lower electricity prices before the election.
His intervention appears to contradict earlier assurances that the
government would play no role in negotiations between British Coal and the
electricity companies.
Senior executives of regional companies say Mr Wakeham asked them at a
recent meeting to consider signing contracts to buy coal-fired electricity
from National Power and PowerGen, the two generators.
This would put pressure on the generators to agree a deal to buy coal from
British Coal, paving the way for the privatisation of the company.
Mr Wakeham also wanted the regional companies, which buy power from the
generators and sell it to customers, to press the generators to seek low
prices on their British Coal contracts. This would allow him to announce
lower prices for electricity consumers before the election.
'Mr Wakeham's got it into his head he might just get a deal before the
election,' the commercial director of one regional company said yesterday.
'I'm not surprised the government has got involved, but it puzzles me why
they are in such a hurry,' the chairman of another company said. Mr Wakeham
had told the companies that he wanted the privatisation of British Coal to
succeed and to get a good deal for the customer and taxpayer.
The Department of Energy said yesterday: 'Of course the secretary of state
meets people from the industry from time to time. We are letting the
companies get on with commercial negotiations.'
The electricity industry is British Coal's main customer, and contracts
between the two are vital if British Coal is to be successfully privatised.
So far, talks between British Coal and its direct customers, National Power
and PowerGen, have made little progress. This, some regional companies
believe, is the reason Mr Wakeham has appealed to them.
'They have been very naive at times. At one point they asked why we didn't
all band together and ask the generators to sell us coal at low prices. But
we don't operate in an administered market any more,' the managing director
of one regional company said. 'They are very worried that the bad PR of
closing down British Coal pits can only be offset by the financial quid pro
quo of lower electricity prices.'
Another chairman stressed that even if National Power and PowerGen succeeded
in buying British coal at the lower prices they want, they were under no
obligation to pass on the benefits to consumers via the regional companies.

GERMANY, by far the biggest net contributor to the European Community
budget, is pressing the Commission to re-examine Britain's budget rebate
negotiated in the early 1980s.
The Commission is due today to finalise its proposals to raise the Community
budget by about a third over the next five years. Germany's demand threatens
to revive the revenue row which paralysed EC decision-making a decade ago.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, successfully argued that
Britain got proportionally less than its equally or more developed peers
from the biggest EC budgets, for agriculture and regional development.
The UK rebate was worth Ecu2.4bn in 1990 and Ecu3.3bn (Pounds 2.35bn) last
year, according to UK officials.
Last week, a senior Commission official warned privately that 'we are
already beginning to smell' that Germany - concerned by the cost of
unification, and demands that it should pay more through the EC to help the
poorer southern countries prepare for economic and monetary union (Emu) -
wanted to reopen the terms of the UK deal.
German officials confirmed yesterday that they had raised the matter with
Brussels, since the new five-year budget package would 'require more revenue
from many sources'. One said: 'It is pretty obvious that we have to talk
about the UK rebate again.'
At the Maastricht summit in December, Chancellor Helmut Kohl pointed out
testily that Germany would be contributing a net Ecu9bn to the Ecu66bn
budget this year. Precise details on net contributions are closely guarded
by the Commission, which wants to avoid 'the Community being seen as a
business', a senior official said.
The incomplete figures published by the EC court of auditors for 1990,
however, show Germany contributing a net Ecu5.5bn, the UK paying a net
Ecu3.4bn and France a net Ecu1.8bn.
Two key aims of the mid-term financial plan for 1993-97, due to be presented
to the European Parliament tomorrow, are to double regional aid funding for
Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece, the four poorest EC members, and to
distribute the revenue-raising burden more fairly.
Spain has argued that it contributes more than it should, both in relation
to its resources and to what it gets out of the budget. High per capita
income countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands meanwhile take more out
than they put in. But Commission officials warn that to calculate
contributions and receipts with 'algebraic equity', as one put it, could led
to endless feuding.
There are already worries that Italy will also balk at the proposed
arrangements. It will be hit by the new five-year plan just as it is
struggling to reduce its own budget deficit in time for Emu.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Balancing Britain's pay scales / Assessment of prospects for
moderation in this year's round of pay negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A negotiator in a south-east London estate agency will be lucky to earn
Pounds 12,000 this year, perhaps one-third of the amount he or she might
have expected in 1988 at the height of the property boom.
But as the annual UK pay round gets into its stride most British companies
are likely to find that pay is not responding in such textbook fashion to
the recession.
January saw fewer pay freezes and pay cuts than for the same period last
year, as pay bargainers pre-empted the end of recession. Most pay analysts
say settlements are averaging about 5 per cent, still above inflation at 4.5
per cent, and the public sector is in the middle of one of its periodic pay
spurts with an overall increase of 7 per cent expected this year.
The government yesterday accepted pay review body recommendations averaging
about 6.5 per cent for 30 per cent of public sector workers, including
nurses and teachers. More worryingly, average earnings increases are stuck
above 7 per cent, a floor that has not been breached since the mid-1960s.
There has, however, been a sharp fall in pay increases since the beginning
of 1991. Average pay rises fell from 10 per cent in December 1990 to less
than 5 per cent in the same month last year, echoing the fall in the 1980-81
recession. The Confederation of British Industry, the UK employers'
organisation, claims that pay in the all-important manufacturing sector is
now growing more slowly than in Germany. Settlements fell to as low as 4.1
per cent in the final quarter of 1991, according to its pay data bank.
The German steel industry settlement of 6.35 per cent agreed last week was
noted with satisfaction by UK employers. And the rise in unit labour costs -
increases in earnings adjusted for gains in productivity - fell to 6.8 per
cent cent in British manufacturing in the third quarter of 1991, narrowing
the gap with west Germany's 4.6 per cent for the same period.
That is an encouraging trend, but is largely thanks to divergent economic
growth cycles in the two countries and the overheating of the German economy
created by reunification. Comparisons of unit labour costs over the past
three years, and indeed most of the past three decades, show that annual
increases in the UK have usually been between two and three times higher
than in Germany.
Moreover, the UK's membership of the European Community's exchange rate
mechanism requires Britain consistently to match, or even better, the German
rates of increase. If UK unit labour costs rise faster than in the main
European economies that will create inflationary pressure which, within the
ERM, can only be countered by high interest rates and thus unemployment. The
job cuts announced last week by Ford UK, which has consistently delivered
higher unit labour costs than Ford in Spain and Germany, are a warning.
The effect of ERM membership on pay bargaining has been obscured by
recession. The test of bargainers' ability to adapt to ERM constraints will
come later this year and next as output is expected to recover.
Have British employers or unions grasped the magnitude of the task? The
signals are mixed. The head of personnel at one of Britain's biggest
manufacturing companies says that the ERM and European productivity
comparisons will play no part in bargaining.
On the other hand, Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, says
that the ERM is already playing an important role in negotiations, at least
in the export sector. 'Employers are saying that with devaluation no longer
an option what happens in Germany is crucial,' he reports.
Union leaders such as Mr Edmonds accept that membership of the ERM requires
a reduction in unit labour costs and stress that the way out is not low
wages but higher productivity. His answer, and the Labour party's, is more
training and consultation at work. Mr Edmonds also advocates consultation at
a national level between government, unions and employers to prevent
competing wage demands and to influence expectations.
The CBI remains strongly opposed to such remedies. But Mr Robbie Gilbert,
head of industrial relations at the CBI, concedes: 'Many employers have not
taken the ERM on board.' The CBI argues that pay will be squeezed because UK
economic growth will be slower in the ERM. The brevity of the early 1980s
recession meant that pay was scarcely affected. In 1983, with unemployment
above 3m, average earnings were almost twice the inflation level of 4.6 per
cent.
But the CBI is not putting its faith in slower growth alone. It believes
that the British bargaining system has been revolutionised in the 1980s and
Mr Gilbert suggests that 'we may be on the way to breaking the wage-price
spiral'.
The optimists, at the CBI and elsewhere, point to the fact that pay did not
rise as much as expected while the economy was buoyant and employers
competed for scarce labour between 1987 and 1989. They conclude that labour
market and union reforms and the more flexible nature of pay bargaining have
left a permanent mark.
The optimists also point to the fact that employers have cut back on
training less than in previous recessions and that skill shortages, one of
the reasons for inflationary pay awards, may be less acute than usual in the
upturn.
An additional reason for hope is that average earnings in the mid to late
1980s were temporarily boosted by a pay explosion for many white-collar and
managerial groups, especially in the financial services sector. The fact
that this sector is now facing difficulties should act as a brake on
white-collar pay for the next couple of years.
That is important because it is not the dwindling band of manual workers in
manufacturing that has been stoking up wage inflation over the past decade,
but white-collar and professional employees. The real gross earnings of male
non-manual workers in 1979-89 rose three times faster than male manual
workers.
Non-manual employees outside the public sector are seldom in unions, so it
seems that white-collar wages' drift has been more the result of market
forces than union pressure. But even among the relatively highly unionised
manual workers in manufacturing few analysts expect a revival of militancy -
strikes are at their lowest annual level since 1933 - when the upturn comes.
Yet the French experience is a chilling reminder that, even with a
revolution in UK pay bargaining, unemployment could remain high. France has
held earnings growth below 5 per cent for each of the last five years but
still has unemployment at 10 per cent.
And, as the pessimists point out, there are several reasons why that pay
revolution will be hard to attain:
Even if Britain is undergoing a training revolution it will take time before
employers no longer have to outbid each other for skilled workers.
While few doubt that there was a marked improvement in manufacturing
productivity in the 1980s, the trend may have run out of steam in the past
few years.
Public sector pay, which now usually matches private sector pay, is due for
a medium-term boost which will force manufacturers to keep pace. The reason
is that private sector reforms, such as performance-related pay, are now
being introduced in the public sector.
In the short run those reforms may increase, not reduce, labour costs. The
break-up of national bargaining in some of the privatised utilities has
boosted pay while the 'regionalisation' of pay has worked one way - paying
more in the richer south-east but not less in Liverpool.
Over the next two years the optimists are likely to be proved right, with
wage increases continuing to moderate. 'But,' says Mr John Muellbauer, an
economist at Nuffield College, 'it will still take years of wage inflation
below that of our competitors to make a dent in our lack of
competitiveness.'
How many years? 'It took 20 years to build in inflationary expectations and
it will take 20 years to squeeze them out,' says the CBI's Mr Gilbert.

UK defence secretary Tom King had a rare excuse when he and his Russian
counterpart, Marshal Shaposhnikov, turned up late at 10 Downing Street for a
meeting with John Major and Boris Yeltsin during the Russian president's
recent visit. King said he and Shaposhnikov had been sampling a prized case
of 1939 Crimean champagne, obtained by King's son who works for Sotheby's.
The reactions of the two national leaders were characteristic.
Major: 'Are you sure our defence budget can stand this kind of
extravagance?'
Yeltsin: 'Good God, I thought all that vintage had been drunk by Khruschev.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / Observer: Official inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is understandably cautious about sticking its neck out.
But one trend it cannot ignore is the increasing size of its official
history. Sir John Clapham's review of the Bank's first 100 years took 305
pages, and his study of the next century ran to 460. However, historical
inflation really took off under Professor Richard Sayers who devoted three
volumes, and 1,468 pages, to the period between 1891 and 1944.
The next episode, by former executive director John Fforde, is due out next
month, and it is an even bigger blockbuster. Covering the 17-year period up
to 1958, it runs to 866 pages. This works out at an average of just over 50
pages per year, compared with Clapham's rate of under three. Oh, and by the
way, Observer's calculations understate the dramatic increase. Fforde
confines himself to a study of public policy. A separate volume on the
Bank's administration over the period is being prepared by Elizabeth
Hennessey.

Meanwhile the mists have descended once more around the Drambuie Liqueur
company, maker of the sweet
whisky-based drink supposedly derived from a recipe invented by Bonnie
Prince Charlie, which a year ago showed signs of emerging from corporate
obscurity.
At an elaborately staged press conference, the family-owned concern
announced a new strategy of diversification, with its purchase of upmarket
crystal-manufacturer Caithness Glass being heralded as the first of several
acquisitions of Scottish companies making quality products.
Spearheading the change was Peter Shakeshaft, brought in from packaging and
games group John Waddington to be finance and development director under the
brothers Calum and Duncan Mackinnon, who had recently taken over as joint
chairmen of Drambuie after the death of their father, Norman.
Bearded and an accountant by profession, Shakeshaft talked of building a
'good solid Scottish group' alongside the liqueur company 'over the medium
to long term'. But the reticent Mackinnons were noticeably absent from the
enunciatory proceedings.
Now the 44-year-old import has resigned 'to pursue his own interests' but
with no alternative job to hand. While he won't say why, it could be that he
has found Drambuie distastefully resistant to being either shaken or
stirred.

The recent opinion poll conducted among Scottish voters for The Scotsman and
ITN showed that 50 per cent of them were in favour of independence for
Scotland. But the poll also uncovered a certain ambivalence among supporters
of the Scottish National party, whose main policy is for Scottish
independence within the European Community.
When given the choice between no change in the existing constitutional
arrangements and an independent Scotland within Europe, 8 per cent of SNP
voters opted for no change.

Never mind the animosity throbbing daily across the front benches in
Britain's House of Commons. Political solidarity across the party divide
still exists. Both Conservatives and Labour are setting up a fund to ease
Birmingham's veteran Labour leader, Sir Richard Knowles, out of a costly
libel embarrassment.
Knowles, a feisty but apparently not wealthy pensioner, went out delivering
leaflets at a council by-election in June 1990. Unfortunately for him he
never bothered to read one. Result: a libel writ from Liberal Democrat
councillor John Hemming. Consequence: the search is now on for Pounds 20,000
to calm the ruffled waters.
Rushing to Knowles's assistance are Roy Hattersley, engineering union chief
Bill
Jordan, Sir Neville Bosworth, former Birmingham Conservative leader and John
Cartwright, the Social Democrat MP. Now is the time for all good men. . .

FT  11 FEB 92 / Observer: Royal Bank's odd turn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If there was one UK clearing bank which seemed to have cracked the problem
of how to own a London merchant bank and not destroy it, it was the Royal
Bank of Scotland. So why is it talking about selling its Charterhouse
merchant banking subsidiary?
Charterhouse has thrived while the likes of Hill Samuel and County NatWest
have provided nothing but grief for their owners. Royal Bank's capital
ratios are stronger than most, so it does not need the money; and anyway,
now is hardly the best time to get premium prices for banking assets.
Royal says that Charterhouse will benefit from a 'larger European
dimension'. But surely that was supposed to be why the Royal's new chief
executive, George Mathewson, had worked so hard at forging a 'European
alliance' with Spain's Banco Santander.
The obvious conclusion is that this proves once and for all that the
oft-quoted benefits of having a merchant bank and a commercial bank working
side by side in the same group are nothing compared with the disadvantages.
Even so, it still looks an odd move. If one had to choose between owning a
mainstream merchant bank in Europe or a quasi-savings bank in Rhode Island,
most bankers would opt for the former.
Yet Royal Bank's new top management team seems bent on doing the opposite.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The limits to repression / Examination of the latest
political manoeuvres in Algeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trial of strength between Algeria's military-backed government and the
opposition Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) has entered a new and dangerous
phase. At the weekend the government declared a one-year state of emergency,
banning protests and anti-government preaching from mosques.
Tension was already running high following the annulment last month of
Algeria's first multi-party elections, which the FIS was poised to win. The
latest move will polarise the country further between the 'haves' and
'have-nots' - the growing army of unemployed.
Until now the authorities have held back from declaring a state of
emergency, well aware that it risked plunging the country into a cycle of
repression and violence. Instead they sought to isolate the FIS and arrest
its leadership, while holding out an olive branch to those within the
movement anxious not to see the country destabilised. They hoped to play on
divisions within the FIS and expose the extremists, bent on establishing an
Islamic society.
This carrot and stick approach also reflected differences within the
military. Hardliners led by General Khaled Nezzar, the powerful defence
minister, favoured an immediate ban on the FIS. More junior officers, along
with some civilian members of the cabinet, were reluctant to acquiesce in a
move that would split the country and make nonsense of their 1988 commitment
to introducing democracy.
However, the mounting cycle of country-wide violence with more than 40
killed last week, the continued use of mosques as centres of political
protest and the appearance of armed opposition groups attacking strategic
installations, undermined this policy.
That it took the FIS three weeks to take to the streets suggests the
movement was initially disoriented by the cancellation of elections. It is
still hard to tell whether the FIS has developed an underground leadership,
or whether the protest is more a mix of spontaneous action by frustrated
supporters reacting to the removal of mosque leaders and scattered acts by
autonomous armed groups.
In seeking to maintain order, the authorities are gambling that Algerians
will shy away from the threat of civil strife. Algeria's Arab neighbours -
as well as industrialised countries which rely on its gas exports - clearly
share that hope.
The authorities have also sought to combat a potential legitimacy problem by
recalling from 28-year exile Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, the veteran independence
leader who is untainted by the abuses of power of the former ruling party,
the FLN, to head a five-man Council of State.
But to keep the lid on, the military needs to count on the loyalty of
conscripts and middle ranking officers. Despite long experience in
repression, the military has never had to deal with sustained civil unrest.
Nor will administering the country be easy since the FIS controls two-thirds
of Algeria's local councils.
In the medium term, perhaps the most important factors will be economic. The
authorities are hoping for a breathing space to implement economic policies
that address opposition grievances: cleaning up the government and
increasing spending to provide housing and jobs. The constraints they face,
however, are enormous. For each of the past four years, three-quarters of
Algeria's oil and gas export income has gone towards servicing its Dollars
25bn foreign debt. And there is little sign of relief. Authoritative
projections show Algerian debt repayments running at around Dollars 8.5bn
annually well into the second half of the 1990s, compared with annual oil
and gas export revenues of Dollars 11bn-Dollars 12bn.
The only way out of this squeeze is a debt refinancing. This Friday a group
of eight commercial banks headed by Credit Lyonnais will meet in Paris to
decide whether to proceed with a Dollars 1.5bn loan to help Algeria
refinance its bank debt. If they do the government will have a bit more room
for manoeuvre.
However, much greater help from western state creditors will be needed if
Algeria is to revive its economy. A year ago Italy made a significant
gesture, effectively refinancing state-guaranteed and other debts falling
due between 1991 and 1993. But France, the biggest creditor, has so far
refused to follow suit.
The debt squeeze is extremely painful. Many factories are running at one
third of capacity, their managers running up large debts with local banks
and having to sack workers to stay open. Domestic demand remains severely
depressed.
The question remains: will the government be able to channel funds into such
sectors as construction and food production? Repressive measures alone will
not contain the fundamentalists.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Arts: The Kiev Ballet - Palais Des Congres, Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lyric ensembles from the Kiev Opera House have lately opened an extended
season in Paris. Pleasure at seeing the ballet troupe - it was last in Paris
in 1964 - is somewhat mitigated by the company's failure to understand
either the nature of the Congres stage or the tensions it imposes upon a
production. The dance area is vastly broad, and utterly devoid of theatrical
ambience or artifice, and it can only suit arena ballet at its most
vigorous. The Kirov and Bolshoy ensembles have played there, classicism
ultimately triumphant, and so - with notable success - has Bejart, whose
stagings seem exactly judged for its conditions. (No Bejart fan, I record
that the bombast of the productions looks bold, and communicates boldly, on
this exposed stage).
Alas for the Ukrainians' ballet. Their operatic offerings, Khovanschina and
Mazeppa, may have fared better, but the two big dance presentations unveiled
at the weekend, Sleeping Beauty and Nutcracker, made for light-weight and
improbable viewing. Gauzy, inadequate design; under-nourished choreographic
texts; a dance-style that had as yet to accommodate itself to the arena
conditions, all made for disappointment. The company's theatrical virtues,
in schooling and temperament, could be seen to be dissipating in these huge
and anti-theatrical surroundings. And the use of recorded music, well played
by an un-named orchestra that I assume to be that of the Kiev Opera House,
did not help individual soloists to appear at their best.
It must be said that the long shadow of the Bolshoy is cast over the two
ballet productions. But the Kiev troupe could muster neither the force of
massed Muscovite dance power nor the cumulative bravura needed to carry a
vision of such masterpieces to any convincing conclusion in these
circumstances. It is now surely time, in the post-Soviet era, for the
Ukrainians to reconsider the nature of the old repertory. Ironically, their
first Beauty in 1950 was staged by Fyodor Lopukhov, one of the great
traditionalists of the Petersburg ballet, for a sense of tradition is
exactly what is missing in this current version (by Kiev's ballet-master,
Viktor Litvinov, after Yury Grigorovich's expansive Bolshoy recension.)
A particular fascination of both Beauty and Nutcracker is the way in which a
precise locale (a court; a Biedermeier household) opens out to magic and
fantasy. A real world is the necessary springboard for a journey into realms
of the imagination exemplified by the classic dance itself. Yet the Kiev
stagings, as with other Soviet versions we have seen, offer flimsy design,
fly-away costuming, weightless dramatic playing, that sabotage the terrain
from which the dance must spring. Unless, as with the Mariinsky and Royal
Ballets, we sense the real, then the magical is denied its force. Florestan
XXIV's courtiers and Councillor Stahlbaum's family must be figures as potent
at the Lilac and Sugar Plum fairies. Nothing, in the Kiev presentations,
compensated for a central flightiness, an imponderability of manner. The
company is disciplined, well-schooled, and probably looks more so in its
home theatre where it does not have to spread itself so thinly as on the
extensive tracts of this stage. The corps de ballet is pleasing as nymphs,
snowflakes, fairies, but it is more difficult to judge the upper ranks of
the troupe under such surroundings.
The leading roles in both Beauty and Nutcracker were taken by Tatiana
Beletskaya and Viktor Yaremenko, able performers, though having to fight to
project either dance or characterisation. The programme book, a mine of
misinformation, misprints and omissions, was selective in listing any of the
other artists. Fortunately it did identify the Blue Bird and his princess as
Maxim Beloserkovsky, a fresh, clean virtuoso and Yelena Filipieva. Miss
Filipieva is beautiful, looks young, and is a treasure. Her Florine was
grand in style, serenely commanding, and had a mysterious radiance that
speaks of joy in dancing. It was a most beguiling interpretation, not least
because of the sweet inevitability with which Miss Filipieva showed us the
dance.
The Nutcracker was given in choreography by Valery Kovtun. As with Beauty,
the bleaching out of drama, the rejection of the richly credible world
established by Tchaikovsky's score, denied the piece its power. Everything
up to the snow-flakes waltz was skimped, improbable; thereafter, Kovtun's
skills produced fluent classic ensembles. On the Kiev Ballet's next westward
journey, and the troupe deserves to be more widely seen, we must hope that
the repertory will look more secure in style, and more rewarding to its
interpreters.

   A REPORT yesterday suggested that GP fund-holding
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one of the most controversial aspects of the government's health reforms -
is producing benefits for patients, Alan Pike writes.
Professor Howard Glennerster of the London School of Economics, who produced
the report for the King's Fund Institute, the health policy research centre,
admitted he had started the project as a 'sceptic about fund-holding'.
However, his research had made him 'far more positive about the
opportunities it presents'.
Under fund-holding some family doctors hold budgets from which they purchase
care for their patients.
Prof Glennerster says he is not yet in a position to judge whether
fund-holding should be extended universally, and adds that weaknesses in the
scheme need to be addressed. For example budgets should be set in ways which
do not penalise GPs who care for disproportionate large numbers of the very
sick and old or work in disadvantaged areas.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cook seeks end to tax relief on
private treatment - National Health Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday challenged ministers to end tax relief on private health
care and spend the savings on the National Health Service, as the NHS moved
to the centre of pre-election campaigning.
The government also focused on health, announcing a record drop in long-term
hospital waiting lists.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, promised that a Labour government
would spend the Pounds 50m saved by the tax-relief abolition on cancer
patients, providing both additional medical posts and new equipment.
Labour would use the money to 'end the disgrace that has left Britain with
fewer cancer specialists than other European countries, and older cancer
equipment than some Third World countries', he said.
Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, told a conference of health
authority chairmen and managers that in the three months to December the
number of patients waiting more than two years for an operation fell by
13,822 - the largest quarterly fall recorded.
He said that, as in the current year, there would be Pounds 39m spent on
reducing waiting lists in 1992-93. The money would be used to target
long-wait patients, 'especially in areas and specialties where there are
particular bottlenecks'.
He also announced that Pounds 4.2m would be provided to fund projects
specifically designed to improve the quality of care at NHS hospitals.
Mr Cook welcomed the additional resources to tackle waiting lists, but
accused the government of 'fiddling' the numbers by making it more difficult
for people to get on to the waiting lists in the first place.
He also questioned how sensible it was to address the issue purely in terms
waiting time, rather than in terms of clinical judgments.
Publishing a paper giving details of 'underfunding, commercialisation and
privatisation' in the health service, Mr Cook said there had been no
fundamental change in the government's approach to the NHS with the change
of prime minister, in spite of Mr John Major's repeated assurances that he
would not privatise the NHS.
He repeated that Labour would end GP fund-holding, abolish trust hospital
status and end the internal market in the NHS. Instead there would be a new
structure for a public health service. Labour intends to publish its plans
for the NHS later this month.
Mr Cook clashed with Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health minister, over
Labour's claims that the 188 per cent increase in the number of people
taking out private health insurance was evidence of 'creeping privatisation'
in the health service.
Mrs Bottomley said there was a big percentage increase in the number of
people insured by the main private health providers in 1979 and 1980. She
said this arose from the winter of industrial action in 1978-79.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (New In Brief): Labour defines
Scottish 'autonomy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday spelled out the case for Scotland staying within the union
with England and Wales by outlining its definition of 'the maximum autonomy'
feasible without severing the links of nearly three centuries, Ivo Dawnay
writes.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said there was no
advantage in 'breaking the first internal market that Europe achieved' when
the European Community was working towards common economic goals.
He said the demands of the Scottish National party for a separate currency
and exchange rates represented 'the costly trappings and not the essential
substance of a modern national identity'.
He went on to attack the Conservatives for gambling with the union by
attempting to 'polarise the debate' between the status quo and separatism.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, SNP MP for Moray, said last night in a party political
broadcast that Labour's programme was simply a 'prospectus for continued
poverty and economic stagnation' in Scotland.

NORTHERN IRELAND: The government's majority slumped to three in the Commons
last night when an order extending trade union legislation already operating
in Britain to Northern Ireland was passed by 90 votes to 87.
Ministers and their handful of supporters in the almost deserted chamber
ignored shouts of 'resign' from the few Labour MPs present to hear the
result.
*****
BRITISH RAIL: The government would be reluctant to tolerate increases in the
sums paid by BR in compensation once the new passengers' charter comes into
effect, Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, suggested yesterday.
The government had 'no plans to be associated with' any scheme that would
involve significant costs, he said. The 'sensible' way of improving services
would be to create performance targets for BR.

OIL RIG SAFETY: Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary has promised to
consider amending a private member's bill now in the Lords to include
legislation to protect from victimisation by employers workers on North Sea
oil rigs who complain about the inadequacy of safety arrangements.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (Campaign Profile): Ashdown's Bonnie
Prince Charlie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORTLY after the 1983 general election the boyish Social Democratic Party
MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye dashed from the Commons chamber, anxiously
seeking the advice of a colleague.
He was supposed to be replying for the party in a complex debate on the
Scottish rate support grant. He turned to his ally and confessed: 'I have
never paid rates in my life.'
Mr Charles Kennedy, now president of the Liberal Democrats, still suffers
from having responsibility thrust upon him at an early age. Just 32 years
old, he has been an MP for almost a decade. With his pillow-like face and
deep-set eyes, neat streak of glowing red hair and a reputation as
Westminster's most likeable chap, he will take a leading role in the Liberal
Democrats' election campaign, touring constituencies and providing
television 'sound bites'.
Not too high a profile, however, because Mr Kennedy has yet to show that a
bonnie prince can be a powerful Liberal Democrat force, perhaps a future
leader.
He has still to demonstrate full mastery of policy details and prove he can
be a philosopher king, even in a minority party unlikely to see much
increase in the election from its current 22 MPs. For now, Mr Paddy Ashdown,
party leader, sets the Liberal Democrat vision; Mr Des Wilson is the
election strategist.
Mr Kennedy's colleagues are almost as disappointed by his lack of
application as they are smitten by his human warmth.
He is a bon viveur, a wit, a charmer who always has time for everyone. He is
someone with an urgency to get on with enjoying life, for whom a good joke
can save a thousand policy lapses. 'He is the Prince Hal of the party,' says
one senior official. 'He is still at the wine-and-song stage.'
Mr Kennedy knows his biggest skill is as a communicator, rather than
championing his social market politics. 'He has never made any pretence of
being the party intellectual or thinker,' says one Liberal Democrat MP.
Another says: 'He has kept it in check since he became president, but he did
have a tendency to be flippant at the party's expense.'
But there is a borderline between communicating as a politician and as a
journalist which Mr Kennedy sometimes fudges. Since winning the party
presidency two years ago, he has appeared less as the party clown. But he
still broadcasts regularly on radio for BBC Scotland and London's LBC. He
also writes a column for The Scotsman. Few doubt he could make his money
from professional punditry.
Liberal Democrats have a hard time grabbing prime time in the Commons'
chamber. But Mr Kennedy does not compensate with the press conferences or
campaign launches beloved by his more ambitious colleagues - even though he
is a spokesman on health, one of the biggest election issues. It is as if he
would prefer to be on the other side, asking the questions and calling the
shots.
Inquiries at the Liberal Democrats' Westminster office for speeches on Mr
Kennedy's political philosophy suggest that his reputation as a wag
predominates. 'Are you looking for the sense-of-humour line?' asks the press
officer.
In fact Mr Kennedy openly admits that his conversion, first to social
democracy and then to the Liberal Democrats, 'was not a great conversion on
the road to Damascus sort of thing'. As a teenager his sympathies were
'fairly moderate, sort of centre-right of the Labour party', but his
greatest enthusiasm was debating.
In Fort William, where he was born, he won a Scottish schools' debating
competition. He loved the clash of arguments and inventive interlocution. At
Glasgow University he decided against joining the Labour club when he
discovered that it was gripped by an aversion to all things elitist and did
not take part in the debating society.
Instead he turned to the new Social Democratic Party - and particularly its
founder member, Mr Roy Jenkins, now Lord Jenkins of Hillhead.
He joined the SDP team which won the Glasgow Hillhead by-election. A year
later, while studying in the US at Indiana University he applied to be SDP
candidate in the geographically vast Ross, Cromarty and Skye constituency.
He was surprised to be selected, and more aghast when he beat the sitting
Tory MP with a majority of 1,704.
After the 1987 election, he was the most eager of the five SDP MPs to merge
with the Liberals.
Lord Jenkins remains a mentor. Mr Kennedy's political philosophy, as far as
it goes, mixes social market economics and quotations on liberty from John
Stuart Mill with Lord Jenkins' warnings on the tyranny of the current
political system. Like all Liberal Democrats, Mr Kennedy wants proportional
representation for elections. But he is pragmatic, rather than passionate.
He is a Catholic but not fanatically religious.
He has a high regard for Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader, who saw
politics more as a vehicle for achieving influence, less about the power of
ideas.
In that he differs from the radicalism of Mr Ashdown, who has set a sweeping
Liberal Democrat agenda - pro-Europe, internationalist, anti-monopoly, and
strong on individuals' rights, education and the environment.
So far there is no evidence of friction between Mr Ashdown and Mr Kennedy.
The roles they have carved are mutually exclusive. Mr Ashdown leads
aggressively from the front, expecting his colleagues to follow. Mr Kennedy
is happy to share the bandwagon if it is going roughly in the direction he
wants. He works hard on the 'rubber chicken' circuit - the endless
constituency annual general meetings and after-dinner speeches.
Where the clash with Mr Ashdown might come is if the Liberal Democrats held
the balance of power after the general election. As much as Mr Ashdown has
gingered up the party's radicalism, so he has also ratcheted up the
conditions for his support. He is determined to force constitutional reform
and an agreed agenda for a four-year government.
Mr Kennedy is perhaps less ambitious. He was a supporter of the 1977-78
Lib-Lab pact which saw the Liberals gain little in terms of policies
implemented. On his own, he might settle for less than Mr Ashdown. A
devolved assembly for Scotland might be enough.
Yet maybe rebellion is too much to expect of Mr Kennedy; he shows little
inclination to rock the boat, he is in no hurry for power. His strong
following among Liberal Democrats would make him a popular choice in the
party to succeed Mr Ashdown. But he may want to learn a little more about
rigour and ruthlessness in politics first.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems step up pact demands -
Hung Parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrats would press for at least one cabinet post if they formed a
pact with either Labour or the Tories in a hung parliament.
Party strategists have decided that the conditions they have set already for
a post-election deal - legislation to introduce proportional representation
and agreement on a four-year programme of government - would require Liberal
Democrats holding ministerial office.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, will step up his party's campaign
for constitutional reform today with a policy launch combining proposals on
electoral systems, a bill of rights and Scottish devolution.
He has previously said a bill on proportional representation would be a
prerequisite for any pact agreement, but has so far stopped short of
insisting on a cabinet post. Senior Liberal Democrats confirmed, however,
that they are determined that any pact must yield tangible gains for the
party if their support among voters is not to be jeopardised.
The lesson learnt from the 1977-78 Lib-Lab pact, when the then Liberal party
sustained the Labour government of Mr James Callaghan but failed to will
many policy changes, is that negotiations will have to be far tougher.
Liberal Democrats would have to be subject to the disciplines of government
office and have the same access to information and advice as their larger
coalition partners. In the 1977-78 pact, Liberal MPs often felt
outmanoeuvred by Labour ministers backed by civil servants.
There appears to be no preference among Liberal Democrats for heading any
particular department - although offers of a cabinet post without portfolio
would probably be rejected as meaningless. The home secretary's job might be
a possibility if it was overseeing constitutional reform.
Liberal Democrats yesterday previewed a general election poster with the
slogan: 'No wonder Britain's ill, it has a bad constitution.' It is the
first part of a week-long 'good government' campaign.
Later, the party revived a campaign dating back to the Lib-Lab pact for
proportional representation in elections to the European parliament.
This week the party will take the European parliament to the European Court
of Justice for failing to initiate electoral reform in the EC.
Mr Andrew Duff, legal campaign leader, said he wanted the court to force the
EC to start a reform process in time for the 1994 European elections: 'If
the European Community has not helped to modernise Britain's electoral
system by then, the European parliament will be a joke.'
Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat EC spokesman, said: 'It is scandalous
that British Liberal Democrats, who form the largest Liberal party in
Europe, have been excluded from the European parliament by the perverse and
reactionary nature of 'first-past-the-post'.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hattersley hints on top rate -
Taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR provided a further clue to its plans for a 50 per cent tax band
yesterday when Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, said that people
earning less than Pounds 36,000 a year would not have to pay the top rate.
Mr Hattersley, speaking on LBC radio, said that people would be willing to
pay more tax to finance higher pensions and child benefit.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, has repeatedly said that an incoming
Labour chancellor would need flexibility in drawing up his Budget plans, and
has refused to be drawn on exactly where the 50 per cent band would apply.
Labour has emphasised, however, that the top rate would affect only those
earning 'well over Pounds 30,000'.
Party officials said that Mr Hattersley's remarks were no more than an
amplification of this line, and that he was giving merely indicative
figures.
His comments were seized on by the Tories as evidence of Labour confusion.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Roy Hattersley has
shown once again that he does not trust John Smith to shape Labour's
economic policy.' He added: 'The trouble for Labour's split and splinted
economic team is that people will remember the lessons of history.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: The victims - 'This resulted in
quite a few attempted suicides'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Bohn, London (who invested the proceeds from the sale of his
company): 'The sad and scandalous thing is that this case involved so many
people who were not sophisticated investors who were trying to get richer.
They were mainly elderly people who had never invested outside a building
society in their lives. They thought this was going to be the safest
investment they could make.
'This resulted in quite a few attempted suicides, quite a few nervous
breakdowns - some people are still on tranquilisers even now.
'Even though people got their money back, that is no compensation for the
loss of their health.'
Capt Don Beadle, Portsmouth (retired naval officer; wife and son also
investors): 'I'm glad that justice has at long last been meted out. This was
a gigantic fraud that caused agony and hardship for thousands. I don't think
anyone will ever forget the 20 months, the time and effort we spent fighting
to get our money back.'
Mr Jim Hinton, Dorset (former oil company executive, Pounds 22,000 invested
with Barlow Clowes): 'This affair must have been responsible for quite a lot
of people passing on to the next world rather earlier than they would have
done.
'A good 75 per cent of investors were elderly. They thought they were were
making a safe investment.'
Mr Harry Lawrence, Sheffield: 'I had to find extra sources of income, but I
didn't let it upset me. I put all my energy into fighting for compensation.'
Mr Antony Gold of Alexander Tatham (solicitors to the Barlow Clowes
Investors Group): 'Investors went through 18 months of utter misery, feeling
that they had lost most of their savings. But they did significantly better
under the old system than they would have done under the new regime. The
ombudsman is not empowered to investigate self-regulating bodies. Under the
new legislation they would have been in a far worse position and would still
have been waiting for compensation if it had occurred under the Financial
Services Act.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Warning to jury on verdicts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JURY in the Blue Arrow fraud trial will today retire to consider their
verdicts - exactly one year to the day after court proceedings began.
Completing his summing-up yesterday, Mr Justice McKinnon, the judge,
repeatedly warned the 11 men and one woman not to convict the five remaining
defendants if unsure of their guilt.
He said the prosecution's remaining allegation was that in agreeing to buy
shares in the 1987 rights issue after the passing of the official deadline -
so increasing the take-up level from 38 per cent to 48 per cent - the
defendants had conspired to dishonestly mislead the markets.
When summing up the evidence against four of the defendants, the judge
listed a series of tests in each case. Unless these tests had been met by
the prosecution, the jury had to acquit, he said.
The case against Mr Jonathan Cohen, County NatWest's former chief executive,
depended on whether, in a telephone call to Mr David Reed, County's former
corporate finance head, he had been told of and approved the 'late take-up'
before the shares were bought. In his evidence, Mr Reed, another defendant,
had denied telling Mr Cohen of this.
Mr Nicholas Wells, a former County director, had given evidence that he had
thought the late take-up was both legal and against nobody's interests. Mr
Wells' approach to both the Bank of England and his superiors might be
thought positive points in his favour, the judge continued.
Mr Martin Gibbs, a former head of corporate finance at Phillips &amp; Drew
Securities, had checked whether the late take-up was legal and obtained
authority from his chairman, Mr Bryce Cottrell.
The jury would want to bear both points in mind in deciding Mr Gibbs'
honesty, he said.
Mr Christopher Stainforth, a former P&amp;D director, should be compared with Mr
David Roper, another corporate financier present at the meeting when the
shares were bought. Both had relied on the late take-up being approved by
their superiors and the prosecution had not sug-gested Mr Roper was a
conspirator.
'Is not Mr Stainforth's position identical to Mr Roper's?' the judge said.
If the jury felt there was no difference between the position of the two men
they might feel no alternative but to acquit Mr Stainforth, he continued.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: North relieved as a scandal becomes
history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL and prof-essional-services sectors of Manchester and Leeds
appear to have escaped any taint from the Barlow Clowes affair, although
some within their business communities had an uncomfortable brush with the
scandal.
In Leeds several leading professionals have made a point since the Barlow
Clowes collapse of briefing existing and potential clients on the background
to the affair.
In Manchester, respectable professionals were so suspicious of Mr Clowes'
bond-washing operations - and the high levels of commission he was
understood to have offered some intermediaries - that they had nothing to do
with him from the outset in the 1970s.
With Manchester's finance sector mainly contained in what the city calls its
'square half-mile', professional networks consigned Mr Clowes to the fringe.
When the scandal broke in 1988 many Manchester professionals could honestly
claim never to have heard of him.
His Manchester professional origins were as a fairly lowly life-assurance
salesman. Barlow Clowes itself operated 10 miles out of the city in Poynton,
Cheshire. From it Mr Clowes sold his investment schemes through the then
poorly regulated financial intermediaries.
But by the time Leeds professionals became involved in 1987, Barlow Clowes
was a big business which Mr Clowes wanted to reverse into James Ferguson
Holdings - a quoted but formerly moribund loss-maker that had started life
in knitwear - in order to go public and achieve respectability.
In 1985 Mr Cramer, a young Leeds market trader, had bought into Ferguson to
raise capital for expansion into financial services and property. Meanwhile
Mr Clowes needed to find other means to keep up the returns he had promised
investors after the Inland Revenue closed the tax loophole through which
Barlow Clowes made its gilts operations pay.
This had worked by selling gilts just before they matured to obtain capital
gains which were then taxed at a lower rate than the interest on the bonds.
A quoted company offered a vehicle for building a network of investment
activity.
The Leeds financial community organised a rights issue so the company could
expand and incorporate the Barlow Clowes businesses. The professionals
involved in the local community took Mr Clowes on trust as they knew his
associate, Mr Guy Cramer.
Rensburg, which has since become part of the BWD Rensburg quoted financial
services group, was the main underwriter to the rights issue and informed
the Stock Exchange that it had been misled over the status of the
sub-underwriter, which turned out to be under the control of Mr Clowes.
Investigations by the Stock Exchange, the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Serious Fraud Office exonerated Rensburg, which had acted in good
faith. Coincidentally, the Barlow Clowes house of cards started to collapse
soon after Rensburg's resignation.
There was some trepidation in Leeds in case negligence claims arose against
rights-issue advisers after James Ferguson's collapse. The fears proved
groundless, but many in the business community of the north will be glad to
see the end of the Barlow Clowes affair.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Europe risks air fares rise, CAA chief says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FARES in Europe could rise and consumer choice diminish unless there is
a coherent policy on airline mergers and acquisitions, Mr Christopher
Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, warned yesterday.
In his first important policy statement since becoming CAA chairman eight
months ago, Mr Chataway said that without a vigorous European policy on
mergers and competition there was 'every prospect that fares will rise and
consumer choice will shrink as the little competition that exists today is
further diminished'.
His warning coincides with an acceleration of the restructuring of the
European airline industry. British Airways is in advanced negotiations about
linking with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, while this year Air France expects to
complete a strategic partnership with Sabena of Belgium which will include
the French carrier taking a significant stake in Sabena.
While Mr Chataway does not want to prevent large European airlines from
expanding their businesses to compete against large US and Asian airlines,
he also wants a safeguard for smaller carriers and new entrants into the
market who can stimulate competition and lower fares.
He added that it was important for European air transport and consumers that
a merger policy was formulated before the process of airline consolidation
confined Europe's airline to a few so-called mega-carriers.
Conditions should be attached to mergers between two national flag carriers
to safeguard the position and prospects of smaller airlines, he continued.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: A landmark case of old-fashioned
theft - Two of the four defendants are found guilty Crash has cost British
taxpayers over Pounds 150m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of Barlow Clowes was a landmark for the UK investment world of
the 1980s.
While insider trading and stock market manipulation had become known as the
fashionable ills of the age, Mr Peter Clowes' little-known investment
management business from the north-west was busy perpetrating a more
old-fashioned form of financial wrongdoing: theft.
Investors' money was used to provide Mr Clowes with an extravagant
lifestyle, according to the prosecution case mounted by the Serious Fraud
Office. New investments were taken in and used to pay 'returns' to existing
investors in a constant recycling of money. It worked as long as new cash
was available to feed the machine - a classic 'ponzi' scheme, one of the
oldest forms of investment fraud.
The case proved a watershed for the UK's system of financial regulation, for
the public's confidence in investment firms, and, above all, for the
strongly non-interventionist government of Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Despite strong denials of any responsibility by the Department of Trade and
Industry, which had been responsible for regulating the firm for many years,
the government bowed to an unprecedented campaign mounted by Barlow Clowes'
11,000 mainly elderly investors.
Attempts to launch a City 'lifeboat' to bail out Barlow Clowes' hapless
investors were initially rejected by a financial establishment unwilling to
admit Mr Clowes as one of its own. About 500 elderly investors had already
died by the time Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, gave
way to pressure to pay out compensation.
The announcement of the pay-out coincided with the publication of a report
by the ombudsman, which criticised the DTI on five counts of
maladministration regarding the licensing and regulation of Barlow Clowes.
The case has so far cost British taxpayers more than Pounds 150m. In its
attempts to recover some of this money, the DTI has already issued more than
800 writs.
The accountancy firms Touche Ross and Spicer &amp; Pegler (which has since
merged with Touche), the four biggest UK clearing banks - and a number of
investment advisers who put money into Barlow Clowes - may all be sued to
recover the taxpayer's money. So far only Pounds 550,000 has been recovered
 -after a successful action against an adviser, ACD Miller.
At the start of the trial last summer, the jury was told that the Barlow
Clowes fraud was massive, flagrant and 'as old as the hills' in style.
According to Mr Alan Suckling QC, bringing the prosecution for the SFO,
investors were persuaded that their money would be securely invested in
gilts, when in reality it was spent on 'living the life of Riley'.
Showing the jurors a photograph of Mr Clowes's yacht - formerly owned by
Christina Onassis - he told them: 'If you look carefully you will see the
only gilt-edged object bought with investors' money by Mr Clowes. Can you
guess what it is? The taps'.
One of the last things investors thought their money would be spent on was
the chateau and vineyard near Bordeaux bought for Pounds 600,000, he said.
As he listed other ways that clients' money had been spent - on luxury cars
and funding corporate raids - Mr Suckling's style was to let the facts speak
for themselves, underlining his points with only a tone of dry irony.
The jury was presented with a detailed account of how the fraud operated.
The company's brochures stated that clients' money would be invested in
gilt-edged stock - a crucial selling point for those anxious to find a
secure place to invest their life savings.
However, contracts contained clauses authorising non-gilts investments
which, Mr Clowes was to maintain, enabled his company to adopt an
'alternative investment strategy'. This strategy, far from being based on
gilts, saw Barlow Clowes operating as a mini merchant bank and funding
take-over bids for public and private companies it wanted to control.
Between 1983 and 1987 more than Pounds 113m of the funds invested in the
offshore companies and partnerships in the Barlow Clowes fund management
empire were milked from investors, Mr Suckling said.
At the end of 1987, when DTI inspectors began investigating, strenuous
efforts were made to throw them off the track. Documents were shredded,
bogus letters were placed on files to indicate accounts had been closed and
Pounds 16m of clients' funds were used to plug holes in the accounts.
When the firm collapsed in May 1988 the true position emerged. More than
Pounds 225m had been invested by clients and a Pounds 115m liability to them
remained. Only Pounds 1.9m was found invested in gilts. The value of other
assets discovered by the receivers and liquidators totalled Pounds 60m.
Otherwise, the cupboard was bare.
Mr Clowes had been 'the instigator and driving force' behind the fraud, the
prosecution said. Mr Peter Naylor, a computer consultant, had been his
'lieutenant' in helping milk investors' funds.
Over the course of the 109-day trial, 113 witnesses gave evidence. These
included a succession of investors who recounted why, attracted by the
security of gilts, they had put their money into Barlow Clowes.
One, who had invested Pounds 440,000, said she had done so because she
understood that her savings would be 'as safe as the Bank of England'.
Only two of the defendants - Mr Clowes and Mr Naylor - opted to go into the
witness box to give evidence.
Mr Clowes admitted very few gilts had been bought. He agreed that although
the group billed itself as a gilts specialist it in fact acted as a mini
merchant bank. However, he repeatedly denied that his dealings had been
dishonest. The clauses in his company's contracts allowing other investments
meant his conduct had been 'absolutely honest', he insisted.
The complex arrangements for handling investors' funds were not a laundering
operation, as the prosecution suggested, but a means of maintaining clients'
confidentiality, he told the court.
Summing up, Mr Justice Phillips ruled that the Barlow Clowes contract with
investors did not permit the alternative investment strategy adopted by Mr
Clowes. This did not necessarily mean, however, that the defendants' conduct
had been dishonest or criminal. That was for the jury to decide, he said.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: A baptism by fire for the novice
investment investigators - Richard Waters on whether regulators can stop
such crimes in the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEREMY ORME, a towering accountant with a cadaverous pallor, is in the
front line of the UK's fight against investment fraud. A seasoned
investigator with the penetrating eye and clipped delivery of his calling,
he is moved to biblical references.
'Wickedness is like the green bay tree in the bible,' he says. 'Cut it down
and it will grow up again.'
Mr Orme is head of enforcement at the Securities and Investments Board, the
main investment watchdog. For him and the team of investigators he heads,
wickedness is tangible - the fraud and theft which deprives investors in
some cases of their life savings. None of them is prepared to say that
another Barlow Clowes will not happen.
'The moment we think we have done enough, we can be sure we will not have
done,' says Mr Orme. Mr Jim Gaskin, head of enforcement for Fimbra, the
regulatory body for independent financial advisers, agrees. 'If I said it
couldn't happen again, it would be a hostage to fortune, and of course it
would then happen tomorrow,' he says.
Yet both argue that the UK's system of investment regulation is far better
than it was. Closing Barlow Clowes was, in fact, one of the first successes
of the regime introduced under the 1986 Financial Services Act (FSA). After
years of dilatory action by the Department of Trade and Industry, SIB moved
to close Barlow Clowes in 1988 just days after it took on its full powers
under the act.
Before the act, investment regulation was administered by the DTI under the
Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act. After it, a raft of new regulatory
bodies, led by SIB, was set up, each with its own team of investigators. The
teams are patched together with accountants, lawyers and assorted
experienced investigators from outside the investment world.
The Department of Trade and Industry no longer directly regulates the
investment industry. However, it too is taking its responsibilities under
the Companies Acts far more seriously after the bad publicity generated by
Barlow Clowes and other cases of the mid 1980s. Its investigations division
now employs 195, marking a 'significant increase in the past two years'.
Mr Gaskin at Fimbra points to some of the lessons that have been learnt in
the short time the act has been in force. Inspection visits on investment
firms are now targeted at those considered to carry the highest risk of
fraud: those with a single controlling director, for instance, or those
audited by a single accountant rather than a partnership. External signs,
such as the late filing of accounts or even the changing of an accounting
date, are monitored as signs of possible problems.
'They are much more focused visits now,' he says. 'There's a much better
assessment of where the risks are.'
Yet at least four weak links remain in the regulatory system. Each makes it
easier for investment frauds to be perpetrated, or delays the time it takes
for frauds to come to light.
The first is the role played by auditors in the regulatory system. Along
with an investment company's own board of directors, they are central to the
prevention of fraud. According to Mr Orme: 'It would be a grotesque waste of
national resource to think that corporate governance and auditing can count
for nothing, and that the specialist regulator has to start again.'
Faced with public concern that it was not doing more to fight fraud, the
auditing profession spent years arguing that the public misunderstood the
role of auditors before accepting that their role needed to be expanded. 'It
was very regrettable that the accountancy profession has taken so long,'
says Mr Orme, himself a former senior partner of Robson Rhodes, the
accountancy firm. He said he was disappointed that it had not been quicker
in its response to public concern. Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the
Auditing Practices Board, accepted that accountants may have been slow to
act before, but said substantial changes were being proposed to meet public
concerns. 'The question now is whether we are being too ambitious in what we
are trying to achieve,' he said.
The second weak link is the unwillingness of professionals in the City to
'blow the whistle' when they suspect fraud. 'There needs to be a general
awakening about whistle-blowing,' says Mr Orme. Investment failures are
invariably followed by comments from City professionals that they suspected
something all along, he says. In spite of constant pleas from the regulators
and the Serious Fraud Office for greater help, the general attitude in the
City seems not to have changed.
The third weak link has been the people on whom the job of supervising the
investment world has fallen, though substantial headway has been made in
raising the quality of investigators in recent years. Low salaries are one
explanation; lack of experience another.
At the outset of the FSA regime, says Mr Gaskin, 'there were lots of people
around with auditing experience, but auditors are not responsible for
detecting fraud. We are - and we're getting better at it'.
The fourth problem has been the sheer number of investigatory bodies in the
City, each with overlapping interests. The political in-fighting and
jealousies this has created have at times spilled over into bad feeling
between regulators, though none has been bad-mannered enough to express it
publicly. Co-ordination between the regulators has improved as they have
learned to live with each other: but as the collapse of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International proved, 'colleges' of regulators all sharing
responsibility for a financial firm can fail dismally.
Ms Marjorie Mowlem, Labour's voice on City affairs, said that a Labour
government would 'streamline the regulatory system to prevent financial
advisers choosing the weak link in the web of regulatory institutions'.
The best defence probably rests with investors. Mr Gaskin says it is 'the
old, old story: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / Manufacturing pay deals fall, CBI says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING pay settlements fell decisively below the rate of inflation in
the final quarter of last year, according to the latest figures from the
Confederation of British Industry's pay databank.
The 4.1 per cent average increase disclosed for the three months to the end
of December was lower than December's 4.5 per cent annual increase in retail
price inflation and less than half the 9 per cent average for manufacturing
pay settlements in the final quarter of 1990.
Productivity among manufacturers rose as pay increases declined. According
to the CBI, manufacturers reported average productivity gains of 5.2 per
cent in the year to the fourth quarter of last year, up slightly on the 5.1
per cent gain registered in the 12 months to the third quarter.
The employers' organisation said that, since August, one in five
manufacturing settlements have been at or below 2.5 per cent, while just
under one in four were between 2.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent. A further one
in four settlements were worth between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent, and
slightly more than one in four between 5.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent.
Pay settlements in service-sector companies are also falling. According to
provisional CBI data, they averaged 6.1 per cent in the second half of last
year compared with averages of 7.1 per cent in the first six months of last
year and 8.9 per cent in the second half of 1990. In addition to those
manufacturers that have reported for the fourth quarter, a further one in
seven are deferring their pay awards for up to six months from their normal
pay review date, the CBI added.
The Treasury said yesterday that the CBI figures were 'encouraging'.
Officials noted, however, that the pay data information has only been
gathered since 1980 and therefore was not as well-established as an economic
indicator as the CBI's industrial trends survey.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Poor management is blamed for staff dissatisfaction:
Recommendations of the public-sector pay review bodies - Nursing and allied
professions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR MANAGEMENT rather than poor pay is the cause of greatest
dissatisfaction among National Health Service hospital staff, according to
the review body, which examined the pay of nurses, midwives and other allied
professionals such as physiotherapists and radiographers.
The review body recommended increases of 5.6 per cent to 6 per cent for the
nearly 500,000 nurses and midwives employed by the NHS. The 43,000 belonging
to the group of allied professions did slightly better, with increases of
6.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Increases for the 1992-93 pay bill are
estimated at 5.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively.
In practice this will mean an increase from Pounds 10,230 to Pounds 10,820
for a newly qualified staff nurse at the bottom of the scale and an increase
from Pounds 12,995 to Pounds 13,750 for a newly qualified ward sister.
Basic grades of the allied professions will be increased from Pounds 10,800
to Pounds 11,500; pay of top occupational therapists, for example, will go
from Pounds 25,750 to Pounds 27,400.
Staff retention appeared to have improved, the report said, and morale among
nurses was found to be 'generally reasonably high'. But the review body was
critical of the fact that more than 30,000 appeals arising from the 1988
clinical grading review were still waiting to be heard.
'Dissatisfaction about this backlog has infected the attitude of many staff
to the pay scales themselves and has to some extent hindered us in assessing
the effect of pay levels on recruitment, retention, motivation and morale,'
the body reported.
Many of the points raised by the staff in their argument for better pay
could be 'addressed more effectively by management action than by increases
in pay', the report said .
The review body made no recommendations on possible future levels of
performance-related pay and increased local pay flexibility, but emphasised
that the two issues should not be confused. Proposals from the Department of
Health have so far dealt with the two together.
The staging of pay rises in previous years had led to widely and strongly
felt 'disappointment and frustration' among all NHS hospital groups, the
review body stated in its report's introductory remarks.
The National Union of Public Employees, which represents, in particular,
some of the lower-paid nursing staff, said the rises did not even make up
for last year's shortfall through staging. 'After these rises over 100,000
nurses will still be paid less than the European Community 'decency
threshold' of Pounds 5.16 an hour,' said Nupe.
The Royal College of Nursing said awards left nurses 'treading water'. Ms
Christine Hancock, RCN general secretary, said: 'The RCN supports the pay
review body structure as a fair and independent method of settling nurses'
pay but it is depressing to see nurses slipping down the pay ladder again.
The award is well behind the average rise in earnings - currently running at
7.5 per cent and only just ahead of current inflation rates.'
Cohse, the other main health service union, said the review body for nurses
was 'in its death throes' because by 1994 all nurses would be working in
trusts.
That would leave nurses 'in the lurch, at the mercy of hospitals driven to
cut costs by aggressive health market competition'.
Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions
Allied to Medicine. Ninth Report on Nursing staff, midwives and health
visitors 1992, HMSO. Pounds 7.65. Ninth report on professions allied to

FT  11 FEB 92 / Government releases a salary surge: Recommendations of the
public-sector pay review bodies - Pressures building up over wages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME TIME this year average gross weekly earnings in the public sector - now
Pounds 283 - are expected to overtake those in the private sector (Pounds
285). This will happen in one of the periodic surges in public-sector pay.
Yesterday's decision by the government to grant the pay-review body
recommendations in full, no doubt mindful of the imminence of polling day,
will not act as a brake on that surge.
The recommended increases, effective from April 1 - for the armed forces,
nurses, doctors, professions allied to medicine and teachers - average
nearly 6.5 per cent, with the teachers on 7.5 per cent pushing up that
average. The four pay-review bodies cover about 1.5m workers or 30 per cent
of public-sector employees.
Nearly half the public sector's 5m workers are covered by review bodies or
special comparability deals, which look at average earnings over the
preceding 12 months and thus tend to boost public-sector pay when inflation
is falling fast, as it has been recently.
The result, according to Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation,
the research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, is that the rise in public-sector pay was 2 1/2 percentage
points above private-sector pay increases in 1991-92 and will be at least
one percentage point above the private sector and three percentage points
above inflation this year. Mr Trinder believes that the relatively generous
awards of the pay-review bodies are helping to create a 'two-tier' public
sector with a growing gap between the privileged pay-review groups and
others, such as local-government workers, who still bargain in the normal
way.
However, this year's pay-review settlement may help to pull up other
public-sector workers to increases of at least 5 per cent. The
non-industrial civil servants still have a private-sector comparability
system, which will probably give them about 5.5 per cent.
As manufacturing industry tries to hold down pay in order to stay
competitive within the European exchange rate mechanism, there are other
pressures that are likely to keep public-sector pay high over the next
couple of years
The pay-review bodies will not start pushing on performance-related pay for
doctors, nurses and teachers until next year. But the various attempts to
introduce more flexibility into public-sector pay will, in the medium-term,
increase earnings and not reduce them.
The Top Salaries Review Body recommendations, postponed until after the
election, are almost certain to propose enormous catch-up rises for top
civil servants, judges and generals which will seep down to lower levels.
Large private-sector employers, which are now agreeing rises of less than 5
per cent, will not thank the government for yesterday's decisions.

MANUAL WORKERS at Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, began
voting yesterday on a pay offer which would provide 5 per cent in the first
year of a two-year deal. Shop stewards predicted that they would be in
favour of taking industrial action in an attempt to win a better package.
The offer, which would be backdated to last October, would provide an
increase in line with inflation in the second year. Workers would also
receive in the second year a lump-sum payment equivalent to 0.5 per cent on
annual pay.
Employees at Luton would receive an extra 5 per cent for agreeing to changes
in working practices as part of the deal.

POTTERTON Myson, part of Blue Circle Industries, yesterday announced the
closure of its domestic boiler factory at Birtley, Co Durham, with the loss
of 302 jobs.
The company, which hopes to redeploy about 10 per cent of the Birtley
workforce, said output would be transferred to the factory's sister plants
at Padiham, Lancashire, and Warwick.
Acquisition of Myson Group in late 1989 had given Potterton Myson more
manufacturing capacity than was needed to meet expected demand. That was the
main reason for the Birtley closure, the company said.

GATEWAY Foodmarkets, the supermarket chain, is planning to make up to 3,000
people redundant, the Usdaw shopworkers' union claimed last night.
Gateway said that it was planning to cut the equivalent of 2,000 full-time
jobs from its 43,000 workforce. The company said sales were down at the
halfway stage and since then the 'trading pressures have not abated'.
It added: 'We are talking about a combination of a freeze on overtime, a
freeze on recruitment, an additional shift from full-timers to part-timers
and some redundancies.' The precise cuts will be decided at store and local
level at the end of the month, but the move to more part-timers is aimed at
allowing higher staffing at peak times for 'an improved level of service
together with gains in productivity'.
The company criticised the union for making what it described as an
'irresponsible' political decision to announce the cuts. 'Jumping the gun is
only going to cause apprehension among staff,' it said.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Award 'greater than contemplated': Recommendations of the
public-sector pay review bodies - Teachers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSTANTIAL pay rise for teachers has been on the cards since Mr John
Major appointed an independent review body to assess their pay shortly after
becoming prime minister. It was a calculated attempt to raise teachers'
morale - and with it the Tories' flagging support in the public sector.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, admitted yesterday that the 7.5 per
cent award to the 420,000 teachers in England and Wales was 'greater than
the government had contemplated'. But ministers had pledged to honour the
review body's findings in full, and with the rise due to take effect on
April 1 - a week before the most likely election date - staggering its
implementation was not an option.
The rise takes the low on the teachers' scale from Pounds 10,404 to Pounds
11,184, and the top from Pounds 17,523 to Pounds 18,837 plus allowances. A
good honours graduate will start on at least Pounds 12,300 - Pounds 14,200
in inner London. The top of the head-teachers' scale - for heads of large
secondary schools - rises from Pounds 46,680 to Pounds 50,181.
Primary teachers do best in the settlement. An additional 26,000 incentive
allowances - more than one extra per school - will be available from
September, worth between Pounds 1,296 and Pounds 4,000 each. By then, more
than half of all teachers will be receiving an allowance.
The settlement will add 7.8 per cent to the teachers' pay bill, which local
authorities will have to meet. The government announced yesterday that it
would provide local government with an extra Pounds 60m to bridge the gap
between the pay settlement and the government's 7.2 per cent allowance for
extra education spending in the 1992-93 rate-support grant settlement.
However, local authority leaders claimed that the 7.2 per cent allowed only
for an extra 3.7 per cent of spending after last year's pay award and
demographic trends had been taken into the calculations.
The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities claimed
yesterday that the 'funding gap' amounted to Pounds 300m, and predicted cuts
in teacher numbers and school budgets.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Lloyd's Names close to clear victory on Outhwaite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Lloyd's Names are close to winning a clear victory in the
out-of-court settlement being negotiated in the Outhwaite case.
Details of the settlement between 987 Names, who were members of Outhwaite
syndicate 317/661 in 1982, and 81 Lloyd's agents, including RHM Outhwaite
Underwriting, will be announced this morning.
The Names - the individuals whose capital supports underwriting at the
insurance market - are expected to win more than Pounds 100m from the
settlement which will be financed by errors and omissions insurers, who
cover agents against legal awards for negligence.
Errors and omissions policies, which are underwritten by Lloyd's syndicates,
also usually cover legal costs.
Syndicate 317/661's losses in the 1982 underwriting year amounted to more
than Pounds 200m and are expected to carry on rising.
Reports that a final settlement had been reached on Sunday night were
dismissed as 'premature' by sources close to the Names, who said
negotiations continued yesterday. Only those Names backing the legal action
will benefit, which will exclude the rest of the 1,614 Names on the
syndicate.
High Court hearings in the action, which began in October, have heard how Mr
Richard Outhwaite, the underwriter of syndicate 317/661, underwrote 32
loss-making reinsurance contracts, assuming the US liability exposures of
other insurers. When claims from awards to asbestosis victims mounted in the
mid-1980s, the syndicates produced disastrous results for Names.
Discussions about a possible out-of-court settlement are understood to have
begun about two weeks ago after an expert witness, Mr Richard Hazell,
finished giving his evidence on behalf of Mr Outhwaite. Mr Justice Saville
adjourned the hearings for a week on Monday last week.
Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's, is said to have been involved
in the initial talks between the 1982 Outhwaite Names Association and the
agents' errors and omissions insurers.
A settlement in the case is likely to encourage other Names also involved in
legal action against their agents. Four legal cases - involving Names on
syndicates managed by Pulbrook, Poland and Oakeley Vaughan - are
outstanding.
A High Court judge yesterday issued disqualification orders against two
former Lloyd's underwriters. Mr Peter Cameron-Webb and Mr Peter Dixon,
formerly of the PCW Agencies, were disqualified from being involved in the
management of companies for 10 years.
The two were accused of 'dishonest and cynical plunder' in a DTI report
published 18 months ago.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Warning on performance rises: Recommendations of the
public-sector pay review bodies - Doctors and dentists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE review body for doctors and dentists warned about the difficulties of
introducing performance-related pay as it recommended rises of 5.5 per cent
for all of the group covered except general dental practitioners (GDPs) who
were awarded 8.5 per cent.
It said it was concerned about government plans to constrain money available
for performance-related pay after health-service officials said they would
not be looking to 'fund pay flexibility' from outside recommended general
increases
The review body said the incentive impact of performance-pay schemes would
be weakened if they were seen as being automatically set against future pay
rises.
Its recommendations will mean a 6 per cent rise in the pay bill for 106,000
doctors and dentists at a cost of Pounds 314m.
In recommending an increase of 8.5 per cent for GDPs, the review body said
it took into account the business difficulties experienced by practices and
the evidence of an increased workload under a new contract.
It also noted the trend in the values of pensions and fringe packages which
showed GDPs at a particular disadvantage to comparable professions outside
the health service.
In spite of the review body's recommendations the British Medical
Association said that doctors would see average earnings rise by only 3 per
cent because of a clawback of money paid this year which resulted from
targets being exceeded. It is understood that some dentists will suffer a
similar effect.
The review body's recommendations would take the average net remuneration of
a general medical practitioner to Pounds 40,010 from April 1 and that of
general dental practitioners to Pounds 35,815.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Inflation-beating increase contrasts with redundancies:
Recommendations of the public-sector pay review bodies - Armed Services

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
297,000-strong but declining - was at the upper end of expectations after a
relatively generous increase last year.
It comes as Army personnel await the first wave of redundancies under the
government's planned cuts in service strength.
'We were not anticipating anything extraordinary,' an Army officer commented
yesterday.
The review body, chaired by Sir Peter Cazalet, recommended a general
increase of 5.9 per cent, with some categories of warrant officer receiving
a higher 7.9 per cent to bring them more into line with comparable civilian
jobs.
Under the increases the pay of a Royal Navy lieutenant with six years in the
rank will rise from Pounds 23,007 to Pounds 24,302. A Lieutenant Colonel or
Wing Commander will receive Pounds 36,964, up from Pounds 35,001.
The pay levels include the so-called X factor, designed to reflect the
special hardships of service life. This now stands at 11.5 per cent of the
basic pay, after being increased last year.
Pay scales for officers promoted from the ranks are being uprated.
Increments for long-serving non-commissioned officers are also to be
increased, but the review body questioned the effectiveness of the current
system.
The recommendations are expected to add Pounds 291.9m to the armed forces'
salary bill including the cost of reserves. But higher charges for food and
accommodation will recover about Pounds 17.7m of the extra cost.
The estimated 5.9 per cent increase in the pay bill for regular forces
compares with 12.2 per cent last year when the armed services was the only
public-sector group to have the rise paid in full rather than by stages.
That increase came in the middle of the Gulf war.
In its recommendations, the review body said it had to take account of 'much
uncertainty about future roles and jobs' following the announcement last
summer of plans to reduce numbers of regular personnel by 62,000. The
remuneration package played 'no small part' in servicemen's motivation, it
said.
A first batch of redundancies, mostly voluntary, is due to be announced
later this month involving about 850 army officers and 2,500 soldiers.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Scottish Nuclear to cut fuel reprocessing needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned company which operates Scotland's two
nuclear power stations, is go ahead with a project to store spent fuel at
its plants instead of having it reprocessed by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL).
This break with established practice in the nuclear industry should save
Scottish Nuclear Pounds 40m a year when fully on stream and will mean a
substantial reduction in BNFL's reprocessing business with Scottish Nuclear.
However, Scottish Nuclear is committed to BNFL reprocessing at least 330
tonnes of spent fuel at Sellafield, Cumbria, as well as the quantity already
contracted for. The two groups said yesterday they had reached agreement in
principle on contracts for the next 15 years.
The contracts, which will be backdated to April 1989, will be worth Pounds
2.7bn and will be on a fixed-price basis instead of the cost-plus
arrangements of the past. They cover supply of fuel to stations at Torness,
East Lothian, and Hunterston, Ayrshire; reprocessing of fuel from Scottish
Nuclear's magnox station at Hunterston, now being decommissioned; treatment
and storage of radioactive waste and Scottish Nuclear's share of the
eventual decommissioning of BNFL's plant.
Mr James Hann, the Scottish company's chairman, has argued since the company
was created in 1990 out of the former South of Scotland Electricity Board
that BNFL charged too much for reprocessing and that reprocessing was
unnecessary - the uranium and plutonium it produced is not needed.
Now Scottish Nuclear is to develop dry fuel stores at its advanced
gas-cooled (AGR) plants, first at Torness and then at Hunterston. Up to the
year 2005 about 2,000 tonnes of spent fuel will be stored for at least 50
years, after which it might either be reprocessed if required or transferred
to a nuclear repository.
The initial stage of each store will cost Pounds 15m. Scottish Nuclear will
apply for planning permission and hopes to begin construction of the Torness
store next year, to open two years later.
BNFL, which is completing its Pounds 5bn thermal oxide reprocessing plant
(Thorp) at Sellafield, is already contracted to reprocess about 600 tonnes
of spent fuel from Scottish Nuclear, most of which is already in its hands.
The extra 330 tonnes covers the period from 1989 up to completion of the new
stores.
Mr Hann said: 'These have been particularly tough negotiations over months.'
Sir Christopher Harding, chairman of BNFL, said the agreement was 'a radical
change in our commercial relationship,' and there were differences of view
between BNFL and Scottish Nuclear on spent-fuel strategy, but the deal was
good for BNFL.
Nuclear Electric, which operates plants in England and Wales, last year
signed a Pounds 13bn contract with BNFL which included the reprocessing of
two thirds of all spent fuel from its AGR stations.

A HUNG parliament would result in a deterioration in the property market,
according to a poll of banks and financial institutions, Vanessa Houlder
writes.
Many lenders also felt that a Labour government would impede recovery,
according to the survey by Chesterton Financial, a property adviser, and
Thames Polytechnic.
Of the lenders surveyed, 58 per cent expected the market to deteriorate if
there was a hung parliament, 41 per cent thought that would be the case if
there was a Labour victory and 4 per cent saw a deterioration under the
Conservatives. The expected timing of a recovery was up to three years.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Treasury admits housing market miscalculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has admitted that its forecasting techniques have failed to
take into account the extent to which the depression in the housing market
has influenced the recession.
The move has raised expectations among some private-sector economists that
the Treasury might be considering a boost to the market, possibly as early
as in the Budget on March 10.
The admission has taken the form of detailed changes to the equations in the
Treasury's computer model of how the economy functions. The model acts as a
base for the department's twice-yearly economic forecasts. An improved
version of the model incorporates new links between consumer spending -
which accounts for two thirds of gross domestic product - and the value of
the housing stock.
It thus enables Treasury officials to make quantitative estimates of the
degree to which consumer spending is likely to be restrained by depressed
house prices. That may happen through a drop in general confidence caused by
falling wealth levels.
The new equations also enable the Treasury to estimate how cuts in tax rates
may influence the housing market, and - through that market - general
consumer spending. It means government economists can simulate the degree to
which consumer spending could lift off through, for example, a change in
mortgage tax relief.
Mr Brian Pearce, chief economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, a
forecasting group which uses the Treasury model, said the new equations
might indicate that the Treasury was considering changes on fiscal policy
applied to housing in the Budget.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a drop of more than 45,000 compared with December. Sales last month were,
however, more than three times higher than in January last year, according
to the FT Satellite Monitor.
The figures, based on monthly interviews with a sample of more than 4,000
adults, takes the number of UK homes with satellite dishes to 2.2m. The
number of those who say they will definitely or probably install satellite
television totals 1.86m, scarcely changed from a year ago. In that time
800,000 dishes have been installed.
Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, which produces the FT
Monitor, said yesterday that the results showed that the dish market still
needed stimulation through advertising and special offers. 'The market will
need constant promotion and good programming if it is to achieve (as
Continental predicts) over 1m new installations in 1992,' Mr Clemens said.
Satellite channels are taking more than 25 per cent of viewing in homes with
dishes compared with 40 per cent for ITV alone.

Colour of money: Royal Mail is breaking new ground with next month's issue
of four stamps ranging from Pounds 1 to Pounds 5. The Queen's head in the
corner of the stamps will change colour from gold to green depending on how
the light hits it. The effect is similar to the changing image on credit and
cheque guarantee card holograms, but is created by the first use on stamps
of a special ink which leaves a microscopically three-dimensional surface.
The ink has previously been used only when printing special documents and
foreign banknotes with a value of about Pounds 1,000. The aim, says Royal
Mail, is to deter would-be forgers, although there have been no signs yet of
such attempts. The stamps will be on sale from March 24.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Tsongas closes on Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE surge by former Senator Paul Tsongas, pictured above at a weekend
rally, has turned next week's New Hampshire Democratic primary race into a
virtual dead-heat, Lionel Barber writes from Salem.
Polls published yesterday show Mr Tsongas within a hair's breadth of
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early favourite in New Hampshire.
A month ago Mr Tsongas, who comes from neighbouring Massachusetts, was
written-off by the media which mocked his self-effacing humour and
unglamorous character. These have now turned into a virtue as allegations of
adultery and draft-dodging have hurt Mr Clinton.
According to weekend Boston Globe and USA Today/CNN/Gallup polls, Mr Tsongas
has drawn within 3 points of Mr Clinton, whose support has slipped to just
over 30 per cent. Senator Bob Kerrey, the Vietnam war hero from Nebraska,
remains in third place, some 15 points behind Mr Tsongas. Mr Kerrey insisted
yesterday the race in New Hampshire was fluid.
A complicating factor in the New Hampshire primary will be the degree of
'write in' support for Governor Mario Cuomo of New York. Mr Cuomo is not an
official candidate, but voters are allowed to write the name of a candidate
of their choice on ballot papers.
Mr Tom Harkin, as the home state senator, was thought certain of victory in
yesterday's Iowa Democratic caucuses.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Conservatives bring protectionism out of closet: Bush, under
attack by Republican left and right, is making what could be free trade's
last stand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator running against President
George Bush in New Hampshire for the Republican presidential nomination, has
brought to the fore a new truth in US politics: protectionism, even
isolationism, is no longer 'politically incorrect' among American
conservatives.
President Bush, under attack from left and right, is making what could be a
last stand for free trade. Thus, the warning of a US turn inward, issued in
Munich on Sunday by US vice-president Dan Quayle and his senatorial
colleagues, is no empty threat to push the European Community into
submission in the international trade talks.
The trade debate cuts across party lines. In New Hampshire, Democratic
presidential runner Senator Tom Harkin plays the economic nationalism tune
with unabashed enthusiasm. Senator Bob Kerrey stands in the middle with
promises to get tough against Japan, which is where President Bush, innately
a free trader, has been moving for the election season. Governor Bill
Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas are both
internationalists.
Among conservatives the rise of protectionism has been fuelled by the end of
the Cold War. Mr John Cregan, president of the Business and Industrial
Council, an advocacy group of 1,500 strongly nationalistic companies, argues
that free trade was only viable as long as it was in US interests. When the
US dominated the world market-place, it could afford to make concessions to
solidify alliances against a common communist foe.
Concerned about the erosion of US economic sovereignty, he and many other
conservatives see support for protectionism as a return to the natural
order. Lincoln, he says, was 'a proud protectionist'.
The struggle under way for the soul of the conservative movement was
illustrated by a recent debate at the Heritage Foundation, a centre of
conservatism, between Mr Cregan and Mr Jim Bovard, a committed libertarian
author who contends that those who say the US market is open are 'hypocrites
or dishonest or fools'.
'The fraudulent and failed nature of this (free trade) approach was sadly
illustrated in the president's pathetic trip to Tokyo,' said Mr Cregan.
'We once again enter trade negotiations armed with nothing stronger than the
gospel according to Adam Smith. We expect a nation that is growing by the
size of Canada's GNP every three years - a most generous investor in
Treasury bills and the world leader in ceramics, robotics and memory chips -
not to lash out once the 'free trade' missionaries have gone home.'
He said the 'liberal trade syndrome' failed to recognise that, having won
the titanic struggle between capitalism and socialism, America was in
another competition that pitted American-style entrepreneurial enterprise
with a mutant form of capitalism perfected by the Japanese and adopted by a
host of Asian countries.
'We have made the same mistake over and over of viewing Japan or Korea or
even Germany, with its structure of financial/industry combines, as more or
less like us.'
Mr Cregan said he supported a bold foreign trade policy for the post-Cold
War. It called for domestic policies that empowered the individual to be
free from excessive government interference at home, while ensuring that the
entrepreneur was freed from distortions of the market through economic
aggression from abroad.
Mr Bovard, on the other hand, argued that in some areas, America was one of
the most protectionist industrial countries in the world.
'Our agricultural import quotas permit each American citizen to consume the
equivalent of only one teaspoon of foreign ice cream per year, two foreign
peanuts per year, and one pound of imported cheese per year. We have import
restrictions on 500 different steel products, on autos from Japan, on
machine tools from Japan and Taiwan, on beef from Australia and Argentina,
on butter from Europe and on cotton from Egypt.'
He said that while the average American tariff was now about 5 per cent,
some tariffs were 'in the stratosphere'. Low-priced watches had an average
tariff of 151.2 per cent, tobacco stems 458.3 per cent and some low-priced
shoes 67 per cent.
'If this is free trade, then perhaps the federal income tax system is truly
voluntary.
'Nowadays, we have paranoid protectionists who sound as if they check under
their bed each night to see if there are any predatory foreigners. And
dumping is what they see all around them. Our dumping law is so sweeping
that the Commerce Department almost automatically convicts 95 per cent of
foreign companies accused of dumping.'
The great mistake many conservatives were making was to try to solve
America's economic problems with trade barriers, said Mr Bovard. Politicians
sounded mystified as to why the US was falling behind in some areas. The
federal, state and local governments soaked up about 45 per cent of the US
GNP; in Japan, government spending accounted for 28 per cent.
'Politicians first seize almost half the national wealth, and then blame
foreigners because American productivity in many industries is not keeping
up. Rather than erecting new trade barriers, the US should slash Dollars
300bn-Dollars 400bn from the federal deficit - and watch American
productivity skyrocket,' he said.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Caribbean finds itself in US trade deal slow lane: Islands
and central America see Mexico overtake them in Washington's priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO's free-trade negotiations with the US have sent a worried shiver down
Caribbean spines.
But the foreign ministers of central America and of the Caricom bloc of
English-speaking Caribbean states, meeting together for the first time at
the end of last month in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, quietly
sidelined a proposal by the host nation to look towards a Caribbean
free-trade zone. The idea was that, with a population of 50m and a total
gross national product of Dollars 50bn (Pounds 27.6bn), this would be a way
to reach 'critical mass' in economic activity and diplomatic clout.
Instead, they agreed to establish a Consultative Forum, inviting other
Caribbean basin nations. The forum will concentrate on the defence of their
privileged trading position with the US, enshrined since 1984 in the
Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), which promotes 'non-traditional' export
production through duty-free access to the US market.
The problem faced by the Caribbean basin is a simple one: the Enterprise for
the Americas Initiative - with the Mexican free-trade agreement as its
centrepiece - has overtaken the CBI as the US trade policy flagship in the
area.
The North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) is expected to give duty-free
entry to the US for all the products included in the CBI. According to Mr
Fafael Callejas, the Honduran president, this 'raises the spectre of the
Caribbean basin's relatively small, young and inexperienced industries being
steam-rollered by the relatively large, well-established and seasoned
Mexican industries'.
The Caribbean basin's response has been to attempt to hang on to the coat
tails of any Mexican agreement, requesting that the CBI be expanded to
incorporate the additional concessions ceded to Mexico.
But requests that this be included in any Nafta legislation have had short
shrift from Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, who will have
enough problems negotiating the Mexico agreement in Congress, without
sending up smoke signals to the effect that the whole of the Caribbean basin
would be covered by the legislation.
She has made it clear that, after Mexico, Chile is the next in line for a
free trade agreement, with the Caribbean basin nowhere in sight.
At the same time, while the low-cost central American banana giants are
avidly sizing up the prospects of a quota-free Europe next year, the small
Windward Isles economies - dependent on European banana quotas for up to 60
per cent of their export revenues and with no hope of competing to defend
the privileges enshrined in Lome IV against the Latin onslaught - are
unimpressed by a proposal for a 14 per cent tariff to replace the quota
system, even though the tariff revenue would be used to compensate the
losers of banana exports.
As a result, although the working papers of the Caribbean basin technical
advisory group (set up last year to outline a regional integration strategy)
identified the single European market as one of the key issues to be faced,
the official communique from San Pedro Sula was silent on the issue.
The isthmus and the islands have little complementarity in their economic
structures - as reflected in the almost complete absence of trade or direct
transport links between central America and the Caribbean at present.
Nor is there complete harmony on economic policy. While both regions are
attempting to revive integration processes that flagged in the eighties, the
new central American scheme is both more advanced and more liberal than the
Caricom equivalent. While external tariffs on the isthmus are to fall to a
range of 5 to 20 per cent, Caricom is having difficulty persuading all its
members to implement the new agreed maximum of 45 per cent.

FURTHER evidence of safety problems with silicone breast implants emerged
yesterday when Dow Corning, the biggest US manufacturer of the device,
released internal documents about the product dating back to 1971, writes
Karen Zagor in New York.
The company later said its board had elected Mr Keith McKennon as new
chairman and chief executive.
Among documents released yesterday was a 1971 memo with details of an
implant that ruptured four months after surgery, causing irritation.
Letters to Dow Corning from a number of doctors outlined recurring problems.
A memo from a sales representative in 1978 said he had experienced 'an
excessive number of ruptures' in his area.
Dow Corning released its documents to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
in an effort to get the agency to revoke its advice to doctors not to use
silicone breast implants until new information on safety was assessed.
The company said most implant problems, discussed in the internal documents,
were associated with earlier prototypes. It added the number of
post-operative ruptures was less than 0.5 per cent.

<TEXT>
EIGHT Algerian policemen were ambushed and killed yesterday, the first full
day of a state of emergency imposed by the military-backed rulers to crush
Moslem fundamentalist agitation for a resumption of the electoral process,
writes Francis Ghiles.
The killings were reported as the head of Algeria's five-man presidency, Mr
Mohammed Boudiaf, told the nation last night that he had imposed the
12-month emergency to fight fundamentalism as embodied in the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS). Speaking in a vernacular Arabic all his compatriots
would have understood well, he argued against any dialogue with the FIS.
'When I stretched out my hand, they sent only a threatening letter.'
His broadcast came at the end of a day that witnessed the killing of six
policemen in an ambush by fundamentalist gunmen in the Casbah, the ancient
heart of the capital. Two other policemen were stabbed to death yesterday by
the companions of a man they had arrested in Bordj Menaiel, 40km east of
Algiers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Philippines, after years of foreign debt-driven economic growth that had
anyway faltered last year, appears ready to shift dependence to its own
financial resources.
A package of revenue-enhancement measures passed by Congress last week, just
before it closed its final session under the administration of President
Corazon Aquino, puts the burden of funding the government's fiscal deficit
this year on a range of domestic sources.
While there was much criticism in the past of foreign borrowings, the level
of debt has risen since Mrs Aquino assumed the presidency in 1986. She
enjoyed high popularity among the country's principal economic partners, in
particular immediately after the 1986 uprising that ousted the authoritarian
regime of former president Ferdinand Marcos and swept her to power.
That support has waned because her government has failed to turn foreign
money into growth and fears of instability caused by several coup attempts.
The need to reduce reliance on foreign assistance became more pronounced
after the Senate's rejection last September of a new dollar-earning naval
base agreement with the US. In addition, early this month, Washington
proposed a much-reduced aid package for Manila for 1993.
The revenue-enhancement bills passed last week enabled the country's debt
negotiators to seek a resumption in the International Monetary Fund's
support programme for the Philippines economy. IMF support is vital for
Manila's relations with the international financial community.
The government expects sufficient revenues to fill a 1992 budget gap of
nearly 30bn pesos (Dollars 1.2bn) or 2.7 per cent of gross national product.
The government also should be able at last to lift by June 30 the 5 per cent
import levy which has pestered private business since January 1991.
The import levy was imposed after the failure of Congress to pass new tax
bills then proposed by the Aquino administration. Set at 9 per cent, the
levy has been singled out as the biggest disincentive to investments over
the past year.
The Philippines has a tax collection efficiency rate of only about 14 per
cent of GNP, Income earners are often loath to pay taxes because many
suspect their payments may end up lining the pockets of corrupt officials.
The government's collection agencies, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and
Bureau of Customs, are widely perceived as the most corrupt in the
bureaucracy even if guilt has not been established in courts.
The newly approved measures either raise rates on existing taxes or put some
teeth into existing mechanisms. One law creates special tax courts that are
designed to speed up tax cases. One reason taxpayers are emboldened to
violate tax laws is the excruciatingly long period it usually takes the
judicial system to settle such cases. The new courts will hear only tax
cases.
Another measure sets up a big-taxpayers unit that will 'closely monitor a
few hundred corporations which account for a very large percentage of the
BIR's revenue collections'. Big corporations are frequently accused of
paying off certain BIR personnel to reduce tax assessments.
Penalties on tax evasion are also to be raised under another law. Another
creates new posts in the internal-revenue and customs bureaux which will be
directly involved in enhancing collections. These staff will get salaries
much higher than those in the normal payroll to reduce corruption.
Not passed by the Senate, however, was a bill proposing refinements in the
value-added tax system. The refinements involve an expansion in the VAT's
scope to include the services sector and property leasing. It was the
feeling of many lawmakers, most of whom are seeking re-election in the May
elections, that the bill in effectcreates new taxes, and therefore was too
hot to handle.
Passed earlier by the two chambers of Congress and awaiting the president's
signature are separate measures raising forestry charges, a simplified net
income tax system that plugs the traditional loopholes 'through which tax
revenues from high-income professionals and business establishments are
drained away', and a withholding tax on purely compensation income.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, campaigned hard for these
measures. He said the outcome was not bad given that this was an election
year.
The year's budget represents a nominal increase of some 20 per cent in
current spending, or nearly 3 per cent in real terms. Mr Estanislao said the
budget did not provide for huge, election-related allocations, which had
characterised most budgets in past election years.
In that respect alone, the 1992 budget is already a rarity.

<TEXT>
INDIAN troops have mined the ceasefire line in Kashmir and the Pakistani
army yesterday blocked roads on its side of the disputed border in an
attempt to prevent Moslem militants crossing into Indian-held Kashmir, K K
Sharma reports from New Delhi and Reuter reports from Muzaffarabad,
Pakistan.
The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) said thousands of its unarmed
supporters would cross the United Nations-monitored ceasefire line from
Pakistan today to express solidarity with Kashmiris fighting to secede from
India.
Pakistani paramilitary troops have set off landslides, erected barricades
and dismantled bridges to try to stop the militants reaching the Indian
side. At least eight people were injured and 40 arrested yesterday in
scuffles with police who stopped caravans of buses. The JKLF leader, Mr
Amanullah Khan - whose group is unpopular in Pakistan because it also
advocates independence for the one-third of Kashmir ruled by Islamabad -
told a rally of 3,000 supporters that he would die rather than abandon the
march. Kashmir has been divided by the ceasefire line since the 1971
India-Pakistan war. Both countries claim the whole state over which they
have twice gone to war.
In India, the government placed border troops on high alert and warned that
marchers who violate the ceasefire line would be shot. Land mines were
planted on Saturday along a 280km strip of border land and Mr BS Bedi,
director-general of police, said a curfew was in force in three districts of
the Kashmir Valley.
Indian ministers have warned that any crossing would 'invite decisive
retaliation.' The Indian government appears unconvinced by Pakistan's pledge
to stop the crossing.

EC finance ministers last night cleared the way for almost unlimited
cross-border shopping for liquor and cigarettes from 1993.
Legal limits on the amount of duty-paid liquor and cigarettes EC travellers
can bring home with them will be raised far beyond current levels by an EC
directive approved yesterday, which sets up a definitive system for
administering and policing excise duty after 1992.
This is the latest piece of the post-1992 VAT and excise system to be put in
place, following last year's agreement on the broad indirect tax framework.
Under pressure from Germany, which would prefer the whole package to be
agreed simultaneously, EC ministers also promised to complete the other
elements before Portugal's EC presidency ends in June.
The outstanding issues include the definition of dutiable goods and the
knotty question of harmonised VAT and excise rates.
There is a consensus on rates, but Britain in particular is unwilling to
agree a formal text.
Under yesterday's agreement, border controls will disappear. But above
certain indicative limits - as many as 800 cigarettes, 110 litres of beer,
or 120 bottles of wine, for example - national authorities could stop
travellers anywhere in the Community and ask for proof that the goods had
been bought for personal consumption.
According to European Commission officials, buying more than the indicated
limit of 90 bottles of champagne for, say, a wedding would be acceptable,
but driving them home to sell to friends would not.
In practice, however, only the UK, Denmark and Ireland have said they will
use an indicative limit at all. Other EC members seem set to allow unlimited
cross-border shopping.

US Secretary of State James Baker today embarks on an extensive tour of the
politically sensitive southern republics of the former Soviet Union. The
tour will include Moslem republics which Washington fears could fall under
the sway of militant Islamic forces.
Mr Baker will visit six newly independent states and the formerly closed
Russian city of Chelyabinsk. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova have been added
to an itinerary that previously included only Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and
Tajikistan.
In Chelyabinsk, a centre of the secretive Soviet atomic weapons complex, Mr

FT  11 FEB 92 / Airlift to Russia under way in earnest: Food and medical aid
supplies reach new areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WESTERN airlift of food and medical aid to the former Soviet Union
reached a new tempo yesterday with aircraft landing in locations which have
so far received little or no direct foreign help.
'Operation Provide Hope', aimed at airlifting about 18,000 tonnes of
supplies, has been discounted by some western politicians and officials as
merely symbolic.
It was announced by President George Bush two weeks ago during a Washington
conference on aid, and provoked other countries - with some reluctance - to
join an operation which many believe to be irrelevant to the real needs of a
country which is not starving, but urgently requires help for its economic
transformation.
Speaking at a brief opening ceremony at the Rhein-Main air base near
Frankfurt, Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, stressed the airlift was
not charity but 'investment in security - the west's security and global
security and stability for decades to come'.
Mr Baker also said that money to support the rouble and to provide
substantial imports would not be forthcoming until credible economic
policies were in place.
Mr Baker's comments suggest that the US - supported at least by Japan - does
not believe that such policies are secured, in spite of the efforts of the
Russian government's economic team, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime
minister.
That team began negotiations yesterday with officials from the International
Monetary Fund to thrash out an application for Russian membership.
Acceptance of the application would go far to persuade foreign countries to
lend money to support economic reform - funds which, according to Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, last week should be no less than Dollars
17bn (Pounds 9.3bn).
Yesterday's aid shipments included US supplies left over from the Gulf war.
In addition Japan delivered 12 tonnes of food and medicine to Khabarovsk in
the Far East, while the Germans - the big aid donors over the past two years
 -flew in another 100 tonnes of supplies to Moscow. Britain shrewdly
directed its aid to Ekaterinburg,the birthplace of Mr Yeltsin.
At the weekend five German trucks carrying food aid for schoolchildren were
held up from Friday to Sunday in Chelyabinsk, in western Russia.
EC finance ministers decided yesterday to redirect the problem-fraught
Ecu500m (Pounds 356.5m) credit from the Deutsche Bank consortium, which the
Community is guaranteeing, to Russia, and to compensate other ex-Soviet
republics by lending them more out of a bigger, Ecu1.25bn EC food credit,
David Buchan reports from Brussels. EC ministers also agreed to back
membership of the IMF for all ex-Soviet republics.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Turkey discovers a new role in former Soviet central Asia:
Leaders of 50m Turkic-speaking peoples look to Ankara as a political and
religious model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, STEVE LE VINE and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE receptionist in Azerbaijan's largest hotel shrugged her shoulders and
said slowly in Russian: 'I'm sorry. I don't know English or good Russian. Do
you speak Turkish?'
It is a question which is assuming increasing importance, not just in
Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan, but right across the southern rim of the former
Soviet Union.
For after decades of being stereotyped as the poor relation of Europe and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Turkey is now discovering a new
geo-political role for itself. The Soviet break-up is offering it the
opportunity to build, with US encouragement, a new domain of political
influence not just in the neighbouring ex-soviet Caucasus, but also among
the 50m Turkic-speaking Moslems in ex-soviet central Asia, where Iran is a
powerful competitor.
One illustration of this came earlier this week in Istanbul. After months of
diplomatic jockeying, Turkey succeeded in persuading nine of the so-called
Black Sea nations to sit down at the first ever Black Sea regional
conference. Eight of the participants - Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia,
Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria and Romania - initialled an accord to create a
new Black Sea regional economic plan in which Turkey seems set to play a
central geographical and political role.
However, it is to the east, in vast central Asia, that some believe the
richest diplomatic pickings for Turkey lie.
Turkey's role in central Asia has long been an emotive issue. In spite of
being separated from the region by the Caspian Sea, Turkey shares close ties
with the region - all the central Asian republics apart from Tajikistan
speak Turkic dialects. The school curriculum in Turkey, moreover, teaches
that all Turks came from the plains of central Asia.
Although central Asia was never part of the Ottoman empire, earlier this
century pan-Turkic sentiments led some central Asians to call for the
creation of a common Turkic union. These dreams were squashed during the
Soviet period, but they are re-emerging.
In Turkey, pan-Turkism, once a secret and conspiratorial movement, has
acquired a respectability. The Turkish government itself has strenuously
denied any charges of pan-Turkic aspirations. But some political voices have
been heard expressing pan-Turkic sentiments.
Central Asia's leaders are overwhelmingly ex-communist. Although they have
cautiously embraced the cultural aspects of the Islamic revival that has
swept through the region in recent years - and are adamant that they do not
want blindly to ape Russia or the west - they are also determined that they
do not want to copy Iran or Saudi Arabia's model of Islamic orthodoxy. They
hope that by aspiring to Turkey's mix of moderate Islam and western
economics - the 'Turkish way' as Mr Islam Karimov, the Uzbek president,
calls it - they will stave off the threat of radical Islam.
In recent weeks the Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Kazakh presidents have all been
effusive in their praise for Turkey. Leaders of the region's fledgling
opposition democratic parties, such as Mr Muhhamad Salikh, leader of the
Uzbek Party 'Erk', repeatedly cite Turkey as their model for democracy. And
even the highly-influential Persian-speaking Tajik Moslem leader, Qazi Akbar
Turanjonzoda, commented recently that 'Turkey is the best religious and
political example for us'.
Turkey claims to be the first country to have embassies in all the central
Asian republics, and was first to extend recognition to Azerbaijan's
declaration of independence. The Turkish government has offered courses for
Turkic republics' bankers and drafted legislation to despatch its own
moderate Islamic teachers to the region.
But these diplomatic moves seem relatively limited when compared with the
enthusiastic overtures being made by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and above all
Iran - countries scrambling to gain a foothold in this vast new Moslem
market, with its array of raw materials such as cotton, uranium, silk,
natural gas and oil, not to mention nuclear weapons.
Saudi Arabia has already donated considerable religious aid to the region,
including over a million Korans. Pakistan has said it would be prepared to
support the central Asian republics in applying for membership of
international organisations. Iran is rapidly building both religious and
political ties with the region, in particular with neighbouring Turkmenistan
and Persian-speaking Tajikistan - backed up by offers of oil and economic
aid.
Similarly, although Turkish entrepreneurs are now the most visible foreign
businessmen in Azerbaijan, they appear outnumbered in central Asia by
Pakistanis, Afghans, Iranians, and South Koreans.
One reason for Turkey's apparent caution may be a cold-headed appraisal that
its best future business prospect is Russia, not central Asia. Russia is the
supplier of the natural gas underpinning Turkish-Soviet trade, which was
worth more than Dollars 1.7bn in 1990.
Another reason could be that Turkey is still cautious about being sucked in
too deeply into a region which faces enormous problems as it moves towards a
market economy.

SERB leaders in Croatia have called a referendum to settle a dispute over
whether to allow United Nations peacekeeping forces to be deployed on their
territory, Reuter reports from Zagreb.
The parliament of Krajina, a Serb-controlled enclave in Croatia, said the
ballot would be held on February 22 and 23.
The move marks a new act of defiance by Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president,
who does not want UN forces to replace the Yugoslav federal army on his
territory and opposes disarming Serb irregulars, as called for under the UN
plan.
'I think the referendum is the best way to see what the people want and test
public opinion towards me as president,' he said yesterday during a
parliamentary session in the enclave's capital, Knin.
But about half the parliamentary deputies stayed away from the session,
indicating divisions.

MR Karol Lutkowski, Poland's finance minister, will be under pressure today
from spending ministries in the new centre-right government led by Mr Jan
Olszewski.
Mr Lutkowski is an advocate of stringent monetary policies in a government
largely formed by critics of the International Monetary Fund-backed
stabilisation policies run by his predecessor, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz.
Last year's Paris Club agreement linked a reduction of over 50 per cent in
Poland's Dollars 33bn (Pounds 18bn) official debt to compliance with IMF
performance criteria.
Last week, Mr Michael Deppler, deputy IMF head in Europe, reminded the
government that it needed an agreement with the Fund if it is to restructure
its overall Dollars 46.5bn external debt - one third owed to western banks.
With this in mind, Mr Lutkowski said he wanted to contain the budget deficit
at around Zl 60,000bn (Pounds 2.92bn) or 4.5 per cent of GDP.

   MOSCOW.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATIONS into the finances of the now-banned Soviet Communist party
have revealed details of its financing of foreign communist organisations
and its holdings in Russia.
Mr Yevgeny Lisov, Russian deputy prosecutor general, told the Russian
Parliament yesterday at least Dollars 200m (Pounds 109m) had been paid to
foreign communist and other organisations - including 'freedom fighters' -
since the 1950s. At the same time, inventories made since the failed putsch
last August showed party property worth at least Rbs2.5bn (Pounds 12.57m at
the current rate of Rbs110 to the Dollars ), with investments in 'commercial
structures' of a further Rbs7.5bn.
Top of the Communist party's beneficiaries were the French, who got Dollars
24m, followed by the (tiny) US party, receiving Dollars 21.25m, the Finnish
with Dollars 16.6m, the Portuguese Dollars 9.5m, Israeli Dollars 6.5m and
Chilean Dollars 6m. These destinations and figures were listed yesterday by
the evening newspaper Izvestia which quoted Mr Sergei Aristov, a senior
prosecutor investigating party finances.
He said that a number of mainly west European Communist parties had received
substantial sums over the past decade. The Izvestia report says the party
possessed 4,228 administrative buildings, 112 party archives, 145 motor
pools, 23 sanatoria and rest homes and 206 'other installations,' which
included special stores and departments with goods for party officials.
The report coincided with attempts by the parliament to question leaders of
the former Soviet Communist party - including Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, former
general secretary.
No moves have yet been made against party leaders not directly involved in
the failed putsch of last August. However, this hiatus could now be ending,
as anti-communism becomes attractive to the current authorities as a way of
redirecting social tension.
Mr Lisov told parliament that Mr Gorbachev had authorised the party to
invest in small business ventures, quoting from a document to that effect
signed by the former general secretary. 'We would like to know whether these
investments were made to save the CPSU in case it was forced to work
underground,' Mr Lisov asked.
Senior communists, including Mr Gorbachev, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the
former foreign minister, and Mr Alexander Yakovlev, a close aide, are
expected to be questioned.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Channel tunnel delayed until autumn next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANNEL tunnel, which has been beset by bitter rows over sharply rising
costs and delays, is expected to open in the autumn next year, several
months later than planned.
Eurotunnel, the operator, yesterday blamed contractors for the delay. The
opening, planned for June 15 1993, will now miss the peak season summer
traffic.
The company said it would not be able to provide a full service to meet peak
summer-time passenger demand until mid 1994. It is the first time it has
admitted that the project will not open on schedule.
Eurotunnel said it would offer a restricted service from September or
October next year provided 'contractors meet programmes for installation and
commissioning currently under discussion'.
The announcement prompt-ed an angry retort from Transmanche Link (TML), a
consortium of five British and five French contractors building the project,
which said: 'Any implication that the delayed opening of the tunnel is
attributable to construction difficulties on the part of TML is wholly
untrue.'
Eurotunnel's share price fell 22p after the announcement but had recovered
to 454p by the close, a fall of 11p.
TML is claiming extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn at 1985 prices to
cover the cost of the private-sector project which since 1987 has risen from
Pounds 4.7bn to more than Pounds 8bn - allowing for the impact of inflation
and interest charges.
Negotiations between TML and Eurotunnel to resolve differences over the cost
and timing of the project have been taking place since October but have
still to be resolved.
Eurotunnel said yesterday that substantial progress had been made by
contractors during the past four months on installing signalling, track,
cooling systems and other fixed equipment into the twin rail tunnels.
Installation delays according to contractors have been reduced to about 10
weeks compared with three to six month delays quoted by Eurotunnel last
autumn.
The main problem appears to be delays in providing a fleet of railway wagons
and locomotives affecting shuttle services and through trains.
Eurotunnel was told last week that BR and SNCF, the British and French
state-owned railways, would be unable to provide a full rail service until
summer 1994. Changes in the design of Eurotunnel's shuttle wagons means it
will have insufficient rolling stock to meet peak demand when the tunnel
opens.
Eurotunnel last autumn cut by Pounds 147m its revenue forecast for the years
1993 to 1996 to take account of reduced services in the first months of
operation. Last night it said it was looking at the figures to see if a
further revenue reduction would be appropriate. It insisted it had
sufficient funds to complete construction of the project by next year.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Pay rises above inflation for 1.5m public employees: Review
body average of 6.5% accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, PETER NORMAN and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT decided yesterday to grant pay increases to 1.5m public
employees at well above the rate of inflation.
This means that pay rises in the public sector are running between 34 and
107 per cent higher than the latest average of increases in manufacturing
industry.
The government accepted in full review-body recommend-ations for raising the
pay of the armed forces, nurses, doctors, professions allied to medicine and
teachers by between 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent.
The increases will average nearly 6.5 per cent, and take effect from April
1, ahead of the widely expected general election date of April 9.
At the same time, the Confederation of British Industry reported that pay
settlements in manufacturing industry fell to their lowest level since it
began collecting such data in 1980.
Latest figures from the CBI pay data bank showed that settlements in
manufacturing averaged only 4.1 per cent in the final quarter of last year,
down on the 5.1 per cent recorded in last year's third quarter and under
half the 9 per cent average rises recorded in the final quarter of 1990.
Yesterday's rises cover around 30 per cent of public sector employees and
are the first to be awarded in full since 1989. They will cost the taxpayer
about Pounds 1.84bn and are expected in the course of the year to lift the
average weekly pay packet of public sector employees above that of private
sector employees.
The government's decision to award pay rises at well above the present 4.5
per cent rate of inflation drew strong criticism from some opposition
politicians. It was denounced as a 'cynical volte-face' by Mr Alex Carlile,
the Liberal Democrat party's economics spokesman, while Mr Jack Straw,
Labour's education spokesman, pointed out that the last time teachers
received a significant real pay increase 'was just before the 1987
election'.
The government responded by saying these were the lowest awards for many
years and covered groups which had not done well in the past. There was no
significant move in the direction of performance related pay for any of the
groups. But performance pay, favoured by the government, will be a feature
of next year's awards.
Among the various professions, general dental practitioners emerged with the
highest pay increases: they received 8.5 per cent to reflect recruitment
difficulties in the profession and an increased workload.
But with a 7.5 per cent across-the-board increase in all scales from April,
420,000 teachers in England and Wales did better than any other public
sector group in the pay review awards. Their increase is on top of the 9.5
per cent awarded to teachers last year.
The total value of the teachers' award is 7.8 per cent, taking the average
classroom teacher's salary - including allowances - to Pounds 18,200. Mr
Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, said the award was 'greater than the
government had contemplated'. He defend-ed the decision to give teachers
review-body status as 'an essential step in restoring the status of the
teaching profession'.
The armed forces will receive an average increase of 6 per cent; doctors 5.5
per cent while nurses will get rises of between 5.6 per cent and 6 per cent
based on grading. The spread for the professions allied to medicine is 6.2
per cent to 6.5 per cent.
The Top Salaries Review Body was not included in the announcement. The
government agreed to the request from the review body to delay its report
until mid-year, so it would not be affected by electoral considerations. It
is expected to recommend large catch-up rises for top civil servants, judges
and generals.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Clowes awaits sentence for theft and fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, NEIL BUCKLEY and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Clowes, the man behind the most spectacular UK investment scandal
of the 1980s, was yesterday found guilty on 18 counts of theft and fraud, 3
1/2 years after the Pounds 150m collapse of his investment company, Barlow
Clowes.
He was led from court in handcuffs and detained at Brixton prison overnight,
before being sentenced this morning at the Old Bailey.
A business associate of Mr Clowes, Mr Peter Naylor, was found guilty on one
count of theft, but cleared of other theft and conspiracy to defraud
charges.
Two other associates - Mr Guy Cramer and Mr Christopher Newman - were both
acquitted of all charges against them in a day of mixed success for the
Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution.
More than Pounds 113m had been 'milked' from the funds of mainly elderly
clients, who had been led to believe they were investing in secure
gilt-edged stock, the jury was told during the seven month trial.
Much of the money was spent by Mr Clowes on buying up other companies and a
luxurious lifestyle which included the purchase of a yacht, an executive jet
and a French chateau. The collapse of Barlow Clowes has cost the British
taxpayer Pounds 150m, paid out in compensation by the government after an
unprecedented campaign by investors.
In an interview ahead of the verdicts, Mr Clowes insisted that he had acted
within the investment guidelines of his company. Speaking at the end of last
week, he reserved his harshest criticism for Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, the Barlow
Clowes auditor which has since merged with Touche Ross.
He said the auditors must have known what Barlow Clowes was doing with
investors' money, and have sanctioned it. If the auditors thought the
company only invested in gilts (UK government bonds) they should have
questioned the lack of gilt certificates in the company, he said. 'Did they
just think Pounds 100m was sitting in a bank?'
Mr Clowes sat stony-faced as the verdicts were returned, but his wife Pamela
shook her head in disbelief and his daughter ran from the courtroom in
tears.
Much of the evidence heard over 108 days was highly complex and related to
the details of the money laundering operations set up by Mr Clowes. Thanking
the jury, Mr Justice Phillips said: 'Until recent times, no one could have
imagined that our legal system could place such a burden on anyone's time.'
At a press conference after the verdicts were delivered, Mr Cramer
criticised the prosecution brought against him by the SFO. He said no
evidence had been produced to show that he knew of any fraud within Barlow
Clowes and he had been tried on a 'guilt by association' basis.
Outside the court, Mr Newman said he was 'delighted that the ordeal of the
last three years is now over'.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Abu Dhabi may pay Dollars 2.2bn to BCCI creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS IN the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are
likely to receive Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 930m) - and possibly up to Dollars
2.2bn - from Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder, under a negotiated
settlement.
This contrasts with the figure of Dollars 4bn which the emirate said it was
prepared to pump into BCCI in April 1991, three months before the bank was
closed by the Bank of England.
On the basis of the bank's current estimated liabilities of about Dollars
10bn, the Abu Dhabi payment would be Dollars 1.7bn. If further liabilities
emerged, the emirate would contribute a further 25 cents in the dollar up to
a limit on its total involvement of Dollars 2.2bn.
Taken together with the remaining Dollars 1.1bn of assets in both of BCCI's
banking arms, BCCI SA in Luxembourg and BCCI (Overseas) in Grand Cayman,
this would give creditors between Dollars 2.8bn and Dollars 3.3bn, from
which they would receive compensation in instalments phased through to 1994.
The full terms of the settlement negotiated between Touche Ross, the BCCI
liquidators, and Abu Dhabi emerged yesterday. The agreement will be
initialled by both parties, probably at the end of this week.
It will then go to the courts in Luxembourg and Grand Cayman, and the High
Court in London for final approval. This is expected to take a further eight
to 10 weeks to achieve.
The approval period will include consultations with creditors, many of whom
are expected to criticise Abu Dhabi's contribution as insufficient.
Once court approval is granted, the first payment out of the liquidation
would be Dollars 300m, to be shared pro rata among creditors. The agreement
with the emirate is conditional, however on its being accepted by 70 per
cent of the creditors, representing about Dollars 7bn of currently known
liabilities. A September 30 deadline has been set for acceptance of the
deal, but the period may be extended to November 30.
The liquidators settled for the formula deal with Abu Dhabi in preference to
risking a lengthy legal battle.
In return for the payment, Abu Dhabi would receive a release of claims and
promises not to sue. Any creditors unwilling to accept would have no access
to the Abu Dhabi contribution.
Included in the arrangement is an unusual provision that treats the Abu
Dhabi liquidation separately. The deal includes an arrangement allowing Abu
Dhabi to pursue claims against third parties.
The proportion of assets to liabilities in the Abu Dhabi BCCI branches is
said to be the same as in the rest of the bank.

FT  11 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Brighter views on BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE
THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT weakness in BP shares, triggered mainly by worries about low
crude oil prices, a board room split, uncovered dividend and fears that any
prolonged period of weakness by oil prices could trigger a shrinking of the
company, was reversed yesterday after reassuring comments in the weekend
financial press.
Stories, suggesting that BP would at least maintain its quarterly dividend
and probably increase the payment to match inflation when the results are
published on Thursday, helped BP recover 10 to 285p on turnover of 6.8m
BP was also helped by firmer crude oil prices ahead of tomorrow's Opec
meeting in Geneva. Brokers were divided as to the outcome of the Opec
meeting and the outlook for the sector. Mr Chris Perry at Gilbert Eliott
said he viewed the downside in oils as 'limited' with the sector relative
close to a five-year low. He is looking for the sector to outperform the
market 'by at least 10 per cent' this year.
Smith New Court's Mr Steve Turner commented: 'A successful Opec meeting and
action by Opec to cut output would send oil prices back above Dollars 20 in
the second quarter; this can only be regarded as a positive for the oil
sector.'
County NatWest, on the other hand, remained pessimistic on oil and oil
shares. Mr Fergus MacLeod said: 'We stand by a 1992 forecast of Dollars 18 a
barrel, with further weakness possible in the short term; this will keep the
oil sector dull.'
Mountleigh deal
A successful share placing in property group Mountleigh saw the stock rise 2
1/2 to 9 1/2 p, as the market speculated on the likely buyers.
One dealer said there was intense US interest spilling over from late on
Friday, when a block of 27m shares came on to the London market. Some
believed the stake was placed following the bankruptcy last week of Danish
investment group Accumulator, which helped to underwrite Mountleigh's
unsuccessful Pounds 96m rights issue in July. Yesterday's deal appeared to
be an agency cross at 7p.
Mountleigh already has large US shareholders - financiers Peltz &amp; May and
the Getty Trust together hold 29 per cent - and has attracted stakebuilding
hints on previous occasions.
Yesterday's move is the latest in a burst of activity in the group's shares.
Last week, chairman Mr Ian MacGregor took his stake to 3.5m shares after
purchasing 2m for around 7p, while fellow director Mr David Watkins bought
100,000 at the same price.
Eurotunnel down
It was a volatile session for Eurotunnel, which fell 27p initially after
announcing that it would not meet its June 1993 target for the opening of
the Channel tunnel. Analysts had, however, suspected that Eurotunnel would
have to make such an announcement, and the stock quickly rallied to close 11
down on balance at 454p on moderate turnover of 778,000 shares.
Mr Richard Hannah, at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, calculated that Eurotunnel would
lose about Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m for each summer month it delays opening
the tunnel. He added: 'I think there is a distinct possibility for further
equity financing, given the over-runs to date.'
Reuters was weak in early trading as investors took profits before the
results due tomorrow. However, the stock bounced in the afternoon to close a
net 5 up at 1095p.
Glaxo rose 12 to 828p as one US house was said to be a strong buyer, arguing
that it was heavily undervalued.
Nervousness ahead of its first-quarter profits failed to hold Hanson down
and the shares gained 4 at 203p with a hefty 7.1m traded. Analysts believe
the profits, to be reported on Thursday, will be below those of the same
period last year.
Weekend press reports that Fisons' best-selling asthma drug Intal was under
threat prompted the shares to fall 11 in early dealing. However, analysts
felt that the threat was overstated and the shares recovered to close
unchanged on the day at 377p.
A Hoare Govett review of the implications for the utilities of various
political scenarios resulted in the broker recommending a switch out of
electricity distribution companies into the water sector.
Overall, Hoare said water shares were undervalued and electricity stocks
fully valued. It particularly recommended Severn Trent, which closed 8
higher at 339p, and Welsh, 11 ahead at 383p.
Allied-Lyons was firm in a generally depressed brewing sector. The shares
put on 3 to 622p, shrugging off confusion about a proposed pub leasing deal
with Brent Walker, and gaining support from the sale of the food division's
home baking mixes and chocolate business.
Bass lost another 9 to 511p, weighed down by the implications of US
litigation over the purchase of the Holiday Inn hotel chain by the UK
brewer.
Cider producer HP Bulmer recovered an early loss to finish unchanged at
254p, in spite of concern that a successful bid for Perrier by Nestle might
mean Bulmer losing the Perrier distribution rights in the UK.
Among food manufacturers, Unigate rose 5 to 280p following the sale of its
loss-making JP Wood chicken business to Hillsdown Holdings for Pounds 36.7m.
Hillsdown, which through its Buxted Poultry subsidiary will lift its share
of the UK poultry market from 14 to 20 per cent, was unaltered at 162p.
William Low weakened 13 to 261p, reacting to Friday's late news that Mr
Colin Mitchell, managing director of supermarkets, is leaving at the end of
the month.
Stores group Burton lost 2 to 37 1/2 p on sell recommendations by Nomura and
Credit Lyonnais Laing. Nomura warned that, on all but the most optimistic
consumer spending forecasts, the shares are likely to drift lower and the
need to conserve cash may result in another cut in the dividend.
Holiday group Airtours surged on old talk of strong holiday bookings. There
was also the likelihood of some lift from US investors, who were reported to
be impressed by a Hoare Govett presentation in New York on the group. The
shares climbed 14 to 250p.
Royal Bank of Scotland was the most heavily traded bank stock as its shares
gyrated between 170p and 164p before settling unchanged at 167p. The bank
confirmed that it was considering the sale of part or all of Charterhouse,
its merchant bank arm.
Other banks recorded minor improvements ahead of the preliminary results
season, which starts on February 21 with figures from Lloyds, 4 firmer at
397p.
Discount houses strengthened on suggestions of an early cut in UK interest
rates. Union Discount, badly mauled in recent weeks, improved 8 to 142p,
while Cater Allen rose 10 to 324p.
Royal Insurance declined 11 to 232p and Sun Alliance 6 more to 280p as
analysts caught up with Goldman Sachs-inspired profits downgrades carried
out last week and continued to fret about a dividend cut at the former.
Sturge Holdings relinquished 6 to 209p before today's annual meeting.
Industrial gases and healthcare company BOC finished 2 easier at 645p ahead
of first-quarter profits - expected to be between Pounds 73m and Pounds 80m
 -due on Thursday. Kleinwort Benson was said to have reduced its forecast by
around Pounds 6m to Pounds 79m yesterday.
British Vita was held down to 261p after Hoare Govett changed its
recommendation from 'buy' to 'hold', arguing that the shares were
over-valued.
Buying in front of today's third-quarter figures lifted British Airways 4 to
225p as 5.5m shares changed hands. The range of analysts' forecasts is
between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m.
USM stock Ross Group was quoted at 46p, against 9 1/2 p at Friday's close,
following a one-for-five share consolidation yesterday.
Stock overhanging the market in USM-quoted Nu-Swift was said to be behind a
drop of 26 to 418p.

Paddy Linaker, the blunt-spoken managing director of M&amp;G Group, is to take
over as chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers Association in May. He
succeeds Charles Nunnelly of Robert Fleming Asset Management, who served as
IFMA's first chairman.
Linaker is a suitable choice for a trade organisation which has on occasion
taken a more aggressive stance on shareholder issues than its Bank of
England-backed counterpart, the Institutional Shareholders' Committee. Among
other things, IFMA has urged shareholders to vote against the award of stock
options offered to company directors at a discount, and has spoken out on
terms of directors' contracts.
Linaker is said privately to hold the view that shareholder activism is too
infrequently translated into action - a view on which he will have ample
scope to pronounce in his new role.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures advanced strongly on speculation over a cut in interest
rates in both the UK and the US, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract opened at 2,530 on the expectation that Friday's fall on
Wall Street was overdone. With only a brief reversal to 2,528 at around 9am,
buying of March continued and moved up a gear as the view of a possible cut
in interest rates spread from the money markets and into FT-SE futures.
The strong opening on Wall Street only served to increase interest, with
buying of the contract by US clients a notable feature. One trader
commented: 'It was a one-way market, all the way up from the opening.' That
was not strictly true; profit-taking before the markets closed caused March
to relinquish earlier gains. March closed at 2,560, around 11 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10.
In the LTOM, turnover was a poor 21,513 lots. Hanson was the busiest stock
option with 1,927 lots traded. The May 220 calls were the busiest series.
Thames Water traded 1,100 lots, with one house reported to have sold a
straddle, trading the May 360 calls and puts at the same exercise price and
expiry date.

JOHANNESBURG eased on fears that the recent weakness in the financial rand
had boosted share prices unrealistically. The currency's volatility also
harmed sentiment. The JSE index fell 14 to 3,660, while the all-gold index

FT  11 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Pacific Rim celebrates Chinese new year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Major equity market blocs produced a muted performance last week, with the
FT-Actuaries Indices for Japan and Europe both down 0.6 per cent, the US up
by the same amount and the World Index, in local currency terms, 0.1 per
cent lower over the five days.
Tokyo started the week well, rising for the third consecutive day after
efforts by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Ministry of Finance
to reassure investors that they were concerned about the current slump.
Among their proposals were a rise in dividends and a reduction in securities
trading tax.
However, it weakened from Tuesday, when a fall in futures prices led to
selling of the cash market. By the end of the week, criticism had mounted of
futures trading and the effect of arbitrageurs on the underlying equities,
and institutions were only placing buy orders at below existing market
levels.
The US rose on balance. Last Friday it went into the weekend depressed after
an unexpected decline in employment in January, and no change in monetary
policy by the Federal Reserve.
Europe would have shown a rise of 0.3 per cent excluding a 1.9 per cent drop
in the UK, where uncertainty over Wall Street and the political future at
home kept big institutions on the sidelines.
The Pacific Rim had an unexpectedly active week, or what was left of it
after the Chinese New Year holidays. Hoare Govett notes that Hong Kong had
only one-and-a-half trading days last week due to the holiday break, but
that bullish sentiment continued. The broker detected increased
participation by retail investors and that - in tandem with the Japanese
derivatives theme - the more liquid blue chip warrants were heavily chased
by local investors.
Malaysia was the best performer of the week, although it opened only on
Thursday and Friday. Over the two days, traders noted bargain hunting,
index-linked buying and Malaysian corporate buyers.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates soften
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES eased in the money markets yesterday as traders got excited about
possible a cut in UK rates this week. However, most economists said
sterling's position within the exchange rate mechanism precluded a cut being
announced with Friday's retail price index, as rumoured.
'Sterling is still the weakest and, bearing in mind the Bundesbank is
unlikely to cut rates,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist with
Yamaichi International, 'that closes the window of opportunity for a UK rate
cut.' Mr McKinnon suggested that, as a result, Chancellor Norman Lamont
might offer more generous terms in his budget.
Short-term money was fairly cheap, with everything up to one year at 10 1/2
per cent or below. The key three-month interbank rate was the highest at 10
9/16 - 7/16 per cent. The March short sterling contract jumped early in the
day to 89.77, from Friday's close of 89.66, and remained there. This
suggested the market was expecting an interest rate of 10.23 per cent.
Economists have not discounted an interest rate cut before the summer.
The main impetus to the current rate cut rumour appeared to be the Bank of
England's early action in taking out its forecast Pounds 1.45bn shortage.
All but Pounds 142m was eliminated with cheaper band three and four bills -
at interest rates of between 10 3/32 and 10 1/16 per cent - and a Pounds
1.215bn resale agreement at 10 7/16 per cent which falls due on March 2. A
Bank official warned against reading too much into the small amount done at
the cheaper rate, or the early action.
The bulk of the shortage was due to treasury bills and maturing assistance.
Overnight rates bounced around, falling to 9 per cent, then rising to 12 and
ending the day at a more normal 10 7/16 - 5/16 per cent.
German call rates were slightly firmer yesterday, at 9.55/65 per cent,
compared with Friday's 9.55/60 per cent. The market expected the Bundesbank
to keep liquidity tight in this week's round of securities repurchase
agreements. A DM30.6bn repo falls due on Wednesday.
In the US, the Federal Reserve gave a clear signal that it would not ease
rates during the day, with a drain on reserves at 3 7/8 per cent. However, a
cut some time soon is not being discounted by economists, who point out that
there are no inflationary constraints.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low Cuban sugar crop forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUBA'S SUGAR crop is at best likely to be 6.5m tonnes in 1991-92, about 1.1m
tonnes less than in 1990-91, according to a group of sugar experts who
gathered together in the Dominican republic under the auspices of the
(moderate) Cuban exile group, Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais.
The experts - who included a senior official from the US Department of
Agriculture, analysts from FO Licht, the German sugar statistics agency,
Scudder Group, Czarnikow, the London trade house, and assorted academics -
believed that Cuba failed to harvest any sugar in the last two months of
1991. This would reduce the seasonal (November-June) harvest by between
300,000 and 1m tonnes.
In January harvesting appears to have been very slow. Even if the weather
holds up, the experts agreed that Cuba would be lucky to produce 6.5m tonnes
this year, given the shortages of spare parts, poor maintenance of
equipment, and problems in the field. The onset of rain would push the
forecast even lower, said Mr Gerry Hagelberg, of FO Licht.
In November the USDA estimated that Cuba's production would reach 7.3m
tonnes. Mr Peter Buzzanell, the official responsible for estimates,
suggested that the department would formally revise its estimate downwards
as early as this week.
The drop of production, if it materialises, will hit Cuba's battered economy
hard - for the first time it is having to sell sugar (usually 75 per cent of
exports) at world, rather than preferential prices. But it will come as
welcome news to the world sugar market, which has been bracing itself for a
flood of sugar after the collapse of Cuba's barter trade with the
former-Soviet Union.
In the nine months to last September, Cuba exported 6.15m tonnes of sugar,
of which 3.7m tonnes went to the Soviet Union, 740,000 tonnes to China,
about 500,000 tonnes to Japan and Canada and the remainder to assorted
countries. In the full year Cuba promised to send the Soviet Union 4m tonnes
of sugar in return for 10m tonnes of oil and other products. (An exchange
that valued Cuban sugar at about 24 cents a lb, compared with a world price
of 8 cents a lb).
This year, however, Cuba has had to renegotiate with ex-Soviet Union states.
So far Russia has agreed to buy (with oil) 500,000 tonnes of Cuban sugar,
with an option to buy another 500,000 tonnes; Kazakhstan will take another
200,000 tonnes, with an option for 200,000 tonnes; and Latvia 50,000 tonnes.
Cuba will thus have to find a home for about 1.5m tonnes of sugar that in
the past went to the Soviet Union, assuming production at the lower 6.5m
tonnes (and exports at around 5.4m tonnes), and the options fully taken up.
Some of this excess sugar will go to other ex-Soviet states that have yet to
sign trade agreements with Cuba, and, says Mr Hagelberg, perhaps as much as
400,000 tonnes to Iran and South Korea.
Nevertheless the world markets could still be expected to absorb about 1m
tonnes of extra Cuban sugar this year - unless Cuba's crop deteriorates
still further.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ferrochrome producers try to
repair damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN ferrochrome producers, who between them account for about 45
per cent of world production, have announced plans to slash output to little
more than 10 per cent of capacity in response to continuing weakness in
demand from the stainless steel industry, which consumes 80 per cent of
ferrochrome production.
Although the industry's predicament is in large measure a function of
sluggish growth in the world economy, there is also an element of
self-inflicted damage. The 6 per cent rise in the ferrochrome price to 52
cents a lb that South African producers insisted upon last December has met
with fierce resistance from customers who have turned to alternative sources
of supply for their metal.
Samancor of South Africa, the world's largest producer, with capacity of
about 1m tonnes per annum, announced on Friday that it would be ceasing
ferrochrome production as of February 20 for at least three months.
Consolidated Metallurgical Industries, the second largest producer, said
last week that it was operating at only 60 per cent of its 330,000
tonnes-a-year capacity while Chromecorp Technology, South Africa's third
biggest producer, announced last month it was shutting down its 180,000
tonne a year furnaces for two to three months.
Mr Allan Kuhnert, marketing director of CMI, said last week that the
combination of a price rise with weakening demand had had 'a fairly
devastating effect on our ability to sell'.
This view, however, is not shared by Mr Hans Smith, managing director of
Samancor. 'There are just not volumes to be had out there,' he comments,
denying that the price rise caused the weakening in demand.
He notes that ferrochrome could be purchased a month ago for Dollars 670 a
tonne, or 37 cents a lb, in the scrap market and says that stainless steel
companies were obviously going to go this route rather than pay 52 cents for
South African metal. With the price in the scrap market now having risen to
more than Dollars 900 a tonne, however, he believes the supply of scrap has
largely gone.
Samancor is now operating at about 75 per cent of capacity. A three-month
closure is thus likely to result in about 200,000 tonnes of production being
lost.
Despite the closures, Mr Smith says, Samancor will have no problem in
meeting all its contractual commitments. Indeed, he forecasts that the
company will still have two and a half months stocks left at the end of the
financial year in June.
Mr Smith says Samancor's stock-rich position is the result of last
September's merger with Middelburg Steel and Alloys, then the world's second
largest producer, which brought together considerable stockpiles. He notes
that the group also took advantage of cheap power rates in December to run
its furnaces at full capacity.
Samancor's decision to cease production for three months was cash-flow
driven, Mr Smith says. He admits that he is 'not too happy' with net cash
levels down to R100m (Pounds 19.5m) from R392m a year previously and
believes ceasing production will help generate cash to restore funds. He
concedes that the company is surrendering profits in favour of cash-flow.
Although the outlook for producers remains poor until there is an upturn in
world economic growth, CMI maintains that its regular customers are already
returning to them and 'by the second quarter they will be back into the
South African fold'.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: German group close to
Indonesian copper deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German metals, mining, and engineering group, is
near agreement on a Dollars 500m smelter and refinery project in Indonesia
in which it will combine with Japanese, US, and local partners to produce
copper for the fast-growing domestic market
At the same time, it is involved in negotiations about a zinc smelter in
Thailand, which would cost about Dollars 300m. In this venture, which would
also act as a recycling centre for metallic waste from steel plants in Asia,
mainly Japan, Metallgesellschaft will work with a big Thai mining concern.
No announcement on either deal has yet been made by the Frankfurt-based
group, which intends to use the latest environmental technology in the
planned Asian smelters. Its world-wide mining and metallurgical activities
already include operations in Germany, Canada, Alaska, Papua New Guinea,
Turkey, Tunisia, and Australia.
Metallgesellschaft's stake in the Indonesian smelter, which will produce
150,000 tonnes of refined copper a year at Gresik near the port of Surabaya
in eastern Java, will be 55 per cent. Both Nippon Mining of Japan and
Freeport MacMoRan of the US will have around 20 per cent each, with the
Jakarta government and Indonesian business interests sharing the rest.
Industry sources said the Gresik project would eventually enable Indonesia
to meet its own copper demands instead of exporting the metal in concentrate
form for outside processing, mostly in Japan, and importing it back for
domestic use. Financing is being arranged by an international banking
consortium, including German banks.
In the Thai venture, Metallgesellschaft will probably have a 49 per cent
participation, with Pateng Industries owning 51 per cent. Eventual output of
80,000 tonnes of zinc and 30,000 tonnes of lead a year is planned. Both
projects will be operated by subsidiaries of the German group: Rheinische
Zinc in Indonesia and Norddeutsche Affinerie in Thailand. Lurgi, also part
of Metallgesellschaft, is likely to be involved in building the smelter
plants.
Finnish mining and metals company, Outokumpu, has decided to shelve a plan
to build a copper smelter at Sines in Portugal, reports Reuter from
Helsinki. Instead, it will examine options for the longer-term development
of its Harjavalta smelter in western Finland.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hard bargaining looms at Opec -
Deborah Hargreaves on this week's crucial ministerial meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will face
their toughest session since the Gulf war tomorrow as they meet against a
background of weak oil prices and stagnant world demand.
The hard-pressed producers' club knows it must send a clear signal to world
markets of its willingness to make meaningful production cuts if it is to
avert a price collapse in the next couple of months.
Producers realise they must cut production by at least 1.5m barrels a day to
have any effect on prices. But for the larger producers, such as Saudi
Arabia, a return to tight individual production quotas, on which Opec policy
was based in the past, is anathema.
Smaller producers such as Algeria want to see the higher prices that a large
cut in output would bring. Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's oil minister,
said yesterday Opec must cut at least 1.7m b/d to 22.5m b/d and sustain this
for a year.
There will be some hard bargaining over the size of the overall output cut
and the production level from which individual producers' will start to turn
down the taps.
Ten producers have already reduced their output by 420,000 b/d altogether,
in order to give some support to prices. The voluntary cuts announced
several weeks ago had little immediate effect on oil prices and have yet to
feed through fully to the market, where prices have languished since
November.
But at least the market stopped falling. In fact, prices have edged up over
the past week - as they usually do before an Opec meeting - and North Sea
Brent crude for delivery in April rose by 40 cents yesterday to Dollars
18.80 a barrel.
Traders are taking a sanguine view that Opec producers will agree at this
week's meeting to stop pumping so much oil. If they fail to come to some
arrangement, there is little doubt that prices will collapse to below
Dollars 15 a barrel for Brent.
No producer wants a price collapse as all of them are running budget
deficits and all have based their financial plans for this year on a price
for oil higher than the current Dollars 17 a barrel for the Opec basket of
crudes.
The state of emergency in Algeria and the attempted coup in Venezuela last
month highlight the way depressed oil revenues can exacerbate political
instability for some members.
At the same time, Opec can no longer look to outside factors to buoy prices.
World demand at just over 64m b/d has shown little more than a 1 per cent
rise over the same period last year and most western countries remain in
recession. In addition, exports from the former Soviet Union have stabilised
after slipping slightly last year.
In December, Opec pumped oil at its fastest rate for 11 years when
production reached 24.4m b/d. This declined in January to 24.2m b/d. But
estimates for the call on Opec oil for the second quarter are as low as
22.7m b/d.
Discussion at the meeting will centre around a cut in production of 5 to 7
per cent or a similar formula that will avoid a direct reference to quotas.
Saudi Arabia will insist that production cuts be shared evenly and not fall
squarely on its shoulders even though it has raised output by far more than
the others to compensate for the absence of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil from the
market.
Saudi Arabia has increased its market share from a quarter of Opec output to
more than a third since the Gulf crisis.
'The more they define what the production cut will be and how it will be
spread, the more credible the agreement will be to the market,' said Mr
Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
But market-watchers are sceptical that a cut of 1.5m b/d will be enough to
do more than put a floor under current prices. A cut of this size could push
Opec prices to Dollars 18 to Dollars 19 a barrel, but not to the Dollars 21
a barrel target price.
'In order to raise prices, Opec needs to cut by 1.7m b/d to 2m b/d and not
just say it, but actually cut it back,' said Mr Joseph Stanislaw at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. 'That is a pretty big task
and I see little chance of it happening.'
Indeed, Saudi Arabia's price objective is thought to be below Dollars 21 a
barrel. The kingdom will try to steer a middle course between pacifying its
hard-line colleagues such as Algeria by agreeing to pump less oil while at
the same time, maintaining its policy of moderate pricing.
In order to keep smaller producers happy, Opec ministers may agree that if,
say, a cut of 7 per cent in output takes an individual country below the
quota that was set in July 1990, it can continue to produce at quota.
That way the agreement can skirt the issue of direct production quotas.
Kuwait will, in any case, escape the overall requirements to cut output
while it is still rebuilding its oil industry. The emirate plans to pump
1.5m b/d by the end of this year, which will take it closer to its
production rate before the Gulf war.
What the meeting is unlikely to do is to make any contingency plans for the
return of Iraqi oil to the market. This is unlikely before the end of the
year given the break-down of talks between Baghdad and the United Nations,
which bought Opec a breathing space. When Iraq returns fully to the export
market, other producers will be forced to cut much more deeply.

NEW CREST Mining yesterday took the Australian federal government to the
High Court, challenging a Cabinet decision last year to ban mining of gold,
platinum and palladium at Coronation Hill in the Northern Territory, writes
Emilia Tagaza in Canberra.
The company, on behalf of the Coronation Hill joint venture, claimed that
the government's June declaration of Coronation Hill as part of the Kakadu
National Park, which closed it to all mining activities, was unlawful.
New Crest's managing director, Mr John Quinn, said the joint venturers
acknowledged that governments had the right to act in what they judged to be
the national interest. 'However, if their action has an impact on private
property rights, it is only fair that the owners be compensated for the full
value of that property.'
The other members of the joint venture are Plutonic Resources, an associate
of Malaysia Mining Corporation, and Norgold.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Compromise plan offered on EC
farm policy reform
</HEADLINE>

THE CURRENT Portuguese presidency of the European Community yesterday
presented its promised compromise 'working paper' on the reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy, which seeks to loosen the Brussels package
without altering its shape or design.
On cereals, the central chapter of the reform plan, the presidency paper
raises the possibility of higher compensation for cuts in the support price
of 35 per cent over three years, and for the land set aside to enforce
production restraint.
However, this proposal contains two caveats that should hamstring ministers
keen to secure more income for their farmers. Higher direct compensation for
the cuts would only be made 'if possible in budgetary terms', and if it did
not cut across the intention of making cereals prices competitive.
The European Commission will today unveil a five-year budget revision
proposal that is already likely to be forensically examined by member states
for unnecessary spending. It foresees CAP outgoings rising from Ecu35.3bn
(Pounds 25bn) this year to Ecu38.6bn in 1997, at 1992 prices, but with a
bulge caused by the compensation payments in 1995 and 1996, which would
raise the farm budget to around Ecu40bn.
Compensation for cereal price cuts will alone rise to Ecu13.1bn by 1996,
with additional spending on environmental and early retirement measures
costing a further Ecu1.8bn. Even though savings from price cuts turn this
into a net increase of Ecu4.7bn, commission officials see little prospect of
any further rise.
The rest of the Portuguese compromise is a shopping list of member states'
most vigorously pressed demands, some of which the commission is discreetly
welcoming as useful political grease to ease the passage of the reform.
Thus, the UK's complaint that limits on premiums to sheep farmers in
disadvantaged hill areas discriminated against Britain's large flocks has
surfaced in the Portuguese plan as an increase in the eligible headage of
sheep from 750 to 1,000. Similarly, the compromise loosens the commission's
limits on the number of both dairy and beef cows per hectare which would
receive a premium payment, raising it from 1.4 to 2.
Greek and Italian tobacco farmers facing a sharp cut in the quota financed
by the EC have had 10,000 tonnes added back. And for dairy farmers, there
will in addition be more flexibility in the management of quota cuts.

Platinum closed easier on the London bullion market yesterday. South
Africa's Impala said it had to acquire 70,000 ounces of platinum to meet
supply commitments in the second half of 1991, but the company refused to be
drawn on market talk of more recent offtake. Impala, the world's second
biggest producer, experienced a shortfall of 150,000 ounces in the six
months to December 31; labour difficulties caused an irrecoverable loss of
100,000 ounces of platinum. The figures were close to analysts estimates.
Reaction on Nymex was expected to be muted in late trading by Tokyo's
holiday closure today. Tin prices closed on the LME at the highest level
since last September as demand for high quality metal increased and
Brazilian supplies slowed. High-purity Brazilian brands now command premiums
over LME of some Dollars 100 a tonne against Dollars 60 last week. Delays to
shipments of Brazilian metal, as well as vessels carrying Malaysian tin have
contributed to the tightness. Trade buying and short covering underpinned
the market. The constructive close suggests a move towards Dollars 5,800 a
tonne, technical traders said. In Chicago soyabeans were higher at midday on
optimism over sales to the former Soviet Union.

FT  11 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Salomon puts an end to
speculation - The plans of the US securities house for European growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The promotion of Mr Dennis Keegan and Mr Stephen Posford as joint chief
executive officers at Salomon Brothers International yesterday is intended
to put a stop to speculation over the direction of the Wall Street firm's
European business.
In an interview with the Financial Times, they stated Salomon Brothers' firm
commitment to the equity business. Salomon plans to increase its presence in
the UK stock and derivative markets, as well as in southern European equity
markets such as Spain.
'We really want to slay this idea that we are getting out of the equities
business,' says Mr Peter McSloy, chief administrative officer and a member
of the new European management committee. Profits for 1991 in European
equities were up 76 per cent on the previous year, he says.
Mr Keegan admits that equity business is the area 'most damaged by errors
made in pay and misunderstandings in the philosophy of the business'. But he
says a decision has been taken to become more active in the UK markets,
particularly as more clients are interested in these markets now that tax
and accounting rules relating to the derivatives markets have been
clarified.
Salomon is already active in the Swiss and German derivatives markets, a
position which Mr Keegan claims has helped generate other business in the
Swiss and German markets.
On the fixed income side, Mr Keegan says the firm will add Euroyen and
Eurosterling bond trading to meet client needs. 'We assume there will be a
higher proportion of European corporations wanting to borrow in the Eurobond
market in future,' he says.
Finally, Salomon wants to develop its investment banking operations,
emphasising cross-border mergers and acquisitions, and privatisations.
'Billions of dollars of capital need to find a permanent home - our role is
finding it,' says Mr Bill Strong, head of investment banking, pointing to
the wave of privatisations expected in Scandinavia, France and eastern
Europe.
Whether these aims are achieved depends largely on how willing customers are
to do business with the firm. For there is no doubting the impact of Salomon
Brothers' misdemeanours in the US Treasury bond auctions on the firm's
European business.
Salomon was stripped of its title as US lead manager for the UK government's
sale of BT shares, and has since been shunned by companies planning
international equity issues.
On the Eurobond side, Mr Keegan admits 'people are wary of giving us the
lead manager position, but we're getting a lot of co-leads and joint leads.
In the Eurobond market, many of the borrowers are sovereign and they are the
most cautious ones.'
The auction-rigging scandal also took its toll on staff. Some were made
redundant while others left of their own accord, demoralised or dissatisfied
over their compensation packages.
Following the appointment of Mr Jim Massey (former chief executive officer
in London) as head of international operations in New York late last year,
insiders say there was an internal power struggle for the number one
position, resulting in further departures.
However, Mr Keegan and Mr Posford (who have worked together successfully as
joint heads of fixed income, and then as joint heads of equity and fixed
income business) are respected by colleagues, and are seen as good managers.

<TEXT>
SAMSUNG Electronics Hungary, a subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate,
has announced plans for a share flotation on Budapest's fledgling stock
exchange. Realisation of the scheme would make Samsung's the first foreign
start-up venture to tap the Hungarian share market for funds.
The issue will almost double the Samsung share capital, diluting the South
Korean parent company's 100 per cent shareholding without depriving it of
majority control.
The pricing and timing of the offering are still to be decided in the light
of 1991 earnings results expected next month.
Samsung Electronics Hungary, which makes televisions and distributes
electronic office equipment in Hungary, is turning to the stock market to
finance further expansion in the wake of 1991 turnover growth of 40 per cent
to Ft2.5bn (Dollars 32.5m).
Analysts said Samsung's move pointed a way out of the dilemma faced by many
western firms based in Hungary and earning local currency. They face
exorbitant local bank interest rates and exchange rate risks if they borrow
in hard currency.
Samsung's resort to the Budapest capital market follows that of the
Hungarian subsidiary of MacDonald's, the US fast food chain, which last
October issued Ft400m in bonds with a four year gratuity.

TWO Ecu offerings for top-rated Scandinavian borrowers met reasonable retail
demand in generally sluggish market conditions. Dealers said the unplaced
inventory on underwriters' books, particularly in the dollar sector, shows
little sign of shrinking.
ing for Norway's Eksportfinans was considered fairly priced, but dealers
said that demand is concentrated at the five to seven-year area of the yield
curve, The deal, arranged by Nikko, was bid at 99.75, below its fixed
reoffer price of 99.95.
Meanwhile, the Swedish National Housing Finance Corporation (SBAB) made its
debut offering in the Ecu market. The Ecu300m five-year deal via UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew was also considered reasonably priced, but had not broken
syndicate at the end of trading.
Despite signs of less than enthusiastic investor interest in recent deals, a
number of sovereign and supranational borrowers are said to be set to raise
funds in Ecu.
As well as the European Community, which is expected to launch its next Ecu
transaction later this week, Spain and Portugal are both said to be eyeing
the market, while Denmark is expected to launch its Ecu1bn domestic bond
issue in the next few weeks.
In the dollar sector, Nomura International arranged a two-tranche
transaction of senior floating-rate and subordinated fixed-rate bonds,
backed by US adjustable rate mortgages. The transaction, issued through a
special purpose vehicle, is one in a series of three offerings currently
being prepared.

FT  11 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: London increases share of Ecu
banking market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S share of the Ecu banking market showed a further increase last
year, while the proportion of business in Paris and Brussels has shown a
steady decline since 1985, according to the Bank for International
Settlements' quarterly report on developments in the Ecu financial markets.
'In the space of a few years London has become the main centre for Ecu bank
business,' accounting for 27 per cent of the market, said the report. There
has also been a surge of activity in Sweden, from Ecu1bn at the end of 1990
to Ecu6bn in September 1991, following the linkage of the krona to the Ecu
last year. Activity in Germany remains relatively modest despite the lifting
of restrictions on Ecu deposits.
The growth in the Ecu banking market last year was outstripped only by the
surge of activity in the Ecu bond market.
Ecu banking transactions grew at an annual rate of 25 per cent for the first
nine months of last year, bringing the total assets of BIS reporting banks
(those in Europe and Japan) to Ecu176bn, compared with Ecu149bn in 1990 and
just Ecu64bn in 1985.
The Ecu banking market has retained two distinctive features: the
predominance of interbank activity (nearly three-quarters of total bank
assets) and the high geographical concentration of business within Europe.
But there are a number of important developments, such as the shift in the
net position of reporting banks from a net asset position at the end of 1988
to a net liability position in September 1991, reflecting the increasing
amount of assets held by non-bank institutions.
However, the bulk of assets are still mainly held by non-bank financial
institutions such as insurance companies, according to Jean-Louis Pezet, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais.
The sharp expansion of holdings by central banks has also boosted activity.
The BIS estimates central bank deposits in the Ecu market at around Ecu30bn,
with a further Ecu4bn-5bn held in the form of securities. The increased
holdings of central banks in private Ecu, rather than official Ecu (which
cannot be traded), is also a notable development, analysts say.
Meanwhile, the Ecu bond market experienced a record period of growth in the
first nine months of last year. The total stock of outstanding Ecu bonds
reached Ecu72bn as of September 1991, with secondary market turnover 10
times greater than in 1989.
Increased borrowing by European governments was a catalyst for growth,
encouraging broader participation by institutional investors. The bond
market has also been able to feed off the growing Ecu swaps market and the
development of Ecu futures and options contracts.
Movement towards European monetary union has underpinned the growth of
activity in Ecu financial markets, although some segments remain
underdeveloped, and the elimination of much of the uncertainty surrounding
the future of the Ecu at the Maastricht summit last December is expected to
fuel further expansion.
There is a need 'to differentiate between financial and commercial use of
the Ecu,' according to Mr Bertrand de Maigret, managing director of the
Association for the Monetary Union of Europe. He said that commercial
invoicing in Ecu is rare, outside certain areas like transportation.
It is a problem which the European Community is preparing to tackle. This
summer, officials at DG2, one of the Commission directorates, will publish a
white paper describing all the legal and technical obstacles to the use of
Ecu.

BUNNINGS, the Australian timber and building products group reported a sharp
rise in net profits, to ADollars 13.12m (USDollars 9.8m) for the first half
to December, from ADollars 4.04m a year earlier, Reuters reports from
Sydney. Bunnings is the subject of a hostile takeover bid from Wesfarmers,
the Australian agricultural services and coal group.
The advance was mainly due to the sale of property.
Sales moved ahead to ADollars 195.43m from ADollars 189.89m, while property
sales netted income of ADollars 15.94m, against ADollars 2.23m. Earnings per
share came out at 28.5 cents, compared with 9.1 cents.
The dividend is being maintained at 8 cents a share.
Wesfarmers already holds 44.6 of Bunnings. Last week it said BTR of the UK
had accepted the bid for its 24.6 per cent stake.

MR KERRY Packer, the Australian media proprietor, yesterday unveiled the
public flotation of 55 per cent of his Australian Consolidated Press, the
dominant magazine publisher in the country.
The flotation, fully underwritten by Ord Minnett Securities, will raise
ADollars 475.2m (USDollars 356m) through the issue of 95.1m shares at
ADollars 5 each. Mr Packer's privately-owned Consolidated Press Holdings
will retain 45 per cent, equivalent to 77.8m shares.
The prospectus said the new vehicle would borrow an additional ADollars 350m
to provide most of the remaining cash to be paid to Mr Packer. It also
showed that the company was being floated on a price earnings multiple of
13.4 times the forecast 1992-93 net earnings of ADollars 64.5m.
The company is forecast to have earnings growth of 21.8 per cent this year
and 17.6 per cent in 1993. Dividend yield for next year is projected at 6
per cent.
The flotation of the publishing group, which owns 68 magazine titles in
Australia and New Zealand, is the latest of Mr Packer's fund-raising
exercises, which began 18 months ago. Last month, he floated 51 per cent of
Valasis Communications, his successful US-based advertising company.

<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing, Australia's dominant brewer, has ridden through continuing
difficulties in its shrinking agribusiness and finance operations to record
almost static earnings for the first half to December.
The company yesterday announced net earnings of ADollars 183.5m (USDollars
137.9m) for the half, against a restated previous figure of ADollars 185.6m.
Total revenue eased to ADollars 5.25bn from ADollars 5.46bn.
The company, however, continued to record large extraordinary losses on its
agribusiness and finance operations. An after-tax extraordinary loss of
ADollars 106.6m, against a ADollars 80.1m loss previously, cut earnings
available to shareholders to ADollars 76.9m from ADollars 105.5m.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the company would still raise the
interim dividend to 3 cents a share, from 2.5 cents, taking almost 87 per
cent of bottom-line earnings.
The increase will doubtless be welcomed by the company's deposed chief, Mr
John Elliott, whose private vehicle, International Brewing Holdings, remains
Foster's main shareholder.
Late last year, Mr Elliott staged a heavily-publicised attempt to reassert
control over the group. He was rebuffed by the board, but not until
performance targets were agreed.
The Foster's result was held together by the performance of the company's
overseas brewing interests: Courage in Britain and Molson in North America.
Although brewing earnings jumped to ADollars 332.8m from ADollars 250.6m,
the contribution from Australian brewing fell to ADollars 111.5m from
ADollars 131m. The earnings star was Courage, lifting its contribution to
ADollars 147.4m from ADollars 78.1m, while Molson rose to ADollars 73.9m
from ADollars 41.5m.
Mr Bartels described the brewing performance as 'excellent in the face of
severe economic conditions'. He said the result clearly demonstrated the
benefits of global spread.
'The recession in Australia, the UK and Canada has had the most severe
impact on beer industry volumes for decades,' Mr Bartels said. 'To improve
profitability in these conditions is a significant achievement, although the
pressure will still be on for at least the next half year.'
Mr Bartels said cost-cutting had helped ease the impact of the Australian
recession. The Courage result was an encouraging early sign of benefits from
the acquisition of GrandMet's breweries and the restructuring of the UK pub
estate.
'As the UK comes out of recession and the trend to larger packaged beer
volumes continues, Courage should be in a position to better exploit its
good range of brands,' he said.
Foster's reduced net interest payments to ADollars 85.8m from ADollars
112.3m, but depreciation provision was up to ADollars 66.8m from ADollars
47.4m. Tax took ADollars 29.4m compared with ADollars 17.7m previously.

A GROUP of Japanese 'non-bank' financial institutions is negotiating the
restructuring of Sueno Kosan, a debt-troubled real estate developer bruised
by the downturn in property prices.
The restructuring programme is unusual for 'non-banks', the leasing and
consumer credit companies often blamed by the Ministry of Finance for the
excessive lending that fuelled stock and property speculation during the
late 1980s.
Japan Housing Loan confirmed that it and three other institutions - Japan
Leasing, Nippon Housing Loan and Jyuso - were considering a purchase of
properties owned by Sueno in an attempt to reduce its debts, reported at
Y600bn (Dollars 4.9bn).
The case highlights the close links between many of the so-called
'non-banks' and mainstream banks, which often have strategic holdings in
these institutions. Seven trust banks have an involvement in Jyuso, while
the Industrial Bank of Japan has links to Japan Housing Loan.
The Bank of Japan, fearing that weaker non-bank institutions could collapse
under the weight of bad property and stock-related loans, has advised
mainstream banks that they should take responsibility for the non-banks'
health and that of their leading clients.

PARMALAT, the Italian milk and dairy foods group whose shares are widely
owned abroad, raised operating earnings by 28 per cent to L173bn (Dollars
147.2m) last year. The improvement, accompanied by a 20 per cent rise in
sales to L1,325bn, is likely to be followed by an increased dividend, the
company implied.
Parmalat made a payout of L50 a share for the second half of 1990 following
its restructuring in July 1990 and the creation of the stock market listed
Parmalat Finanziaria holding company. Full 1991 figures will be released in
March.
The group has used its strengthened capital base for a series of
acquisitions, most of which will be reflected in this year's turnover. In
Italy, Parmalat has bought control of municipally owned dairies in Como and
Genova, while in Brazil, its second main market, sales jumped by 97 per cent
to L201bn thanks partly to two acquisitions.
Last year's purchases would have raised group turnover by L115bn, but only
L12bn has been consolidated into the 1991 accounts, the company said. Sales
this year are expected to rise by around 23 per cent to about L1,636bn,
while operating profits should rise by 16 per cent to L201bn.
Parmalat intends to continue its acquisition strategy, using privatisation
opportunities in Italy and in eastern Europe.

A DECLINE in advertising due to the US recession contributed to a 27.5 per
cent drop in 1991 net profits to Dollars 47m at the New York Times Company.
The decline in profits was struck on revenues of Dollars 1.7bn, 4.5 per cent
down on 1990.
The company said that 1991 earnings - which were 61 cents a share against 85
cents in 1990 - would have been higher had it not been for a series of
special charges, including a Dollars 20m second-quarter 1991 charge to cover
severance payments for 160 employees at the flagship New York Times.
The company's fourth-quarter 1991 net profit was nearly treble the low 1990
level, at Dollars 34.6m (45 cents a share). Fourth-quarter revenues were
Dollars 452.5m, compared with Dollars 456m in the last quarter of 1990.
A series of special charges affecting the company's 1991 earnings included a
Dollars 10m provision for income tax contingencies related to a settlement
dating from the 1980-1984 period.
Magazine acquisition costs also affected 1991 earnings, as did the
discontinuing of the capitalisation of interest in connection with the New
York Times's automated colour production and distribution facility in New
Jersey.
If these factors are excluded, the company's 1991 earnings would have been
97 cents a share.
Operating profits in the newspaper group - which includes the New York
Times, 32 regional papers and a 50 per cent share in the International
Herald Tribune - rose to Dollars 49.2m from Dollars 32.1m in the fourth
quarter. Revenues were Dollars 345.7m, against Dollars 350.1m.
Fourth-quarter operating income from the magazine division was Dollars 1.4m,
compared with a Dollars 6.3m loss in the last quarter of 1990. The
broadcasting and information services business recorded Dollars 4.8m of
operating profits, against Dollars 4.7m in the same period of 1990.

YVES Saint Laurent, the French fashion house which last week celebrated its
30th anniversary, yesterday confirmed it had sustained a slight fall in net
profits for 1991, on sales which rose 2 per cent to FFr3.06bn (Dollars
576.2m), from FFr3bn in 1990, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Saint Laurent said profits for 1991 would fall slightly from the FFr252m
made in 1990, given the competitive state of the luxury goods market and
also the impact of the costs incurred in launching a skin-care range.
As with the rest of the global luxury goods industry, Saint Laurent
experienced a difficult year in 1991.

<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has sold just over 66 per cent of Multibanco
Comermex, the nation's fourth largest bank, for 2.71bn pesos (Dollars 872m),
equivalent to 21 times last year's earnings and 3.73 times book value.
The extraordinarily high multiple reflects a growing desperation among some
Mexican brokers to buy a bank before it is too late.
The government has already sold the country's three largest banks, and of
the seven remaining, none has the national coverage of Comermex.
Banamex, Bancomer and Serfin, the three largest banks, have been sold for
2.62, 2.99 and 2.69 times book value respectively.
Comermex has assets of 24bn pesos, 6.4 per cent of the total in the banking
system, and 352 branches spread across the country.
Grupo Financiero Inverlat, the holding company of the large brokerage by
that name, outbid its nearest competitor by a mere 2.81 per cent, and paid
1,029 pesos per share. Inverlat had previously failed in its attempt to buy
two banks.
The result will come as a bitter disappointment to Invermexico, the
brokerage which missed out on buying Banamex, Mexico's largest bank.
A group of top executives who had been forced to resign from Inverlat after
a boardroom disagreement, recently joined Invermexico. The rivalry between
the two brokerages may in part explain why the bids were so high.
Inverlat has 26 branches in Mexico and one in New York. Its president, Mr
Agustin Legorreta, is from Mexico's leading banking family.
The bank has been conservatively managed in the past decade, and with a more
aggressive strategy could increase its share of the loan market.
In common with many Mexican banks, it made much of its money in the late
1980s from trading in the money market.

<TEXT>
HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, a subsidiary of the Anglo American group of
South Africa, announced a 36 per cent fall in attributable earnings, to
R95.6m in the year to December. Weak economic conditions caused demand to
drop in domestic and export markets, writes Philip Gawith.
Turnover dropped to R1.38bn from R1.43bn and pre-tax profits were down to
R109.2m from R201.3m. A large cut in the tax bill reduced the impact on
attributable earnings.
The dividend was maintained at 70 cents per share despite a fall in earnings
to 130 cents a share from 208.4 cents.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said the drop in earnings was the result of lower
domestic and export volumes and lower export prices.

<TEXT>
IMPALA Platinum, the world's second largest producer, yesterday cut its
interim dividend by 31 per cent, from 80 to 55 cents a share, as first-half
earnings fell 16 per cent.
The performance of the South African group was better than analysts
predicted, due largely to a large drop in expenditure on leases, royalties
and tax, to R45.5m (Dollars 16.4m) from R211.2m. A 39 per cent fall in
profits from platinum operations, to R218.1m, was therefore ameliorated at
the bottom line, with attributable earnings 16 per cent down at R124.7m.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman, said the group was hit by unexpectedly weak
platinum and rhodium prices, coming at a time of high capital expenditure,
'enormous' labour difficulties, and problems with the 'lock-up' of metals in
refineries. The average price received for platinum dropped to Dollars 376
per ounce from Dollars 448 in the same reporting period in 1990.
Mr Gilbertson said the group lost about 100,000 oz of platinum production,
which could not be recovered. This was the result of labour difficulties
which caused shaft closures and decreased efficiency. The shortfall was
compounded by the 'lock-up' of 50,000 oz of platinum in the refinery because
of construction and commissioning activity.
The outcome was that Impala produced only 382,000 oz of refined platinum
compared with 528,000 oz in the year-ago period. Sales dropped to 443,000 oz
from 544,000 oz.

CAP Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computer services group, is making a
SKr500m (Dollars 88.3m) bid for Programator, its Scandinavian competitor.
CGS said the acquisition would mark the group's return to a strategy of
'external growth' after a period of consolidation.
In 1990 CGS took control of Hoskyns, the largest UK computer services
concern. Since then CGS has taken over Scientific Control Systems in Germany
and sold a minority holding in its own equity to Daimler-Benz, the giant
German industrial group.
Programator, which is based in Sweden, is the biggest Scandinavian computer
services company. It mustered sales of SKr1.9bn in 1991 and employs around
2,500.
The deal has already won the agreement of the larger shareholders in
Programator - Sandvik the speciality steel and carbide group, the gas
company Aga and the Wasa insurance group. As a result Cap Gemini Sogeti
controls 51.4 per cent of Programator's equity and 82.2 per cent of the
voting shares.
The new organisation, consisting of Programator and Cap Gemini Sogeti's
Nordic unit will have a turnover of SKr2.7bn and employ around 3,500.
CGS's net profits fell by 10 per cent last year to an estimated FFr560m
(Dollars 105.4m) from FFr623m in 1990. Sales increased by 9.3 per cent to
FFr10.02bn.

FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: German banks ride high as
economy sags - Why the sector is expected to report record profits for 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when German industrial companies are struggling to maintain
profits and shareholder dividends in the face of a deteriorating economy,
the banking sector is enjoying a boom.
Germany's banks are certain to report record profits for 1991 when full-year
figures are released this spring. Moreover, the biggest and most profitable
bank - Deutsche Bank - signalled its confidence in the outlook for the
current year when it recently increased its 1991 dividend by DM1 to DM15 a
share.
Although few other banks are confident enough to match Deutsche Bank's
dividend move, the increase in the sector's profits last year was spread
widely.
Group operating profits rose by 21.7 per cent at Deutsche Bank in the first
10 months of the year; by more than 31 per cent at Commerzbank, Germany's
third largest bank; and by as much as 50 per cent at medium-sized banks such
as Deutsche Verkehrs Bank.
Strip out the effect of trading gains, and the rise in so-called partial
operating profits was also impressive and widespread. At the parent company
level, this figure increased by 11.4 per cent to DM2.99bn (Dollars 1.92bn)
at Deutsche Bank; by over 20 per cent to DM1.22bn at Dresdner Bank, the
second largest in Germany; and by 29 per cent to DM626m at Bayerische
Vereinsbank, Germany's fourth largest bank.
For the sector as a whole, partial operating profits are likely to rise by
more than 15 per cent for the full year, according to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in
London, compared with an increase of just under 11 per cent for 1990.
Central to the profits performance last year was a surge in demand for
credit, with banks' lending to non-banks rising 12.7 per cent during the
first eight months of 1991. According to Vereinsbank, the growth in lending
volume reflects investment opportunities in the east of Germany, where
economic growth is likely to outpace that of the west for some years to
come.
To the great benefit of the banks, the risks of lending directly to east
Germany have been curbed by credit protection schemes put in place by the
Treuhand, the privatisation agency for former state-owned enterprises in the
east.
To round off the virtuous circle, the banks' cost of funds has fallen at the
same time that lending volumes have risen. This again reflects conditions in
east Germany, where hundreds of thousands of unsophisticated and
conservative customers have left their money in low-yielding accounts.
Recent statistics show that nearly 30 per cent of the total liabilities of
Germany's large banks are financed by money on which they pay out 3 per cent
or less a year. This can be lent out at up to four to five times this rate
to eager corporate customers - at no risk at all to the banks if the
Treuhand is guaranteeing the loans.
The higher German interest rates, the higher the spread for the banks - and
since the Bundesbank's decision to raise rates by a full half point just
before Christmas, they are now at their highest level since before the
Second World War.
In the light of these favour-able circumstances, even earnings growth of 15
per cent last year looks modest: banks' profits would have been
significantly higher had administrative and other costs not also risen last
year. Again, this reflects circumstances in the east, where the banks have
had to invest heavily in new technology, training and property.
At Deutsche Bank's parent company, for example, the costs of developing a
network of branches in the east led to a 19.3 per cent increase in staff and
other operating costs, to DM5.47bn, in the first 10 months of last year.
By the time the banks report their profits early this spring, the boom
conditions which inspired them will have fallen away, for three reasons:
The pre-Christmas rise in interest rates will have dealt a further blow to
the German economy and to the demand for credit. A weaker economy will
expose the banks to bad and doubtful debts. As yet the banks have not made
any provisions for bad loans.
The banks' exposure to the former Soviet Union stood at DM35bn in the middle
of last year. Analysts are playing this down as a depressant on 1991 and
1992 earnings. They point out that the bulk of the risk is shouldered by the
German government or its agencies, leaving the private-sector banks'
uninsured exposure at a relatively modest DM6bn to DM10bn, spread among some
4,000 German banks.
Of the big three banks, only Commerzbank has yet to make any provision
against its Soviet exposure, although it has said that it will bite the
bullet this year. Deutsche, meanwhile, is likely to increase its provisions
from 65 to 70 per cent of a total of an estimated DM1bn-plus of uninsured
loans.
The costs of doing business in eastern Germany are likely to fall this year,
but any benefit here is likely to be offset by rising wages. The 430,000
members of Germany's banking unions are demanding a pay rise of 10.5 per
cent for this year. They have been offered 5 per cent but they are unlikely
to moderate their demands.
While bank workers are currently being ballotted on strike action,
Deutsche's dividend increase at this sensitive stage of the pay round shows
that the banks feel no compulsion to hide their prosperity.
Despite these factors, analysts are expecting the big banks' earnings to
rise as much as 9 to 10 per cent this year - about twice the rate of
increase for the German market as a whole.
Does the performance of earnings mean the banks' shares will do well this
year? Analysts are pinning their hopes on interest rate cuts later this
year. This would reduce the banks' cost of funds without obliging them to
pass on all the benefits of lower rates to their customers, at least not at
once.
'Once the market gets a hint that interest rates are coming down,' says one
German broker, 'banks shares will go into orbit.'

MOTOROLA of the US and Northern Telecom of Canada yesterday unveiled plans
to pool more than Dollars 200m of assets and form a joint venture to market
cellular telephone network systems in North and South America.
The venture - between the leading US electronics and semiconductor
manufacturer and the Canadian-based telecoms group - is aimed at stepping up
competition against American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) and Ericsson of
Sweden, the leaders in the cellular switching sector.
The new company, to be called Motorola-Nortel Communications, is expected to
have 1992 sales of more than Dollars 500m, according to Mr William Spencer,
a Motorola vice president who will become chief executive of the new 50-50
venture.
Mr Spencer said the venture would sell, service and support cellular
infrastructure systems in all areas of North, central and South America,
including the Caribbean region.
The venture is to be based in Chicago and will consist of between Dollars
200m and Dollars 300m of assets that are being pooled. Some 600 Motorola and
300 Northern Telecom employees will be transferred to the venture.
The North American cellular telephone network sector is estimated to have
annual sales of around Dollars 1.4bn, with a compound growth rate of around
40 per cent a year.

<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the large US media and entertainment group, more than halved
its net loss, from Dollars 227m in 1990 to Dollars 99m for the whole of
1991.
The improved figure was partly attributable to lower debt servicing, thanks
to a Dollars 2.6bn rights issue last year that reduced total debt to Dollars
8.7bn.
The company, which had almost unchanged operating profits of Dollars 2.26bn
for 1991, recorded a Dollars 9.60 loss per common share in 1991. This
followed payments of dividends on preferred stock issued in January 1990 as
part of the merger between Time and Warner.
This loss per share - against a Dollars 13.67 loss per share in 1990 -
translated into a deficit of Dollars 692m following the preferred dividend
payout.
Revenues for the whole of 1991 were Dollars 12bn, up from Dollars 11.5bn in
1990. Operating income from publishing, which includes Time magazine,
dropped to Dollars 246m in 1991, from Dollars 366m in 1990. The other four
divisions - music, filmed entertainment, Home Box Office (HBO) television
programming and the cable business - all recorded higher operating profit
last year.
Time Warner said it had Dollars 45m of net income in the last quarter of
1991, compared with a Dollars 34m loss last time.
Mr Steven Ross, chairman, said this was the first time since the merger of
Time and Warner that net profits had been achieved for the quarter.
Fourth-quarter 1991 revenues were Dollars 3.4bn, against Dollars 3.3bn in
the last quarter of 1990.
The loss per common share after preferred stock dividend payments was
Dollars 1.16, against a Dollars 3.08 loss per share in the last quarter of
1990, which translates into a Dollars 107m loss, down from Dollars 177m.
The publishing division was affected by declines in advertising revenues and
a Dollars 60m restructuring charge.

SWISS Volksbank, Switzer-land's fourth largest commercial bank, has taken a
20 per cent stake in Banque Odier Bungener Courvoisier (BOBC), a Paris-based
institution active in commercial, merchant and private banking, writes Ian
Rodger in Bern.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Volksbank said BOBC had total assets
of FFr6.5bn (Dollars 1.22m) and net earnings of FFr47m in 1990, representing
a 15 per cent return on equity.
BOBC has been controlled by the family of Mr Francois Propper, its chief
executive, except for the period from 1982 to 1987, when it was
nationalised.
Mr Walter Ruegg, chief executive of Swiss Volksbank, said he expected an
improvement in the bank's profits this year, despite the weakness of the
Swiss economy.
The bank reported a 38.3 per cent drop in net income last year to SFr68.4m
(Dollars 49.2m) because of a huge increase in provisions to SFr393.8m.

Perrier
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERRIER, the French mineral water company embroiled in a battle between
Nestle of Switzerland and the Agnelli family of Italy, yesterday saw 2 per
cent its capital - 158,000 shares - change hands on speculative hopes of a
counter-offer to Nestle's FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.5bn) hostile bid.
Speculators began buying Perrier as soon as the Paris bourse opened. The
shares - which had been suspended since mid-December following the Agnellis'
FFr5.6bn bid for Exor, Perrier's controlling shareholder - closed at
FFr1,501 against a suspension price of FFr1,396.
This left the Perrier shares trading slightly above the FFr1,475 offered by
Nestle and Indosuez, the French bank with which it is mounting its bid.
Exor, the most likely contender for a Perrier counter-bid, also saw its
shares shoot up after a period of suspension. The Exor share price yesterday
rose by 8.9 per cent to FFr1,438, well above the FFr1,320 a share offered by
the Agnellis.
At present Exor would be able to block Nestle's bid, or a third-party bid,
given that it controls 49 per cent of Perrier's voting shares - through its
own 35 per cent stake and the 13.8 per cent holding recently bought by Saint
Louis, another company associated with the Agnellis.
However, it is not certain that Saint Louis will be able to hold on to its
shares. Nestle has filed two legal cases in France to try to nullify the
stake on the grounds that Perrier, which is chaired by Mr Jacques Vincent,
president of Exor, sold the shares to Saint Louis specifically to block the
Swiss group's imminent bid.
The first court case comes to an end next week and the second on February
25.
If the courts rule in Saint Louis' favour, it would be able to keep its
shares. The French stock market authorities would then force Exor to make a
full bid for Perrier.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Geest agrees exclusive deal for Chilean
produce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEEST, the UK foods group, has agreed an exclusive partnership with United
Trading Company in Chile on the supply of fruit and vegetables to the UK.
It is intended to provide a model for the standards which should be met by
Geest's suppliers in other countries, and responds to stricter UK food
safety laws aimed at making companies like Geest more directly responsible
for the quality of imported foodstuffs.
'Very few companies are willing to commit themselves to these standards, but
Geest has come off the fence,' said Mr Alan Forrester, development director
for Geest International Produce.
'Our suppliers will have to perform against some very difficult
requirements. Those that don't qualify will be isolated: those that are
accredited will be significantly helped in the UK market,' said Mr
Forrester.
UTC is Chile's fourth largest fruit and vegetable exporter, accounting for
9.7m cartons in the 1990-91 season. Just 300,000 of these came to the UK.
Products range from grapes, pears and apples to plums, kiwi fruit and
avocados.
Under the agreement, Geest will use no other supplier in Chile. Nor will UTC
sell to any other UK importer. The agreement involves 'total transparency',
Mr Forrester said.
Geest is to have full access to UTC's market information, and at the same
time provide advice on quality control, and information about the UK market.
He said Geest would not have been willing to share market knowledge so
openly with UTC if the Chilean company had not agreed to an exclusive deal.

FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: James Wilkes' chairman to quit board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN Hinchliffe yesterday resigned as chairman of James Wilkes, the
engineering group which is fighting a hostile Pounds 35.8m bid from
Petrocon, the engineering and surveying group.
He will receive termination payments of about Pounds 533,000 and has
approached the company with a view to buying some Wilkes assets including
Beauchief Hall, the head office in Sheffield, and the helicopter owning
subsidiary.
Mr Arthur Watt, the group managing director who takes over as chairman, said
that if the board accepts Mr Hinchliffe's proposals the group's debt and
overheads would be substantially reduced.
On Friday Mr Hinchliffe was ousted from the board of Lynx Holdings, the
leisure and computer services group where he was chairman, in an
institutional coup triggered by the perception that head office spending was
out of control.
Mr Watt said the new board had different ideas about head office costs. 'The
helicopter division is for sale, head office will be moved and any excesses
will not be continued,' he said.
Petrocon immediately criticised the severence payment. 'In a desperate
effort to escape Petrocon's offers, Wilkes has been forced to jettison its
chairman and some of its extravagancies,' it said.
Mr Hinchliffe's departure in no way reduced the blame for the demise of the
company's fortunes from co-directors he leaves behind, the bidder added.
More than 28 per cent of Wilkes shareholders have already accepted the
Petrocon offer, which is thought to lie behind Mr Hinchliffe's decision to
quitleave the board.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shaping a single exploration entity from the ungainly mixture of Lasmo's and
Ultramar's assets was always going to be a long job, if only because it
looked as if the unwanted parts would be hard to sell. Judging by
yesterday's settlement with the vanquished Ultramar board, Lasmo is
meanwhile making a good enough fist of cutting the group's costs. Granted,
two Ultramar directors have still to agree terms, so an already steep Pounds
8.1m severance charge will rise further. A provision at the year end for
middle management redundancies could further spoil the picture. But the
market was braced for the boardroom pay-offs alone to cost nearer Pounds
20m, so at this stage the deal looks comparatively cheap.
Lasmo also appears in recent weeks to have talked down expectations of the
sale price for Ultramar's downstream businesses. A halved figure of Pounds
700m for the Wilmington refinery in California and the US and Canadian
retail operations looks realistic given the continued weakness of the market
for oil assets. While Lasmo will have to warehouse the businesses for the
foreseeable future, it could conceivably benefit when a buyer eventually
emerges. Until then, the assets will at least be self-supporting.
The more important trick of persuading investors to be patient in the short
term may prove rather harder. But if Lasmo can pull it off, its shares
should at least continue to hold their own against the market.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Unigate/Hillsdown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown's purchase of Unigate's chicken business is a faintly depressing
answer to a long-standing problem. Unigate's massive investment in poultry
looked dubious from the outset. The outcome is a cumulative loss after the
sale of some Pounds 60m, or roughly a year's net profits. Hillsdown will
meanwhile pay an initial Pounds 19m for a business which lost Pounds 7m last
year, chiefly as a means of protecting its own investment and reducing
overcapacity.
Assuming no objection from the Office of Fair Trading, Hillsdown will end up
nearly doubling its share of the UK chicken market to 22 per cent, three
times that of its nearest competitor. It will also leave itself dependent on
the notoriously cyclical poultry market for a fifth of worldwide turnover.
There will obviously be extensive closures, perhaps more among Hillsdown's
older plants than Unigate's. The aim of adding value to several hundred
thousand tonnes of chicken meat a year may prove more elusive.
Taken all round, the deal is a sharp corrective to the view that food stocks
are defensive because people have to eat. Since the onset of the recession
18 months ago, Unigate's shares have underperformed the market by 20 per
cent, Hillsdown's by 45 per cent. In that period, Unigate has been
increasingly forced back on its original dairy business. In the same period
Unigate's chief competitor in that business, Northern Foods, has
outperformed the market by two thirds. Whatever the industry, it seems,
there is no substitute for management.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though the government cannot pull decisively ahead in the polls
without taking some calculated risks in economic management. A tax-cutting
budget and lower interest rates are not the most obvious prescription, given
sterling's weakness in the ERM. But they might be warmly received by the
foreign exchange market if they made a Tory victory appear more likely. That
would be the kind of virtuous circle the government badly needs. Yesterday's
consumer credit and retail sales figures were a rude reminder that there is
precious little reason for the voters to get spontaneously excited.
If so, the government may be tempted to cut interest rates before the
budget. Otherwise it would be too late for lower mortgage rates to be in
place before an April election. Indeed, they already need to be effective by
budget day to affect the retail price index before a May 7 poll. That
explains why some money dealers believe the Bank of England is now testing
the water for a possible rate cut.
But it would be dangerous to infer that a cut is actually imminent. Sterling
may have ridden out December's German rate increase; the peseta may also be
only a distant threat, since it seems to move obediently in line with
sterling. But the surest way of losing the election would be a botched rate
cut followed by a currency crisis. That risk calls for delay until the last
possible moment. There is still some time left, though not much, if the
government is to maximise the political advantage of a cut and retain the
option of going for April 9.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Tobacco puffing under threat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,538.4 (+21.2)
Today's vote in the European Parliament on the banning of tobacco
advertising raises the question of how seriously the equity market should
take the anti-smoking lobby. Certainly, the spectacle of one of Europe's
more politically powerful industries quivering before an institution once
described as the mother-in-law of parliaments is thought-provoking. The
verdict of the Strasbourg assembly may not be the final word. But if its
record on other emotive issues like lead-free petrol is anything to go by,
it will influence thinking in the Council of Ministers later this year.
The problem for investors is working through the implications of a total
ban. At face value, the industry's propaganda suggests that advertising is a
minus sum game, aimed at brand recognition and market share rather than
total consumption. BAT and Rothmans do not disclose the size of their
budgets. Perhaps 5 per cent of net sales is a fair guess, or Pounds
30m-Pounds 50m in the case of BAT's European business. It is instructive to
recall that when tobacco advertising was outlawed in Canada, volumes fell
but profits increased.
In the longer term, of course, companies will no doubt find other ways of
spending the money. Marketing effort will move to the point of sale, with
price discounts likely to displace newspaper and billboard advertising. The
multinationals, moreover, will be at a disadvantage against state monopolies
in France or Spain. On the whole, though, the correct response by investors
to a ban seems to be to sell advertising agencies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If political instability does affect investment planning, this could be a
grim year. The 'if' is there because I do not believe that many chief
executives maintain a project file marked 'pending the outcome of the
election'. They will invest when they think it will be profitable to do so.
The course of the economy is set. While we remain within the exchange rate
mechanism and all parties swear to abide by it, a change of government is
unlikely to make much difference - except to the little matter of the chief
executive's net take-home pay after tax. A bagatelle.
The counter-argument is that uncertainty about government policies damages
confidence and therefore business prospects. If you buy this line, get your
head down. An election on April 9 is unlikely to decide anything for
certain. Before explaining, let me record that not everyone agrees. One
distinguished psephologist privately forecasts a Conservative majority of
100. If so, goodbye British democracy; hello Japan. More seriously, some
senior ministers predict a majority of about 40. If they achieve that, we
may have stability, but even 40 is difficult to believe given the opinion
polls and gloomy reports from the Confederation of British Industry.
The polls still suggest that there will be a hung parliament. Last week's
Gallup in the Daily Telegraph gave the Conservatives a five-point lead,
while Sunday's NOP in the Independent put Labour four points ahead. But the
Financial Times monthly average of all polls had the two larger parties neck
and neck in January and so far it is the same in February. The budget might
edge up the March and April scores for the Tories.
That could help. Dr John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde postulates
a post-spring improvement in the perceived economic outlook and a consequent
Conservative lead of 2 per cent in a June contest. His arguments are set out
in a paper published by Shearson Lehman. Even with regional swings favouring
the government the best his model can offer is a Conservative majority of
10. This falls to - 3 if the Liberal Democrats keep only 13 seats (as
against 22 won by the Alliance in 1987). Note that Dr Curtice assumes that
the election will be delayed until June. It could be, but expectations for
an early April ballot are now so widespread that the prime minister is just
about boxed in.
My guess is still that it will be a very close call, with the Tories likely
to come out ahead. If they have a majority of 15 or less then just seven
by-elections (the number they have lost in a row since May 1989) would wipe
them out. They would be in nearly the same weak-to-unstable position as was
Labour in 1974-79. The government would function but it would be obliged to
tread carefully. The Ulster Unionists, who in 1977 successfully blackmailed
the then Mr James Callaghan into Only politicians really believe in the
beneficence of strong government
granting Northern Ireland an extra five constituencies, know how to exploit
such a situation. Perhaps they would try to get Stormont back, on their own
terms.
Enter Scotland. Some senior ministers argue that even if the Conservatives
dwindle to a taxi-ful of MPs north of the border, they can still maintain
Whitehall rule. They would try to run Scotland with ministers elected in
English constituencies, as they do Northern Ireland and Wales. If they did
they would soon learn the meaning of the word instability. Others in the
government would grant full independence if a referendum demanded it. 'I
would expel them,' says one minister. Yet others believe that after the
election the Scottish Conservative party will become devolutionist, as it
was before Mrs Thatcher turned it, and that, if re-elected, Mr John Major
would then legislate for a Scottish assembly with tax-raising powers.
Never mind the consequential reduction in Scottish seats - and therefore
Labour MPs - in Westminster. That is a detail. The Welsh would quickly be
stirred up and suddenly the three main Celtic countries would be trying for
varying degrees of disentanglement from direct rule by the English. The
minister who put all this in my head believes that for these reasons
constitutional debates will take up most of the new government's time and
energy if the Tory majority is low.
In a hung parliament there would be more urgent constitutional
preoccupations. Say the Tories are the largest party. Mr Major stays prime
minister and presents a Queen's Speech. Mr Paddy Ashdown says his Liberal
Democrats would vote against it unless it contained a promise of
proportional representation and a four-year alliance. Mr Major rejects the
bait. All now depends on Mr Neil Kinnock and the Ulstermen.
If they both voted alongside Mr Ashdown in the 'no' lobby Mr Major would
fall and the Queen could call for the Labour leader to try to form a
government. Mr Ashdown might try the same deal with him, and get the same
response. But then again Mr Kinnock might accept a pact on PR. Then . . .
The Liberal Democrat leader has all this on his 'war games' computer. Yet
the arithmetic suggests that the only sure winners are the Ulster Unionists.
So I prefer to put backgammon and gin rummy on my own laptop. Either is more
soothing to the mind.
In any case, I would welcome a period of instability. Only politicians
really believe in the beneficence of strong government. If you draw a line
down the middle of a foolscap page, as Mr Major is wont to do, and write on
one side the gains from strong government (with privatisation and
Thatcherite trade union legislation at the top) and on the other the losses
(start with the poll tax) a pattern emerges. Most of the items on the gains
side merely undo what previous strong governments contributed to the list of
losses - eg, nationalisation begat privatisation, laxity with the unions
begat Thatcherite laws, the poll tax begat its own abolition. Curious, is it
not?

FT  11 FEB 92 / Letter: Underlying factors creating foundation for future
growth in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MATTHEW OLEX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your news item ('Polish economy declines despite private growth',
February 3) deserves elaboration. It focused without comment on 1991 figures
from the Main Statistical Office. As in other post-socialist countries, this
is notoriously incapable of capturing much private activity in services,
industry and agriculture alike, both because of its reach and because of
'grey' and 'black' evasion. In an economy like Poland's, which some time
this year will be more than 50 per cent private, the official numbers are
simply not to be trusted.
There is much evidence that unrecorded output in Poland is not just
absolutely but also proportionately larger than among its neighbours. The
Austrian bank, Creditanstalt, recently estimated that in Poland official
1991 output figures understated the true position by as much as 38 per cent
and that consequently GDP was on a rising trend. Whatever the 'truth', it is
certain that the official negative number of 8-10 per cent overstates the
contraction. The Polish economy now appears to be bottoming out.
Your conclusions about rising unemployment and the greater number of
pensioners are simplistic. It is not necessarily the case that these reflect
a 'sharp overall contraction in job opportunities'. Of course there is,
inevitably, rising unemployment in an economy shifting orientation on a
massive scale, and there are numerous unemployment black spots. However, the
new non-farm private sector is creating jobs rapidly. Officially, it employs
2.5m and unofficially perhaps a million more, some of whom are surely
claiming benefits.
Furthermore, in relative terms pensions are extremely generous. In 1991
pensioners' average incomes were higher than those in working households,
and their expenditure rose by a huge 8 per cent in real terms (that of
working households was unchanged).
The continued and remarkable boom in exports to the west, up by an
(understated?) 18 per cent to Dollars 14.2bn, shows extraordinary
flexibility in an economy which has had market conditions for only two
years. This will be the foundation for future growth. Exports are
well-diversified and so far have come predominantly (80 per cent) from the
state sector, which has a vast potential for improved efficiency. The
private sector accounted for 46 per cent of imports. Those included consumer
items, such as the (one-off?) flow of western cars, some 300,000 of the
523,000 sold last year.
But the private sector, as we are seeing in the Polish Development Bank, is
now also gearing up for import substitution and export-orientated
production, using imported machinery on a large scale.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Letter: Hopes for enhancing the security of pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD MALONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader, 'Maxwell's pensions' (February 7), you say that 'the
pensions lobby' would argue against the principle of pension rights ranking
as secured creditors when the sponsoring business fails, because it does not
regard final salary pensions as deferred pay.
The assertion confuses two issues. Few people would argue with the principle
that the value of accrued pensions rights - the members' stake in the fund
as you put it - could be described as deferred remuneration, but that does
not in itself resolve the complex question of the ownership of surplus
assets in balance of cost schemes. As far as the ranking of pension rights
in a liquidation or receivership is concerned, even fewer would argue
against the case for further enhancing the overall security of members'
retirement provision in occupational pension schemes. In fact, it is to be
hoped that such a change in legislation may be one positive development
which may emerge from the disastrous consequences of the Maxwell case.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER BEAZLEY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'How to grab the EC money' (February 7), highlights the
importance to the British government of clarifying the agreement, made in
1975 and put in more explicit terms in 1988, that EC regional grants should
have a 'genuine additional economic impact in the regions concerned' and
'result in corresponding increase in total expenditure'.
The differences of interpretation should be relegated to the agenda of the
past and, if sustained, can only serve to cause unnecessary political
embarrassment to Britain in her evolving EC role.
In the future it is anticipated that the agreed expansion of EC regional
programmes will be closely linked to the process of 'convergence', which
makes it even more important to UK regions currently benefiting from access
to EC funding that they demonstrate the success of those schemes, and, where
necessary, sustain them in years to come.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Letter: Locked into PEP losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERNEST G GOBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having been in PEPs since the day they were first traded I have come to
the conclusion that the current increasingly strident advertising could be
misleading.
I, and my family, wish we had never heard of them, for we are much out of
pocket.
We deal with several PEP managers. None has ever forwarded reports and
accounts of the companies in which they hold shares on our behalf. This is
typical of the second-rate service they extend to their PEP customers. No
doubt their excuse is that they are dealing here with penny numbers; but
that is in the nature of the beast (and why offer the service if they don't
like to?).
At 40 per cent tax and at current yields the costs of our PEPs are probably
greater than the tax benefits (at 25 per cent tax the situation would become
untenable).
But what is unequivocal and worse is that we are locked into our loss-making
shares: (eg, Lucas - 35 per cent; Tarmac - 54 per cent; Ladbroke - 21 per
cent; Pilkington - 48 per cent; and my piece de resistance, warmly
recommended by my brokers for one of my PEPs, Adwest  - 52 per cent).
I could go on. And, of course, these losses cannot be offset against my
non-PEP gains.

<TEXT>
Sir, As a Briton I find it offensive to read of trade union restrictive
practices described as a part of our tradition. Ken Gill's letter (February
7) is tinged with racism; he understands the provocative insinuation of the
word 'alien' well. It is insufficient to reject Japanese work practices
merely because they are foreign. They have worked extremely well in Japanese
car factories in the US. I am sure many British workers would be glad to
show they could compete unshackled by the chains of British unionism. And
that is the real point: what kind of dignity have the trade unions provided
for British workers? Unemployment, low living standards, and a work
environment that no Japanese worker would put up with.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Fair pay for the teachers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S PAY review body reports will attract a predictable chorus of
disapproval. Some organisations representing the teachers, doctors, nurses
and health workers will attack their awards as niggardly. Private sector
employers will regard the awards as over-generous at a time when they are
being battered by recession.
This is in the nature of the pay review process, which must balance the
expectations of the people it covers against pressure from the taxpayer and
private sector employers to keep increases in public sector pay as low as
possible. Independent review bodies offer the most acceptable way of
resolving that conflict for teachers, doctors and other large groups in the
public service, where government is the sole employer.
Central to the pay review process is some form of comparability with private
sector pay rates, combined with analysis of turnover and vacancies. But
comparability is inevitably backward-looking: this year's pay increase for
the public sector reflects last year's increase in the private sector (which
in turn is bathed in the glow of last year's rate of inflation). The public
sector pay rises above the going rate announced yesterday are only the
obverse of public sector pay rises below the going rate when the economy was
racing.
Scale back
The government of the day may find this uncomfortable, especially if it is
lecturing employers on the need for prudence. The temptation to scale back
this year's awards or phase them in has been resisted - generosity not
unconnected with the imminence of an election. The government is to be
congratulated on this, however, since the results of such tinkering are all
too often low morale and difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff in
key public services.
These are exactly the problems facing schools in England and Wales, where
teachers this year benefit for the first time from an award by an
independent review body. Turnover remains at worrying levels: a survey
published in December by Manchester University School of Education found
that almost one in 20 teachers left teaching in 1989. More than a third of
vacant teaching posts attracted three or fewer applicants during the year -
with the figure reaching nearly two-thirds in the south-east.
Attract recruits
There is some comfort in the 90 per cent leap in applications this year for
teacher training. But the review body is right to see this as little more
than a consequence of the recession. Its task over the next few years will
be to ensure that teachers' pay reaches levels which can attract high
quality recruits to the profession - and remains at such levels when the
economy starts to grow again.
There is particular cause for concern in turnover among new entrants to the
profession, one in three of whom leave teaching within the first five years.
About half of these subsequently return to teaching - often after starting a
family - and the education department is investigating what can be done to
lure more back. But higher pay may not be the only solution: opportunities
for part-time working, job-sharing and childcare schemes all have a part to
play. More needs to be done to keep in contact with teachers who have
temporarily left employment for family reasons, including courses to keep
them in touch.
There is scope for further use of targeted incentives for experienced
teachers, scarce subjects and hard-to-staff schools. The decision to
increase substantially the number of primary schoolteachers who receive
extra incentive allowances is a good example of how this can be done. The
review body promises to put 'properly designed performance-related pay
arrangements' at the top of its priorities for the next year. The aim should
be to pay good teachers much more, and edge out the poor performers.
But the review body is right to insist that only adequate levels of basic
pay will recruit and retain enough teachers of the right calibre. When
teaching can attract the very best entrants to the labour market, Britain's
schools may score better in Europe's league tables.

Mr Albert Reynolds, sworn in today as Ireland's prime minister, inherits a
country saddled with economic and social problems, which have gone
unresolved under a divided political leadership for the past decade. Yet he
has the opportunity to unify his Fianna Fail party and to revive hopes that,
in 1994, it will win its first parliamentary majority since 1979.
Mr Reynolds assumes office at a time when political solutions to the
problems of Northern Ireland have entered a vacuum. However, his cordial
working relationship with UK prime minister Mr John Major, another
pragmatist, may provide scope for new initiatives in the troubled province.
The challenges are enormous. Mr Reynolds inherits record unemployment of
20.3 per cent, twice the European Community average, and accumulated public
sector borrowings of IPounds 25.4bn (Pounds 23.6bn), or 107 per cent of
gross national product. While the debt level has been reduced since 1988, it
is still one of the highest in the EC. The challenge of harmonising the
Irish economy with its European partners in the run-up to monetary union
requires that the debt/GNP ratio must be steadily reduced, and the
government has set itself a target of 100 per cent of GNP within two years.
Mr Reynolds's party and the country are also looking to him to clean up the
image of pork-barrel politics which for many Irish people had become the
hallmark of government in the era of the former prime minister, Mr Charles
Haughey.
In five general elections during the 1980s, Mr Haughey failed to win an
absolute majority. The party's traditional tenets of republicanism, populism
and conservative Catholicism were increasingly out of tune with the
aspirations of under-30 voters who form about a quarter of the electorate.
In his last term of office Mr Haughey tried to be more European-looking, but
internal squabbles left the party weak and defensive.
The surprise presidential victory of Labour party candidate Mrs Mary
Robinson in 1990, on a programme of job creation and social reform, was a
signal to Fianna Fail.
As the then finance minister, Mr Reynolds led the first push against Mr
Haughey in eight years last November. Although he failed to topple him, a
rising tide of scandals and controversies forced Mr Haughey to step down two
weeks ago. Mr Reynolds faces the task of healing party wounds, stabilising
its coalition with the Progressive Democrats and restoring the image of
Fianna Fail ahead of the 1994 elections. If he is successful, he could call
an early general election.
Mr Haughey's controversial political legacy overshadowed the main success of
his government, which was to tighten the reins on public sector borrowing.
As finance minister from 1988 to 1991, Mr Reynolds slashed the current
budget deficit from more than IPounds 1bn when he took office to IPounds
244m last year. A buoyant economy until the end of 1990, accompanied by
rising tax revenues, enabled the government to freeze public spending
without incurring significant job losses.
In 1990, the powerful Irish Congress of Trade Unions was persuaded to put
its signature to a Programme of Economic and Social Progress (PESP), which
promised industrial peace in return for a series of phased pay awards to
1994 and progress in job creation.
The PESP is now under strain. The promised jobs have not materialised and
part of the 1992 pay awards have been deferred to keep public sector
borrowing under control. Mr Reynolds said yesterday that job creation 'will
be brought to the top of my political agenda'. He was less precise about how
to achieve this goal, but he ruled out any big public spending programmes:
'That policy was tried before and failed and left us with a big overhang of
debt,' he said.
Instead, his emphasis is on the creation of 'sustainable jobs'. Since 1979,
when Ireland entered the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System, industry and the services sector have been forced
to become more efficient to compete with rival European economies. This has
meant a shedding of traditional industries such as textiles and footwear and
the introduction of new ones such as pharmaceuticals and electronics. Now
faced with declining EC farm subsidies, Ireland's relatively large
agricultural population will be looking for jobs in other areas.
Many of these could potentially come from an expected doubling of EC
Structural Funds to IPounds 6bn for 1994-99 compared with the previous five
years, to pay for improvements to Ireland's deficient road and rail
transport systems. Mr Reynolds hopes that, with improved communication
networks in place, Ireland will be well-placed to attract inward investment
and to capitalise on the EC single market.
Presenting the 1992 budget last week, finance minister Mr Bertie Ahern said
his aims were 'sustainable economic and employment growth, the preparation
for the single European market and Emu, and a better and fairer tax system'.
He said the 'containment of debt and borrowing is not simply a matter of
prudent national book-keeping. It is central to the government's strategy
for establishing and sustaining economic confidence in all its aspects -
confidence in the currency, the confidence to invest and expand'.
Mr Ahern's income tax concessions for the lower paid are calculated to
increase the personal disposal income of about 1m taxpayers by 2 per cent
this year, and at the same time to ease wage pressure in the economy. He
sees this move as vital to achieve another goal: reforming the system of
wage-bargaining in the public sector. 'We have spent 20 years in making
annual awards with no increases in productivity. The present system is not
giving the required increases in efficiency. (Its change) will be important
for public finances in the years ahead,' he said.
The budget has won the cautious backing of business and the trade unions.
The prospect of such widespread support for his economic policies will give
Mr Reynolds more room to bring several outstanding and contentious social
issues back on to the political agenda, such as the constitutional ban on
divorce and condom sales.
On the condom issue, for example, a proposed bill to introduce sales from
slot machines and non-pharmacy outlets has still to reach its first reading
in parliament. Sales through pharmacies to over-18-year-olds were legalised
in 1985, but their use is not widespread. In 1989, figures supplied by the
principal distributors showed total condom sales of about 5m, or about five
a year for every adult male. Many pharmacies only sell them from under the
counter.
Social reform will be important not just to attract younger voters to Fianna
Fail, but also to improve Ireland's relationship with Northern Ireland.
Several Unionist leaders in Ulster cite the Catholic Church's dominance of
political affairs in the Republic as a reason for blocking any role for the
Irish government in Northern Ireland's affairs.
Mr Haughey's trenchant republicanism, epitomised by his accusal and
acquittal in an IRA arms trial in 1970, his initial opposition to the 1985
Anglo-Irish agreement, and his stormy interchanges with former UK prime
minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher over the H-block hunger strikers and
extradition in the early 1980s, did little to endear him to the Unionists in
the north.
There will be expectations of fresh initiatives under Mr Reynolds's
leadership. He said yesterday he wanted to create more cross-border projects
'to build trust between the two communities' and to look for 'a possible
involvement of the EC' in a new political initiative. 'The economic borders
of the community will be gone next year, so we have to try to find a
structure to allow the political borders to go as well,' he said.
However, the possibility of a hung UK parliament after the upcoming general
election, with a Conservative government that might have to rely on Ulster
Unionist support, is not a prospect likely to encourage political
flexibility in Dublin.
Having grasped the leadership nettle, Mr Reynolds has now to prove that he
will give the country a fresh start. He is widely viewed as fair and honest.
He promises to appoint a new cabinet on personal merit rather than on a
basis of repaying political favours. 'It will be a government of openness,
not defensiveness, a government of consultation and consensus, not diktat.
'My overall aim is to create a modern society; progressive, enlightened and
socially caring,' he said.
These are messages calculated to appeal not only to ordinary Irish people
but also to investors in Japan, the US and Europe. It would be a wasted
opportunity indeed were Mr Reynolds to compromise them too readily when
faced with the political realities of office.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Why Mr Kohl must act
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL has persuasive reasons for radiating self-satisfaction.
Unlike the heads of governments of the US, Britain, France and Italy, he is
not in the midst of a debilitating election campaign. He enjoys
unprecedented sway over his no-longer-fractious Christian Democrats. The
opposition Social Democrats are in some disarray. The domestic economy is
faltering, but is not in recession.
Above all, with unification tucked away under his broad belt, Mr Kohl is in
the happy position of having achieved a feat of historic grandeur. Mr Kohl
may not be the world's greatest thinker or orator. But he has already etched
out a lofty place in the annals of German politics.
The widespread perception that he is a success represents, perversely, a
problem. Whatever the strains of harnessing the eastern Lander to the west,
Germany's economic and social fabric is in a far better state than that of
most other European countries. But Germany still faces a series of
post-unity challenges which should be accorded the chancellor's urgent
priority. There is a danger that Mr Kohl, in the 10th year of his
chancellorship, may feel inclined simply to rest on his laurels rather than
to tackle these tasks head on. He should strongly resist the temptation.
German leadership is particularly required in the Gatt talks. Mr Kohl must
follow up his words in favour of free trade with action to encourage a
breakthrough in the Uruguay round - even if it means offending German
farmers and damaging Bonn's ties to Paris. As US politicians made clear in
Munich at the weekend, there is plainly a link between maintaining free
trade and upholding post-Cold war cohesion within Nato.
Trim spending
Another pressing problem is the need to trim public spending in western
Germany to bring down the large fiscal deficits which are a principal cause
of high European interest rates. Two years ago, Mr Kohl failed to put budget
policies on to a sounder footing to finance unity. The current Bonn impasse
over Mr Kohl's plans to increase value added tax next year - blocked by the
Social Democrat majority in the upper house  - threatens the strategy of
controlling the deficit. The chancellor's errors in delaying necessary tax
increases until after the 1990 election are, however, partly responsible for
the mess.
Constitutional reform
More fundamentally, Germany faces the need to reform its constitution. The
1948 Basic Law served the federal republic well during 40 years of division.
It now looks too rigid to meet the obligations and requirements of an
enlarged, united Germany. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, last week
sensibly suggested privatising Telekom, the state telecommunications
company, during the 1990s. First, though, the constitution must be altered
to allow agencies like Telekom or the railways to operate outside the
federal government framework. Similar adjustments are needed to bring
constitutional provisions on asylum law and Bundeswehr deployment outside
Nato into line with practices of Germany's partners and allies.
Mr Kohl has been talking for more than a year about reform to allow
Bundeswehr participation in international peace-keeping. But, highly
regrettably, the chancellor now sounds as though he wants to shelve the
issue until after the 1994 elections. Constitutional amendments need a
two-thirds parliamentary majority, so bruising political tussles with the
Social Democrats are inevitable. But the Basic Law will anyway have to be
changed as part of plans for European monetary union. Mr Kohl should not
duck the opportunity for a wide-ranging debate on all the issues,
His country has reattained nationhood, but not yet found a role. Confusion
about the part Bonn wants to play on the world stage is just one reason for
international irritation over its stance on Croatia and Slovenia. If Mr Kohl
can successfully direct his country towards clearer policies in all these
fields, he will deserve respect and gratitude from those within and outside
Germany. Otherwise, the laurels of unity may start to wilt.

<TEXT>
A shortage of eminent German conductors in their prime is starting to make
itself felt. Major posts across the musical world are filled by conductors
from a wider range of cultural backgrounds, which is entirely beneficial to
the spread of music on offer, while the younger Austro-German may find doors
opening at an earlier point in his career.
On Saturday Claus Peter Flor made his first London appearance as Principal
Guest Conductor of The Philharmonia. With some years of concerts for several
of the capital's orchestras behind him, this was not in fact a catapulting
to fame of the kind that landed Franz Welser-Most his position at the rival
London Philharmonic. Flor has worked patiently towards an appointment. He is
well versed in the German tradition and comes with a solid repertoire base
from which to work.
If all that suggests a certain Teutonic solidity in his general approach,
the musical performances more often than not lean in that direction too.
Flor, now in his mid-30s, learnt his craft in the former East Germany, where
it is likely that the road to the top would have been slow and propelled by
traditional musical virtues.
The choice of programme for Saturday's concert, sponsored by Automotive and
Financial Group, pointed to where the conductor presumably feels his
strengths and sympathies lie. The three works, all Germanic, classical or
early romantic, were just far enough off the concert-goers' beaten track to
suggest an enquiring spirit; but none was of the type where a conductor can
easily show himself off.
The evening opened with Haydn's Symphony No. 6, 'Le Matin', and closed with
Beethoven's Mass in C. The Haydn was done with reduced forces, the Beethoven
by full orchestra and the large Philharmonia Chorus. But both sounded fairly
weighty, the blend of textures middle-heavy, without much desire to get wind
or brass to cut through. Flor's aim is more to secure a good standard of
all-round performance and the Beethoven Mass left one not elated, certainly
not dazzled, but at least with a feeling of quiet satisfaction.
The soloists - Nancy Argenta, Susan Bickley, Philip Langridge and Michael
George - sang as a genuine quartet, rather than four solo voices. The
Philharmonia Chorus had been decently well prepared and was probably glad to
be there at all, given that one of Flor's counterparts in London recently
spurned the services of his orchestra's resident choir and imported a chorus
of his own.
In between Cecile Ousset was the soloist in Mendelssohn's First Piano
Concerto. There is not a lot more than dazzle to this score and Ousset duly
provided the bravado, if without achieving the fearsomely hellish drive of a
Serkin that would make it an occasion to hang on to the edge of the seat.
But then, however well it is played, this concerto is unlikely ever to sound
more than the work of a lesser composer.
*****
Occasionally, a thoroughly dreadful concert such as the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra gave in the same hall the following evening needs to be written
about, even if only in brief. Charitable instincts might prefer to draw a
veil of silence over the performance of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony in the
second half, which ran the work's symphonic argument through a gauntlet of
ill-chosen tempos ill-sustained, and transformed its radiant sound-world
into a nightmare of slack strings, braying brass and sloppy ensemble.
But after all, Sunday's conductor, Yury Temirkanov, is the orchestra's
Principal Guest; and the RPO was once - the period is still in living memory
 -a Bruckner orchestra of noble style and conviction, when the great Rudolf
Kempe was its Music Director. What on earth can have persuaded the players
to submit themselves to so patently absurd and embarrassing display of a
conductor's musical incomprehension? Surely the problem must have become
glaringly evident in rehearsal?
The first half was no better: an invertebrate account (in spite of some
lovely woodwind playing) of L'Apres-midi d'un faune, and an airless,
near-motionless one of Brahms Double Concerto, with Vladimir Spivakov and
Alexander Knyazev the soloists. Temirkanov may be an erratic, show-off
conductor of Russian music, but at least he speaks its language; on this
showing he is liable to reduce Brahms and Bruckner to the musical equivalent
of gibberish.

In the third of its 'Fin de Siecle' conversations, Without Walls asks
whether the cold war has given way to a new conflict between east and west
in which Japan will move to the top of the heap and use the USA as its bread
basket and Europe as its boutique. Some people, such as William Rees-Mogg,
have moved beyond that scenario to worry about the one after, when the
economic capital of the world will be not Tokyo but 'Hong Kong or some other
Chinese city' (9.00 C4). ITV's documentary series Murder Squad (9.00) is
concerned with an explosion at a hairdresser in London's New Cross. That is
followed by the first episode in a new batch of That's Love (9.30) a rather
superior comedy starring Jimmy Mulville and Diana Hardcastle as a middle
class couple dealing with the vicissitudes of marriage in the 90s. Today
Tony Slattery appears for the first time, playing a marriage guidance
counsellor. Viewpoint 92 tells the story of journalist Geoffrey Lean who
went into hospital for a minor operation last year and woke three weeks
later paralysed and unable to speak. He says 'I believe that if my case had
been decided on a cost-benefit basis I wouldn't be here to tell the tale'
(10.40 ITV).

<TEXT>
This year the Hunting/Observer Prize and the Barclays Young Artist Award
again coincide. Each was established in the early 1980s and each is worth a
considerable sum of sponsor's money. And again their coincidence raises many
questions on the nature and value of such things.
The student or young artist has often proved attractive to the sponsor: the
hard time he has of setting himself up in the harsh world, finding a decent
studio, getting a show and all that apparently softens the hardest
commercial heart. The Barclays Award is reserved specifically to the young
artist of the year 'at a crucial stage in his career', to be drawn from
among his peers in the previous summer's final exhibitions at London's
post-graduate schools: only the Slade, Academy Schools, Royal College,
Chelsea and Goldsmiths' need apply.
The work of the final short-list of candidates for the current Barclays
Award is now on show at the Serpentine Gallery (Kensington Gardens W2, until
March 8). There are nine artists in all, of whom all but the winner take an
equal share in Pounds 10,000, while the winner has Pounds 10,000 to himself.
The process, as I understand it, is one not of application but of
invitation, the panel of selectors visiting the shows to make its initial
choice and so winnowing it down by degrees. That there may also be an
element of nomination, or at least discussion with the school itself,
remains unspoken, though the nature of the work that has come through on
recent occasions, given the known catholicity of interest of the panel,
suggests this may well be so.
Now this is to cast no aspersions, nor is there a case to be made for any
cynical exploitation of student or position. And yet it must be said on the
strength of this exhibition, following so hard upon last year's award, the
Serpentine's subsequent Broken English show in the summer and then the whole
Turner Prize farrago of the autumn, that an orthodoxy has emerged and become
established, compounded of the banal, the stylish and the empty.
Here, the Award is saying, is the outstanding young artist of his
generation. Yet why, with so wide a range of work to choose from, is it work
only of a certain kind that is admitted for consideration at this critical
level? We are often told that we live in happily pluralistic times,
post-avant-garde, post-modern. If that means anything in this connection, it
can only be that what is good of its kind across the board has a legitimate
claim on our critical interest, whether it is the severest minimalism or the
most rigorous conceptualism on the one hand or, on the other, the most
beautifully understood and realised still-life.
Is there no figurative work, no work from life or nature or the imagination
being done in these schools? Of course there is, only not to be taken
seriously at this level, let alone considered for the prize. Certainly there
is no whiff of representation in this exhibition, save for the toy-town
Meccano archness of Joanna Lawrance (RA Schools) with her spindly cranes and
trolleys, set out on shelves.
What we get is Andrew Kearney (Chelsea) with his grandiose installation that
fills the entrance gallery, a featureless block some 10 feet high on the
plan of a medieval stronghold, square with rounded turrets at each corner
and clad entirely in corrugated iron sheeting. It is not so much the
self-importance in carrying through such a futile imposition that takes the
breath away, as the thought that he has been so positively encouraged in his
self-importance as to believe its expression significant.
And there is Yinka Shonibare (Goldsmiths'), whose great leap of the creative
imagination has been to take a number of African batik fabrics, as may be
bought at any craft bazaar, mount them on a stretcher and then paint one or
more of the surfaces a flat and even grey. They are nicely stretched and the
paint put on well enough: and again the artist has somehow been persuaded of
the cosmic significance of the simple trick. Oh, but it is a metaphor for
exploitation and appropriation, perhaps; how poignant and politically
correct. But yet the cliche never made the art of itself, or every rhyme of
'moon' with 'June' would produce the greatest poetry.
And here is Gabriel Klasmer (RCA), who has reduced his art to the simple
practice of painting a surface with dark, thick, fat grey paint, and then
modifying the surface by direction, as one may brush with or against the nap
of the cloth on a billiard table. The light catches the surface, which
shifts accordingly, and no matter that Ad Reinhardt was doing the same and
more 40 years ago, to far more point and with far more painterly wit. But
why go on? No prize exhibition can be better than the work submitted or
otherwise eligible.
The Hunting/Observer Prize exhibition, meanwhile, is at the Mall Galleries
(until February 15, then on to Leicester in March). It is worth Pounds
20,000 to the winner, with minor prizes in addition, two of them reserved to
students. I can say little about it critically, being, as one of the judges,
parti pri, but I whole-heartedly support it, both in principal as an
entirely open exhibition and as it stands.
It is predominantly figurative, but not as a policy, for far too little
abstract work was sent in. Similarly, surprisingly few students chose or
were advised to send in, though what we got was very good and Ishbel
Myerscough's double nude outstanding. The main prize went to Dick Lee for
his painting of a wood-pile in a farmyard. Now in his 60s and retired from
Camberwell, where he taught, he is the best painter of landscape now working
in this country.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Arts: Thomas Bernhard - enfant terrible of European theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I despise actors', wrote the dramatist Thomas Bernhard, 'indeed I hate
them, for they ally themselves at the least sign of danger with the audience
and betray the author and completely identify with stupidity and
feeblemindedness . . . they are the true gravediggers of literature. Minetti
is the exception'.
He may have hated them, but since his death in 1989, Bernhard has become the
adored enfant terrible of contemporary European theatre, his cantankerous
eloquence sung out by actors in Vienna, Berlin, Paris. In particular, there
is a small feast of works about the loathed profession. Minetti, inspired by
Bernhard's favourite German actor, 86-year-old Bernard Minetti, opened this
week in a stylish French version by the Nouveau Theatre de Belgique in
Brussels, and recasts Minetti as the quintessential Bernhard type: a
pessimist on the fringe of the establishment, bitter, raging, penalised for
seeing the truth.
This Minetti arrives in a New Year's Eve snowstorm in Ostend and shelters in
a hotel where 30 years ago he met the Belgian artist James Ensor and
commissioned from him a mask of Lear. Now an old actor cast out of Germany,
he dreams of a rendez-vous with a director who will offer him the part of
Lear. While he waits and remembers, fantastical masked figures from the past
swarm on and offstage, whirling him up into a mad carnival.
Henri Rosne, veteran director of seven Bernhard works, is here in his
element, getting to the heart of the play through a particularised Belgian
setting. His phantom revellers are embodiments of James Ensor's paintings,
resembling harlequins from Ensor's 'La Gamme d'Amour'. They come in fur and
satin, stage outfits and dinner suits; a dwarf in pink knickerbockers and
top hat dolefully joins the procession; they burst into Rosne's haute
bourgeois hotel - all mahogany bars and art deco furniture - and dance on
the orderly seafront promenade, breaking up the silence and snow as they
spin round Minetti, now mad, enacting Lear's scene on the heath.
Rosne's set, breathtaking in the sensuous but stifling elegance of every
detail, evokes exactly Bernhard's claustrophobic world view: when Minetti
praises Ostend as a place to 'respirer l'air anglais', you almost feel the
relief of English liberalism wafting across the Channel.
Into this propriety, Rene Hainaux's Minetti spurts blood and thunder, then
dissolves into mockery, spitting consonants and elongating vowels into
nonsense rhymes, swooning off in a jokey drawl ('c'est l'Angleterre que je
prefere: Shakespeare et Scotland Yard'). He hugs the suitcase containing the
mask, symbol of exile and dreams, and suggests at once his own absurdity and
the frenzied love of life that has turned to savage disappointment: a tragic
hero floundering in a 'comedie misanthrope'. It is a deeply touching
portrait of the artist as old man, as madman, as everyman caught between
sanity and insanity, reality and fiction. Bernhard's extraordinary ability
is to distil nihilism into a concrete picture of an individual's meaningless
life, and to make us care desperately about that life.
While the Bernhard of the novels can read like a monster of middle European
gloom, a rich production - this one from Rosne, or Claus Peymann's
Heldenplatz, hit of the German World Drama Festival last summer - is a
shimmer of contrasts: the warmth of character and luxurious precision of
setting versus the uncompromising voice calling out that all this is hollow
and foolish.
At the Vienna Burgtheater, desperation and madness are fixed into the
tangible reality of parochial upper class Vienna in Peymann's production of
Ritter Dene Voss, named after three Burgtheater stars. Voss is Ludwig
Wittgenstein, and Ritter and Dene are his two sisters trapped in a
paralysing relationship with their brilliant/lunatic brother.
Each character is shown as the victim of his own fictions; conversation
shifts between staccato exchanges and a kind of stream-of-consciousness
monologue which each of the family picks up like a madrigal, individual
variations expressing dissonance but the whole symbolising their helpless
unity. Over them hangs the spectre of Ludwig's bullying doctors whose
'establishment' corruption is slowly unveiled.
Peymann's intense, ironic production comes to northern Europe next month; a
French production of the play, Dejeuner avec Ludwig W, is currently enjoying
a successful run in Paris. English theatres have been missing out, but a
translation of three Bernhard plays - the popular Der Theatermacher
(Histrionics), also about an actor, Ritter Dene Voss and A Party for Boris -
is published this week (Quartet, Pounds 19.95). Peter Jansen and Kenneth
Northcott's version is a model of drama in translation; they retain the
musicality and edgy comedy of Bernhard's prose-poetry, and even in reading
the colour and wit underlining the seriousness shine through. Bernhard's
drama, turning nihilism and dissonance into entertainment, is unique in
European theatre: what a pleasure to have at last the chance of an English
production.

FT  11 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Mortgagors can object to costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOMBA HOLDINGS (UK) LTD v MINORIES FINANCE Court of Appeal (The president,
Lord Justice Stocker and Lord Justice Scott): January 30 1992
A MORTGAGOR is entitled to object to allegedly unreasonable non-litigation
costs itemised on a mortgage account submitted to him on redemption; and the
court can order that the costs be quantified by a taxing master, such
quantification ordinarily to be on the contractual basis of taxation.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing part of an appeal by eight
plaintiff mortgagors, Gomba Holdings (UK) and others, from Mr Justice
Vinelott's decision on a preliminary issue, that they were not entitled to
object to allegedly unreasonable items relating to non-litigation costs, in
accounts submitted to them by the defendant mortgagees and receivers,
Minories Finance and others.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT giving the judgment of the court, said that in 1984 and
1985 Minories Finance made substantial advances to the mortgagors under
debentures, guarantees and mortgages.
Demands for repayment were not met and joint receivers of the assets were
appointed.
On March 18 1986 the mortgagors issued an originating summons seeking
accounts of the monies owed, and redemption on payment of monies due. By
February 11 1987 they succeeded in raising sufficient to meet the
liabilities. The receivers were discharged.
There were outstanding disputes as to the accounts. An order for various
accounts and inquiries was made by Master Munrow on March 14 1988.
On June 22 the mortgagors served notice of objection to the accounts
submitted. Their objections included 'unreasonable and/or improper amount'.
The majority of items related to solicitors' or advisers' charges, or
receivers' remuneration. The total challenged was Pounds 1.8m.
On October 13 Master Munrow directed trial of a preliminary issue of certain
questions arising out of the notice of objection, including whether the
mortgagors were entitled to object on the ground that the items were
unreasonable in amount.
Under the mortgage deeds Minories was entitled to 'all costs, charges and
expenses on a full indemnity basis' and the receivers were entitled to
retain their remuneration out of the mortgaged property.
It was clear that 'costs, charges and expenses' included costs, charges and
expenses incidental to litigation, and costs, charges and expenses incurred
otherwise than in connection with litigation.
Mr Justice Vinelott declared inter alia that the mortgagors were not
entitled to object to non-litigation items on the ground that they were
unreasonable.
The mortgagors appealed.
Minories cross-appealed. It sought an order that the mortgagors were not
entitled to object to unreasonable litigation or non-litigation costs,
unless the court had deprived it of the costs.
Order 62 rule 1(4) of the Rules of the Supreme Court provided that
references to costs included 'fees, charges disbursements, expenses and
remuneration', and costs of or incidental to proceedings.
The natural meaning of rule 1(4) was that 'costs' was not confined to
litigation costs.
Order 62 rule 12 (2) provided that on taxation on an indemnity basis 'all
costs shall be allowed except insofar as they are of an unreasonable
amount', and any doubts the taxing officer might have as to whether they
were reasonable 'shall be resolved in favour of the receiving party'.
Both the standard and the indemnity bases of taxation under rule 12 were
based on concepts of reasonableness.
Rule 19 provided that a taxing master had power to tax '(a) the costs
arising out of any proceeding . . . ', and '(c) any other costs the taxation
of which is ordered by the court'.
Paragraph (a) was dealing with litigation costs. Paragraph (c) was dealing
with non-litigation costs.
Rule 24 provided that where the court ordered an account to be taken and the
account consisted in part of costs 'the court may direct a taxing officer to
tax those costs'.
In that rule too, there was nothing that confined 'costs' to litigation
costs.
The principle that a mortgagee was entitled to add to the secured debt his
costs, charges and expenses properly incurred was firmly embedded in the
law.
On the true construction of the mortgage, guarantee and debenture, Minories
was entitled to be paid all its actual costs, charges and expenses including
the receivers' remuneration, except insofar as they were of unreasonable
amount or had been unreasonably incurred, any doubt as to reasonableness
being resolved in favour of Minories.
The Rules of the Supreme Court provided machinery for quantification. They
provided in particular for accounts to be taken and inquiries to be made.
And they provided for costs to be taxed by the taxing masters.
Mr Potts for Minories submitted that non-litigation costs were not subject
to taxation and could only be quantified by the taking of an account with or
without supplementary enquiries. Mr Cullen for the mortgagors accepted that
that was correct. The view seemed to have been shared by the judge.
The proposition that non-litigation costs could not be subjected to a
process of taxation to quantify the recoverable amount was unsound in
principle and on authority.
'Taxation' was no more than the name given to the quantification process
whereby the amount of recoverable costs and disbursements was ascertained. A
special cadre of judicial officers, the taxing masters, had been established
to carry out that process.
Order 62 rule 19 authorised taxing masters to tax (a) costs of proceedings,
and (b) any other costs the taxation of which was ordered by the court.
'Costs ' included 'fees, charges disbursements, expenses and remuneration'.
Rule 24 enabled a Chancery Master taking an account to request a taxing
master to tax any items of 'costs' comprised in the accounts.
The effect of those provisions was that if an account contained items of
litigation or non-litigation costs, they could be referred to a taxing
master for taxation, ie for him to decide what amount was recoverable. He
must be told on what basis he was to conduct the taxation.
On the basis of the authorities also, litigation costs and non-litigation
costs could be referred for quantification to a taxing master (see Allen v
Jarvis (1869) 4 Ch App 616; National Provincial Bank of England v Games 31
Ch 582; Adelphi Hotel(Brighton) (1953) 1 WLR 955).
Minories was contractually entitled to recover costs on an indemnity basis.
Its contractual entitlement corresponded with the indemnity basis of
taxation set out in Order 62 rule 12(2).
Prima facie the basis of taxation of a mortagagee's costs should correspond
with his contractual entitlement under the mortgage deed.
Nevertheless, in relation to 'costs of and incidental to' civil proceedings
in the Court of Appeal and High Court, the court had a statutory discretion
(see section 51(1) Supreme Court Act 1981).
Orders for payment of costs to be taxed on standard basis had already been
made in the action. The court needed to decide what, if any, residual rights
Minories could claim.
The discretion should ordinarily be exercised to reflect the contractual
right (see Seavision Investment v Evenett, October 18 1991, CA). A mortgagee
was not to be deprived of a contractual or equitable right merely by reason
of an order made without reference to his contractual or equitable right and
without adjudication as to whether he should be deprived of those costs.
That opinion accorded with that of Mr Justice Vinelott.
The court did not agree with Mr Justice Vinelott that a complaint about the
fixing of the receivers' remuneration at an unreasonably high level could
only be pursued in a separate action. A separate action was not necessary.
The mortgagors were entitled to object to items on the ground that they were
unreasonable in amount, but any doubts were to be resolved in favour of
Minories. The master had power to direct that costs be taxed by a taxing
officer on an indemnity basis.
Indemnity costs were not to be disallowed on the ground that standard costs
had already been ordered, unless the court intended to deprive Minories of
those costs.
To the extent indicated the appeal and cross-appeal were allowed.
For the mortgagors:

FT  11 FEB 92 / Management: False dawn for single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than half of Britain's small business owners and managers remain
unprepared for the full effects of the Single European Market, according to
a survey* carried out by the Small Business Research Trust.
Forty-four per cent believe they will not be affected by the completion of
the single market, scheduled for December 31, while a further 11 per cent
have not considered their position, the survey showed.
Despite this continuing high level of unpreparedness, there has been a large
increase in the number of owner-managers who have begun to prepare for
change to 45 per cent compared with only 23 per cent in early 1990. Smaller
companies, employing fewer than 10 people, appear to be most oblivious to
the likely impact of the removal of trading barriers in Europe.
Forty-three per cent of companies said their business was too local to be
affected while 11 per cent did not believe that their industry would be
affected. Ten per cent said they lacked enough information about
developments while a further 10 per cent preferred to 'wait and see'.
Small manufacturers of finished consumer or industrial goods and providers
of consultancy or professional services were the most likely to have made
preparations. This frequently took the form of seeking agents or
distributors overseas or reviewing their business plans.
Small business owners had increased their preparations, but only in the west
Midlands had a majority of owners been actively preparing for the single
market. Businesses in the north of England were most likely to see the
single market as a threat while those in southern England were the most
optimistic.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Management: Unravelling the big risks in small print -
Charles Batchelor offers tenants a word of warning / Commercial leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years after moving out of a small office it had leased in West London,
Abercrombie &amp; Kent, a tour operator and travel agent, found itself faced
with a demand from the landlord for the payment of back rent.
This was not rent that Abercrombie had failed to pay but money owing from
the tenant to which Abercrombie had assigned the lease after it moved out.
Under British commercial property law, landlords can force long-departed
tenants to make good unpaid rent owed by a more recent occupier.
'The first time we knew there was a problem was when we got a letter from
the landlord's solicitor saying we were the original tenant, there was
outstanding rent due and they looked forward to receiving our remittance,'
says Bob Winder, finance controller.
After several months of negotiations, Abercrombie succeeded in getting the
rent demand reduced from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 30,000. Abercrombie, which
has turnover of Pounds 22m, was able to absorb the cost - some smaller
companies have gone under - but it was still 'a blow on the chin we could
have done without', says Winder.
Abercrombie &amp; Kent is just one of a growing number of companies to fall
victim to legislation which many in the property and legal professions
believe to be unfairly weighted against the tenant. Even though landlords
have the right to vet any new tenant to which a departing occupant wishes to
assign his lease, they accept no responsibility if the new tenant
subsequently cannot pay.
During the boom years of the 1980s, landlords had no difficulty finding new
tenants. In the current recession, many tenants are going bust leaving
unpaid rent bills and triggering clauses which allow landlords to seek
redress from previous tenants.
'The recession has made this into a hot issue,' says Robert Lee, commercial
property partner at solicitors Davies Arnold Cooper. 'When tenants go bust,
landlords are forced to look elsewhere for their money.'
The rigidity of the British commercial property market, with 25-year leases
the norm, means that it is not unknown for companies to be pursued for rents
10 or 15 years after they have quit premises. Over these lengthy periods,
the rent may have increased many times.
One company was paying Pounds 355,000 a year in rent when it left an office
block in central London. When problems arose with a subsequent tenant a few
years later, it faced a demand for unpaid rent of nearly Pounds 800,000 a
year.
In many countries, lease periods are far shorter and there is no obligation
to take on the liabilities of subsequent tenants, says Theresa Grant
Peterkin, a partner in solicitors Withers.
In France, leases are usually for nine years with 'breaks' at three-year
intervals while in the US, five-year leases are common.
The unfairness of the present system has long been recognised and a Law
Commission report of 1988 suggested legislation to redress the balance. The
government has so far taken no action although the Lord Chancellor's
Department says it is looking closely at the report and will take it forward
when other commitments permit.
Under current legislation there is not even an obligation on the landlord to
warn previous occupants that the present tenant is not paying rent and bills
are building up. 'There is no limit on how long the landlord leaves it,'
says Grant Peterkin.
No matter where a business comes in the chain of tenants who have occupied a
property, it may find itself the target of a claim from the landlord. David
and Adrienne Jackson held the lease on a shop in Reading from which they ran
a business printing motifs on sportswear and leisurewear.
The Jacksons were the fourth tenants to lease the shop and two more followed
before the most recent tenant ran into problems. Six years after assigning
the lease to another long-departed tenant, the Jacksons say they now face a
demand for Pounds 17,500 in unpaid rent.
'A lot of people don't even know these clauses exist in their leases,' says
Adrienne Jackson. The Jacksons have already spent Pounds 3,000 on legal
fees.
But it is not just small companies which are affected and which might be
forgiven for failing to read the small print of their lease agreements. Many
large retail groups are also concerned at the present state of the law.
Dixons, the electrical company; Oliver Group, a large footwear retailer; and
W H Smith have all worked with Davies Arnold Cooper on a review of leasehold
law.
So what can tenants do to reduce their exposure? Property specialists
suggest:
When signing a new lease or when preparing to assign an existing lease to a
new tenant, negotiate to remove or reduce your liability for rent once you
have left the premises. It will be more difficult to win the landlord's
agreement if you have an existing lease, but if the new tenant is a very
solid company or is prepared to give guarantees or a pay a deposit, this may
persuade him. 'Before the recession you did not stand a chance but it is
easier to negotiate now,' says Grant Peterkin.
Insist on a short-term lease or on a lease with 'break' clauses which would
free you from further liability.
Instead of assigning the lease, grant an underlease to the new tenant. You
remain in control of the lease and know immediately if your sub-tenant has
problems in paying his rent. 'This does not solve the problem but it
mitigates it,' says Grant Peterkin. Granting an underlease does mean,
however, that you must become involved in dealing with the sub-tenant.
Insure yourself against liability for unpaid rents. Insurance cover for
'assignor's consequential loss' has become more popular recently, says
Malcolm Jamieson of Credit and Guarantee Insurance. Premiums vary between
0.1 and 5 per cent of the sum insured, depending on the soundness of the
business to which you assign your lease.
Maintain a contingent liability in your accounts for the term of any lease
you have held.
As part of its submissions to the Law Commission review, the Confederation
of British Industry (CBI) argued for tenants to be released from liability
10 years after the assignment of a lease, or immediately if there was an
increase in the rent because the building had been improved or its use
changed.
The CBI also called for an immediate release if rent was outstanding for
more than one month without the landlord starting court action to recover
it.
If there is to be a shift in the law towards a better deal for tenants, then
action needs to be taken quickly. Tenants are only now able to negotiate
better leasehold terms because landlords are desperate to let their
properties. Once the upturn comes, tenants will once again be dependent on
the law to bolster their negotiating position.

Ever optimistic, the management buy-out community is forecasting an upturn

parallels with the buy-out scene in the early to mid-1980s but the
priorities for deal-making have changed, say accountants Ernst &amp; Young
(E&amp;Y).
To help managers contemplating a buy-out, E&amp;Y has published a new handbook,

FT  11 FEB 92 / Technology: Early viewing of the finished work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All the best innovations in modern manufacturing can be found in the UK
somewhere. The trouble is that they are not happening as frequently as they
should be.
Round the corner from Gloucester's renovated wharfside is mainland Britain's
only rapid prototyping bureau. Formation Engineering Services will convert
an engineering drawing or 2D Cad (computer-aided design) file into a 3D file
and then, through stereolithography, produce a 'hard copy' in hours or days
that would have taken weeks or even months by conventional methods such as
pattern-making.
Last week some 280 engineers from British manufacturing in the south-west
and the Midlands had a chance to view the process. The visit was part of a
two-day workshop on rapid prototyping, sponsored by the Department of Trade
and Industry South-West, supported by the Institute of Directors and
organised by the Computer Graphics Suppliers Management Association.
For Doug Ponsford of DTI South-West, the aim of the Cheltenham workshop was
simple. 'What I want to do is wake people up, by saying 'Here it is, please
have a look.' This could have more effect on British industry than anything
I have seen in a decade.'
Rapid prototyping is important because, like Cad, it promises to be a key
element in the spread of concurrent or simultaneous engineering,
complementing the interdisciplinary teamwork method of accelerating product
development times.
Design engineers are used to working in 2D but their customers, in-house or
otherwise, usually need to see and hold the real thing to check whether it
fits their requirements. If it's wrong, a revised version can be produced
through rapid prototyping with little time wasted, and potential tooling
expenses saved.
There are about 300 rapid prototyping machines in the world, all but a
handful produced by 3D Systems of California. Two other less established
systems were also represented at Cheltenham: the Solider 'instant slice
curing' process from Israeli-US manufacturer Cubital, and laminated object
manufacturing from Helisys of California.
The systems share one basic principle - conversion of a 3D Cad file into an
STL (stereolithographic) file which reduces the design to thousands of
layers.
There are just six or seven of 3D's machines in the UK, but Ponsford says
there is no reason for Britain's manufacturers to hold back just because the
rapid prototyping industry is in its infancy. 'If big companies are scared,
they can get their feet wet by using a bureau.'
The systems cost from about Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 400,000, and prices are
falling. Even so, the expense will be too much for some of the smaller
companies which attended the workshop. Keith Howell, product manager at
Umak, the Birmingham-based agency for Helisys, said 90 per cent of inquiries
at the workshop concerned bureau use - a UK bureau for Helisys will be open
by the end of May.
One of the handful of UK companies with in-house rapid prototyping is Rover.
Graham Tromans, principal engineer for stereolithography, recalls turning an
STL file of a thermostat housing into a prototype within a day - after
leaving the 3D machine on overnight. Conventional prototype development had
already taken eight months, with a further nine weeks forecast.
Big companies, clearly, can get their money back fast. Roger Holden,
applications engineer at Sherbrook Automotive, Lichfield-based agents for
Cubital, says its machine will pay for itself in a year if 500 prototypes
are produced.
The three producers argue fiercely about the relative merits of their
systems. None is perfect, and each has its strong points. But at least they
all agreed that, simply by explaining what rapid prototyping is, the
workshop worked.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Technology: Technically Speaking: A hole in one for CFCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one can see an 'ozone hole'. The sky looks the same whether or not ozone
is present in the upper atmosphere. But scientific evidence released last
week showed that man-made chemicals are destroying the protective ozone
layer far more quickly than even the pessimists had feared a year ago.
Natural chemicals thrown many miles high by the exceptionally violent
eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines last June have accelerated the
ozone destruction. But these cannot obscure the fact that the main culprits
are synthetic chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which have built up in the
atmosphere after decades of use in the world's refrigerators, aerosol cans,
cleaning fluids and insulating foams.
The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that a sustained loss of
even 10 per cent of the ozone layer would cause 300,000 extra skin cancers
and 1.75m eye cataracts per year worldwide. Additional ultraviolet radiation
could also suppress the human immune system and exacerbate diseases such as
Aids.
At least a human being can escape solar radiation by going indoors. The
impact of ozone depletion on plants and animals that spend their whole lives
in the open air could be still more serious. Both wildlife and agriculture
are vulnerable.
In the face of such a threat, the governments of the world must accelerate
further the timetable for phasing out CFCs (and related chemicals called
halons) which was agreed originally as the Montreal Protocol in 1987 and
revised in 1990. The present schedule calls for CFC production to stop by
2000, but the EC has already set 1997 as the deadline and Du Pont, the
largest CFC manufacturer, says it will not sell the chemicals in developed
countries after 1996.
Although the next ministerial meeting of the Montreal Protocol is not due
until next November, Greenpeace, the environmental group, argues that the
latest evidence justifies holding an emergency session to ban CFC production
immediately. The chemicals industry responds that this would not be
practical, since substitutes are not yet available for many applications,
particularly in refrigeration.
However, a ban taking effect in 1994 might represent a reasonable compromise
between urgent action and the need to leave users enough time to make
alternative arrangements. An early halt to CFC production must be
accompanied by more active incentives for industry to extract and purify the
'bank' of CFCs trapped in existing products, so that these can be re-used
rather than discharged to the atmosphere.
At the same time it is essential for all parties in the debate - chemical
manufacturers, users, governments and environmentalists - to reach some sort
of agreement about what is an acceptable substitute for CFCs. Uncertainty
about this issue is holding up investment in alternatives and making it
likely that some users will face a serious crisis when CFC supplies run out.
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), technically the best substitute for many
CFC refrigerants, are not acceptable because they also contain chlorine and
could exacerbate ozone destruction.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are another matter. They pose no threat to the
ozone layer but environmentalists oppose them because they are powerful
'greenhouse gases'. However, used as refrigerants on a limited scale, their
contribution to global warming would be much less than that of carbon
dioxide released by burning fossil fuels. HFCs should be welcomed if their
commercialisation makes it possible to phase out CFCs more quickly and allow
nature to start repairing the ozone hole.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Technology: Lost in space - The competitive nature of the
satellite launch market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conditions were perfect for the launch. The rocket boosters ignited, and
executives of General Dynamics, the launcher manufacturer, cheered and
slapped backs as the distant glow was followed by a gathering roar.
The US's second largest defence group had more than the Dollars 150m (Pounds
83m) cost of the satellite launch to worry about. General Dynamics'
commercial programme has been beset by problems culminating in the abortive
launch of a Japanese TV satellite in April. A second failure would be a blow
to a company fighting for share in an increasingly competitive market.
Despite problems 15 minutes into the launch, the satellite is now in orbit.
Each successful launch - on this occasion of a satellite for the European
operator, Eutelsat - reinforces the launchers' credibility in a market where
reliability is a principal component. Failures are as spectacular as they
are costly and the US has been rebuilding its launch operations since its
expensive, and ultimately tragic, decision to re-use the Challenger launch
vehicle, which exploded in 1986.
Spurring the US effort has been the decline in orders from Washington for
government and military satellites, which have been the bulk suppliers to
domestic launchers General Dynamics, Martin Marietta and McDonnell Douglas.
All have been eyeing the Dollars 2bn-a-year commercial market with
increasing interest. So too have the fledgling commercial satellite nations
China and Russia, with Japan also declaring a limited interest.
The leader, with about 60 per cent of the commercial market, is Arianespace.
It is owned by the French authorities and a consortium of 11 European
countries. However, as the American record on reliability and safety has
been restored over the last five years, its challenge has grown.
Ramin Khadem, finance and administrative manager for Inmarsat, which has
just invited bids for launching its new series of communications satellites,
says: 'The reliability of the launch vehicle and the track record of the
launcher have always been of the utmost importance. But with the US and the
Europeans both having good performances, the issue of price is now becoming
the focus.'
Price is a contentious subject among the launchers. Charles Bigot, chairman
of Arianespace, says: 'General Dynamics continues to reduce its prices and
we feel that it is not normal. If you compare the GD price for the
Intelsat-2 launch two years ago, today they are quoting prices 25 per cent
less. It is like dumping. We do not think that it is good for the market to
reduce prices without proper commercial reason.'
Bigot claims financial aid from Washington underpins the GD policy. 'US
government orders mean they can subsidise their commercial launches.' This
would not be so bad, says Bigot, if Arianespace were allowed to bid for US
government satellites.
But Jack Isabel, GD information manager, cites a Dollars 400m capital
programme as evidence of GD's independent financial commitment. He, in turn,
accuses Arianespace of having a head-start. 'They have the advantage over us
in that all their non-recurring costs are paid for by the European Space
Agency.'
The pricing dispute and access to the US market are now the subject of
discussion at ministerial level between the EC, France, Germany and
Washington. They are also debating a common policy towards China and Russia,
which are making desperate bids to gain market access.
One leading satellite operator who recently invited bids for a 1994 launch
said that Russia offered to launch for around half the cost of Arianespace,
while China had come in at about a third of that price. Moreover, Roy
Gibson, head of the British Space Centre, says that China offered to launch
a new series of British mini-satellites for nothing in order to gain
experience.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the US is presently refusing to allow either
country entry to the market, citing the Cocom rules on the export of high
technology to the former eastern bloc and Communist countries as the reason.
It is, however, looking increasingly friendly towards allowing a Russian
launch.
'We do not regard the threat from Russia and China as serious,' says Bigot.
'You want to be able to launch a satellite safely, reliably, on time and at
the right price. Can they achieve these criteria? I do not think so. The
Chinese will offer any price. With the Russians it is more difficult to say:
who knows what their capability will be in, say, 1995? But, I still do not
think they are a serious threat, mainly because they do not know enough.'
Meanwhile, both Arianespace and GD are developing new launch vehicles and
trimming costs. GD has four commercial launches confirmed for this year and
hopes to announce others shortly. It also has 32 government orders over the
next five years.
Arianespace expects to launch nine rockets during 1992 carrying between 10
and 12 satellites, following on from the eight launched in 1991. From this,
Arianespace expects to show a net profit in 1991 slightly higher than 1990's
FFr135.4m (Pounds 13.85m) on turnover of FFr5.8bn. The consortium had orders
to launch a further 21 satellites, worth FFr10bn on its books.
Whether such a healthy state of affairs will continue remains to be seen. On
the plus side, demand for satellite launches is rising with developing
nations seeking to enter the operating market. Recently, Arianespace signed
a contract with Thailand and is negotiating launches with Malaysia and South
Korea.
However, the biggest smile seems to be on the face of the operators. Khadem
says: 'We very much welcome new suppliers in the launch market. The launch
vehicle is a big element in our costs, and if new competition helps drive
down costs that can only be good for our customers.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (New in Brief): SNP hits back at
Labour on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIERCE dispute over the economic impact of Scottish independence
continued unabated yesterday as nationalist MPs hit back at Labour's claims
that a nationalist government would run up a Pounds 7bn deficit in its first
year, Ivo Dawnay writes.
In a party political broadcast last night, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Scottish
National party MP for Moray, said Labour's offer of a devolved Scottish
parliament was simply a 'prospectus for continued poverty and economic
stagnation'.
Her claim reflected widespread anger among nationalists that Labour has
adopted 'smear' tactics on the cost of independence. They claim these
directly parallel the Tories' allegations that a Labour government would
bring in big rises in taxes and spending.
Countering the charge, Mrs Ewing said a devolved assembly would have no
powers over North Sea oil revenues, set to rise to Pounds 5bn in 1997, and
no powers to make Pounds 1.5bn savings by scrapping the Trident nuclear
programme.
*****
BR COMPENSATION: The government would be reluctant to tolerate increases in
the sums paid by British Rail in compensation once the new passengers'
charter comes into effect, Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, suggested
yesterday.
The government had 'no plans to be associated with' any scheme that would
involve significant costs, he said. The 'sensible' way of improving service
would be to create performance targets which BR would strive to meet.
BR paid between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m in compensation last year, Mr
Freeman said. His remarks followed a claim by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours,
Labour MP for Workington, that BR would probably have to find Pounds 40m for
compensation payments.
*****
OIL RIG SAFETY: Early legislation to protect workers on North sea oil rigs
who complain about the inadequacy of safety arrangements from victimisation
by their employers was demanded from both sides of the Commons last night.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, promised to consider if the
objective could be achieved by amending a private member's bill sponsored by
Baroness Turner of Camden, a Labour peer, which is due for second reading in
the Lords tomorrow.

FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: SFO under fire as Cramer is
acquitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TIRED but exultant Mr Guy Cramer said yesterday the Serious Fraud Office
had failed to produce any evidence to show that he knew of the fraud at
Barlow Clowes, and had based its case against him on 'guilt by association'.
Posing for photographers with a bottle of champagne shortly after he was
acquitted of one charge of conspiracy and six of theft, the former chief
executive of Barlow Clowes' parent company James Ferguson Holdings declared:
'There is not one single piece of paper, nothing, absolutely no shred of
evidence that I had any knowledge the funds used by Mr Clowes improperly
were in fact clients' funds.
'The prosecution have run this case on a guilt-by-association basis.'
Mr Derek Duffy, his solicitor, said he was 'disappointed' at the Serious
Fraud Office's handling of the case.
'Had the SFO considered all the issues before it, considered all the
documents, then these proceedings would never have taken place and the four
years that have gone by and the suffering that Mr Cramer and his family have
gone through need not have occurred.'
He suggested the SFO might have felt compelled by the publicity surrounding
its investigation of Barlow Clowes to mount as many prosecutions as
possible.
'We were always very anxious that the jury should take an impartial view and
see who had and had not been involved in the mismanagement,' Mr Duffy said.
The fact that the jury had acquitted two people, he said, was a vindication
of the jury system as 'a powerful force for justice'.
Regarding Mr Peter Clowes, convicted on 18 out of 19 counts, Mr Cramer would
say only that the jury had reached the 'right decision'.
Mr Clowes' image, he said, had always been one of 'extreme wealth and great
integrity'.
'Clearly that has been proved wrong now,' he added.
Mr Cramer said he would be attending a small celebratory lunch, and then a
'short holiday abroad might not be unreasonable'.
He then planned to spend some time rebuilding his family life with his wife
and two young children before trying to relaunch his business career.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Potterton Myson to close boiler factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTTERTON Myson, part of Blue Circle Industries, yesterday announced the
closure of its domestic boiler factory at Birtley, Co Durham, with the loss
of 302 jobs.
The company, which hopes to redeploy about 10 per cent of the Birtley
workforce, said output would be transferred to the factory's sister plants
at Padiham, Lancashire, and Warwick.
Acquisition of Myson Group in late 1989 had given Potterton Myson more
manufacturing capacity than was needed to meet expected demand. That was the
main reason for the Birtley closure, the company said.
Mr Peter Taylor, director and general manager at Birtley, said: 'If it
didn't happen now I fear we would die by starvation.' He added that the
plant was essentially an assembly operation lacking core technology, whereas
Warwick and Padiham manufactured the heat exchangers used in the company's
gas central-heating boilers. 'Today if you want to invest you have to invest
in your core technology,' he added.
Mr Taylor declined to disclose how much the recession's impact on
housebuilding had hit demand for Birtley's boilers. But he said it had
depressed the market considerably.
The AEU engineering workers' union, which represents most of the workforce,
said it was monitoring the situation.
'The employees have been devastated by the news and are in a state of
bewilderment,' said Mr Davey Hall, Tyne district secretary.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Unit trust body backs down on retail regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNIT Trust Association has reversed its position on retail regulation in
a revised paper submitted to the Securities and Investments Board. The move
is a result of pressure from its life assurance company members.
Five of the trade association's largest life assurance members resigned
after it submitted a paper to SIB which criticised life assurance sales
practices in unusually harsh terms. The five members contribute 10 per cent
of the associations's revenues.
In its most significant reversal, the new paper from the association no
longer offers unequivocal support for the SIB proposal on 'depolarisation',
which would have allowed unit trusts to be sold through more outlets than
are presently available for life assurance products. Instead, the paper now
simply says that while some members support the concept, others are opposed
to it.
Sales of all products are currently polarised - that is, they must be sold
either through tied or direct agents selling the products of a single
company, or through independent financial advisers selling the products of
many suppliers. The association had argued that as charges relating to the
sales of unit trusts are easily visible to prospective buyers, unlike those
of life products, the consumer protection afforded by polarisation was
unnecessary.
The paper also climbed down on SIB proposals to require tougher disclosure
rules in the sale of life products. The life assurance industry has been
fighting many of these proposals, arguing that to give too much information
to consumers would confuse many of them.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Recommendations of the Public-Sector Pay Review Bodies:
Award 'greater than contemplated' - Teachers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSTANTIAL pay rise for teachers has been on the cards since Mr John
Major appointed an independent review body to assess their pay shortly after
becoming prime minister. It was a calculated attempt to raise teachers'
morale - and with it the Tories' flagging support in the public sector.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, admitted yesterday that the 7.5 per
cent award to the 420,000 teachers in England and Wales was 'greater than
the government had contemplated'. But ministers had pledged to honour the
review body's findings in full, and with the rise due to take effect on
April 1 - a week before the most likely election date - staggering its
implementation was not an option.
The rise takes the low on the teachers' scale from Pounds 10,404 to Pounds
11,184, and the top point from Pounds 17,523 to Pounds 18,837 plus
allowances. A good honours graduate will start on at least Pounds 12,300 -
Pounds 14,200 in inner London. The top of the head-teachers' scale - for
heads of large secondary schools - rises from Pounds 46,680 to Pounds
50,181.
Primary teachers do best in the settlement. An additional 26,000 incentive
allowances - more than one extra per school - will be available from
September, worth between Pounds 1,296 and Pounds 4,000 each. By then, more
than half of all teachers will be receiving an allowance.
Incentive allowances are to be payable not only for special responsibility
but for 'excellent classroom performance'. That apart, the review body,
chaired by Sir Graham Day, chairman of British Aerospace, has refused to
rush the creation of a full-blown performance-pay regime for teachers.
However, with one in three teachers leaving the profession in their first
five years, the review body said it was 'concerned to avert complacency on
teacher quality', and it intends to work up a performance-pay scheme for
introduction in 1993-94.
The settlement will add 7.8 per cent to the teachers' pay bill, which local
authorities will have to meet. The government announced yesterday that it
would provide local government with an extra Pounds 60m to bridge the gap
between the pay settlement and the government's 7.2 per cent allowance for
extra education spending in the 1992-93 rate-support grant settlement.
However, local authority leaders claimed that the 7.2 per cent allowed only
for only 3.7 per cent of extra spending, once last year's pay award and
demographic trends are accounted for. Most authorities - which have to set
budgets before the end of this month. - have allowed only between 5 and 6
per cent in their provisional spending plans.
Some county councils will make up the shortfall from reserves. But with
average county council reserves projected at only 3.3 per cent of budgeted
spending for the next financial year, many will be forced to seek savings
elsewhere.
The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities claimed
yesterday that the 'funding gap' amounted to Pounds 300m, and predicted cuts
in teacher numbers and school budgets.
Even with the pay rise, the review body concluded that 'teacher shortages
are more likely than surpluses' in the next few years, and that high wastage
rates were likely to result in 'serious teacher shortages in some areas.'
School Teachers' Review Body, HMSO. Pounds 8.20.

   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury has admitted that its forecasting techniques have failed to
take into account the effect of the depression in the housing market on the
the recession, Peter Marsh writes.
The admission has taken the form of a series of changes to the mathematical
equations in the Treasury's computer model of how the economy functions. The
model acts as a base for the department's economic forecasts.
Mr Brian Pearce, chief economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, a
forecasting group, said the new equations could indicate that the Treasury
was considering changes to fiscal policy in the Budget. One possibility
could be to raise the Pounds 30,000 ceiling on mortgage relief.
The Treasury said the changes were technical and 'not significant'.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL HUNDRED more troops were on their way to Northern Ireland yesterday,
bringing the Army presence there to its highest level since 1979.
About 500 soldiers from 2 Battalion The Queen's Regiment were ordered to the
province in response to calls for stronger security to deal with the upsurge
in sectarian killings.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, will discuss Northern Ireland's security
with nationalist and Unionist leaders today after one of the most violent
months since the early 1970s.
Two other extra units were deployed in Northern Ireland last month - an
infantry battalion and a field artillery regiment sent to refurbish
permanent checkpoints.
These were in addition to the 10 battalions, totalling 10,800 soldiers,
which have formed a more or less constant Army presence for more than five
years. The total now stands at about 12,300. There are also about 6,100
soldiers of the locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment, half of whom are
part-time.
Army officers said that the deployments were meant to be 'very short-term'
but the troops would remain as long as they were required.
The prime minister hopes his meeting with local leaders will encourage
political co-operation in the province. But officials made clear yesterday
that it was an opportunity for him to listen, rather than an effort to start
formal 'round-table' negotiations.
He is expected to ask the leaders to encourage greater co-operation between
the community and security forces and to express the abhorrence of most
people in the province to violence. The government has sought to avoid
increasing permanent troop levels.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said the authorities wanted to
show they were 'actually prepared to do the things they need to do'.

FT  11 FEB 92 / BBC makes offer on copyright fees ahead of tribunal ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC has made publishers a new offer on copyright payments several weeks
before the Copyright Tribunal is due to rule on the issue.
The move by BBC Enterprises came last month following the tribunal hearing
which opened on November 12 and ended on December 20. A decision is not
expected before the end of this month.
Copyright fees became controversial last year after deregulation of the
television listings market. The government decided to end what Mr Douglas
Hurd, then home secretary, called the 'dotty duopoly' of Radio Times and TV
Times. All programme listings had henceforth to be provided to publishers in
return for a copyright fee.
The Newspaper Publishers' Association, which represents national newspapers;
the Newspaper Society, representing regional newspapers; Time Out, the
London listings magazine; Hello, the national magazine; and the Surrey
Advertiser group, representing the interests of weekly newspapers,
complained to the tribunal that the fees were too high.
Mr Tony Elliott, publisher of Time Out, and a long-time opponent of the
listings duopoly said yesterday he was 'amazed' that BBC Enterprises,
publisher of Radio Times, should have offered a deal before the tribunal
decision was known.
Mr Elliott said he believed the 'without-prejudice' offer went first to the
Newspaper Society and was later sent to the other parties.
The offer is believed to involved considerable reductions in the present
rate card.
Mr John Mellon, chairman of IPC Magazines, publisher of TV Times and What's
on TV, yesterday also expressed surprise that the BBC should have made an
offer when it did.
IPC, which owns copyright in ITV programmes until the end of this year, said
that it will await the tribunal's verdict and does not intend to make any
offers to publishers.
It is believed that Newspaper Society lawyers have been in contact with BBC
lawyers since the without prejudice offer was received but it is not clear
if there is any chance of an agreement.
The BBC action is being interpreted by publishing groups as a sign that the
corporation may be taking a pessimistic view of the outcome of the Copyright
Tribunal hearings.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Europe risks high air fares and poor choice, CAA warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FARES in Europe could rise and consumer choice diminish unless there is
a coherent policy on airline mergers and acquisitions, Mr Christopher
Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, warned yesterday.
In his first important policy statement since becoming CAA chairman eight
months ago, Mr Chataway said that without a vigorous European policy on
mergers and competition there was 'every prospect that fares will rise and
consumer choice will shrink as the little competition that exists today is
further diminished'.
His warning coincides with an acceleration of the restructuring of the
European airline industry. British Airways is in advanced negotiations about
linking with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, while this year Air France expects to
complete a strategic partnership with Sabena of Belgium which will include
the French carrier taking a significant stake in Sabena.
While Mr Chataway does not want to prevent large European airlines from
expanding their businesses to compete against large US and Asian airlines,
he also wants a safeguard for smaller carriers and new entrants into the
market which can stimulate competition and lower fares.
He added that it was important for European air transport and consumers that
a merger policy was formulated before the process of airline consolidation
led Europe's airline to be confined to a few so-called megacarriers.
Conditions should be attached to mergers between two national flag carriers
to safeguard the position and prospects of smaller airlines, he continued.
These would include the surrender to another carrier of landing times or of
main routes where there would be otherwise little or no competition.
Carriers would also be required to dispose of shareholdings in smaller
airlines which are actual or potential competitors.
Mr Chataway is also worried about the competence of existing European
Community institutions to introduce a strong airline policy. 'The relevant
institutions of the Community seem ill-equipped for the task,' he said.
The EC's competition directorate would require considerable strengthening,
he continued, suggesting that an independent agency should be set up to take
decisions purely on competition grounds.
The EC Commission would have the power to overrule the new agency but would
have to explain its reasons. The agency could be the equivalent of a
European version of Britain's Mergers and Monopolies Commission or Germany's
Cartel Office.

FT  11 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Japan rethinks lifting of rice ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government, having come close to lifting a ban on rice imports,
is recalculating the domestic and international political costs of rice
market reforms.
A poor performance by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) at a weekend
by-election has left party leaders nervous about the impact of market
liberalisation before an upper house election scheduled for July.
Last month, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, suggested that
allowing rice imports would not necessarily damage farm incomes, a comment
generally interpreted as meaning that the political damage could also be
limited.
However, Mr Miyazawa has now retreated into ambiguity, proposing no more
than that Japan should 'examine' replacing the ban with a tariff regime.
The rice issue has, in part, been a contest between the Foreign Ministry,
which wants to safeguard Japan's international reputation, and the
Agriculture Ministry, representing farmers' interests.
Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, has urged the government to
announce liberalisation before the March 1 deadline for food trade
submissions in the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
But agriculture ministry officials privately argue that there remains little
likelihood of a broad agreement on agriculture, and Japan would be foolish
to make an unnecessary concession.
Publicly, the ministry opposes an opening on the grounds of 'food security',
and because imports would lead to fewer paddy fields and, perhaps, increased
flooding in rural areas. It also suggests that rice has a 'spiritual'
importance for Japanese and should be exempt from the Gatt negotiations.
Factional heads of the LDP informally agreed more than a year ago that the
rice market would be opened. Aware that a decision has been taken in
principle, farmers' leaders have encouraged protests in the belief that the
ultimate announcement will be accompanied by compensation for farmers, and
the larger the fuss, the larger the payout.
LDP leaders are hoping to limit the foreign share of Japan's 10m tonne rice
market to between 3 and 5 per cent, and Mr Watanabe believes that this could
be achieved by replacing the ban with a 700 per cent tariff on imported
rice.
In spite of the issue's sensitivity, imports are likely to have far less
impact on Japanese farmers than the government's own crop reduction
measures.
