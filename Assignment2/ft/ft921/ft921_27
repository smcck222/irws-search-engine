HUNGARY has become the first east European country to be entirely freed from
restrictions on imports of high technology goods from the west under the
Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom), the US
government officially confirmed yesterday, writes Nicholas Denton from
Budapest.
The relaxation of western controls is subject only to Budapest implementing
further safeguards for transferred technology, which is understood to be a
formality.
The decision on Hungary was taken in Paris last week by the Cocom group of
western countries. Cocom was designed to prevent technology with military
uses leaking to the former Soviet bloc, but its purpose has disintegrated
along with its target.
A lifting of restrictions on Czechoslovakia and Poland is expected to
follow.
The tangible impact in Hungary will be to allow the armed forces to purchase
western military equipment.
However, defence ministry officials said the procurement budget was too
tight for western defence firms to hold out much hope in the short term.
Most western high technology exports to Hungary were liberalised in 1990 and
1991. Digital telephone switching equipment was removed from the list of
restricted goods in 1990, allowing Hungary to begin to close a technology
gap estimated at 10 years and embark on vital modernisation.

FT  11 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Italy to boost Algerian gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROJECT aimed at virtually doubling gas exports from Algeria to Italy, has
been given the go-ahead with the approval by Sace, Italy's export credit
guarantee agency, of credits worth Dollars 127m (Pounds 70m), writes Francis
Ghiles.
Delayed for months because of political uncertainty in Algeria, the approval
of the first tranche of finance for the project means work can begin on the
Trans-Med gas pipeline, to run from Algeria to Italy.
The decision follows last week's visit to Rome by Algeria's foreign
minister, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, and confirms that for Italy - Algeria's
largest natural gas customer - it is back to business as usual.
The total cost of the project, which will increase the volume of natural gas
exported to Italy from an annual figure of 14.2bn cu ft to 25bn cu ft, is
estimated at Dollars 5.8bn.
The pipeline will link Mazara del Vallo in Sicily to the distribution point
near Bologna. Italy's state electricity company, Enel, will buy 6bn cu ft of
the extra gas for the fast-growing electricity generation sector.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S air force yesterday formally transferred control of its Condor
II missile project to a new civilian space agency, following US demands that
it stop developing the missile for military purposes, writes John Barham in
Buenos Aires.
Mr Rosendo Fraga, a military affairs specialist, said the move meant the
Condor was no longer a secret military project, and the technology would
fall under international safeguards.
The project was initiated in 1983 in collaboration with Egypt, and financed
indirectly by Iraq with support from German companies. Argentina developed a
propulsion system and in 1988 began work on a guidance mechanism.
In 1990 Argentine President Carlos Menem promised the US that the Condor
project would be cancelled. Washington repeatedly pressed him to destroy the
missile.
The air force is handing over control a week before Mr Dick Cheney, US
defence secretary, makes a two-day visit.
Western governments fear the dispersal of Argentine technology and
scientists could accelerate weapons proliferation. The US has made known its
concern over the planned sale by Argentina to Iran of Dollars 18m (Pounds
9.9m) worth of machine tools for work in the nuclear industry.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Mexican farm laws face radical reform: Millions of farmers
will win right to own private property
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S Congress is to go into an extraordinary session tomorrow to vote on
radical changes to the nation's agricultural laws and pension fund system.
The overhaul of the antiquated agricultural sector is considered one of the
key reforms proposed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari since he came to
office in December 1988, and is likely to have far-reaching political and
economic consequences.
The new laws will give Mexico's 3m ejidatarios (communal farmers) the right
to become private property owners, if two-thirds of the ejido votes in
favour; to form joint ventures with private businessmen; and to use their
land as collateral for loans.
Private property owners will be able to form joint stock companies, thereby
partly skirting the constitutional limits on the size of farms and helping
them raise money in the capital markets.
The ejidos, set up after the country's revolution of 1910-20, now occupy
about half Mexico's agricultural land. All Mexicans have the theoretical
right under the constitution to farm the land under the ejido system and
many would-be farmers are already protesting at the changes.
The government has also proposed sweeping changes to the pension fund system
which will have a substantial impact on Mexico's capital markets.
Employers will have to put 2 per cent of the salary of each worker into a
personal pension fund, and another 5 per cent into a personal housing fund.
Workers can draw down their fund when retired, unemployed or buying a house.
The fund managers, selected by employers, will be banks, and the money will
be invested in government bonds.
These will offer a real return of between 2 and 6 per cent a year. The fund
will run alongside the existing system.
Mexico's monthly inflation reached 1.8 per cent in January, against 2.4 per
cent a month earlier.
The January figure, although the lowest in 17 years, is steeper than
expected and too high if the government is to reach its year-end target of
9.7 per cent.

FT  11 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Unctad sees hope for world's poorest
states
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic outlook for the world's poorest countries is tinged with hope,
even optimism, after years of gloom, according to the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad).
In its latest annual report on the least developed countries (LDCs)
published today, Unctad says the positive outlook reflects the relatively
high growth rates achieved by some LDCs in recent years and, 'above all',
the changed international political and economic climate.
The prospects for the settlement of many long-standing wars and conflicts -
affecting one in four LDCs since 1990 - are much brighter today, Unctad
notes. The resulting peace dividend 'will come in the form of a redirection
of national efforts and resources away from military pursuits, the removal
of the burden of hundreds of thousands of refugees on neighbouring
countries, the repatriation of flight capital and skills, and improved
conditions for agricultural production.'
Other hopeful signs include widespread political reform and democratisation
movements, and major changes in domestic economic policies to support viable
long-term growth.
The report looks at the economic performance during the 1980s of 42 of the
47 countries classified by the UN as least-developed (with a per capita
income of Dollars 600 (Pounds 330) in 1987). Eleven managed to boost per
capita GDP by at least 10 per cent, with overall GDP increasing by nearly 6
per cent a year in 1980-89, while six others registered positive but slower
growth.
However, LDCs suffered from the world economic slowdown in 1990 and 1991,
with negative or negligible per capita GDP growth. In Africa, real GDP
growth turned negative in 1990, after a sharp fall in agricultural
production.
In addition, Unctad notes, several LDCs such as Samoa and Bangladesh have
recently been struck by natural disasters. Man-made disasters have proved
equally devastating. In Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Liberia and Somalia,
development has been halted by civil strife. Only 13 of the LDCs enjoyed
basic peace and stability throughout the 1980s. LDCs are also home to almost
80 per cent of the world's 17m refugees, with the biggest concentration in
the Horn of Africa.
The report calls on the industrialised world to boost aid flows to the
poorest countries, to do more on debt relief and to give LDCs preferential
trade treatment.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Bush health care plans trouble insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's plan to reform the US health care system is creating
concern among what should be his most fervent supporters: health insurance
companies.
Insurers have welcomed the broad outlines of the president's scheme, which
would retain private insurance as the basic financing mechanism for US
health care. But they are anxious over some details of the proposals, which
could affect the way they conduct business.
The Bush plan aims to help most of the 35m Americans who currently have no
health insurance by giving them tax credits. But the plan would also prevent
companies which sell group health insurance plans from refusing to cover any
employer group or employee on the basis of their health status.
In addition, the plan would restrict insurers' ability to vary the premiums
they charge in line with their claims experience. In the longer term, the
plan proposes setting up health risk pools in each state to compensate
insurers who agree to cover individuals with poor health.
The administration claims these and other insurance market reforms could
allow businesses with fewer than 20 employees to save at least 10.9 per cent
on health coverage for their employees.
Some insurers worry, however, that this could turn into a state-administered
welfare scheme - in fact, the kind of 'socialised' system that Mr Bush
complains would result from the alternative proposals of the Democratic
opposition.
Insurers say that now about 3 per cent of the population could be defined as
uninsurable on the basis of their past health problems. This percentage
could grow, they warn, if companies are not allowed to attach waiting
periods or other conditions to their coverage.
However, Mr Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, a Washington-based trade association, has welcomed the broad
outlines of the Bush proposals.
'We agree with the president that only a strengthened private/public health
insurance partnership can deliver the health care Americans need, at a price
they can afford to pay, while retaining the cutting-edge quality they have
grown to expect,' he said.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Japanese voters turn up the heat on Miyazawa: Prime minister
comes under growing pressure to restore party's image, or resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S RULING Liberal Democratic party faces its most serious political
difficulties since losing two prime ministers in the space of a few weeks at
the height of the 1989 Recruit bribery affair.
The party's failure on Sunday to win a by-election in Nara, a long-time LDP
stronghold in western Japan, has highlighted voters' anger at the LDP's
recent performance, particularly its involvement in a new spate of financial
scandals. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who took office only last
October, is under growing pressure to restore the party's tarnished image -
or resign.
Mr Miyazawa's immediate challenge is to break a deadlock in the Diet over
the passage of the government budget bill for 1992-93 by the end of March.
Opposition parties are demanding that aspects of the recent financial
scandals should be examined first.
While each side is primarily engaged in securing domestic political
advantage, the impasse has international implications: The weaker Mr
Miyazawa becomes, the more difficult it will be for the government to secure
parliamentary approval for controversial plans to send Japanese servicemen
on United Nations peace-keeping missions or for the possible liberalisation
of the rice market - a key issue at the Uruguay Round trade talks.
As Mr Masayuki Fukuoka, a political commentator, says: 'Mr Miyazawa's
position is getting more difficult because he has shown no leadership either
in the Diet or in this election.'
Even though the LDP had been braced for defeat in Sunday's poll in Nara, the
verdict came as a shock. The contest was for a seat in the upper house, left
vacant by the death of the incumbent, a member of Rengo Sangiin, the
political arm of Rengo, Japan's trade union confederation. He had won his
seat only in 1989 the unusual circumstances of the Recruit affair - before
that for more than 30 years the seat had been held by LDP-inclined
conservatives and the LDP had hoped to win it back.
The result showed that even in Nara, the ancient capital of Japan, modern
concerns about political ethics are arousing strong passions among voters.
Mr Yukihisa Yoshida, the winning candidate, also from Rengo Sangiin, ran on
an anti-corruption platform. He secured 244,930 votes, against 178,002 for
the LDP's candidate. LDP officials in Tokyo pledged after the result to
renew efforts at political reform.
Three scandals are now at the centre of voters' minds. First, the Kyowa
affair, in which Kyowa, a steel framemaker and property company, allegedly
bribed Mr Fumio Abe, a former minister, with Y80m (Pounds 360,000) in return
for leaked planning information. Mr Abe was, until his resignaMr Miyazawa.
Other Miyazawa supporters are also known to have accepted money in the form
of political donations from Kyowa.
Next, the opposition parties are trying to revive interest in Mr Miyazawa's
own role in the Recruit scandal. Recruit, a recruitment company, distributed
cut-price shares to a large number of influential people, including Mr
Miyazawa. Mr Miyazawa, who was finance minister when the scandal erupted in
1988, resigned from his post. The opposition parties want to embarrass him
and the LDP further by raking over the coals.
Finally, there is the Sagawa Kyubin affair, still bubbling just below the
surface but likely to explode any day into a full-scale scandal. At the
centre is Sagawa Kyubin, a road transport company, which is under
investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's office for alleged
links with gangsters and illegal financial transactions.
The prosecutor's office is examining the role of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the
group's biggest subsidiary, in Y530bn worth of allegedly questionable
transactions. Tokyo Sagawa apparently acted as an intermediary between banks
and 84 borrowers, individuals and corporations - sometimes guaranteeing
borrowings on behalf of the ultimate borrowers and sometimes diverting funds
meant for its own use.
While this is not illegal in itself, there is considerable suspicion about
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin's motives. The public prosecutor's office has alleged
that some Y100bn of the funds were diverted to yakuza or gangster groups.
Chief among them was Inagawakai, Japan's second largest criminal
organisation, which was led until his death last year by Mr Susumu Ishii, a
boss known for his commercial acumen.
The public prosecutor's office also believes that companies in the Sagawa
Kyubin group made donations to politicians. Such donations are legal if they
are properly accounted for and if nothing was done in return for the money.
But Sagawa Kyubin's donations are thought to total billions of yen - a
figure which many Japanese regard as suspiciously large.
The trouble for Mr Miyazawa is that even if he survives the attacks over the
scandal, the party has already lost much of the credibility it regained in
the years 1989-91, under the leadership of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, Mr Miyazawa's
predecessor. Mr Kaifu failed in his most important goal - political reform -
but he managed to create a clean political aura which the voters welcomed.
The damage done should be kept in perspective. The LDP's lock on the Diet's
lower house, where most power resides, remains unchallenged. Lower house
elections are dominated by an MP's personal standing in a constituency.
National issues, even scandals, are usually of secondary concern.
But the LDP lost its majority in the upper house in 1989. It also faces the
prospect of losing further ground in a by-election next month and in an
election due in July to half the seats in the upper house.
Legally, the LDP can use its lower house majority to force most kinds of
legislation through the upper house. But under Japanese political
conventions, the ruling party rarely behaves in this way. Instead it seeks
compromises with the opposition. These compromises will now be even more
difficult to achieve.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Israel's growth stalls as more are out of work: Immigration
drive may be harmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TREND of rising output and employment in Israel has stalled since late
last year with worrying implications for the country's uphill struggle to
absorb mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union, according to
the Manufacturers' Association.
Surveys of employment in 1991 and the performance expectations of industrial
companies suggest that public sector expansion and a now flagging
construction boom were mainly responsible for GDP growth of 5.2 per cent
last year.
Since the last quarter, the domestic boom has slowed, with little sign of
the export-led industrial expansion that economists say is needed for enough
long-term growth to cope with immigration.
'Until now we have not produced enough jobs and we have not produced them in
the right places,' Mr Chezi Gutman, head of the Manufacturers Association's
economics and foreign trade division, said yesterday. 'We still have the
same problems of one or two years ago. Exports are the solution but what
happened in the industrialised world did not help us to produce the exports
and the right jobs.'
The arrival of some 400,000 immigrants in the last two years, the vast
majority from former Soviet territories, has pushed unemployment above 10
per cent, which in turn is blamed for a recent slump in new immigrant
arrivals.
Although a reduced influx would give the economy a chance to catch up, that
is politically unacceptable given Israel's commitment to encourage all Jews
to immigrate - hence the government's anxiety to win Dollars 10bn (Pounds
5.5bn) in US loan guarantees to help generate investment and job creation.
Manufacturers' Association figures show that 69,000 jobs were created in the
first nine months of 1991, compared with 34,000 in all of 1990. But more
than 30,000 were in the public sector - mainly in health, welfare and
education - and more than 18,000 were in construction where a
government-fuelled building surge is now declining. Industry accounted for
14,000.
The association's latest survey of 133 industrial companies revealed that
marginally more experienced a decline in domestic orders rather than a rise
over the last months of 1991. About 37 per cent expected a fall in sales in
the current quarter, compared with 34 per cent forecasting an increase. More
companies predicted workforce cuts than those expecting to employ more.
Mr Gutman said he expected domestic industrial growth of more than 8 per
cent last year to be halved in 1992. A brighter outlook emerged for exports,
which he said could grow by up to 4 per cent after a decline in 1991. But
that is still well short of the government target of double-digit export
growth needed to cope with the import costs and employment demands of
immigration.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's controversial decision last year to block a
Franco-Italian takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer,
was 'completely wrong', Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry and internal
market commissioner, said yesterday.
Mr Bangemann - who last October clashed with Sir Leon Brittan, the
competition commissioner, over the case - also launched an impassioned
assault on competition 'ayatollahs', who rule on merger cases without taking
into account economic reality.
His attack was not directed at Sir Leon himself, but at the 'gurus' who
staff national and Community merger control authorities. He singled out
Germany's cartel office for particular criticism.
'What I'm angry about is that there are some academics, mostly lawyers by
profession, who have no idea of the reality of economic life. They are the
experts who are taking the competition decisions, which is complete
madness,' Mr Bangemann said.
Mr Bangemann's comments could reignite the smouldering debate over EC
competition and industrial policy. In Strasbourg today, commissioners are
set to agree a new Community budget, including provisions to retarget some
existing EC funds to help struggling industries.
Competition advocates suspect such moves may result in funds being channeled
'vertically' to individual sectors, such as cars or electronics, contrary to
EC policy.
Mr Bangemann said yesterday that the Community should persist with its
free-market industrial policy, but he added: 'A horizontal approach does not
mean you can't take up a definite example (for EC funding).'
The blocking of the De Havilland takeover was vociferously attacked by both
Italian and French governments at the time and Mr Bangemann still disputes
Sir Leon's recommendation. He said yesterday: 'I have had to defend it (the
decision) as a collegiate (Commission) decision and I've done that, but now
I can say it was completely wrong, as has already been seen.'
Sir Leon argued in October that the market for turboprop planes like those
made by De Havilland was completely separate from the market for jets, but
Mr Bangemann said yesterday that Lufthansa, the German airline, had recently
decided to buy 50-seater jets to compete against turboprop aircraft on
commuter routes.
Mr Bangemann made an attempt to dilute Sir Leon's influence over merger
control inquiries last year. But that dispute appeared to have been defused
last week when the Commission renewed Sir Leon's mandate to handle the
internal decisions on such inquiries jointly with Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president.
Separately, Mr Bangemann urged member states to continue their efforts to
bring down internal EC border controls before the end of the year. He warned
that Brussels would speed up legal action to punish member states which
maintained controls in breach of EC obligations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERICH MIELKE, the 84-year-old head of the former Stasi, East Germany's
feared security police, yesterday became the most senior member of the
Communist leadership to be placed on trial.
He was charged with murdering two policemen in 1931 as a young Communist
seeking revenge for the murder of a Party member. Only later is Mr Mielke to
be tried for crimes he allegedly committed against east Germans - including
an order to shoot would-be escapees to the West - after becoming Stasi chief
in 1956.
Mr Mielke, hunched under a brown leather hat and clutching a cane, was
carried on a chair into the Berlin courtroom where he proclaimed that he was
'feeling rotten.' He has been held for nearly two years in a hospital cell
of an adjoining prison.
Mr Hubert Dreyling, his lawyer, demanded that the trial be called off
because he claimed that the crimes happened too long ago and that
prosecutors' evidence was inadmissible and sometimes forged.
The defence also argued that the evidence relied on the Nazi regime's 1934
trial of Mr Mielke's party accomplices, many of whom were tortured by the SS
militia or Gestapo security police.
Mr Mielke and a colleague were subsequently found guilty of first degree
murder but fled to the Soviet Union.
As Minister of State Security, a post he held for 33 years, he hid the
investigation findings and a 1934 order for his arrest at his home, where
they were found on his arrest.
The court proceedings were interrupted at one point when a young man leapt
to his feet and cried out that the trial was 'pure fascism.' He was ejected
from the courtroom. Outside, members of leftist groups protested against the
trial.
The Berlin state prosecution, however, believes it has its strongest case in
the 1931 killings.

<TEXT>
MR Karol Lutkowski, Poland's finance minister, will be under pressure today
from spending ministries in the new centre-right government led by Mr Jan
Olszewski.
The outcome will be a big test of the prime minister's ability to restrain
government spending and raise new taxes. Mr Lutkowski, a 52-year-old
academic, is an advocate of stringent monetary policies in a government
largely formed by critics of the International Monetary Fund-backed
stabilisation policies run by his predecessor, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz.
'There is a conviction abroad that Keynesian methods of reinvigorating the
economy are now appropriate,' he said in an interview.
Mr Lutkowski was an adviser in the Finance Ministry under Mr Balcerowicz and
over the last two years has taken part in the IMF talks. His appointment was
meant to signify that no radical break with past financial policy was
feasible.
This is partly because last year's agreement with the Paris Club of official
creditors. The accord lead to an end to over 50 per cent of Poland's Dollars
33bn (Pounds 18bn) official debt but is linked to compliance with the IMF
performance criteria attached to a Dollars 2.5bn loan facility granted last
April.
The IMF suspended disbursements after the first tranche because the Finance
Ministry overshot several key criteria, including the budget deficit.
Mr Michael Deppler, deputy IMF head in Europe was in Warsaw last week for
consultations. The government was reminded it needed an agreement with the
Fund if it is to restructure its overall Dollars 46.5bn external debt - one
third owed to western banks.
With this in mind Mr Lutkowski said he wanted to halve this year's inflation
rate from around 70 per cent in 1991, and contain the budget deficit at
around Zl 60,000bn (Pounds 2.92bn) or 4.5 per cent of GDP.

IN DEFIANCE of mounting pressure from Serbia, Mr Milan Babic, the president
of Krajina, yesterday summoned the parliament of the Serb enclave in Croatia
to consider a referendum on the UN plan to despatch 10,000 peace-keepers,
reports Laura Silber from Knin.
As deputies in Knin, the capital of Krajina, assembled yesterday, Mr Babic
accused the federal army of blocking roads to prevent them from reaching the
parliament.
Mr Babic has consistently opposed the UN plan, pitting him against Serbian
president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his former patron. Mr Babic objects to the
plan, saying it lacks sufficient guarantees for the region's 250,000 Serbs.
Krajina's Serbs in August 1990 began their uprising against Croatia, fearing
their fate in an independent Croatian state.
Serbia claims the UN plan has full support, ignoring the objections of
Krajina's leaders. But the UN has never before deployed peace-keepers to a
country unless all sides have agreed to their despatch.
The UN is expected today to despatch an additional 25 unarmed liaison
officers.

<TEXT>
GERMANY and France clashed over monetary policy yesterday at the first
meeting of Community finance ministers since the Bundesbank pushed up
interest rates in December.
Germany's EC partners all expressed their frustration with Bonn, but France
was the most openly critical.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's finance minister, complained that Bonn was not
paying enough heed to domestic factors, such as fiscal and wage
indiscipline, that affected Bundesbank money rates and thus all other EC
economies.
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in Bonn's finance ministry, hit back,
arguing that Bonn had to pick up the bill for unifying the country, yet at
the same it could not intervene in such private sector pay deals as the
recent award of more than 6 per cent to the steelworkers.
'I find it somewhat strange that there should be so much more talk about a
half percentage point rise in interest rates (the Bundesbank's discount
increase in December), and so little about the Uruguay Round negotiations of
the Gatt trade talks,' retorted Mr Kohler.
Bonn believes Paris is preventing any breakthrough on farm subsidies, German
officials said.
Behind Mr Beregovoy's comments lie an irritation that France has disciplined
itself - bringing inflation down to an estimated rate of 3 per cent this
year compared to 4.25 per cent across the Rhine - and would be well poised
for recovery, but for having to match German interest rates.
However, most other EC ministers seemed resigned to accepting that Germany
had had no alternative.
The Commission's latest annual report, approved by ministers yesterday,
paints a picture of the EC only gradually pulling out of recession with
average 2.25 per cent growth this year, not fast enough to prevent
unemployment rising to 9 per cent.
This is just half the current jobless rate in Ireland, whose turn it was
yesterday to come under the 'convergence spotlight.' Ireland was commended
for combining 'a catching up process with the successful pursuit of monetary
stability.'

FT  11 FEB 92 / MEPs likely to back plan to ban tobacco advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Parliament is expected to back a European Commission plan to
ban all tobacco advertising, except at the point of sale, when it votes on
the draft directive in Strasbourg today.
However, the measure is likely to encounter serious opposition at the next
meeting of EC health ministers in May. Ministers from a blocking minority of
member states, including the UK and Germany, have already voiced their
objections to the directive.
Parliament's vote on the issue was delayed for procedural reasons following
a full debate in Strasbourg last month. Some MEPs argued successfully that
the legal basis of the legislation should be re-examined. Parliament's legal
affairs committee has since decided that Brussels was right to put forward
the directive as a single market measure which only requires approval from a
weighted majority of member states.
Nearly 30 amendments have been tabled, including proposals to change the
legal basis of the directive and to overturn the legislation altogether.
There is still a possibility that that the directive might be talked off the
parliamentary agenda.
The Commission's plan seems sure of approval by MEPs in spite of heavy
lobbying by tobacco companies.
In the UK, the Tobacco Advisory Council at the weekend launched another
national advertising campaign opposing the EC proposals.
It said the campaign focuses on 'Brussels' intransigence' in pursuing the
ban in spite of a lack of evidence to support claims that it would reduce
smoking. Mr Christopher Bullock, the TAC's director of public affairs, said:
Brussels has simply ignored the facts  .. preferring instead to listen to
the special pleading of the anti-smoking lobby.'
The European Commission is considering separate proposals for co-ordinating
its legislation on advertising through a single department.
Advertisers and agencies have objected that disparate measures - including
those on tobacco and comparative advertising - have emerged recently from
different parts of the Brussels bureaucracy, without consultation.
Mr Martin Bangemann, internal market commissioner, said yesterday that he
intended to produce a Commission paper on advertising and the single market
which would try to resolve the problem. '(The current proposals on
advertising) are too dotted about - they deal with single topics but aren't
based on general considerations,' he said. 'That's why we must have real
European legislation with a systematic structure.'

A workman died and at least three others suffered multiple injuries
yesterday after an explosion and fire at Grangemouth docks on the Firth of
Forth in eastern Scotland. Police feared there could be more casualties.
The explosion, at 5.05pm, appears to have occurred during the filling of a
BP oil storage tank under construction at the dockyard. Eyewitnesses said
there was a loud bang and they saw flames shoot into the air.
BP Chemicals said: 'There was some protective sheeting being used in the
construction work and there has been a fire in that sheeting.'
The fire was still burning two hours after the explosion. Thick smoke
covered the Grangemouth area and was drifting across the estuary to Fife.
Police advised people to stay indoors.
Grangemouth docks are close to a large BP chemical complex, but the company
said it was not affected.

on earnings for year

<TEXT>
ITALCABLE, the Italian state-owned company which operates most of the
country's international telephone services, has struck a cautious note about
net profits for 1991, despite a 13 per cent rise in traffic last year.
The caution stems from last year's 20 per cent cut in international phone
charges which, according to analysts, will bite into earnings for the year.
At the interim stage in 1991, Ital-cable's turnover fell 1 per cent to
L341bn (Dollars 290.4m), despite a 12 per cent traffic increase. Pre-tax
earnings dropped 9.3 per cent to L136bn.
In a letter to shareholders, the company said turnover had remained at 'a
good level', despite the tariff cut and would allow the payment of an
'adequate' dividend.
Financial revenues from treasury operations rose by around 16 per cent last
year.
Stet, the Italian public-sector concern which controls the state's
telecommunications interests, is loosening its hold on SIP, the main
telephone utility, in a further partial privatisation.
Stet's stake in SIP's savings shares will fall from 53.6 per cent at present
to 33.1 per cent under the terms of a L400bn convertible Eurobond to be
issued this month.
Precise details of the issue, which will carry warrants convertible into SIP
savings shares, have not been released. However, the exercise price for the
warrants will be set between 104 per cent and 110 per cent of the average
price for SIP savings shares in the five days before the issue.
The deal, which will lower Stet's overall share of SIP's capital to 53.5 per
cent from 58.4 per cent at present, follows a Dollars 275m international
equity offering of savings shares in Stet itself last June.
Once all associated warrants are exercised, that transaction would reduce to
around 30 per cent the stake in Stet's savings shares owned by the IRI state
holding company.

THE secretary of Sweden's opposition Social Democratic party offered his
resignation yesterday after a group of newspapers controlled by the party
filed for bankruptcy, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
Mr Bo Toresson, party secretary since 1983 and a board member of the
A-Pressen group, told a news conference he had offered to resign as a result
of the crash. His offer will be reviewed on Thursday by the party's board.
Party leader Ingvar Carlsson said the Social Democrats, who ruled Sweden for
most of six decades up to last year, would restructure most of its
newspapers in a new group and inject SKr 100m (Dollars 17.5m) in capital.
But Mr Carlsson said the party could not afford to assume financial
responsibility for three of the group's newspapers, including the flagship
Arbetet - a morning paper based in the southern town of Malmo.
'This is a very difficult and painful measure for the party. We lose
ownership of three important newspaper companies and there is a risk that
these papers will cease publication,' he said.

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION Macedonia to a Greek official and his expression becomes stern.
Strong words follow about how the breakaway Yugoslav republic should choose
a new name, like 'Slavomacedonia' or 'Western Macedonia', in order to avoid
offending Greek sensibilities.
Nationalist fervour is sweeping Greece with an intensity that seems out of
place in a European Community member-state which claims to be an
enthusiastic supporter of European union. Left and right sound equally
passionate. A former socialist minister declared: 'We must make clear their
use of the Greek name Macedonia amounts to a casus belli for our country.'
Last week, deposed King Constantine, who lives in Britain, hinted in a
television interview that Greece should not rule out acquiring a piece of
the Macedonian republic by force.
The ruling conservatives stop short of making inflammatory remarks in
public. Still, they were held responsible for an unexpected ban last month
on a press conference to present a report on ethnic minorities in Greece -
among them the 40,000 Slavomacedonians who live close to the border with
Macedonia.
'The country has been seized with hysteria over the Macedonian issue. It's
unfortunate because the Greek position can only lead to isolation,' says
Professor Nikiforos Diamandouros, a political scientist at Athens University
and a member of an Athens human rights group which organised the press
conference.
The Greek argument is that the name Macedonia, chosen by Tito when he carved
the republic out of Serbia in 1944, implies a territorial claim on the Greek
province of Macedonia. According to Mr Antonis Samaras, the Greek foreign
minister, Greece will not recognise the republic unless it changes its name,
and gives guarantees it has no territorial ambitions and will refrain from
propaganda attacks against Greek interests.
So far only Bulgaria and Turkey have recognised Macedonia, but other
European countries are expected to do so before much longer. Popular
resentment over Macedonia reflects a deep-seated feeling among Greeks that
their Slavic neighbours have usurped a heritage associated with Alexander
the Great, the Macedonian king whose conquests 2,300 years ago established
Greek dynasties as far away as Persia and Afghanistan.
However, Greek bankers and businessmen are becoming increasingly annoyed
with the furore over Macedonia. About 100 Greek companies are involved in
joint ventures there, mostly producing clothing for export. Owners are
worried that their cross-border investments may collapse if a compromise is
not found soon.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Volcker may be guru to save rouble: The band of consultants
in Moscow is growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the heart of government headquarters to smart western-style hotels,
Moscow is swarming with foreign consultants and gurus telling the republic
how to proceed to a market economy.
Likely to join them is Mr Paul Volcker, the former (two-term) chairman of
the US Federal Reserve Board, who is considering an offer to serve as a
part-time adviser to the Russian government on economic and banking reform.
Mr Volcker now divides his time between teaching at Princeton's Woodrow
Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and serving as chairman of
James Wolfensohn, a New York investment bank.
The areas on which Mr Volcker might provide advice include the banking
system, currency arrangements between the various republics of the
Commonwealth of Independent States and Moscow's relations with the
International Monetary Fund.
Mr Volcker would work alongside other advisers to the Russian governments.
At the top of the pile, three professors - Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, Anders
Aslund of Stockholm, and Richard Layard of the London School of Economics -
are publicly advising the Russian government on a 'shock transition' to a
market economy.
They have even joined in Russian political battles, accusing Mr Georgy
Matiukhin, the chairman of the Russian central bank, of destabilising
government reform with a lax credit policy.
Funded by western foundations, the trio have also led calls for massive
financial aid from the west.
Behind the scenes, the IMF, with its unrivalled experience of economic
reform around the globe, is providing advice of a more discreet kind. But it
is coming under increasing pressure to lead from the front, not least to cut
through the chaos within the former Soviet Union and the differences among
western governments on how to help.
'The Russians say they are in the hands of Jeffrey Sachs because they do not
know what the IMF is recommending,' said one western diplomat.
'Meanwhile western countries are each doing their own thing in their own
corner. The Fund should play a co-ordinating role,' the diplomat added.
The IMF counters that it cannot put its prestige on the line by getting
involved in internal Russian politics. Besides it says that the government,
led by deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar, is perfectly aware of what the
IMF wants it to do. 'It is just not possible to do it all overnight,'
explained Mr Sergei Alexashenko, an independent economist who has contacts
with both the government and its foreign advisers.
Still the tremendous difficulty of switching to a market economy after 74
years of communism leaves the door open for any outsider who offers decisive
advice and attractive solutions.
Hence the arrival in Moscow last month of a new consultant to the
government, Mr Jude Wanniski, a former editorial writer at the Wall Street
Journal.
Mr Wanniski is proposing that the Russian government issue long-term bonds
which would be backed by reserves of natural resources such as gold, oil,
gas and other assets.
The bonds, which would be issued in lieu of interest payments to foreign
creditors and in tandem with a new currency, are seen as a way of salvaging
the savings of ordinary Russians, while giving Russia breathing space to
restructure the economy.
He is vociferously opposed to the recommendations of Prof Sachs, saying they
will topple the government, cripple the economy, and give priority to
foreign creditors at the nations expense.
Another outside plan has been put forward by Mr George Soros, the private
benefactor of eastern European reform, who wants the west to finance a
payment union enabling republics to trade with each other even if they
switch to separate currencies.
The proposal is due to be discussed by Russia, Ukraine and other republics
at a meeting brokered by the European Commission in Brussels next week.
At the lower end of the scale, consultants funded under western 'technical
assistance' programmes are advising officials and enterprises on various
areas of micro-economic reform.
The danger is different from that at the top. It is about how former Soviet
republics can avoid receiving 'soft advice for hard currency' as private
consultancies rush to cash in on what is sometimes seen as just a gravy
train.
The problem of selecting consultants with proven competence and expertise
may become particularly acute as the European Commission begins to assign
contracts this year for its Ecu400m (Dollars 516m) technical assistance
programme.
Another concern is that the assistance should be well targeted.
Apart from pushing British companies' 'expertise' on privatisation, a
Russian-British seminar in January ranged from kindly generalisations ('Keep
a steady course and don't lose heart,' advised Mr Edward Leigh, a junior
minister from the Department of Trade and Industry) to over-sophisticated
advice on public share flotations.
The Russian officials attending the seminar had not even begun a crucial
first stage of privatising small shops and the trade sector, so it was not
surprising that what many of them really wanted from their trip to Moscow
were long-promised government instructions on how privatisation was to be
carried out.
But a heartening contrast was provided by a simultaneous privatisation
seminar which was co-sponsored by the World Bank in another part of Moscow.
Its purpose was to train representatives from several former Soviet
republics to form their own privatisation experts and agencies.
The advice was practical, drew on concrete experience, and was designed to
help republics help themselves
Foreign Speakers included the likes of Mr Marco Simoneti, from Slovenia's
privatisation agency.
He urged participants to decide clearly what they wanted from their western
advisers, and also gave timely advice on how to side-step old-style
communist politicians when running a privatisation agency.
The need for purely practical assistance was also emphasised in a recent
interview by Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation chief, who expressed
gratitude for an abundance of foreign advice.
However, he added that what he really needed now were computers,
photocopiers and fax machines to help agencies round the country carry out
privatisation.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE first sign of what could become a spring of discontent, unions
representing Portugal's 300,000 public sector workers have called a one-day
strike for next Tuesday to press for higher wages after the breakdown of
tripartite negotiations with the government and employers.
The Social Democratic administration of the prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco
Silva, is determined to bring inflation - currently above 11 per cent on an
annual average - and the budget deficit down. This is part of an ambitious
plan for economic convergence with the European Community in preparation for
Economic and Monetary Union. But the government's budget cuts and efforts to
keep public sector wages in check, combined with a decision last month to
raise value added tax on basic goods and services, are meeting increasing
opposition.
The strike call follows last week's unilateral announcement by the
government that it will raise public sector pay by 8 per cent, in line with
its inflation forecast for this year. The unions say this target is
unrealistic and that the government's offer is penalising public sector
workers, the majority of whom earn an average of Esc80,000-Esc90,000
(Dollars 580- Dollars 650) a month. They want a double digit rise, and argue
that the government's announcement was unconstitutional as negotiations had
not been completed.
Last month, several thousand public employees demonstrated outside the
headquarters for Portugal's EC presidency, and the unions promise more
protests. However, the government is intent on pushing through what it
considers are necessary if unpopular decisions in the early part of its new
mandate, having won an absolute majority in last October's election.

THE prospects of Europe launching a satellite television news channel
designed to rival Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network have increased.
A launch date has been set for January 1 1993 for Euronews and the first
tranche of finance has been agreed.
The European Community has said it will contribute Ecu3m (Dollars 3.87m) to
the project and a matching amount has been promised by the governments of
France, Italy, Spain and the French speaking community of Belgium.
The aim is to broadcast the news channel across all of Europe using the
Eutelsat satellite system.
The aim of the channel is to reflect the cultural diversity of Europe.
Initially the channel will be broadcast in English, German, French, Italian
and Spanish.
A shortlist of European cities has been drawn up for the headquarters of the
channel and a decision is expected before the end of this month.
The contenders are Munich in Germany, Valencia in Spain, Charleroi in
Belgium and Lyons in France.

<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday rejected claims that it would be 20 years
before living standards in the former East Germany matched those in the
west.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman in Bonn, stuck firmly to the
official line that the process would take only five years at most.
He was responding to a charge from Mr Wolfgang Scheremet, a labour market
expert at the respected DIW economic institute in Berlin, that the
'desolate' condition of the eastern economy had been widely under-estimated.
Mr Scheremet said unemployment in the east would reach 1.5m in August, and
claimed there would still be 1m people without work at the end of the
decade. Unemployment in the east jumped to 1.34m, or 16.5 per cent, last
month.
Forecasts that economic growth of between 7 per cent and 12 per cent a year
would lead to equal living standards in three to five years were illusory,
he added.
High pay awards in east and west were damaging competitiveness in the new
federal states. Westerners would have to realise that unification had a very
high price, and easterners would have to learn patience.
Official estimates of 10 per cent growth this year are based mainly on the
construction boom and developing service industries.
According to the latest report from the Berliner Bank, oil refining,
printing and food manufacture are also making better-than-average progress.
Output from manufacturing industry, meanwhile, is still around 70 per cent
of pre-unification levels.
Figures published yesterday showed production in November last year was 1.5
per cent higher than in October, and 28 per cent lower than in November
1990.
Engineering output was 38 per cent lower than a year earlier and only half
the pre-unification level.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Demirel fuels reports of split over tax policy

<TEXT>
MR Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, left for the US yesterday
leaving behind Mrs Tansu Ciller, his chief economics minister, fuelling
further speculation of a government split over economic policy, writes John
Murray Brown in Ankara.
Mrs Ciller last week denied rumours she is to tender her resignation, but
her position looks increasingly precarious following the announcement in
January of an 11 per cent rise in inflation.
There is also growing opposition within the government to her plans for tax
reform and privatisation. These are seen as essential to tackle the budget
deficit, running at more than 11 per cent of GNP. Mrs Ciller, a 45-year-old
Istanbul academic, has proposed reforms centring on an amnesty for tax
offenders, increased collection and changes in tax treatment of government
bonds.

FT  11 FEB 92 / Perrier shares rise on hope of counter-offer to Nestle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERRIER, the French mineral water company embroiled in a battle between
Nestle of Switzerland and the Agnelli family of Italy, yesterday saw 2 per
cent of its capital - 158,000 shares - change hands on speculative hopes of
a counter-offer to Nestle's FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) hostile bid.
Speculators began buying Perrier as soon as the Paris stock market opened.
The shares, which had been suspended since mid-December, following the
Agnellis' FFr5.6bn bid for Exor, Perrier's controlling shareholder, closed
at FFr1,501 against a suspension price of FFr1,396.
This left Perrier's shares trading slightly above the FFr1,475 offered by
Nestle and Indosuez, the French bank with which it is mounting its bid.
Exor, mooted as the likeliest contender for a Perrier counter-bid, also saw
its shares shoot up after suspension. The Exor share price rose by 8.9 per
cent to FFr1,438 yesterday, well above the FFr1,320 a share offered by the
Agnellis.
At present Exor would be able to block Nestle's bid, or a third party bid,
since it controls 49 per cent of Perrier's voting shares - through its own
35 per cent stake and the 13.8 per cent holding recently bought by Saint
Louis, another company associated with the Agnellis.
However, it is not certain that Saint Louis will be able to hold on to its
shares. Nestle has filed two legal cases in France to try to nullify the
stake on the grounds that Perrier, which is chaired by Mr Jacques Vincent,
president of Exor, sold the shares to Saint Louis specifically to block the
Swiss group's imminent bid.
The first court case comes to an end next week and the second on February
25.
If the courts rule in Saint Louis' favour, it will be able to keep its
shares. The French stock market authorities would then force Exor to make a
full bid. Exor, however, would be allowed to make a token bid below the
Nestle price, since it already controls enough stock to block Nestle's
offer.
But if the judgment goes against Saint Louis, Exor's blocking stake will
disappear. Exor will then have to decide whether to fend off Nestle with a
fully fledged counter-bid.

FT  11 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Big credit repayments cast gloom on recovery
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 12th February 1992) appended to this article.
CAUTIOUS BRITISH consumers made the biggest monthly net repayment of debt
since 1976 in December, a further sign that they are not yet ready to lead
the economy out of recession.
Consumers paid back more than they borrowed for the fifth successive month,
making a Pounds 196m net repayment. This followed November's net repayment
of Pounds 34m.
At the end of the year, outstanding consumer credit from finance houses,
building societies and on bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or
Mastercard system stood at only Pounds 370m compared with Pounds 2.9bn in
1989 and more than Pounds 3bn in 1990.
A broader measure of outstanding consumer-type debt, which includes credit
agreements granted to mainly small businesses, showed borrowers paying back
a net Pounds 486m over the year compared with net borrowings of Pounds 4.5bn
in 1989 and Pounds 3bn in 1990.
According to the seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical
Office, the amount of new credit advanced to consumers in December was
Pounds 4.1bn, an increase on November when the amount was Pounds 3.7bn.
However, the total declined by 2 per cent to Pounds 11.8bn in the last
quarter of 1991 compared with the previous three-month period.
The figures suggest that most consumers, chastened by rising unemployment
and high interest rates, are behaving prudently and paying off expensive
debts accrued in the 1980s. Others, however, are beginning to borrow again
to take advantage of low inflation and discounting by retailers.
Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Midland Montagu, said: 'There are a
lot of people who are suffering but within that overall total there are some
who are not doing too badly and I think that is what is revealed in that
Pounds 4.1bn.'
The last quarter of 1991 saw a net repayment of Pounds 303m by consumers.
This compares with average quarterly net borrowings of Pounds 762.5m in
1990.
The last monthly increase in outstanding credit was in July when consumers
added Pounds 165m to their overall debts.
The consumer credit figures, contributed to a softer tone on the UK domestic
money markets where the three-month inter-bank rate closed around 10.5 per
cent. This fuelled market speculation that base rates might be cut from
their current 10.5 per cent by the time of the Budget on March 10, but
analysts underlined that this would be possible only if conditions in the
European Monetary System permitted.
Revised figures for retail sales in December, seasonally adjusted, showed a
0.9 per cent fall on November, giving a year-on-year fall of 0.4 per cent,
according to the CSO.
Correction (published 12th February 1992).
OUTSTANDING consumer credit from finance houses, building societies and on
bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system grew by
Pounds 370m in 1991, compared with Pounds 2.9bn in 1989, and more than
Pounds 3bn in 1990. In yesterday's FT it was incorrectly stated that the
amount outstanding at the end of the year was Pounds 370m.

FT  10 FEB 92 / UK Gilts: Prices rise as solid run continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUMPER week for gilt funding ended with prices moderately higher,
continuing the solid run of recent weeks for the UK government bond market.
The Bank of England took the opportunity of a firm market to announce gilts
funding worth a total of Pounds 1.8bn. The move seemed aimed partly at
raising money for the 1992-93 public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR),
which could total some Pounds 24bn, roughly twice the figure for this year.
With sterling undergoing few signs of strain in the European exchange rate
mechanism and with recessionary conditions likely to continue for some time,
gilt yields continued on a downward path.
Since the start of 1992, yields have come down faster than for all the other
important types of government bonds, illustrating the attraction of the
securities for investors both in the UK and overseas.
The prospect of a large amount of new gilt issues in the financial year
beginning in April continues to worry some investors, as it might depress
prices. But even allowing for the nervousness that may affect the market
ahead of the general election, the outlook for gilt yields seems fairly
positive.
The firm state of the market was underlined when three tap stocks totalling
Pounds 550m announced by the Bank on Tuesday sold out the day afterwards, as
a result of considerable pent-up demand for securities maturing around the
end of the century. The instruments comprised Pounds 150m of the 9 1/2 per
cent Treasury loan due 1999, Pounds 150m of the 12 1/4 per cent exchequer
stock due 1999, and Pounds 250m of the 9 1/2 per cent conversion stock due
2005.
This was followed on Friday by news of an issue of Pounds 1.25bn of 9 per
cent cent Treasury stock due 2012, available for dealing from today. The
Bank set an issue price of 99.25 per cent, with 50 per cent payable up front
and a redemption yield of 9.08 per cent.
Including Friday's issue, the first new gilt to be unveiled by the Bank for
four years, total announced funding by the Bank so far this financial year
comes to some Pounds 15bn. Allowing for gilt redemptions of Pounds 6.5bn and
some Pounds 3bn of gilts thought to have been sold by the Bank unannounced,
the authorities appear to have already funded the estimated Pounds 11bn PSBR
for this year.
Last week, prices rose for gilts at all parts of the yield curve, apart from
extremely short-dated bonds. On Friday night, the 10 per cent Treasury bond
maturing in 1994 closed at 101 1/32 , up from 100 7/8 the week before. The
yield crept down to 9.48 per cent.
Since the start of the year, according to figures for annualised yields
worked out by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, 10-year gilt yields have come down by 44
basis points (0.44 per cent). That is in contrast to a reduction in yields
for German and French 10-year government bonds of 15 and 22 basis points
respectively, while Japanese and US bonds of an equivalent maturity have
seen yields respectively unchanged and 47 basis points higher.
Over the next few weeks, more heavy funding by the Bank seems likely, given
the possibility that as the date of the election draws nearer, nervousness
about the outcome may well depress prices in the gilt market. With the
likelihood of a rise in yields closer to the poll (which many think will be
in April or May) it is probably in the Bank's interests to sell gilts sooner
rather than later.
The economic data due to be announced over the next week are likely to do
little to puncture the expectations of a slow recovery from the recession,
with inflationary pressures extremely small. Figures for UK credit business
due to be announced today are thought likely to show that consumers repaid
borrowing worth a net Pounds 50m last month, underlining the weak state of
demand. On Friday, the headline inflation rate is expected to be 4.4 per
cent, against 4.5 per cent in December.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECU, basket currency of the European Community, has developed
dynamically in the last three years under the EC's drive for monetary and
economic integration, a new report says, Reuter reports from Switzerland.
Between 1988 and September 1991, Ecu banking grew by around 25 per cent
annually, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in its quarterly
report.
'Without doubt the accelerated monetary and economic integration in the EC
is one of the driving forces of this expansion.'
At the end of September, outstanding claims of the banks reporting to the
BIS stood at Ecu176bn, against Ecu101bn at the end of 1988.
The Ecu is now the fourth most important currency for foreign currency
holdings, the BIS said. Although it is still far behind the dollar, it is
catching up on the yen and Swiss franc, the report added.
The BIS noted the Ecu was gaining in attractiveness as an issuing currency
on capital markets. Almost Ecu25bn were taken up through international bond
markets in the first nine months of 1991.

This represents a slight slowdown in the rate of sales growth for L'Oreal.

FT  10 FEB 92 / New stock helps lift gilt market profits 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILT-EDGED market makers (Gemms) reported an overall operating profit of
Pounds 49m in 1991, up 22.5 per cent on the previous year.
This is only the second year since Big Bang in 1986 that the group of 18
firms has shown an overall profit. They were helped by the government's
return to issuing gilts during 1991, favourable market conditions, the
absence of volatile market movements, and benefits of cost-cutting.
The figures, in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin*, were released
ahead of publication tomorrow.
Last year also marked the first time since Big Bang capital dedicated to the
gilt market increased, from Pounds 395m for the group at the beginning of
the year, to Pounds 432m at year-end.
The figures will interest companies considering starting up as Gemms.
Deutsche Bank has said it will begin trading gilts soon. Nikko, Yamaichi and
Morgan Stanley are expected to follow suit. The Bank's report says only a
few of the 18 Gemms incurred losses last year.
A main reason given for the performance of the gilt market was the
government's need to issue new stock to meet borrowing requirements.
After three successive years during which the market shrank, the Bank of
England began issuing gilts again in January 1991. New issues totalling
Pounds 13.9bn in nominal terms were announced last year.
'There can be little doubt that the growth of the gilt market. . .acted as a
stimulus to investor interest' reports the Bank.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Mayhew's key role in corporate deals: Special arrangement
allowed broker to operate while facing Guinness charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Mayhew, the Cazenove broker charged in connection with the Guinness
affair, has played a leading role in some of the UK's largest corporate
transactions, in spite of not being fully authorised under the Financial
Services Act.
The three remaining charges against Mr Mayhew were dropped by the Serious
Fraud Office on Friday after he had presented new evidence which satisfied
the prosecution he had no case to answer.
In the four years since he was charged over his role in the Guinness
takeover of Distillers in 1986, Mr Mayhew - the only Guinness defendant to
retain his job after charges had been brought - has continued to play a key
advisory role in a number of transactions.
He was a leading figures in the BAT 'war cabinet' during the tobacco group's
defence against Hoylake, he advised Grand Metropolitan on its takeover of
Pillsbury, and he masterminded substantial 'bought deals' like ICI's sale of
its stake in Enterprise Oil and General Cinema's disposal of shares in
Cadbury Schweppes.
However, throughout this period he has been refused membership by the
Securities and Futures Authority (formerly The Securities Association), the
self-regulatory organisation set up under the Financial Services Act.
SFA's membership committee declined to pass him 'fit and proper' while the
charges against him were outstanding.
Although the Financial Services Act only requires firms to be authorised the
SFA requires individuals who give investment advice to be registered.
A special arrangement allowed Mr Mayhew to operate while being 'shadowed' by
other Cazenove partners. Senior partners of the UK corporate stockbroker
promised to ensure his work met regulators' rules.
The arrangement owed much to the regard in which Cazenove is held in the
City of London. One senior SFA staff member yesterday commented of the
Cazenove promise to supervise Mr Mayhew: 'From them, it meant something:
from lesser firms, it might not have carried such weight.'
Merchant bankers and senior corporate figures who have worked with Mr Mayhew
since he was charged said the SFA's restrictions had not prevented him
continuing as before. 'He has been extremely active, and all credit to him,'
one leading merchant banker commented.
The chairman of a large public company advised by Mr Mayhew, who declined to
be named, said: 'He has continued to be a very important operator in the
City. The reason he is important is that people trusted him - they didn't
believe these charges.'

FT  10 FEB 92 / Economics Notebook: High hopes of a good decade for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL be of little comfort to politicians in the US and Europe facing
elections this year in grim economic conditions - but the 1990s will be a
good decade for economic growth in the OECD countries and potentially an
excellent one for the reforming economies of east and central Europe.
This is the conclusion of Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research in London, in a recent study for
the United Nations of postwar economic growth in the market economies.*
Mr Britton argues that, while ultimately growth is driven by technological
advance, countries can expand far more rapidly than this implies over many
years both through technological 'catch-up' and through moves to freer
markets and thus more efficient use of resources.
Between 1950-73, known in retrospect as the 'golden age', western Europe and
Japan benefited from both factors. Labour productivity, measured by GDP per
hour worked, rose 5.3 per cent a year on average in France, Germany, Japan,
the Netherlands and Britain, compared with 1.6 per cent from 1870 to 1950.
By contrast, the 2.5 per cent annual growth of GDP per hour worked in the US
in 1950-73 was little different to that between 1913 and 1950.
Operating closer to the technological frontier (with an absolute level of
GDP per hour worked higher than any of the five countries cited) and with an
already largely deregulated economy, the 'golden age' passed the US by.
'It seems likely that the distinguishing characteristic of the 'golden age'
was not the more rapid acquisition of new knowledge, so much as its faster
diffusion, and a more efficient use of knowledge already acquired,' the
study says.
This process was aided by the dismantling of international trade barriers
and high rates of investment, especially in Japan and Germany.
The golden age was followed by 'an age of disappointment and confusion'. Mr
Britton gives short shrift to 'oil-shock' explanations of the worldwide
slowdown after 1973, citing evidence that the direct impact was small. He
argues that the slowdown was inevitable.
The scope for technological 'catch-up' in relation to the US was largely
exhausted. Indeed, by the 1970s Japan already surpassed the US in many
sectors. There was little more to be gained from switching resources from
agriculture to industry, while the shift to services may have actually
reduced productivity growth. There was also a halt to progress on trade
liberalisation.
Mr Britton dismisses claims made by the OECD and others that economic growth
was stifled by a burgeoning public sector. Government receipts as a
percentage of GDP rose from 32.1 per cent in 1973 to 35.6 per cent in 1984,
not enough significantly to affect productivity or growth, he says.
Similarly, he is reluctant to accept explanations that put all the blame on
government actions to restrain demand in order to curb inflation. Countries
which avoided the worst of the inflation in the 1970s, like West Germany and
Switzerland, did not have a better growth performance. Countries with
continued low unemployment (relatively high demand) in the 1970s still
suffered from the general fall in productivity growth rates.
However, Mr Britton says growth after 1973 became more volatile. The loss of
output in the recessions of the mid-1970s and the early 1980s was not made
up by faster growth in subsequent years.
Thus in the 1980s, the decade of the 'conservative revolution' in Europe and
America, average OECD output growth of 2.8 per cent a year was almost the
same as in 1973-79 when economic expansion was supposedly fettered by
rampant growth of the nanny state.
But the recession precipitated by tight money policies to defeat inflation
cost the OECD countries 2.5 per cent of GDP, a loss which may prove
permanent.
The 'conservative revolution' was intended to allocate resources more
efficiently through deregulation of markets rather than boost the underlying
rate of technical progress, for which markets are not necessarily best
suited. But even here it has failed to achieve 'a general and sustained
acceleration in productivity growth'.
OECD labour productivity area rose 1.7 per cent a year on average in the
1980s, though in particular sectors in particular countries gains were more
impressive.
In spite of this, Mr Britton is 'cautiously optimistic' on the outlook to
the end of the decade. He believes the 1980s have left the market economies
in relatively good shape to take advantage of growth potential.
In the absence of big increases in investment (low savings) or in labour
supply (population ageing), this will depend mainly on technical progress
and/or the more efficient use of resources.
Indulging in some crystal-ball gazing, Mr Britton believes the slowdown in
military spending following the end of the cold war could reduce the pace of
technological advance in the long term, though in the medium term growth
could benefit from more productive use of liberated resources.
European economic integration will further boost efficiency, though against
that is the possibility that the world trade talks may fail. Finally, Mr
Britton expects a move to the political centre from the right in the US,
Britain and Germany, but no return to more interventionist policies.
In eastern Europe the parallel is with western Europe in the 1950s. The same
potential exists for a rapid rise in productivity, combined with reduced
regulation and an expansion of trade. There is the same need to catch up
with existing technical knowledge and the same need for capital.
In western Europe the parallel is with the US in the 1950s. It is not
expected to experience anything like the possible boom in the east but the
National Institute is predicting annual growth of 2.6 per cent in 1993-95
and 2.8 per cent in 1996-99 for the big seven economies.
'We are not forecasting a new 'golden age' of rapid growth in the market
economies, but we do foresee continuing progress and overall a better
performance than that of the 1970s or even the 1980s', Mr Britton says.

FT  10 FEB 92 / BAA begins to throttle back on costs: Sir John Egan wants to
change the way the UK airports operator undertakes investment projects in
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Egan, BAA chief executive, is determined to stop costs taking off
at London's Heathrow airport.
The privatised airports operator is expected to apply for planning
permission later this year to build a new fifth terminal at the world's
busiest international passenger airport: an even bigger project than the
Pounds 400m new terminal complex BAA opened last year at Stansted airport.
But timing of the application remains in doubt because Sir John wants to
halve the original Pounds 1.6bn estimated cost of building terminal five at
Heathrow to around Pounds 800m.
'We will only proceed the moment we see a project where the costs are
acceptable,' he warned, after rejecting last week the latest plans drawn up
by his staff. 'It was a good project but not a great one,' he explained.
The former Jaguar chairman, who took over the running of BAA from Sir Norman
Payne last year, seems convinced his group can provide the necessary 30m
passenger a year additional capacity at Heathrow by the turn of the century,
with a more cost-efficient terminal five project than previously planned.
He does not want a repeat of the Stansted experiment. BAA could never have
foreseen that its new Pounds 400m terminal at Stansted would open during the
worst crisis to hit civil aviation in 40 years. But Sir John also
acknowledged there was no need to spend so much at Stansted.
Since taking over, Sir John has sought to change the way BAA undertakes new
investment projects. 'When you spend about Pounds 300m a year in building
new things, you've got to make sure you are cost effective while meeting the
world's best standards,' he said.
Sir John said he was first alerted to the need to transform the company's
approach to new investment projects by large US carriers such as United
Airlines and American Airlines which started services to London for the
first time last year. 'They asked me why it took twice as much time and
money to build in the UK as it did in the US,' he said.
'The problem in the UK is that there is a managerial muddle, impractical
designs by architects and the fact that sub contractors accounting for about
70 per cent of the total costs don't get a look in until a project is
started and the project then constantly changes,' he explained.
He has already applied his new approach of designing buildings around their
functions and future income streams at Glasgow airport - rather than allow
what he calls 'the whimsy of managers and architects' to take over.
BAA last week announced it was investing Pounds 60m to develop Glasgow's
international passenger facilities. 'We started with a project costing
Pounds 110m. It took us a year to get it down to Pounds 60m and I expect
after another six months of detailed work we can get it even lower,' he
said.
The planning inquiry alone for the terminal five project at Heathrow is
expected to take up to four years and cost BAA between Pounds 50m and Pounds
60m. 'We won't embark on this investment until we have a robust project,'
Sir John said.
BAA is also developing an express rail link between Heathrow and Paddington
station. But Sir John is adopting the same cautious approach to the project.
'I don't want a Channel Tunnel but a high-quality line,' he said. BAA has
started tunnelling tests in the Heathrow area with the target of seeing the
rail link enter service by 1995-96.
BAA is still negotiating with British Rail the Pounds 235m funding of the
Heathrow line. Originally BAA was to pick up 80 per cent of the cost and BR
the rest. However, there is a query over BR's contribution as well as the
future of all rail links between central London and the three BAA London
airports of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
Privatisation of BR or parts of it could give BAA the chance to take charge
of the rail links to its London airports. Sir John is cautious on such a
prospect. 'Running railways is not part of our core business but I don't
think it is impossible to create a nice quality solution which all the major
players find attractive,' he said.
Focusing on BAA's core airports and retailing businesses have become the
priority for Sir John. 'Our core businesses are more profitable than any
diversifications. What I want to do is build up our critical skills and once
these grow we will see where we can diversify,' he said.
He emphasised that Gatwick was not for sale, in spite of speculation earlier
this year. 'What Gatwick needs is a marketing drive to make it fully
competitive with Heathrow,' he said.
Stansted would also ultimately pay for itself. It suffered a setback this
month when Air France and Crossair of Switzerland said they were suspending
flights from the airport because these services were losing money. However,
traffic at the airport grew 100 per cent to nearly 1.8m passengers last year
after the new terminal was opened. But the airport is still short of the 5m
passengers a year it needs to break even.
Sir John wants to expand BAA's profitable airport retailing operations by
doubling retail space at airports over the next three years. He is also
seeking to export the company's retailing and airport design expertise. It
is competing for the design contracts of the new Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur
airports and is developing the retailing and catering businesses of
Pittsburg airport.
At home, Sir John has spent his first year driving down costs by reducing
staffing by around 20 per cent from 10,000 to 8,000 people. 'The company had
never seriously examined its productivity. We have significantly improved it
with the staff reduction programme,' he said. The company aims for
productivity improvements of 3 per cent a year.
Although passenger traffic is recovering after last year's slump caused by
the Gulf war and the recession, BAA is expected to report a decline of about
18 per cent in pre-tax earnings for its financial year ending next March
compared with the previous year.
The City of London forecasts pre-tax profits of about Pounds 200m for the
year compared with Pounds 246m. The lower profits will also reflect
provisions for staff cuts, property and the possible sale of Prestwick
airport in Ayrshire.
After two years of zero passenger growth at its airports, Sir John sees
signs of an upturn. 'We are sluggishly starting to get a little growth but
we are fearful one swallow does not make a summer,' he said.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Salomon plans big changes in Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SALOMON BROTHERS, the scandal-struck Wall Street securities house which was
caught rigging US Treasury bond auctions last year, is to announce a
shake-up in the management of its European operations today.
Mr Deryck Maughan, chief operating officer at Salomon Brothers, is due to
announce the promotion of Mr Dennis Keegan and Mr Stephen Posford to the
position of joint heads of the London-based European business.
Mr Jim Massey will step down from his position as head of Salomon Brothers'
international business (which included Tokyo and Europe), and will take over
responsibility for both Salomon Brothers' own investments and special
projects. He will not be replaced in this capacity.
Mr Maughan is expected to tell staff today that Salomon's London-based
Europe operations can no longer be run from New York, in view of their
importance, and that a decision has been taken to set up a local management
team.
Mr Posford, who is English, and Mr Keegan, an American, were recently
appointed joint heads of Salomon's equity and fixed income business in
London in the wake of fall-out from the Treasury bond scandal. They have
worked closely together at Salomon's bond trading desk in London for several
years, a working relationship which, according to one Salomon employee, has
earned them the nicknames 'Tweedledum and Tweedledee'.
The rise of Mr Posford and Mr Keegan, who both have backgrounds in
proprietary bond trading (trading on the company's account rather than for a
particular client) has been interpreted by some employees as a sign that the
senior management wants to focus more on this business area. One Salomons
source said revenue on the proprietary trading side amounted to 'over Pounds
100m' in 1990 at the company's London operations.
However, Salomon Brothers yesterday denied there was any intention of
focusing on proprietary trading at the expense of other business areas. 'It
has been made very clear to everybody that there isn't more emphasis on
proprietary trading. The emphasis on clients and client business will be
stronger than ever,' said Mr Lee Bruce, press spokesman for the company.
The announcements regarding senior staff changes come as Salomon Brothers is
still suffering from the repercussions of the Treasury bond rigging scandal.
Both in London and New York, the company has lost several members of staff,
including some senior and well-respected analysts and desk heads, either as
a result of redundancies or voluntary departures.
One former employee claims: 'The London trading floor is half empty these
days, so many people have left, they have even started to fill some of the
vacant places with settlements people.'
However, a spokesman for Salomon strongly denied the claim and said the
company had begun interviewing replacement staff.
Mr Massey will remain on the Salomon Brothers executive committee (chaired
by Mr Maughan) and on the board of directors of Salomons Inc. In his new job
he will have an overview of the firm's investments, such as its 5 per cent
stake in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the Italian banking group.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Instrument fault is blow to Airbus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RELIABILITY of the technology on board the Airbus A320 was thrown into
doubt for the second time in a month yesterday when Air France told its
pilots not to use part of the aircraft's navigational system.
Airbus yesterday acknowledged that one instrument was behaving erratically.
The company is conducting tests to find the cause.
Both Air France and Air Inter, its subsidiary which flies on domestic
routes, imposed indefinite bans on landing their combined fleet of 46 A320s
using the VOR-DME navigational system. This followed an incident last
Wednesday when an Air Inter pilot reported a malfunction on a flight from
Lyons to Bordeaux.
The ban comes only a few weeks after 87 people died after an Air Inter A320
crashed into Mont Saint-Odile near Strasbourg when trying to land using the
VOR-DME system.
Airbus said yesterday that the two incidents were unrelated: at Strasbourg
the aircraft was at the wrong height while at Bordeaux it was off course.
However, Airbus conceded that Lufthansa, the German carrier, had quietly
imposed a similar ban on VOR-DME on A320s late last year after noting the
erratic behaviour of the same system.
'We have advised the airlines of this occasional misfunctioning of one
instrument,' said Airbus.
Modern aircraft, including the A320, are also fitted with the superior
Independent Landing System (ILS), although not all airports can handle
ILS-guided aircraft. British Airways, which has 10 A320s, said that its
pilots almost always used ILS and would not be issuing any advice on
VOR-DME.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority took a similar line to BA, saying: 'We would
expect to have been informed by the French authorities if it were especially
urgent.'
The French ban could prevent A320s landing at airports without ILS if fog or
low cloud prevented a manual approach.
VOR-DME (VHF omni range distance measuring equipment) is used in many types
of aircraft, although Air France has banned its use only on the A320. The
system works by picking up signals from a network of radio beacons on the
ground.
Airbus said the VOR-DME equipment on the affected aircraft was supplied by
two US manufacturers, Bendix and Collins Government Avionics.
The incident that triggered the French ban occurred last Wednesday when an
Air Inter pilot noticed that the instruments showed he was in line with
Bordeaux runway while the view from the cockpit showed this not to be so.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Talks to settle Outhwaite case get under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS are under way in an effort to reach an out-of-court settlement in the
Outhwaite case, the biggest single legal action in the 300-year history of
the London insurance market.
Representatives of the 81 Lloyd's agents named in the suit - including RHM
Outhwaite Underwriting - and the 987 Names who are party to the action said
last night discussions were taking place which might lead to a settlement.
Names are the individuals whose assets back underwriting, while agents
handle their affairs and manage syndicates.
Mr Justice Saville, who has been presiding over hearings at the High Court
since the case opened in October, adjourned proceedings for 'administrative
reasons' last Monday.
A successful outcome may also encourage the settlement of other legal cases
in which another 1,000 Names are involved. Names in the Outhwaite case
allege that their insurance losses of more than Pounds 200m were due to
negligence by Mr Richard Outhwaite, the underwriter of syndicate 317/661,
and the agents who placed Names with his syndicate.
Mr Outhwaite's losses stem from 32 reinsurance contracts, underwritten in
1982, whereby in return for substantial premiums he assumed the exposures of
other insurers to US liability business.
During the 1980s insurance claims arising from court awards to victims of
asbestosis proved to be much greater than Mr Outhwaite had expected and the
business produced disastrous results for Names.
There was speculation yesterday that agents would settle the case for around
Pounds 100m - about two thirds of the amount that the Outhwaite 1982 Names
Association had been hoping to win in the courts.
It can be expected that errors and omissions insurers - Lloyd's syndicates
that insure agents against the cost of legal awards for negligence - will
meet some of the cost.
On Friday E &amp; O underwriters paid an out-of-court settlement worth about
Pounds 4m, including Pounds 1.5m in legal costs, to more than 500 members of
syndicate 553, managed by CJ Warrilow agency.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Securities markets in a post-inflation world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gloomy minds think alike. By one of those coincidences which make you wonder
if your great thoughts are not simply something you overheard, I had just
started drafting this column when I received a circular from Mr Nicholas
Carn of Draycott Partners saying pretty much what I was planning to say. Or
at least the central thought is the same: inflation should now be discussed
in the past tense.
Draycott is a Boston firm, so Mr Carn dates the turning point from the
Federal Open Market Committee meeting of the autumn of 1989. British
investors are likely to remember our own steep rise in interest rates of
about the same time, Japanese the arrival of Mr Yasushi Mieno as governor of
the Bank of Japan, and continental Europeans, perhaps, the more recent rise
in German rates.
However you trace it, the central banks outside Europe decided some time in
the late 1980s that they had had enough of what the Japanese so vividly call
the bubble economy, and pricked it. In Europe the fiscal and wage explosions
in Germany and Italy provoked the same response. The result, according to
the consensus of the investment community, is that world inflation is now
converging towards 3 per cent. Not, however, according to Mr Carn, or to me;
the disinflation is more likely to be dangerous overkill.
A glance at the US economy, where the monetary overkill has largely (but not
entirely) been reversed, should be enough to set off some warning signals;
there is still barely a sign of revival, to the despair of President George
Bush and his advisers, who are openly campaigning against the Fed. The
British authorities are now showing some signs of awareness and worry; a
debt-ridden economy does not seem to respond to interest rate cuts. Yet in
Germany and Japan, whose economies are rapidly sliding into recession, the
central banks still talk as if they had plenty of time to ease later. We
shall see.
It is the old central bank story of first watching the wrong indicators, and
then doing too much, too late. Through the 1980s they targeted consumer
price inflation, and were complacent about asset price inflation; they
ignored the fact that there were already powerful forces checking inflation
in productive industry - new technology, improved man management, lower
demand for raw materials in a service economy, and better stock control. So
the over-expansion of money was mainly seen in asset markets - 'a
speculative vortex that ultimately sucked in everything from paintings to
toy cars,' as Mr Carn reminds us. The past tense, as any dealer can confirm.
This is the point which the current equity bulls, who like to argue that low
inflation is good for equities, have missed. The restraint in unit costs did
help margins, and will continue to do so; but the bull market itself, and
the growth of credit-financed demand which it supported, was not the result
of deflation, but of continued financial inflation. It was in fact the last
gasp of the great inflation which started in the early 1970s.
Now we have monetary disinflation, while the technological disinflation is
still gathering force; and looking some way ahead, we have growing
competition not only from the emerging Asian and Latin American economies,
but from the well-educated low-wage economies of the former Communist world
as well. The combined competitive squeeze on UK industry is producing a
result which has never been observed before - a sharp rise in productivity
even as output is falling. In the US, goods price inflation virtually
stopped about a year ago.
Meanwhile, the expansion of the service economy, which was a by-product of
the asset boom, is in sharp reverse - not just in financial and
property-dealing services, but now in the US in retailing too. Retail
employment there is falling sharply, almost for the first time in peacetime
living memory, or at any rate since the 1930s. Spending growth is virtually
all in low-cost warehouse-type operations. Like the British retail
revolution a century ago, this will maintain living standards, but at the
cost of a sluggish economy. We can expect to see the same trends in Europe
and even Japan.
Against this sluggish, highly-competitive background, the debt work-out
which is the main business of the English-speaking and Japanese economies is
bound to be a protracted affair; and the fall in inflation makes it steadily
more difficult. Mr Carn draws a dramatic conclusion: 'The cyclical downturn
ushers in an environment that few of us can remember; money has always been
a temporary refuge - now it is the thing to have.'
That seems to me premature: it recalls an era when prices were persistently
falling, so that all 'real' assets were wasting assets. But it could happen.
What current American experience does suggest is that the blow to financial
confidence of the current wave of failures, kept in place by the huge
over-supply in commercial property, has already created the situation Keynes
described, where easier credit is pushing on a string. It might be almost
impossible for the central banks to start inflation off again even if they
wished, and the hope of stable values is just that - a hope. Prices could
start falling.
The best ground for hope is that we have learned one lesson from the 1930s:
the danger of a banking collapse, with a huge destruction of wealth and
income, has been checked (though in the US it was a near thing). But in
Europe we have also unlearned one lesson. The ridiculous rules for fiscal
policy agreed at Maastricht - ridiculous because they do not trust financial
markets to discriminate between different borrowers - will greatly hamper
any government wanting to re-stimulate growth through budgetary action.
The investment implications of this prospect should hardly need spelling
out, except that they cut across the conventional wisdom of recent decades.
We face sluggish growth at best, and continued cost pressures, so that
equity investment will have to be highly selective - the most efficient
manufacturers and retailers, and companies with a defensible monopoly
position. Meanwhile, in Europe, we will initially face an artificially
restricted supply of trustworthy bonds. So buy bonds.

FT  10 FEB 92 / UK plans to put brake on single marke: British EC presidency
under the Conservatives may put new legislation in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans to put a brake on new single market legislation when it
takes over the European Community presidency in July - probably jeopardising
a proposed directive on opening up EC securities markets.
Ministers have decided that, if the Conservatives win the general election,
the government's emphasis will be on reforming and implementing existing
measures for the single market.
Mr John Redwood, the corporate affairs minister, is risking infuriating the
UK's European partners by saying he would rather have no agreement on the
proposed Investment Services Directive than a measure with which he
disagrees.
Mr Redwood represents the UK on the EC's internal market council and
meetings of finance ministers when they discuss the directive.
The Investment Services Directive is seen within the European Commission as
an integral part of the single market, which begins at the close of the UK
presidency, January 1 1993.
Mr Redwood says he wants to change the 'culture' of the internal market
council. 'Too many people have seen the single market as a legislative
programme whereas I see it as about getting more cross border trade,' he
said.
The British presidency will aim to 'celebrate the completion of the single
market and to make sure it is working well'.
There will be a consultative exercise among EC business leaders about
possible revisions to existing directives.
Mr Redwood said that may see a relaxation of EC technical standards set for
some products which he regards as preventing cross-border trade.
Of the 282 measures proposed in 1985 for a single market by Lord Cockfield,
the former internal market com-missioner, agreement has been reached on 232,
although not all have been implemented.
The UK is hoping to reach agreement soon on which of the others, possibly
10, could be dropped as no longer applicable.
One is likely to be the fifth company law directive. This directive would
harmonise the administration and structure of large EC companies. Up to 30
others might be agreed under the current Portuguese presidency.
Failure to reach agreement on investment services directive will disappoint
the City because it had been hoped it would significantly extend the
potential markets of UK companies.
The directive will not be discussed at today's meeting of EC finance
ministers but should be on the agenda for the next council, scheduled for
March 16.
So far the Portuguese have been unable to resolve the fundamental
differences between Britain and France over the speed and method by which
stock market trades are made public under the directive.
The last high-level meeting in December broke up over the issue with Mr
Redwood accusing France of intransigence. But other national officials from
EC countries and Commission officials believe it is Mr Redwood who is guilty
of stubbornness. Some of them think it may be possible to achieve the
necessary majority in favour of a compromise despite the British position.
Compromise on the draft directive might be helped by movement on the related
capital adequacy directive, which would set common capital standards for
securities trading operations.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Major calls for debate on policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR called yesterday for a switch in the focus of election
campaigning from the leading protagonists' private lives to the policy
divisions between their parties.
But after a weekend of clashes over alleged 'smear tactics' and 'dirty
tricks' there was little sign of any easing of the personal acrimony which
has come to dominate the campaign.
Mr Chris Patten, Conservative chairman, distanced his party from efforts by
some newspapers to delve into the personal lives of other opposition
politicians following last week's revelations by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
Liberal Democrat leader, about an affair he had five years ago.
However, Mr Patten said politicians should not be too 'sanctimonious' about
intrusions into their private life if they used spouses and families to
project a favourable image. 'I don't like this sort of politics . . . but to
some extent we make a rod for our own back.'
Speaking on LBC radio, Mr Major said the general election should be 'a crisp
campaign that deals with the policies. I hope that will be the campaign the
other parties will fight'.
Meanwhile, Mr Ashdown complained that it was journalists, not himself, who
had wanted to write about his family life. However, he joined Mr Major in
opposing restrictions on press freedom.
For Labour, Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader, drew a stark contrast between
the 'ruthless individualism' of Tory polices and Labour's goal of 'a kinder,
gentler, more compassionate society'.
He told 800 local government delegates at a Blackpool conference that the
coming general election should be 'a crusade' based on the party's principle
of equality.
At the Young Conservative conference in Eastbourne, Mr Patten insisted that
the 'character' and 'leadership' issue was entirely legitimate.
The personal bitterness of the campaign so far was reflected in attacks
during the conference on Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour's foreign affairs
spokesman, who has often led Labour's criticism of Mr Major and who was the
recipient of a continuous stream of jibes by senior ministers.
Mr Patten promised a sustained attack on Labour's tax and spending policies
and its general economic competence.
On Saturday, Mr Major set out the principal themes for the Conservative
manifesto as choice, ownership, opportunity and responsibility. He indicated
the government's determination to raise defence as an election issue by
announcing it would press ahead with an order for a fourth Trident nuclear
missile submarine.
However Mr Hattersley said the Tories could never understand voters'
'instinct for fairness'. He asked if Young Conservatives would have
'screamed with delight', as they did with the Trident announcement, 'if he
had said he was going to spend the same amount on the homeless, on schools
and on hospitals'.
Mr Patten brushed off an opinion poll giving Labour a 4-point lead. He said
other recent surveys gave the Tories an advantage confirming that the two
parties were 'neck and neck' at about 40 per cent.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Letter: Work is one thing, but productivity is another
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr FRANK HELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It seems that the meaning of the term work ethic has become the subject
of political controversy. The Japanese prime minister is reported ('Miyazawa
queries US work ethic', February 4) to have accused the Americans of lacking
the work ethic, while the American president ('Bush responds to Japanese
work ethic jibe', February 5) is reported to have defended the American
approach to work.
Your readers may be interested to know that there has been some
cross-national research on this topic. Although the results are fairly
clear, their interpretation is not easy. When an international research
group asked large samples of people how central work was in their lives, the
Japanese scored the highest, but Yugoslavia came second and the US fourth,
after Israel. Work proved least central among those in the UK and (west)
Germany.
It seems that the importance of work in one's life is not the same as
effective productive, or even hard, work. It appears to have more to do with
what alternative activities are highly regarded. The older advanced
industrial countries: Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the US
have reached a different value hierarchy than the countries that started
industrialisation more recently.
A more policy-relevant finding from the same research shows that,
irrespective of nationality, the self-employed and people who enjoy a
measure of autonomy in their work have a significantly higher attachment to
work than other groups.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Parker prepares to write a new chapter: The image the pen
maker is trying to maintain as it looks for a buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A return to basics has swung Parker, the now British-based pen maker, from
loss to profit and put it on the lookout for a buyer with Pounds 300m to
spare.
The movement from the loss-making days of the mid-1980s appears complete.
But it has been a chequered path since the Dollars 100m management buy-out
staged by Mr Jacques Margry, Parker's chairman, and his fellow executives in
1986. In 1987 and 1988 Parker twice aborted flotation plans. In 1988 it was
the target of a failed friendly takeover offer of Pounds 180m by Pentland
Industries, a British group that had made a fortune with a stake in the
Reebok sports shoe business. Parker said at the time of its June 1988
flotation that the plan was abandoned because of stock market pessimism.
Image has been vital for the pen maker. Back in the 1960s, there could
hardly have been a finer symbol of meritocratic reward for a child who
passed the 11-plus exam than to be given a rolled-gold Parker 61 fountain
pen.
Mr George Parker, a Wisconsin teacher who founded the company in 1888, would
have been proud; academy and commerce linked through a symbol not simply of
status, but also of quality. Through most of its history, Parker has
maintained strongly defined branding, focused on quality and steering clear
of cheap disposability.
That brand image created loyalty. But loyalty is a fragile emotion in
business; it needs nursing. In the early 1980s, Parker tried to propel
itself into the mass disposable pen market, while keeping its up-market
image for other products. Parker came unstuck.
Enter Mr Margry. His answer, apparently successful, has been to turn back
the clock and return to the core brand value of quality.
A marketing specialist, he has been with the company for 42 years. A former
group area manager covering Europe, Mr Margry has throughout tried to hold
to a consistent marketing line: 'Our strategy had always been to position
Parker at the top of the market, not as a designer product, but as a
high-quality product which cost more but delivered more.'
Mr Margry's strategy was not always followed. In 1976, Parker started a
wide-front marketing battle, with a price war against one big competitor,
Shaeffer, at the top end of the market, and a foray into the disposable pen
business, taking on the Japanese with a ballpoint called Itala.
It was, for Mr Margry, a classic brand-confusing error. 'By going
down-market we confused the customer; the consumer no longer knew what
Parker stood for. We were all over the place, dissipating the advertising.'
The Parker Pen Company decided to sell off its writing instruments division
in 1985, following a series of losses which Mr Margry attributes di-rectly
to the marketing changes.
Following the January 1986 buy-out, Mr Margry and his team brought Parker
back into profit; 1987 showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.3m, compared with
a Pounds 300,000 loss in the previous year, on turnover up from Pounds 115m
to Pounds 128.7m. The years since 1987 have seen steady growth; operating
profit has increased an average 16.3 per cent annually, while sales have
yearly grown an average 7.3 per cent.
Mr Margry has no doubt that returning Parker to its traditional marketing
policy - which he sums up as 'not trying to chase every rabbit in the field'
 -has been the main factor behind its recent steady growth. Parker spends 80
per cent of its advertising budget promoting top-range pens; the other 20
per cent is for discretionary use by local managers.
Sales this year will be about Pounds 180m worldwide, says Mr Margry, out of
a total international market worth some Pounds 2.1bn annually at retail
prices. In the UK, Parker claims a dominating 53 per cent of the writing
instrument market, while Mont Blanc has 6 per cent, Waterman 5 per cent,
Shaeffer 7 per cent and Cross 6 per cent.
The marketing policy devised by Mr Margry has meant avoiding two extremes;
neither down-market into cheap disposables, nor following Mont Blanc (part
of the Dunhill group) up-market into the fountain pen as a designer
accessory. 'I think to market yourself as something to be purchased as a
status symbol is dangerous in the long term. Everyone who has made a perfume
or a dress wants to make pens; these are temporary markets,' says Mr Margry.
Mont Blanc would disagree. Mr Kevin Boltman, Mont Blanc's UK marketing
manager, says the company's advertising is deliberately designed to
encourage purchasers 'to think they are buying an aesthetic quality, a
luxury item, not just a pen'. To that end, Mont Blanc, whose factory is
based in Hamburg, 'has a limited distribution policy, to protect the brand
as a sort of Mercedes-Benz of pens'.
But for many, the top brand in pens is still Parker. Mr Gerry Grimstone, a
director of the merchant bank Schroder, has the task of steering it home to
a new buyer. He says Parker is looking for a buyer that will appreciate 'the
strengths of the global brand, of its international distribution network and
the continual product development which Parker performs. That is actually
unlikely to mean someone from the pen world'.
Mr Margry is looking for a buyer that values a quality brand, one that has
the royal warranties of the Queen and the Prince of Wales. Mr Grimstone is
talking to some 50 potential customers. He is confident a deal will soon be
signed; no doubt both sides will be using a top-of-the-range Pounds 3,000,
18-carat gold Parker Premier Presidential.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Answers that need repeating: FT writers talk to Nelson
Mandela about the ANC's policies on issues such as nationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT, ANDREW GOWERS, CAROLINE SOUTHEY and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NELSON Mandela has a credibility gap, and he knows it.
Fresh from rubbing shoulders with the elite at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, the African National Congress (ANC) president wryly
recalled the group discussions.
'They put all these questions, on nationalisation or violence, and I would
deal with them. At the end they would clap.' Mr Mandela paused, smiled
ruefully, and added: 'The following day, the same people raised the same
questions. In spite of their ovations, I had to start all over again.'
His Davos message - rethinking nationalisation, encouraging foreign
investment in a post-apartheid South Africa, honouring external debt - had
not been helped by apparently conflicting reports from Johannesburg. In his
London hotel room last Friday, on his way home, Mr Mandela spoke to the
Financial Times about a controversial week.
During a two-hour exchange he revealed his growing doubts about
nationalisation. He remained inflexible in his support for economic
sanctions. He repeated his personal preference for a coalition government,
'even assuming the ANC is returned with an overwhelming majority'.
Sometimes he gave the impression of making policy on the hoof, as in his
comments about alternatives to nationalisation. Sometimes he seemed
ingenuous, taking at face value welfare donations from big business. But it
was a remarkable performance: vigorous, articulate and good humoured.
Most of the questions raised, whether in Davos or by the FT, are not new.
But as South Africa moves closer to a post-apartheid government, in which
the ANC will have the prominent role, the answers become more pertinent.
It is two years ago tomorrow that the world's most famous political prisoner
walked free after 27 years in detention. Political power is now moving from
the white house of assembly to the multi-party Convention for a Democratic
South Africa (Codesa), where negotiations over an interim government are on
the verge of a breakthrough, says Mr Mandela. The ANC president has been
central to the process, with President FW de Klerk.
Neither man, however, can be entirely confident that his constituency will
hold up as the transition unfolds. Mr de Klerk's ruling National Party is
losing ground to the extreme right. Mr Mandela has to keep an eye on the
left wing of the ANC, and an angry young generation who are impatient for
radical change.
But while the white right fears majority rule, it does not differ from Mr de
Klerk on economic issues. For many black South Africans, however, economic
policy could determine their vote: state take-over of industry is synonymous
with rapid redistribution of wealth; and repudiating apartheid's debts can
be readily justified.
Last week, these two critical issues came under rigorous scrutiny, both by
Mr Mandela's black constituency and the business community. Mr Mandela's
reassurances at Davos were, it seemed, being questioned by both blocs at
home.
A draft of Mr Mandela's main address obtained by a Johannesburg weekly
business magazine contained a section - dropped from the final text - which
advocated putting 'some key enterprises into public ownership'.
And no sooner had Mr Mandela told delegates at Davos that an ANC government
would honour external debts, than the ANC publicity department in
Johannesburg promptly raised doubts.
It issued a statement implying that the ANC might not, in fact, honour loans
made to the 'present illegitimate South African regime and its agencies'.
New foreign borrowing had to await the installation of a multi-racial
interim government. Since the main advocate of this view within the ANC is
said to be Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the party's secretary general and viewed as a
potential successor to the 73-year-old Mr Mandela, the warning was
significant.
Mr Mandela tried to put the record straight in London. Mr Ramaphosa - 'a
young man of considerable ability destined to occupy a very important
position in our political life' - had not been accurately quoted. 'He
accepts the fact that it would be a disaster,' the ANC president said, 'to
say we would not pay the debts entered into by the regime.'
But while some questions were answered, uncertainties remained. A statement
issued on Friday by Mr Mandela accepted 'an obligation to pay foreign debts
. . . incurred by the present regime in the normal course of administration
before financial sanctions were imposed by the international community'.
What, anxious creditors might ask, was 'the normal course of administration'
under apartheid?
Recent South African bond issues, the statement continued, are 'totally
unacceptable', an attempt to 'bust financial sanctions adopted by the
international community'. Mr Mandela was asked what sanctions were being
busted.
'The sanctions which have hit South Africa most are the financial
sanctions,' he replied, 'because they cannot get loans from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank . . . Banks which have
now given a loan to South Africa are breaking those very sanctions.'
Mr Mandela is right in his reference to the IMF and the World Bank. But the
bond issues do not contravene any law other than the one the ANC leader went
on to enunciate: 'We have recommended to the international community that
sanctions be applied against South Africa by everybody. And anybody
therefore who violates those sanctions is not acting in the interests of the
people of South Africa as interpreted by us.'
If Mr Mandela seemed unrealistic on the issue of economic sanctions, most of
which have been repealed, his comments on nationalisation suggested a
fundamental change. The legacy of apartheid 'cannot just be addressed
through stimulating economic growth', he argued. 'Without state
intervention, it is impossible to achieve redistribution.'
Two years ago, most ANC officials - including Mr Mandela - would have said
nationalisation was the answer. Some officials still do. But Mr Mandela,
citing advice from world leaders with credentials which he must hope will
satisfy even the most radical of black South Africans, appears to have
undergone a change of heart.
The collapse of communism has strengthened the hand of critics of
nationalisation, he said. 'What is more, we have had discussions with people
like Li Peng, (prime minister of the Peoples Republic of China,) and they
have given us a different scenario.
'Li Peng, the head of a Marxist state, has said that difficulties which they
faced with their economy induced them to reduce state participation . . .
and they are considering other measures to reduce the involvement of the
state. Now that was a big shock]' exclaimed Mr Mandela, relishing his
anecdote and the chuckles from his audience.
Vietnam 'was even more disillusioning to us', revealed Mr Mandela, who is
inclined to use the Thatcher 'we'. A senior minister told him how Vietnam
had allowed 'more scope to private enterprise and to reduce state
participation. Very cautiously, very diplomatically, he suggested to us that
we had to examine the question of nationalisation.
'We want to attract investment,' he continued, 'but nationalisation is the
sword of Damocles hanging above the heads of the people who want to invest.
. . As long as nationalisation is our policy, it is clear to me that we are
not going to attract investors.'
He gave a clear indication of his thinking on nationalisation: the ANC
should 'be able to (achieve redistribution of wealth) without
nationalisation'. He suggested that he would prefer to redress the legacy of
apartheid in other ways: tax reforms, partnerships with the private sector
and by encouraging land redistribution through a land bank.
He was aware that a battle might be looming at the ANC policy conference
next April. 'I am not saying that my colleagues will be convinced that the
time has come to abolish nationalisation.' But he will tell them that they
have to choose between nationalisation and foreign investment.
As at Davos, however, Mr Mandela may have to repeat his message before it
gets through.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: 'When beauty is destroyed, God suffers' - Civil war
has inflicted more damage in Croatia than any world war / Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a bizarre and moving sight. A well-dressed evening crowd in London
stood before the glowing eye of a television set, their eyes riveted to film
of bombs and rockets blazing over the ancient city of Dubrovnik.
It was no ordinary gathering. The majority of the crowd were Croatians
either living or in exile in London. They had gathered to attend the opening
of an exhibition of photographs in London's Royal Festival Hall documenting
the tragic loss of much of the cultural heritage of their country. As the
sun went down and the floodlights came on along the banks of the Thames, it
was impossible not to compare the calmness of London with the brutal
destruction so recently inflicted upon the ancient cities of a European
neighbour.
'When beauty is destroyed, God suffers.' These were the poetic words of Dr
Stambuk, the UK representative of the Croatian government who spoke at the
opening of the exhibition. Dr Stambuk is both a medical doctor and a poet
and he movingly described both the loss of lives in the recent civil war in
Yugoslavia and the damage to the art and architecture of Croatia that is
part of the European cultural heritage. There are perhaps some 20,000 dead
in Croatia and some half a million refugees; thousands of homes, villages
and some 30 towns have been destroyed; and 400 churches have been ruined.
The Ministry of Culture and Education in Zagreb estimates that some 40 per
cent of the built fabric of Croatia has been ruined. The damage inflicted by
Federal forces is far worse than anything any part of the country
experienced during the Second World War. The question has to be asked: were
the ears of Europe sealed that it did not hear the cries of pain?
No one can deny that the cities of Zagreb, Dubrovnik and Split are important
places in the history and culture of Europe. It was Rebecca West, in her
book Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, who described Zagreb as having, 'the warm
and comfortable appearance of a town that has been well aired. People have
been living there in physical, but not political, comfort for a thousand
years. Moreover it is full of those vast toast-coloured buildings, barracks
and law courts and municipal offices, which are an invariable sign of past
occupancy by the Austro-Hungarian Empire'. It is not a flamboyant city. The
moderately elevated upper town still has its medieval character while the
lower town retains some sense of Imperial Vienna. The upper town was bombed
and attacked by rockets in a big air raid last October. Damage was inflicted
on more than 70 important buildings and the governor's palace was ravaged.
Photographs in the exhibition graphically show how rockets damaged rooftops
in the densely packed older parts of the city.
Dubrovnik has been exposed to destructive military and naval attacks since
the beginning of last October. It is hard to imagine this Dalmatian coastal
town, which has many of the qualities of Venice, being so brutally attacked,
so recently.
In some ways the remarkable 12th- and 13th-century walls may have fulfilled
their original function and helped protect the city from even worse damage.
At certain points the walls are some 30 feet thick and 80 feet high but
since November last year, when the historic centre was subjected to
incessant shelling, they have not been enough to defend the city.
The famous Minceta Tower - the best viewpoint for the city walls - the
northern and western ramparts and the Gate of Pila have all been directly
shelled and damaged. The two citadels of St John, Bokar and St Saviour have
also suffered serious damage.
It was last December 6 that the very heart of the famous old city
experienced a barbaric bombardment from Yugoslavian naval vessels. The
15th-century fountain designed by the Neapolitan architect Onofrio de la
Cava, which is like a great domed altar running with water, was badly hit.
The Sponza Palace, on the main square of Stari Grad, with its almost perfect
14th-century courtyard, has been damaged. This wonderful building is a
lovely mixture of the Renaissance style and Venetian Gothic. Its growth
shows that styles can mix, if a continuous civilisation builds with local
coherence and integrity. Added to this tragedy is the fact that archives
housed here dating back to the 12th century may have been destroyed.
A great part of the attraction of Dubrovnik lies in the unspoilt atmosphere
it maintained on its tiny, half mile wide, peninsula. It still felt like an
independent republic that never fell under the rule of Hungary or Venice. It
is a terrible irony that the city that resisted the Turks and other invaders
for so long is now being so badly damaged by civil war. The fearful damage
seems so wrong, as there have been no troops or military installations of
any importance in Dubrovnik since the 1960s.
Damage to its historic heart is equalled by the loss of many of the fine
summer houses around the city and the burning of many of the 16th-century
gardens that were so admired by Lord Byron. In the Gruz Port area almost
total destruction is reported, including the loss of two rare Renaissance
summer houses. The main street of the old city, Stradun, has been riven with
craters by grenades, and the cupola of the cathedral has been damaged. The
official estimates of the damage in Dubrovnik suggest that some 30 per cent
of the entire historic city centre has been heavily damaged and that 10 per
cent has been completely destroyed by fire.
There is also serious shell damage in the port of Split; and the old centres
of Vukovar, Osijek, Kostajnica, Otocac, Gospic and Petrinja have been
completely destroyed.
While it is possible to see the records of all this horrific cultural damage
in London at the Royal Festival Hall exhibition - also in displays at the
Courtauld Institute in Somerset House and the Photographers' Gallery in
Great Newport Street - anyone concerned with the culture of Europe must feel
the need to help Croatia. Both funds and expertise are badly needed.
An appeal is now launched under the auspices of the International Council on

RESULTS DUEBRITISH PETROLEUM is likely to report sharply lower pre-tax
profits for its fourth quarter on Thursday, following the steep decline in
oil prices late last year. Analysts' estimates go as low as Pounds 48m,
although this is expected to be boosted to just over Pounds 100m by gains
from asset sales. This compares with a fourth-quarter profit of Pounds 456m
for 1990.
Full-year profits for 1991 are also likely to be down on the previous year
by about 10 per cent to just under Pounds 1bn. All sectors are expected to
have shown a decline, including refining and nutrition. Chemicals is
expected to have made another loss.
Interest in the financial information and news group Reuters Holdings will
focus on Wednesday not so much on its annual results, but on how trials are
going of the long-delayed second phase of Dealing 2000, its automated
trading system for foreign exchange, and of Globex, which will provide
screen-based trading of futures and options.
Their success is likely to be very important to the future growth of
Reuters, which has had to cope with retrenchment in the world's financial
centres. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 334m to the
end of December, compared with Pounds 320m.
Amstrad, the consumer electronics group headed by Mr Alan Sugar, is expected
to announce an interim pre-tax loss of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m
tomorrow.
In a PC market disrupted by over-supply and weak consumer demand, Amstrad
has had to cut prices to combat competition from the likes of IBM and
Philips.
The first half is traditionally the better half for Amstrad as Christmas
boosts sales, but this past season, children bought Nintendos instead and
the company described sales in the run-up to Christmas as dramatically down
on the previous year. The one promising area, satellite dishes, has also
been weakening.
The consensus is, however, that the interim dividend at least will be
maintained as Amstrad has a strong balance sheet.
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is expected to report its first
yearly quarter fall in pre-tax profits when it announces its results on
Thursday. Forecasts for the three months to the end of December range from
Pounds 220m to Pounds 240m. Last year Hanson reported a 7 per cent increase
in taxable profits to Pounds 241m.
BOC, the UK industrial group, is expected to report a 9 per cent increase in
first-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 77.5m on Thursday, demonstrating its
strong defensive qualities during recession.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Economics: Spotlight falls on UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession-struck UK economy will be centre stage again this week, with
the usual mid-month welter of statistics.
Key data include the December manufacturing output and industrial production
figures published on Friday. These form the basis of the much awaited
fourth-quarter GDP figures due on February 20 which are widely expected to
show flat or negative non-oil growth - the sixth successive quarterly
decline.
Today's credit business figures will be watched closely for signs of a
pick-up in consumer confidence in December. Another net repayment is
expected following a reduction in the demand for credit in the three months
to November.
Attention will also focus on the inflationary pressures which remain in the
economy with underlying earnings expected to touch a new low of 7.25 per
cent, the lowest annual rate recorded since 1981.
In the US, optimists on prospects for economic growth this year are unlikely
to find much succour for their views in this week's statistics. January
retail sales are expected to remain dormant following a disappointing
Christmas sales season. But inflation has continued to decelerate with the
producer price index for January likely to remain unchanged.
Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of City forecasts in brackets,
from MMS International, a financial information company, include:
Today: UK, final retail sales for December (down 1.0 per cent), December
credit business (net repayment of Pounds 50m). Canada, motor vehicles sales
in December, January housing starts. Norway, January consumer price index.
Tomorrow: UK, producer price index for January - output (up 0.7 per cent on
month, up 4.5 per cent on year), input (up 0.1 per cent on month, down 0.6
per cent on year), Bank of England publishes quarterly bulletin. US,
December wholesale trade, Federal Reserve chairman Greenspan addresses
Independent Bankers Association. Japan, National Foundation holiday - all
markets closed. Canada, department store sales in December.
Wednesday: France, fourth-quarter employment. US, December housing
completions. Japan, machinery orders in December. Australia, retail trade in
December (up 1.0 per cent).
Thursday: US, retail sales in January (up 0.2 per cent), excluding autos (up
0.4 per cent), M1 (Dollars 13.5bn), M2 (Dollars 6.2bn), M3 (Dollars 8bn) for
January, M1 (-Dollars 3bn), M2 (-Dollars 1.9bn), M3 (-Dollars 0.5bn) for
week ended February 7, initial claims for week ended February 2 (450,000),
auto sales February 1-10 (5.8m). UK, January unemployment (up 30,000),
January vacancies (up 5,000), average earnings in December (7.25 per cent).
Spain, January consumer price index (up 1.7 per cent on month, up 6.1 per
cent on year). Sweden, January unemployment rate, December current account.
Japan, January trade balance (Dollars 3bn). Australia, employment in January
(down 10,000), January unemployment rate (10.6 per cent), Canada, December
unfilled orders.
Friday: UK, January retail price index (up 0.1 per cent on month, up 4.4 per
cent on year), excluding mortgage interest payments (up 5.8 per cent on
year), December manufacturing output (up 0.1 per cent on month, down 2.9 per
cent on year), December industrial production (up 0.1 per cent), December

cent on month, down 2.1 per cent on year). Sweden, January trade balance
(SKr3.2bn). Australia, November import price index.
During the week: Germany, December retail sales (flat on the year).
Netherlands, December trade balance (NLG1.7bn). Denmark, January, consumer

FT  10 FEB 92 / Management: Bank tots up the cost of coddling toddlers -
Childcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost to an employer of replacing an experienced employee is a year's
salary. The cost of subsidising childcare for the first four years of an
infant's life is about half that.
When Midland Bank made this calculation at the end of the 1980s, it
concluded that helping mothers with childcare must make good commercial
sense. Three years later, Midland is providing almost as many nursery places
as the rest of the private sector put together. It is involved in more than
100 nurseries, offering places to nearly 1,000 Midland babies and toddlers.
Already the scheme is having results. In 1989, no fewer than 1,400 women at
the bank became pregnant, but only 30 per cent returned to work. The latest
figures suggest that about 50 per cent are returning. While not all the
improvement can be attributed to the nurseries, Midland believes that they
have played a big part. 'We found that for the majority of women, childcare
was a major barrier to promotion,' says Anne Watts, equal opportunities
director.
The bank will not be drawn on how much it has spent on the scheme, because
it fears the giddy cost would put off other companies.
'I am conscious that we are pioneers in this,' says Watts. 'Other employers
would look at our figures and say that they were totally unrealistic.' Even
Midland seems to be baulking a little. It no longer talks of the 300
nurseries that it mentioned at the outset. Instead it plans to hold the
total at about 120 for now.
Midland has a direct interest in encouraging other employers to start
similar schemes and is disappointed that not one has yet done so. Almost all
its nurseries are run as partnerships - usually with the public sector.
Running nurseries on its own is prohibitively expensive: the more willing
partners there are, the lower the costs, as the overheads can be spread more
thinly.
Watts blames the absence of imitators on recession and the cuts in most
companies' workforces. The other culprit is the government. 'It has set up
conferences and said: 'It would be jolly good if you get together'. But it
has done nothing.'
At the moment the cost of providing workplace nurseries is tax deductible
for private-sector employers. For industrial companies, the capital costs
may also qualify for capital buildings allowance. For the employee, the
benefit is tax deductable, but only when the employer is involved in
financing and running the nursery. However, Watts argues that this does not
go far enough, and that the government should be more active.
The bank decided to become directly involved in childcare - rather than
simply hand out subsidies to staff - because it recognised the problem for
working mothers was not just financial. Nurseries and childminders were in
short supply and their quality uncertain.
At each nursery, Midland guarantees that the premises are up to scratch,
that there are enough staff and that the children are learning as well as
playing. The bank shares the cost with employees, who pay Pounds 42 to
Pounds 58 a week towards a total cost of around Pounds 100.
But with just 1,000 places available - against 60,000 employees - the
nurseries are not a benefit for everyone.
Instead, Midland allocates them in hard-nosed commercial fashion. It
supplies childcare in areas where it is having trouble recruiting staff,
recognising that a nursery has great pulling power. When the Midland
advertised for jobs in Jersey where workers are in short supply, the promise
of subsidised childcare brought more than 200 enquiries on the first day.
Even in areas where a Midland nursery exists, employees are not assured a
place. Priority is given to those whom the bank is particularly anxious to
keep, because their skills are in short supply, or because they would be
expensive to replace. Although Midland may have abandoned a target of 300
nurseries, Watts stresses that it has not had second thoughts about the need
for childcare. Instead, the bank is channelling money into other areas.
It has started holiday play arrangements for the over-fives.
It also offers employees - male and female - five days off a year on full
pay to deal with sick children or other crises at home.
Parents are also allowed a break of up to five years, with their jobs back
at the end of it.
The one important area which it has not attempted to tackle is after-school
care for children. This, it reckons is something the government should do.
A handful of other big employers have made gestures, but most are
peripheral. At Dixons, the electrical retailer, much was made of a scheme
that offers term-time working contracts to men and women. That was three
years ago, and only 30 people have taken it up.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Management: Keeping bosses up to the mark - The introduction
of schemes in which staff assess managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FIONA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From time to time, John Ainley would turn and gaze out of his office window
when listening to a colleague who had called in for a talk.
He had no idea why he did it. Similarly, he had no idea of the adverse
impact his window-gazing was having. Until, that is, one of his colleagues
told him.
The opportunity to make the small, but by no means insignificant, point
arose as part of a radical scheme of upward appraisal - in which staff
assess their managers - launched by W H Smith, the retailer, in late 1990.
It was, in fact, Ainley, who was responsible - as the company's personnel
manager - for suggesting and implementing the programme. It now seems
blindingly obvious to Ainley that this is an untapped source of information.
Who knows the quality of a manager better than those who are managed?
Bottom-up assessment, upward feedback, upward appraisal - call it what you
will - is not uncommon in the US; IBM has been applying it worldwide since
the 1960s. But it is still largely untried in Britain.
W H Smith and BP Exploration have so far taken the plunge and a number of
blue chip companies are actively considering similar schemes.
The prevailing attitude in many hierarchical British companies is that only
bosses are entitled to assess the performance of staff. That the staff
should also have informed opinions about managers seems daring. That they
should be asked to make formal assessments of their bosses might appear
revolutionary.
Ainley has been approached by some 500 companies about upward appraisal.
'They share the fear that we had. If you're asking the staff what they think
of your managers, you're asking them what they think of your company. And I
think you need to be a brave company to take that decision,' he said.
For Ainley, the assessments presented an obvious solution to a problem. In
the light of demographic change and the need to retain experienced
employees, the company wanted to reduce staff turnover. It also wanted to
attract new people.
A survey of employees established that the attitude of individual managers
was the most important factor determining whether staff felt W H Smith was a
good place to work.
'We felt that the best way to obtain views about how a manager was
performing was to ask the staff,' says Ainley.
Upward assessment was initially introduced on a voluntary basis but it was
soon extended to a full survey of all 400 senior managers.
From the outset, managers were keenly aware that their jobs involved making
tough decisions - not calculated to make them popular. And yet they were
being judged by those who felt the effects of the decisions. What is more,
coming under scrutiny in a survey which was conducted anonymously presented
a golden opportunity to the disaffected to air their grievances.
W H Smith devised its own survey, internally. It asked members of staff to
rate 32 characteristics of their boss on the attributes of a good manager.
They were also invited to place in order their choice of the top six
qualities of a good manager.
'We found that the staff were very understanding of the fact that a
manager's job is not just to be a nice guy all the time,' said Ainley. The
survey revealed positive messages about the managers' skills in
decision-making and running an efficient ship.
More question marks were raised over their abilities to deal with personal
relations and to motivate individuals. 'It certainly has made managers
consider very carefully the way in which they relate to their staff.'
The company, in turn, has identified a basic need for what Ainley defines as
inter-personal skills training: the ability to discuss personal
difficulties, to talk openly and honestly at an early stage when performance
problems arise; to make the most of individuals who might otherwise be
written off - but who might instead be 'turned around'.
The findings of the W H Smith survey were relayed to the managers
themselves, their immediate bosses and to the managing director - but not
automatically to the staff who had taken part. It was left up to each
manager to decide whether to follow through the survey with his or her own
team, with between 40 and 50 per cent opting to do so.
Ainley reckons many more will do so when the next study is carried out. Many
of those who chose to discuss the findings apparently found it a valuable,
barrier-breaking exercise. How else do you thrash out questions like the
tricky business of window-gazing?
It can be a cleansing experience, says Joyce Willard, senior consultant at
Forum Europe, which advises companies introducing upward appraisal schemes.
Further, it could also be a hurtful one, unless well handled.
The type of exercise conducted at BP Exploration, advised by Forum, is
devised to overcome that risk with a neutral 'facilitator' on hand at such
after-the-event meetings of the team with the manager to ensure that there
is a constructive debate which does not descend into petty personal
point-scoring.
In BP Exploration's upward- feedback scheme, employees were asked to
complete a confidential questionnaire seeking their views on management
practices - first in general terms and then in relation to their own
manager. They were asked to rate, on a scale of one to five, the importance
of attributes like 'being effective at initiating change' or 'agreeing
challenging and achievable performance goals and standards with employees'.
They were then asked to rate their own boss in terms of each of these aims.
The manager then received a written report, summarizing the team's responses
but not making any individual identifiable. Forum recommends that the
manager concerned should, in the first instance, be guided through the
findings in order to gain the maximum from the information provided. The
report can bring surprises of both sorts, pleasing and upsetting.
'The follow-up team meetings can become quite personal,' said Willard. 'For
example, one of the management practice questions is 'To what extent does
your manager meet regularly with staff to discuss their career objectives?'
The response comes back that it's very infrequent.
'The boss will say 'My god, we do it all the time. Tell me, where am I
failing?' And they all start coughing up examples: 'Well, you haven't met
with me for 12 months.' Or 'You asked me in the corridor the other day how I
was doing with regard to such and such a plan - and I said fine, but that's
not a career discussion.'
'They can become very personal because the examples will get closer and
closer to reality. But that's the interesting thing. When a manager begins
to hear those examples, usually they don't take it personally. Rather it's
'Oh, is that how you understood that? I didn't mean it that way'.'
Willard maintains that upward assessment providing this sort of feedback
brings proven benefits to companies undertaking such exercises. And to the
individual manager, being assessed? 'Overwhelmingly,' she says.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Treasury asks for forecasting input from industrialists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP INDUSTRIALISTS are to be invited to an advisory panel to feed insights
on economic trends to the Treasury under a plan to improve the government's
forecasting record and strengthen dialogue with business.
The initiative comes as the government seeks to counter criticism ahead of
the general election that it has misjudged the seriousness of the recession
and become too detached from the views of industry.
There would be regular meetings between senior Treasury officials, led by
Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary, and a team of industrialists.
Treasury economists are revising down their forecasts for this year's growth
after conceding that the recession is dragging on longer than they expected
last year. The new forecasts will be announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, in his Budget statement on March 10.
In recent months, ministers have indicated concern that Labour, which is
stressing a pro-industry stance, may capture a large share of the votes of
business people. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, is co-ordinating
a broad government effort to improve relations with industry.
The Treasury said that the idea of holding 'systematic and regular' contacts
with industry had come from business representatives.
The timetable for establishing the meetings has yet to be decided but the
department said that 'nothing is likely to be announced before the Budget'.
Senior business representatives welcomed news of the initiative. Mr Miles
Middleton, president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce,
said the Treasury had made a 'fundamental mistake' in recent years in not
talking enough to people from industry. He added that the Treasury's
forecasting record was 'lousy'.
Mr David Wigglesworth, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's
economic situation committee, said: 'Anything that improves the links
between the Treasury and industrialists would be to everyone's advantage.'

FT  10 FEB 92 / Supermarket food seen as expensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY SHOPPERS believe that food prices are high in big supermarkets,
according to a survey published today.
Verdict, the retail consultants, found that 57 per cent of shoppers thought
that most products were expensive in supermarkets.
Just over 30 per cent disagreed, while the remainder had no opinion.
The findings might spur a further round of price-cutting by the big
supermarket chains with the aim of influencing public perceptions.
In the past few months, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Asda have all run aggressive
price-cutting promotions. These have been partly a response to recent media
reports which suggested they were charging higher prices than food retailers
in other European countries.
However, in a separate report on the structure of the food retailing
industry, Business Strategies (BSL), an economic research group, largely
absolves the supermarkets of the charge that they are making excessive
pro-fits.
BSL criticises those who have made much of the differences in margins
between UK and continental European food retailers. It says the most
efficient operators in the UK enjoy net margins of more than 6 per cent or
about double those achieved on the Continent.
BSL argues that this disparity is largely accounted for by differences in
accounting and taxation practice, law and commercial philosophy.
The return on capital employed by UK food retailers is very similar to that
on the Continent, it suggests.
Verdict's study showed the recession has been markedly influencing consumer
shopping patterns.
It found that 42 per cent of shoppers were adopting a more tactical approach
to shopping and were waiting to make their big purchases in sales.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Lord Mayor backs change for Somerset House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRIAN JENKINS, the Lord Mayor of London, will tonight launch a campaign
to make Somerset House a promotional showcase for London, John Willman
writes.
The 18th century building is the headquarters of the Inland Revenue and
houses parts of the Lord Chancellor's Department.
Both are due to vacate Somerset House soon. Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, has invited suggestions for an 'imaginative public
use' of the building, which already houses the Courtauld Collection of fine
art.
Sir Brian is expected to say that London is alone among leading cities in
not having a promotional centre which would provide a showcase for business
opportunities, display available properties and offer information for those
wishing to set up in the capital.
The proposal will be backed by Westminster City Council and the London
Docklands Development Corporation.
As a first step, the Corporation of London, the local authority for the
City, is to launch an architectural exhibition in May in conjunction with
the Architectural Foundation. This will display all buildings in the City.
The exhibition - to be shown in the Royal Exchange - is designed to tour
European cities. But Sir Brian will propose that it be given a permanent
home in Somerset House and could be part of the showcase.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Global warming threat reaches council agendas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNERS will have to consider the threat of global warming at local level
for the first time under planning guidelines to be announced today by Sir
George Young, minister for planning.
The guidelines would oblige councils to take account of the rising sea level
as a result of global warming when giving permission to build in low-lying
areas.
Sir George will also announce proposals that will encourage planners to take
account of public transport and to site housing so as to minimise car use
for journeys to work or school.
The government guidance will incorporate into local planning for the first
time the concept of protecting the environment through sustainable
development.
The intention is not to hold back economic growth, but to strike a balance
between growth and the environment.
The proposals involve greater use of public transport and improved energy
conservation as a means of curbinggreenhouse gases which cause global
warming.
Mr Tony Burton, senior planning officer for the Council for the Protection
of Rural England, said that the move was the most significant step to
incorporate wider environmental concerns into the UK planning system.
The proposals are in government guidance which has to be observed by county
councils in their strategic plans and by district councils in making local
development plans.
It would also have to be taken into consideration when hearing appeals by
developers against planning decisions.
Patterns of travel influence emissions of carbon dioxide, the main
greenhouse gas, and would have to be changed, the guidelines say. To reduce
emissions, new development should take place in locations which reduce the
need for car journeys and distances driven.
Policies should be designed to control pollution and limit nuisances such as
noise, smell and dirt, the guidelines add.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Dispute over the need for Trident fails to submerge: The
future of the nuclear deterrent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HMS VANGUARD, first of Britain's Trident nuclear-missile submarines, is
being readied for its first appearance. The day is set, but not yet made
public, for it to leave VSEL's dock hall at Barrow-in-Furness and to be
lowered into the water.
It will be the coming-out ceremony for a programme that until recently
appeared to be slipping out of the focus of political controversy. But in
the past few weeks, with the US and Russia proposing deep cuts in their
nuclear arsenals, with more jobs being cut at the VSEL yard, and with an
impending general election, the debate surrounding the new Pounds 10bn
nuclear deterrent has suddenly been revived.
For the first time, cancellation of the programme is on none of the main
parties' election agendas. Ironically, Labour's shift since 1987 towards
accepting Trident and backing its deployment happened just as the cold war,
which gave Trident its raison d'etre, was melting away. The remaining
argument is about the size and firepower of the Trident fleet, due to start
being deployed in the mid 1990s.
The row began again over the weekend when Mr John Major, the prime minister,
repeated his commitment to Trident. Labour is committed to stopping the
fourth Trident boat but there are signs that the party may try to get off
that hook if it wins the general election, partly for the sake of jobs at
Barrow.
Work on 'long-lead items' for the fourth boat has been under way for some
time, pending completion of contract negotiations, and Pounds 138m has been
spent on it - about a quarter of the building cost.
The four-submarine fleet has been conceived with the idea that there will
always be one boat undergoing refit. A second will usually either be
preparing for a refit or 'working up' after one. This leaves two in the
'operational cycle', but there may be only one of those actually on patrol,
with the other in transit.
Maintaining the credibility of a UK deterrent, the argument goes, means
being in a position to use it at all moments and having at least one
submarine on patrol. With four new boats there will often be two on patrol
and sometimes three. But with old boats it can be a struggle to keep to the
minimum.
Britain's Polaris fleet is due to continue in service until the third
Trident boat goes to sea. Renown has been in refit since 1987. Reported to
have suffered cracks in its reactor piping, it should have been out more
than two years ago. Revenge, another Polaris boat, has had a long-overdue
refit cancelled. This leaves the main burden on the remaining two
submarines.
Submarines could fire their missiles without leaving the Faslane base in
Scotland. But keeping an ocean patrol is a central tenet of UK deterrence
policy. A submarine's value is that its whereabouts remain secret, it is
immune to pre-emptive attack and will therefore always be in a position to
retaliate. Officials reject the idea that it could perform the same role in
port. If it then put to sea in the midst of a crisis, it could provoke,
rather than deter, an escalation.
More flexible, in the official view, is the firepower installed in the
Trident submarines. Like the Polaris boats, they will carry up to 16
missiles each. These missiles, which will be collected in the US and then
mated with their British warheads, are more accurate than their
predecessors, with a range of up to 5,000 miles compared with less than
2,500 miles for Polaris.
The Polaris missiles, which Britain updated with its own Chevaline system in
the 1970s, carry up to three warheads. The Trident II was designed for up to
12, but the government (after switching its choice of missile from the
Trident I) stuck to a maximum of eight. In practice it is expected to
produce far fewer than the 512 warheads which would be needed to provide
full payloads for four fully armed submarines. Requirements may now be
reduced in the light of US-Soviet disarmament.
Mr Tom King, defence secretary, has refused to hint at how low the total
might go, but has confirmed that 'we're not going to carry the maximum'.
With concerns shifting to possible threats from countries with newly
acquired nuclear and ballistic missiles, Royal Navy officers argue that the
Trident system is flexible enough to enable it to adapt, taking on a
'sub-strategic' as well as a strategic mission.
In the east-west context, the case for 'sub-strategic' weapons has been to
give credibility to the threat of nuclear retaliation, providing an
intermediate option short of ultimate devastation.
Apart from Polaris, Britain's main nuclear weapons are ageing RAF bombs. The
government plans to replace these with aircraft-launched missiles - at a
cost estimated at up to Pounds 2.5bn - but has put off a decision on whether
to join a French missile programme or buy a suitable weapon from the US.
The case put for an air-launched 'sub-strategic' weapon is that it would
would serve as a deterrent against, say, a Third World dictator. In such a
case, the threat of using the full force of a strategic weapon system might
not be taken seriously.
Ministry of Defence officials are sticking to the idea that Britain needs
separate strategic and sub-strategic weapons. But the debate is very much
open. A recently retired army officer put the issue succinctly: 'Do we
really now need a second ticket to Armageddon?'

FT  10 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): TGWU plans higher fees to combat debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TGWU general workers' union plans to increase contributions by more than
18 per cent in an attempt to balance its budget this year after several
years of losses.
The increase, which is likely to be approved by a special delegate
conference this week, should raise an extra Pounds 1m a month, which is
roughly equivalent to the rate of the losses.
Members will be asked to pay a further 21p a week. This will take the weekly
contribution to Pounds 1.35, which is below the average level for union dues
but slightly above the contribution to the GMB, the other main general
union.
The TGWU expects to make savings this year of about Pounds 5m. That, with
the extra income from the contributions increase, should enable it to
balance its budget.
The union's structure and finances are being examined by Klein &amp; Co, a US
management consultancy which is expected to produce an interim report at the
end of next month.
Mr Ron Todd, the TGWU's retiring general secretary, said: 'This is an
important increase. The union's leadership is determined to balance our
budget this year after several years of running a deficit.'

FT  10 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Asylum bill warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY genuine asylum-seekers will be denied natural justice and could be
returned to countries where they face imprisonment, torture and death unless
the government's Asylum Bill is amended, the Law Society warned yesterday,
Robert Rice writes.
Proposals in the bill scheduled to have its second reading in the Lords
shortly would create 'a barrier to justice' by requiring asylum-seekers to
apply for leave to appeal before they could challenge a refusal of refugee
status, the society said.
Applications for leave to appeal would be considered without an oral
hearing. This would deprive asylum-seekers of the chance to present their
case at the vital point of entry into the appeals system.
This denial of natural justice would be compounded by the extreme speed of
the new system, the society warned. Many asylum-seekers would have as little
as two days in which to prepare and present their case for leave to appeal.
The society said this was an insufficient period in which to prepare their
cases properly, particularly if they were in detention and found it
difficult to contact a legal adviser. If they were refused leave to appeal
there would be no further appeals and they could face immediate removal from
the UK.

FT  10 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Bargaining shift triggers increase in
personnel managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of personnel managers has more than doubled in the past 10 years
because of the shift from national to plant-level bargaining, and about half
of the total are women.
Membership of the Institute of Personnel Management, the main professional
body for personnel managers, has grown from 20,000 to more than 47,000 over
the past decade. During the past six years the organisation's membership has
grown steadily at 10 per cent a year.
Not all personnel managers are members of the institute, but Mr Leslie
Walford, an institute official, said that between 60 per cent and 70 per
cent of them were thought to belong to the organisation.
Mr Walford said that one important cause of the growth in membership was the
devolution of a wide range of industrial relations issues, including pay,
from national and company level to plant level.
In the past, pay negotiations in large companies may have been handled by
two or three people at head office.
But separate negotiations are now often conducted at each plant with a
corresponding increase in the number of managers required.
Mr Walford said another reason for the expansion of the personnel function
was increasing specialisation in subjects such as pensions. The most
commercially aggressive organisations employ the most personnel managers,
with the ratio of personnel managers to employees three times higher in the
private sector than the public sector, according to a study by Chater
Associates Management Consultants, an Oxford-based consultancy.
The CAMC study, of more than 150 organisations shows that there are 280
employees per personnel manager in the public sector and only 109 in the
private sector.
Within the public sector, health authorities have a higher-than-average
ratio of one personnel manager to every 237 staff. In the private sector
retailers are below average with 164 employees per personnel manager.
Japanese-owned enterprises are way above average with a personnel manager
for every 62 employees.
'An organisation top heavy with personnel specialists is not necessarily an
inefficient one,' the study says.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DEVELOPMENTS in the complex disputes between Lloyd's Names
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the individuals whose assets back underwriting at insurance market - and the
agents who handle their affairs, are set to take a new twist in the next few
days.
With the ink barely dry on the out-of-court settlement ending the
long-running Warrilow dispute - and a similar outcome possible in the
mammoth action between 987 Names on Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 and more
than 80 agents - further litigation is on the cards.
A report - commissioned by Names and prepared by Rodney-Smith &amp; Partners,
the accountancy firm, will be published in the next 10 days - is likely to
provide new ammunition for Names on loss-stricken catastrophe reinsurance
syndicates. The report could lead the Names to seek injunctions to prevent
agents from drawing cash from their deposits. These are placed with the
agents when Names join Lloyd's and are drawn upon when Names fail to meet
cash calls from their other financial resources.
Such a move would spark confrontation with the authorities governing the
insurance market.
Agents announced in January that just more than Pounds 100m is needed from
syndicates managed by Gooda Walker within the next few weeks. Names on other
catastrophe syndicates could face similar calls.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names action group,
said last week that his members were becoming 'neurotic' about the threat to
call in bank guarantees.
The Rodney-Smith report, commissioned by the Gooda Walker and Rose Thompson
Young action groups, examines the 'spiral' reinsurance arrangements - in
which Lloyd's syndicates reinsure and retroinsure (the reinsurance of
reinsurance) each other's exposures to catastrophe risks. This formed the
bulk of business written by both groups.
According to Mr Martin Rodney-Smith the report lends 'strong support' to the
legal opinion obtained last October by Withers, the solicitors acting for
Gooda Walker Names, from Mr Gavin Lightman QC. Mr Lightman said that if it
were shown that the contracts were not in the interests of Names they could
be 'voidable'. This means that the contracts contain flaws which enable
Names to apply to have them set aside.
In his opinion Mr Lightman also stressed the importance of other parties to
the con-tract - who are other reinsurers - knowing that the contracts were
not in Names' interests.
Mr Rodney-Smith says that the report shows that the close-knit character of
the catastrophe reinsurance market means 'participants would have been aware
not only of the nature of each other's book of business but also, in all
probability if not certainty, of each other's reinsurance programme,'
'It was regular practice for syndicates to reinsure business in and reinsure
it out with the same syndicates,' he added.
If Mr Lightman agrees that the report does prove the case for 'voidability',
Names are likely to be advised to seek an injunction.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Moscow business centre wins backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO initiatives to promote enterprise in central and eastern Europe have
been announced by the government. They are a business-support centre in
Moscow and a conference in London of employment ministers from 11 former
Communist states.
The first Russian support centre for small businesses will open in Moscow in
September with the help of finance provided by Britain's Know-How Fund, Mr
Michael Howard, employment secretary, said. The Pounds 50m fund was
established in 1989 to help countries in east and central Europe to develop
market-oriented economies.
The centre, which will provide advice and training to small-business owners
and would-be entrepreneurs, is intended to be the forerunner of a network
throughout Russia.
The announcement of the planned opening follows visits by British experts to
Moscow to provide advice on staffing the centre, staff training, the
availability of premises and equipment, and help with evaluating the needs
of entrepreneurs in Russia. A team of Russian experts paid a two-week return
visit to the UK, leaving for home last Saturday.
In a further move to help eastern European countries develop more
enterprising economies, the government has invited the employment ministers
from 11 countries to a conference in London this month.
Delegates will examine the political and practical difficulties of
establishing an enterprise culture and promoting the growth of small
companies. Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and
the three Baltic states are expected to send delegates. The International
Labour Organisation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
will also be represented.
Twenty managers from businesses in St Petersburg are due at Manchester
Business School today at the start of a four-week management development
programme. They come from businesses involved in boat building, hotel
construction, fashion knitwear and computer science.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Ashdown opposes tighter press curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday joined Mr John
Major, the prime minister, in opposing tighter controls on the press, in
spite of his party's anger last week at the treatment of the news of an
affair he had five years ago.
Weekend opinion polls showed a sharp rise in Mr Ashdown's popularity,
calming party strategists' fears about the electoral impact of Mr Ashdown's
disclosure, which was forced by the theft of documents from his solicitor.
Although he believed his personal life was not a matter of public interest,
Mr Ashdown said he would not vote for a privacy bill. He expressed alarm,
however, at the apparent willingness of the media prepared to use papers
obtained by criminal means.
'If the press will not even draw the line at the use of stolen documents,
which in any other circumstances is a crime, we are in a very dangerous
situation indeed,' he said on London's LBC radio.
Mr Ashdown said the increase in his support said 'more about the decency and
generosity of the British people than it does about me'.
An NOP poll for the Independent on Sunday showed 47 per cent of voters
thought Mr Ashdown was doing well in his job - his highest-ever rating and
13 percentage points higher than last month.
Mr Major said that to inhibit the press would be 'a very substantial'
change. He added: 'We have had a free press in this country for all its good
points - and sometimes its excesses - for a long time.'
Liberal Democrats will seek to bring the political agenda back to policy
issues this week with a series of statements on constitutional reform.
Meanwhile, as fears intensify about a 'dirty war' in the run-up to the
general election, Mr Des Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' campaign strategist,
is considering using the Data Protection Act to investigate Tory computer
files on Liberal Democrat MPs and officials.
His concern follows reports that Conservative Central Office used a credit
agency for information on a Welsh Liberal Democrat activist.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Ministers go into battle over surcharges: A controversy
about poll tax that continues to dog the government's footsteps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO IS having to foot the bill for the poll-tax non-payers? 'The vast
majority of law-abiding citizens in this country - that's who', Mr Michael
Heseltine, the environment secretary, declaimed recently.
In the run-up to the general election, the government continues to be
haunted by controversy over the poll tax. In particular, the surcharge for
non-payment which is shown separately on poll-tax bills, has been the cause
of much anger among many voters.
While formally the surcharge appears on the bill as 'other adjustments'
which include items such as the revenue from the standard community charge
on second homes, it is broadly seen as the extra needed to make up for
non-payment.
Ministers and officials privately admit that this was a political and
presentational mistake. One minister said: 'It illustrates in microcosm the
basic problems with the poll tax.'
These problems are very visible, especially for a tax which raises so little
revenue. The poll tax itself has too high a profile, considering that it
raises only about 15 per cent - or under Pounds 10bn - of local-government
spending in England and less in Wales and Scotland.
The surcharge will raise only a fraction of that amount, yet it still has a
distinct identity as a separate charge. By contrast, VAT in 1990-91, its
last year at 15 per cent in raised Pounds 31bn.
The poll-tax surcharge is hard to collect. Beyond the familiar difficulty of
collecting a personal local tax when people regularly move house - which
helps to account for the existence of the surcharge in the first place - it
engenders particular resentment among those who do pay their poll tax.
It is difficult to assign blame for non-collection. For every time that Mr
Heseltine lambasts Labour councils' inefficiency, Labour can point to the
prime minister's own characterisation of the tax as 'virtually
uncollectable'.
Anecdotal evidence is already being produced about a new class of voters who
realise that they are being asked to subsidise non-payers and refuse to do
so.
One or two Tory MPs have been drawn close to making the moral case for not
paying. 'I see no reason why people who have paid their contribution to
local services should have to contribute to services for those who have
not,' one said during Commons discussion of the council tax.
The surcharge will ensure that some poll taxes will be forced over the
Pounds 300 mark, which is seen by many voters as an upper limit of
acceptability. Ministers have already admitted that their target poll tax of
Pounds 257 will be overshot.
The government estimates its target figure will be overshot by about Pounds
15 but that is lower than a forecast from the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy, representing most local authority treasurers, which
puts the overshoot at about Pounds 21.
The decision to show the level of surcharge so clearly on poll-tax bills
derives from the work of Mr David King, a senior economics lecturer at the
University of Stirling. When advising the government on the poll tax, he
made the case for greater transparency in bills.
At that time, with a much weaker regime for capping local expenditure,
ministers were concerned with council overspending rather than prospective
poll-tax non-collection.
Mr King's proposal to itemise charges was endorsed by Mr Michael Howard,
then local government minister. The belief - which remains unfulfilled - was
that when local taxpayers saw how much more they had to pay than the
government had planned, they would press their council to be more efficient.
It seems that the lesson of spelling out the surcharge has not been lost on
the government.
'You won't find a similar figure on the council-tax bill,' one minister
said.

FT  10 FEB 92 / PM outlines manifesto 'pillars'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR told Young Conservatives at the weekend that individual
choice, opportunity, ownership and responsibility would be the 'pillars' of
his manifesto.
Mr Chris Patten, party chairman, told the Young Conservatives' conference in
Eastbourne, that economic competence and taxation, defence and 'leadership'
would provide the core of the party's attack on Labour. His slogan was that
the Tories offered economic recovery and Labour permanent recession.
Some of the details have been held back to give substance to a
carefully-planned series of announcements over the next few weeks, but the
Conservatives have now marked out clearly the ground on which they intend to
fight the general election.
The themes would not have looked out of place in a manifesto crafted by Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, Mr Major's predecessor as prime minister and party
leader. But the government, Mr Major insisted, would never forget those who
had been 'knocked off' the ladder of opportunity or the need for a 'free'
National Heath Service.
The emphasis on individual choice which already runs through the
Conservatives' tax, education, and privatisation policies is to be
progressively strengthened in the approach to the election.
A white paper later this week on employment and training will signal a
further push to establish the primacy of the individual over collective
agreements in the workplace. There may also be proposals to extend to adults
the scheme to give individual training vouchers to the young unemployed.
A consultation paper next month will foreshadow a manifesto commitment to
break the local authorities' remaining grip on housing by the introduction
of compulsory competitive tendering for housing management.
There will also be further efforts to promote the Citizen's Charter as the
instrument through which individuals can assert their rights against the
state.
Mr Major edged back from a detailed plan for the privatisation of British
Rail, preferring to talk of the 'break-up' of the rail monopoly.
He foreshadowed a series of pledges to reinforce personal ownership.
Alongside a reduction in inheritance tax, the promise is for tax incentives
for share ownership and other savings and - the recession notwithstanding -
an attempt to extend the sale of council houses and flats.
Opportunity and responsibility are presented as the mirror image of the
drive for choice and ownership. Ownership will provide opportunity; choice
will confer responsibility.
The aim is to develop each of them in a detailed programme of announcements
planned for the next few weeks.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be expected to pull together many of
the strands in his Budget on March 10. If all goes to plan, Mr Major will
draw in the rest in a speech four days later at the Conservative Central
Council. That speech is intended to launch the election campaign proper.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Cut in VAT seen as best stimulant for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEMPORARY cut in value added tax would be a more effective way of
stimulating economic growth in Britain than a 1p cut in the basic rate of
income tax, according to Oxford Economic Forecasting, an independent
research group.
But, in its latest quarterly analysis of UK economic prospects, the group
expects Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to cut the basic income-tax rate
to 24p from 25p in his Budget on March 10.
It says a 1p cut in income tax (or an equivalent increase in tax allowances)
would raise UK gross domestic product by just 0.1 per cent this year.
By contrast, a cut in the VAT rate to 12.5 per cent from 17.5 per cent for
six months from April to November could raise output this year by 0.5 per
cent.
The report forecasts UK economic growth of 1.5 per cent this year, with
unemployment reaching a peak of 2.9m in the second quarter.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Conditions for monetary
union expected to be met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK fully expects to meet the economic conditions for European economic
and monetary union by the time parliament decides whether to move to a
single currency and single monetary policy, according to the Bank of
England.
In its latest quarterly bulletin to be published tomorrow the Bank says that
the government and parliament will have to decide whether to move to the
final stage of European Monetary Union (Emu) shortly before the end of 1996.
It adds: 'In the meantime, the UK authorities fully expect to meet the
convergence conditions.'
This means that by the end of 1996:
The UK will have had for one year an inflation rate that is no more than 1.5
percentage points higher - and long-term interest rates that are no more
than 2 percentage points higher - than those of the three EC member states
with the best records for price stability.
The UK's budget deficit will be either at or near 3 per cent of gross
domestic product and its ratio of debt to GDP will not exceed 60 per cent.
The UK will have participated in the narrow band of the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System for at least two years and will
not have initiated a sterling devaluation in that period.
The Bank says that other factors such as the integration of markets and unit
labour cost developments will also be considered in assessing eligibility
for Emu. While acknowledging that the criteria 'probably cannot be applied
purely mechanically', the Bank says the UK has frequently urged that
judgments on convergence must be based on economic grounds.
The UK determination to fulfil the Emu convergence criteria will mean that
whichever government is in power after this year's general election will
have to put sterling into the narrow ERM band by the end of 1994. The narrow
band limits a currency's fluctuation to 2.25 per cent either side of its
central rate.
Convergence will also impose a constraint on future government borrowing.
This has been safely within the convergence limits in recent years, but is
generally expected to rise to around 4 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 as a
result of the recession and increased public spending.
Providing parliament ratifies the Maastricht agreement, the UK will
participate fully in the transitional second stage of Emu, which is intended
to begin on January 1 1994.
The Bank notes that EC member states will have to start granting
independence to their central banks before the start of the final third
stage of Emu, although action on this in Britain's case could wait for a
commitment to move to the final stage.
The Bank suggests in another article in the bulletin that the slow growth of
credit in the US cannot be blamed entirely on financially crippled lenders
holding back funds from borrowers.
It says: 'There is little consistent evidence of creditworthy borrowers
being unable to find credit, with the exception of particular industries and
regions, notably commercial real estate development and the north-east.' A
fall in demand is also responsible for the slow credit growth.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Self-rule supported 'by 31% of Scots'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER THAN a third of Scottish voters support independence, according to a
Market Research Scotland poll in today's Scottish Daily Express. This
contrasts with a survey a week ago indicating that half of Scottish voters
wanted independence.
The latest poll shows 34 per cent supporting some form of devolution, 31 per
cent supporting outright independence, and 25 per cent favouring remaining
part of the United Kingdom, with 10 per cent 'don't knows'. Party
preferences where: Labour 41 per cent, Scottish National Party 29 per cent,
Conservatives 21 per cent, Liberal Democrat 8 per cent, and others 1 per
cent. The poll was conducted among 1,020 respondents between January 31 and
February 3.
Mrt Alex Salmond, Scottish National Party leader, said: 'We have more than
doubled our support since the last election.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to visit Scotland within the
next few weeks as Conservatives try to rally voters behind the government's
opposition to a devolved Scottish assembly.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said he thought it was impossible to
set up an assembly which would not lead to the end of Scotland's union with
England and Wales. Speaking on BBC Television Mr Lang also ruled out a
referendum on Scotland's future.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Council tax in confusion, Blunkett says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE TIMETABLE for the council tax
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
intended to be in force by April next year - has been jeopardised by the
need for a register of households, Labour said yesterday.
Mr David Blunkett, the party's local government spokesman, said 'the total
confusion' now emerging over the tax meant the Tories would be forced to
table additional legislation if they were returned to power. He was speaking
at Labour's local government conference in Blackpool, which ended yesterday
with the fervour of a pre-election rally.
Earlier in the conference, Mr Blunkett had said Labour would use its first
100 days in power to reverse 13 years of growing centralism in Whitehall
that had left the Department of the Environment 'riddled with Thatcherites'.
Yesterday, his attention centred on a report by local government
associations, discussed with environment department officials last week,
that expresses serious unease over the 'collectability' of the new tax.
The report, submitted by the associations of metropolitan, London and
district authorities, casts doubt on whether regulations now passing through
parliament give councils adequate powers to check households' eligibility
for discounts.
It also warns that, at the outset of the council-tax system, 'there will be
a resistance to the payment of local taxes as part of the legacy of the
community charge'.
In reply, environment department officials have said that steps will be
taken in the report stage of the bill later this month to empower councils
to seek information from households.
Mr Blunkett drew attention, however, to comments by a senior Department of
Environment official reported in a local government journal. The official is
quoted as warning that the legality of the use of the poll-tax register to
judge eligibility for council-tax discounts may have to be tested in the
courts.
'I suspect that if the Tories were re-elected further changes to the
legislation would be inevitable,' Mr Blunkett said.
That view is certain to be contested by ministers who have long promised
that the new tax will be enforced by April next year.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Big market predicted for private mail service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT PLANS in the Citizen's Charter to open postal services to
competition will create a Pounds 500m market for letter services, according
to independent research published yesterday.
Dr Peter Rickard, former director of the Royal Mail letters network, says
the largest potential market will come from the proposal to reduce the
present Pounds 1 minimum postage fee which an independent letter service is
obliged to charge.
The market for a more reliable next-day letter service could exceed Pounds
200m, but only if the monopoly limit is brought down very close to the
first-class price, he says.
A highly reliable and profitable next-day service could be provided for
business-to-business mail at a modest price premium to first-class post.
Dr Rickard said yesterday that the threat to Royal Mail from private-sector
competition was real. But even if competitors built up a Pounds 500m market
this would still represent less than one-sixth of current mail volumes.
Losing one sixth of current mail volume would require Royal Mail to increase
prices by about 5 per cent. This would bring the price of delivery in real
terms to the level of five years ago.
Letter volumes had grown by 56 per cent since 1983 whereas postage rates had
fallen by 14 per cent in real terms. It was extremely unlikely that all
Royal Mail's first-class business-to-business mail would be lost, Dr Rickard
said.
The research indicates that if the loss was less than 3 per cent of the
total mail volumes each year - equivalent to the current loss of mail to
licensed document exchange operators - and allowing for general growth in
the market, Royal Mail's total volumes need not fall at all.
This would allow it to maintain economies of scale and avoid the need for
postal price increases.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Monetary policy obstacles to G7 growth in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE forces that have been inhibiting economic activity in many countries
are dissipating and the conditions for improved global growth exist,'
declared the finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised
countries at their recent meeting. Yet this cautious optimism is not
universally shared. Monetary policy has eased in the US, Japan and the UK
over the past year, though not in the rest of Europe. Yet output growth is
still decelerating everywhere.
Is monetary policy in the G7 laying the foundation for 'non-inflationary'
growth this year? No, cry those monetarist economists who judge the
tightness of policy by the rate of growth of money and credit. Broad money
aggregates decelerated sharply across almost every G7 country throughout
1991, as this week's table shows. Germany is the exception: broad money grew
at an annual rate of 9 per cent in past three months, compared with a target
of 3.5-5.5 per cent.
Yet monetary aggregates have not done a great job of predicting future
changes in economic activity in the 1980s. Moreover, it is possible to find
at least one reason for most countries why broad money growth rates might be
distorted.
An alternative measure of the monetary policy stance is the yield curve, a
line which plots the market interest rate on deposits or bonds of increasing
maturity. The central bank is able to determine interest rates on short-term
securities by varying the price at which it is willing to lend to the money
market. But interest rates for bonds of longer maturity are also influenced
by the risk that a burst of inflation will undermine the bond's nominal face
value, as well as other political or default risks.
So the market's judgment over whether monetary and fiscal policy is too
loose or tight to foster non-inflationary growth can be gauged by the slope
of the curve. Loose policy drives up inflationary expectations and steepens
the curve; tighter policy to rein in inflation flattens it again; while very
tight policy pushes down inflationary expectations, thereby inverting the
curve. The more inverted is the curve - the more that short rates exceed
long rates - the less encouraging are short-term growth prospects.
How easy is monetary policy across the G7? The charts show stylised yield
curves for the six largest industrialised countries in June 1990 and January
1992. The US chart confirms how aggressively the Federal Reserve has eased
monetary policy since the recession began, though Mr Michael Boskin, the
White House chief economic adviser, says it should not stop yet. In fact the
US yield curve is steeper than at any time in the past twenty years.
According to Mr David Morrison of Goldman Sachs, an upward sloping US yield
curve has always been associated with positive year-on-year growth of gross
national product within four to eight quarters - which should please Mr
Bush's nervous advisers.
Similarly, if more modestly, the Japanese central bank has swung Japan's
yield curve from being inverted to gently upward-sloping over the past few
months. Meanwhile, Germany has been going in the opposite direction: its
yield curve has become progressively inverted over the past 18 months as the
Bundesbank has raised rates to choke off rising inflationary pressures.
The rest of Europe remains stuck with US-style growth and German-style
monetary policy. The European exchange rate mechanism has prevented France
from cutting short rates, thereby inverting its yield curve; while the
Italian curve is upward-sloping, despite higher short rates, because of the
increased risk premium on Italian government bonds.
Nowhere is this decoupling of the economic cycle and monetary policy more
stark than in Britain. The UK had a tighter squeeze than did the US in the
months before its recession began, and has since suffered a deeper
recession. Yet, in spite of a series of rate cuts over the past year, policy
remains chokingly tight: the UK yield curve is still as inverted as that of
Germany. What easing there has been, argues the ever-optimistic Goldman
Sachs, 'is probably consistent with some economic recovery this year.'
Little wonder, though, that the much-heralded recovery is yet to
materialise.

<TEXT>
Hong Kong's economy grew 3.6 per cent in the third quarter of 1991 compared
with the same period in 1990, the colony's statistics office said yesterday,
writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
Economists expect Hong Kong to achieve growth of more than 4 per cent in the
year.
Strong growth in both private consumption, investment and trade saw gross
domestic product rise by 7 per cent in the three months to the end of
September compared with the April-June period.
The figures disclosed a moderation in the growth of the GDP deflator, the
best measure of domestic inflation, to 9.8 per cent in the third quarter,
from 10.2 per cent in the second quarter.

Opposition parties joined forces to defeat Japan's ruling party in a closely
watched upper house by-election yesterday, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The
defeat dealt a heavy blow to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's
scandal-plagued government.
The by-election, the first national poll since Mr Miyazawa took office in
November, was seen as a test of public confidence in the new government
ahead of upper house elections due in July. The LDP's defeat came after
almost daily disclosures of political scandals involving close aides of
Miyazawa.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez has vowed to press on with
unpopular economic reforms despite last week's frustrated uprising by rebel
army units.
However, in his first press conference since the coup attempt, Mr Perez said
he was bringing forward a Dollars 4bn social welfare 'mega-project'.
Mr Perez admitted that economic benefits from the reforms had 'not trickled
down, way down'.
His government had, nevertheless, done more to protect the lower classes
through social programmes than any other Latin American nation undergoing
similar reforms. The shock, however, had been hardest for Venezuelans
accustomed to the easy wealth of the 1970s oil boom.
Mr Perez sought to justify heavy press censorship imposed since last week,
saying the country was still in a 'difficult period' in terms of public
order. The media should not 'make a star out of a felon', he said, referring
to Lt Col Hugo Chavez Frias, the leader of the revolt.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Levy challenges Shamir for Likud leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, faces an important
pre-election test of strength within his own Likud party next week following
the weekend decision by Mr David Levy, the populist foreign minister, to run
against him for the party leadership.
Mr Levy, whose more conciliatory approach to the Middle East peace talks has
deepened a long-running rivalry with the hardline prime minister, represents
the less privileged Sephardi, or Oriental, Jews within the Likud who have
recently criticised Mr Shamir for not doing enough to combat economic
hardship.
Mr Shamir is expected comfortably to defeat both Mr Levy and Mr Ariel
Sharon, the housing minister 'hawk' who declared some weeks ago, when the
leadership vote is held at a meeting of the Likud's 3,000-strong central
committee on February 20. The committee will prepare for the general
election on June 23.
But the three-way race will test the support within the party for the
76-year-old prime minister's controversial leadership and provide a pointer
to who may succeed him when he eventually steps down.
The day before the Likud vote, the main opposition Labour party, struggling
to close a five-point Likud opinion poll lead, will ballot its members on a
challenge to the leadership of former prime minister Mr Shimon Peres. Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, himself a former premier and defence minister, stands a good
chance of unseating Mr Peres in what has been an acrimonious battle between
them.
The respective leadership contests have provided the early domestic focus of
the election campaign in which the main issues will be the economy,
staggering under the weight of mass immigration from the former Soviet
Union, and Israel's stance in the peace talks.
The two issues have already come together in Israel's request for Dollars
10bn in loan guarantees from the US to help finance immigration. Washington
is refusing to grant the assistance without securing a halt to new building
of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
At a meeting in Washington on Friday, Mr Zalman Shoval, the Israeli
ambassador, failed to reach agreement on the issue with Mr James Baker, the
US secretary of state. They will hold more talks. Meanwhile, a joint
US-Israeli committee is to be formed to agree economic terms for the loan
guarantees. The US is pressing for accelerated reforms in the still
state-heavy Israeli economy.
Mr Shamir wants to be able to tell the electorate he won the loan guarantees
without making a humiliating retreat on his commitment to expand the
settlements. Labour, by contrast, would freeze settlements to secure the aid
and help secure a peace agreement with the Palestinians.
Mr Levy's stance is much tougher than Labour's. But his body of supporters
within Likud, many in peripheral 'development' towns where unemployment is
10 per cent or more, tend to be more concerned about economic difficulties
than the ideological issue of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

construction site to the cabinet, Mr Levy's background could hardly have
less in common with that of Polish-born Mr Shamir, a flinty Ashkenazi, or
European, Jew.
He was goaded into running by the decision of Mr Moshe Arens, the defence
minister, to challenge his number two position in the party. Mr Shamir and
Mr Arens, who are allies, apparently hope a decisive defeat will undermine
Mr Levy's future leadership aspirations.
Mr Levy has cast himself as a champion of the peace process within Mr
Shamir's cabinet, urging a spirit of compromise on his colleagues. But the
balance of power within the Likud central committee remains weighted in
favour of Mr Shamir.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Algeria's rulers declare state of emergency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S military-backed rulers, assuming new powers to crush widespread
unrest by Moslem fundamentalists, declared a state of emergency last night.
The Interior Ministry soon afterwards announced it would take steps to
dissolve the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) for imperilling public order
through subversive actions.
Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, leader of the ruling High Council of State, decreed the
one-year emergency after at least 40 people were killed and more than 300
wounded in two days of fighting between security forces and FIS supporters.
About 400 people have been arrested.
The Moslem militants want a return to the electoral process cancelled last
month when the FIS looked set to win control of parliament.
Under the state of emergency all demonstrations are banned and local
authorities can order an end to all activities affecting public services.
The Algiers authorities had already banned a march called by the FIS for the
capital next Friday but the fundamentalist movement said it would go ahead
regardless.
The decree gives the interior minister power to close meeting places and
authorise the security forces to search houses day or night.
The authorities could use this provision to close mosques, which the FIS has
used to campaign against the new rulers.
The latest unrest erupted after weekly prayers on Friday, when security
forces tried to enforce a ban on FIS imams (mosque preachers) focusing on
politics.
State television said people threatening security could be taken before
military courts under the state of emergency. Local authorities can be
dissolved or their activities frozen, it added. The FIS controls more than
half the country's local authorities.
Workers taking part in unauthorised strikes can also be detained. The FIS
called a general strike last year as part of an earlier protest.
The FIS, in its last communique before Mr Boudiaf issued his decree, said
confrontation would continue with what it called 'the infernal apparatus of
repression'. Riot police shut down the movement's headquarters in Algiers
shortly afterwards and arrested five of the staff.
The FIS communique, signed by fugitive militant Abderrazak Rajam, demanded
that security forces lift their siege of Algerian mosques and allow freedom
of speech in them.
Scores of imams have been arrested for inflammatory speeches. The jailing of
one last Tuesday sparked three days of battles in the eastern town of Batna
in which 14 people died and 66 were wounded.
Two courthouses were set on fire in other towns during the last two days of
unrest.
Trouble continued in certain of the FIS strongholds in Algiers such as
Kouba, Badjarah and Hussein Dey throughout the weekend.
There was confusion last night as to whether Mr Tedjini Haddam, who is
rector of the Paris mosque, had resigned his position as a member of the
Council.

FT  10 FEB 92 / No early campaign pointers from Iowa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN MCGOOKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR years ago, the people of Iowa went to their precinct caucuses believing
they were helping to choose a president.
Tonight, considerably fewer will brave the Midwest winter. And the nation is
barely interested in their opinion. The state's political activists are left
to reflect on why the national media circus will be pitching its tents - and
taking the quadrennial financial windfall - elsewhere.
The reason is simple. With Iowa's own Senator Tom Harkin seeking the
Democratic nomination and assured of victory in the state by a considerable
margin, none of the other Democrats felt campaigning here was
cost-effective.
When Mr Bob Kerrey, another Democratic presidential candidate, conceded Iowa
to Senator Harkin last October, saying he intended to concentrate his scarce
campaign resources on next week's New Hampshire primary, it signalled the
deathknell of Iowa as a 'kingmaker' state, undermining its previously key
position as the first test of popular opinion.
Iowa, an agricultural state in the heart of the Great Plains, has a long
record of contrary politics. Its influence on the nomination process has
again and again helped give the Democrats, in particular, presidential
candidates who were far more dovish and interventionist than mainstream
America.
Republican nominations have traditionally been more influenced by
conservative and anti-tax New Hampshire - which in the 80s, at least, has
given the party a candidate more in tune with the country at large.
Had Iowa been a factor in this year's election, voters would have heard a
lot more about aid to the Soviet Union - which would benefit the state's
grain farmers - and probably less about the recession, which has left Iowa's
farm economy relatively unscathed while it has battered New Hampshire.
With the main contenders giving Iowa a miss, it will now fall to New
Hampshire to make the running.
Ever since former President Jimmy Carter used Iowa to launch his 'guerrilla
campaign' for the Democratic nomination in 1976, the state's highly
unrepresentative influence had been artificially created by the national
media in their haste to fire the starting gun on the campaign and establish
an early 'pecking order' among candidates.
The 'grassroots appeal' tactic had also been employed by Mr George
McGovern's campaign in 1972, and - less successfully - by the anti-Vietnam
war supporters of Mr Eugene McCarthy in 1968, but it was Mr Carter, in spite
of coming second in the poll to an 'uncommitted' grouping of delegates, who
used the media to capitalise on his unexpected performance.
The contest had become all about exceeding expectations, often with campaign
staff deliberately downplaying candidates' prospects to prevent them
underperforming. In effect, anything less than a landslide for Senator
Harkin tonight would be considered a failure.
Iowa Democratic chairman Mr John Roehrick and other party officials had
expressed fears last year that a 'favourite son' candidacy by Mr Harkin
might discourage other Democrats from participating, particularly given
difficulties in fund-raising and the seemingly unshakable incumbency of
George Bush in the wake of the Gulf war.
And so it has proved. The only reason for a candidate to take an active part
in Iowa's pre-nomination contest is to gain national media exposure and, by
performing well, generate momentum which can be translated into recruiting
and fund-raising elsewhere.
In 1988, the caucus 'winners' in delegate terms were Republican Senator Bob
Dole and Democrat Mr Richard Gephardt, both from neighbouring farming
states. Just as with Mr Carter in 1976, however, the perceived winners, in
terms of exposure and, importantly, credibility, were the two preachers; Rev
Jesse Jackson and former television evangelist Mr Pat Robertson, who beat
the then Vice-President Bush into third place in the Republican poll.
By abandoning the contest, the candidates have removed the need for the
media - and the country - to take any regard of tomorrow's outcome.
The legacy of the Iowa caucuses will be that they provided an early
kick-start to some campaigns that were otherwise dead (Gary Hart), and
killed off some others which probably deserved a wider audience (Bruce
Babbitt).

FT  10 FEB 92 / Fall in global bank credit reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first-ever fall in the amount of credit provided by the international
banking system has been reversed, according to the Bank for International
Settlements.
However, the latest figures show that renewed growth in net lending by banks
has been slow in the face of the slowdown in several big economies.
Net new lending in the third quarter of last year rose by Dollars 20bn
(Pounds 11bn), following a fall of Dollars 5bn in the second quarter. But
this growth amounted to just 12 per cent of the new lending in the
comparable period in 1990.
With activity in the international bond markets at about the same level as
in the second quarter, the total amount of new finance provided by the
global financial system in the three months to last September rose to
Dollars 60bn from Dollars 40bn.
Equity-linked bonds were the one area of the bond market to experience a
sharp decline, thanks to renewed weakness in the Tokyo stock market from
late summer. Only Dollars 11.8bn of equity-related bonds were issued,
against Dollars 18.6bn in the previous quarter. In the last three months of
the year the figure had collapsed to Dollars 4.6bn, BIS said.

FIAT Ferroviaria, the rolling stock division of the Turin-based automotive
group, has made a breakthrough in overseas sales of its high-speed tilting
train by winning a L500bn (Pounds 232m) order from Finland, writes Robert
Graham in Rome.
The deal was clinched despite stiff European and Japanese competition.
The order, for a total of 25 trains to be supplied over the next five years,
is Fiat's first foreign sale for this type of locomotive, which will be used
on inter-city routes.
The electric-powered locomotive was developed in the early 1980s. The FS,
Italy's state railways, has 14 in service with a further 10 on order.
Export success for Fiat Ferroviaria comes as the state-controlled Efim-Breda
group makes important inroads in the US, with sales of rolling stock for
urban mass transit systems to three big cities.

FT  10 FEB 92 / French wine output hit by spring frost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S wine industry suffered a drop in output of about 35 per cent last
year, after three years of excellent vintages and healthy production.
The latest figures from the Finance Ministry show the volume of wine
produced in France fell from 65.53m hectolitres in 1990 to 42.69m in 1991,
when vineyards in regions such as Bordeaux, Medoc, St Emilion and
Entre-Deux-Mers were hit by bitter frosts in the early spring.
The higher quality wines suffered the steepest falls in output. Production
of vins delimites de qualite superieure at the upper end of the market
almost halved - falling from 647,359 hectolitres in 1990 to 373,497
hectolitres last year. By contrast, production of vins de pays was
relatively stable at 11.06m hectolitres.
For any other industry such a steep fall in production would be disastrous.
But the idiosyncratic nature of the wine trade means that, after three years
of over-production, a 35 per cent fall in output is exactly what France's
vineyards needed.
The healthy harvests of 1987, 1988 and 1989 were good news for wine buffs in
that they yielded vintages of high quality. But so much wine was produced in
those years that prices have fallen, thereby imposing intense pressure on
the industry's profitability.
This problem of over-production has been aggravated by the economic
recession in key markets, notably the US, where demand for wine has weakened
leaving the French wine trade with low sales and high stocks.
The poor harvest of 1991 should, at the very least, help alleviate the stock
problem.
In the meantime, French consumers are beginning to benefit from the wine
industry's plight.
Although retailers are reluctant to discuss the sensitive issue of price,
there is some anecdotal evidence that prices are falling.
Two St Emilion wines - Angelusse 1987 and Pavie 1987 - now sell in
supermarkets for about FFr100 (Pounds 10.23) and FFr80 respectively. Both
would have cost 30 to 40 per cent more six months ago.
Even prestigious wine sellers like Legrand on the Rue de la Banque in Paris
are not immune. Legrand has not actually stooped to cutting prices but, it
says, it has not had to raise them for the last 12 months.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Wild card in volatile gameof nuclear power poker:
Territorial claims to Crimea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRONT page of Crimea's most popular newspaper last week displayed a deck
of cards in which the joker had been replaced by a map of the sunny Black
Sea peninsula.
The drawing illustrated Crimeans' rueful awareness that this stretch of
rocky beaches and vineyards has become the wild card in the volatile
relationship between Ukraine and Russia.
For the time being, Ukrainian-Russian disputes over the military and economy
have been restricted to volleys of newsprint and hostile parliamentary
resolutions.
But should economic crisis create political instability in the two nuclear
Slavic giants, Crimea could play Sarajevo in the sparking of a military
confrontation potentially more destructive than the First World War.
In fact, Russia's attachment to Crimea is warm but not too deep. Russia
first took control of the peninsula little more than 200 years ago and as
recently as 1926 Russians accounted for only 22 per cent of the population.
Likewise, Ukrainian interests in Crimea are more geopolitical than
emotional.
To date the conflict has been more of a high stakes diplomatic poker game
than a Yugoslav-style fight to the death. The players are expected to show
their hand on Friday, when presidents of the Commonwealth of Independent
States meet in Minsk.
The Russian strategy, as outlined in a memorandum from Mr Vladimir Lukin,
then chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, is to use territorial claims on the Crimea as a
lever to pressure Ukraine to drop its aim to take over a substantial part of
the Black Sea fleet.
From the Ukrainian perspective, Crimea is the key to a Pandora's box of
rival territorial claims, which could transform the former Soviet Union into
a Yugoslavia writ large.
Most western leaders have carefully labelled Crimea a hands-off internal
dispute, but in Kiev last month Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign
minister, backed Ukraine saying it had 'strong legal arguments' for
retaining Crimea.
In a delicate and dangerous diplomatic game, Mr Lukin's memo was followed in
mid-January by a resolution from his commission questioning the legality of
the 1954 transfer of the Crimea from Russia to Ukraine. The Ukrainian
parliament responded with scathing criticism.
The Russian parliament then opted to postpone its review of the matter until
after the Minsk meeting, but passed a resolution insisting that the Black
Sea fleet should not be divided, as Ukraine would like.
Mr Lukin's barter of the Crimea for the fleet may work. At the weekend Mr
Volodymyr Hryniov, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, said it was
likely Ukraine would agree to the deal.
This manoeuvring, inside what was once a superpower, exemplifies the way in
which the collapse of the Soviet Union has rewritten the rules of
international diplomacy. But Crimeans believe much is unchanged.
'We were not consulted in 1954 and we are not consulted today,' complained
Ms Elvira Kara-Oglan, a 26-year-old Crimean Tartar.
In Simferopol, Crimea's capital, people have been queueing to sign a
petition calling for a referendum on Crimean independence.
A vote will be mandatory if 180,000 signatures are gathered by April 3.
Many Ukrainians argue that independence is just the first step to
unification with Russia and that is certainly the thinly veiled hope of Mr
Yuri Mishkov, leader of the movement that is spearheading the petition
drive.
But many Crimeans, who voted narrowly for Ukrainian independence in December
but have since been disappointed by the country's inept economic reforms,
genuinely wish to opt out of the Ukrainian-Russian tussle.
Mr Hennadi Iarovyi, the deputy mayor of Simferopol, predicts a vote for
independence but warns that Ukraine could retaliate by cutting off
electricity and water.
That tactic has worked before. In 1918, by means of a tariff war, the
short-lived Ukrainian Republic compelled Crimea's shaky German-backed
government to join Ukraine as an autonomous republic with wide local
authority.
That is the very arrangement Ukrainian politicians hope to entrench in
negotiations with the Crimean leadership over the next month.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Space-based defences back in favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT the Cold War is over, nuclear weapons have lost favour with the
western defence establishment, while space-based anti-missile defences -
previously backed only by hard-core Reaganites - are suddenly popular across
the political spectrum on both sides of the Atlantic, after their resounding
endorsement by President Boris Yeltsin last month.
That was one of the more surprising developments to emerge over the weekend
at the Munich Security Conference (formerly Wehrkunde), an annual gathering
of Nato's political and military top brass. The reasoning was explained by
Mr Les Aspin, chairman of the US House of Representatives defence committee.
'Previously,' he said, 'we didn't want to make the world safe for
conventional warfare because in conventional terms the Soviets were the
biggest kid on the block. Now we do, because we're the biggest kid on the
block.'
As a result, certain policies previously regarded as right or left-wing were
now much more widely supported, Mr Aspin said.
From the right came defensive systems - both space and ground-based - as
well as the idea of pre-emptive action against states that might be building
a nuclear weapon with aggressive intent.
An example is the action taken by Israel against Iraq's nuclear reactor in
1981.
From the left came such ideas as a comprehensive test ban treaty,
co-operative efforts to halt proliferation, the doctrine of 'no first use'
of nuclear weapons and a ban on the production or sale of fissile materials.
Several speakers called for a return to the Baruch Plan of 1946, when the US
proposed to put all nuclear energy under international control. At the time,
it was vetoed by Stalin.
The first to advocate this was Mr Alfred Dregger, a right-wing German
Christian Democrat, who said unless the US went back to the Baruch Plan
there would soon be 20 countries with both nuclear and chemical weapons and
'a very far-reaching carrier capability'.
Even more surprisingly, Mr Dregger received qualified support from Mr Pierre
Lellouche, a French defence expert and adviser to Mr Jacques Chirac, the
Gaullist leader.
Northern industrialised countries, Mr Lellouche said, were already living in
a 'post-nuclear' world, while North-South relations were returning to a
pre-nuclear age.
He believed that to deal with the threat of nuclear proliferation the North
did not need a nuclear response.
'What you need is a defensive system and a non-nuclear pre-emptive
capacity.'
Professor Edward Teller - often described as the father of the hydrogen
bomb, but also instrumental in President Reagan's strategic defence
initiative - after giving an account of the original Baruch Plan made an
impassioned plea for an updated version which should include an abandonment
of secrecy.

   KNIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of Krajina, the Serb enclave in Croatia, yesterday reaffirmed his
resistance to the United Nations peace plan for Yugoslavia, in the face of
increased pressure from Serbia to accept the proposals.
On the eve of a crucial session of the Serb enclave's parliament today, Mr
Milan Babic, president of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Krajina,
said: 'A step forward has been made in the plan.' But he continued to oppose
a key element of the UN initiative to despatch 10,000 peacekeepers. He said
Serb reservists could not be disbanded while Croatia maintained its army.
Mr Lazar Macura, Krajina's information minister, added: 'The Yugoslav army
no longer exists. There are many army officers who are ready to stay in
Krajina, about 30,000 reservists are from the region. . . only the generals
who are manipulated by Belgrade will leave.'
At the same time, in a move directed by Serbia, a rival parliament in Glina,
northern Krajina, unconditionally accepted the UN plan at an emergency
session.
Mr Babic dismissed the manoeuvres by Serbia, under President Slobodan
Milosevic, to marginalise the leadership in Knin, the capital of Krajina. He
said: 'It (Glina) is not a legitimate session. It is simply a continuation
of pressure from Belgrade.'
The parliament in Knin is expected today to approve the holding of a
referendum on the UN plan. Krajina's leaders say the referendum would be
held as soon as possible.
The referendum could break the deadlock between Krajina and Serbia, offering
Mr Babic a way out of the impasse. He said: 'If the people approve the plan,
I will bow to their will.'
Despite Mr Babic's defiance, the inhabitants of Knin, tired of the economic
deprivation brought on by the civil war, seem likely to approve the UN plan.
'We want peace. Any plan that will bring us peace,' one worker in Knin said
yesterday.
Krajina's leaders, say Mr Milosevic, have betrayed the region's 300,000
Serbs, stranding them in an independent, hostile Croatia. 'Mr Milosevic
doesn't need us any more, so he is ready to sacrifice us,' said Mr Macura.
Serbia has denounced Mr Babic as the main obstacle to bringing peace to
Yugoslavia, torn by deep ethnic antagonism.
In a further effort to undermine Mr Babic, Belgrade has economically
isolated the poor mountainous region of Krajina. Serbia last month also cut
off Krajina from the monetary system, when it issued new bank notes. The
Yugoslav dinars currently circulating in Knin are practically worthless,
valid only in the enclave.
Mr Babic opposes the UN plan for Yugoslavia because he fears that replacing
the federal army in Krajina with UN troops and disarming local Serbs would
leave them at the mercy of Croatian forces.
UN Security Council members urged all warring sides in a resolution passed
on Friday to give their unqualified support to the UN peace proposals.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Estate agents take 75% pay cuts in big shake-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S estate agents, a symbol of the 1980s boom, are having to accept
cuts in pay of up to 75 per cent and huge job losses as the recession in the
housing market continues.
Regional directors who would have been earning up to Pounds 100,000 a year
during the property boom are accepting Pounds 30,000 jobs as branch
managers, according to Mr Anthony Hesse, managing director of Property
Personnel, one of the industry's main employment agencies.
Few, least of all the tens of thousands of families whose homes face
repossession, will have tears to shed for one of the least popular
occupational groups in the country.
But, true to their Thatcherite image, estate agents are behaving as workers
are meant to in a free market, taking large pay cuts when business turns
down.
Typical jobs being advertised by the National Association of Estate Agents
appointments service include a negotiator job in Avon at Pounds 10,000 a
year without commission, and another negotiator post at Pounds 5,000-Pounds
6,000 a year in south-east London with commission.
It is understood within the industry that, even with commission, the
south-east London job would probably pay only a little over Pounds 10,000.
Before the property downturn that figure would have been twice as high in a
less successful firm and four times higher in a more successful one,
according to Mr Hesse. At the height of the property boom, many negotiators
were working for commission only.
According to Mr Hesse there has been a 'huge shake-out' in the industry
since 1988. He estimated 'very provisionally' that the number of people
employed in the industry has fallen from 75,000 to 50,000.
He speculates that among those to have left the industry are the dealers who
were making Pounds 30,000 a year at the age of 18 and contributed to the
industry's bad image.
Last week Estate Agency News, a trade magazine, estimated that the total of
estate agency branches has fallen from a peak of 6,500 in 1988 to just over
5,000 at the end of last year.
Most large estate agency chains are continuing to incur heavy losses and the
industry is still contracting.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Employers face transfer fee for poached staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS who poach expensively-trained workers from competitors could face
demands to repay training costs under a government plan to be unveiled this
week.
The former employers of poached recruits would be entitled to reclaim at
least part of the cost of training if a worker left within a certain period,
a white paper will propose. The move is designed to promote investment in
training by those companies which may currently be discouraged by the
prospect of losing recruits soon after training.
The white paper will also contain proposals for vouchers for career guidance
and counselling for adults as well as encouragement to employers to make the
best use of their female employees and older workers.
The government's intention is to attempt to raise its profile on training
and employment issues as the election approaches. The white paper will come
in a week when the 22nd consecutive monthly rise in unemployment is likely
to be recorded: figures due to be released on Thursday are expected to show
unem-ployment heading towards 2.6m
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, yesterday refused to be drawn
on details of the white paper but said he was working on a 'whole series of
ideas' that would bring qualifications within reach of everyone. 'And I'm
talking about people in work - people who've left school or college some
considerable time ago, perhaps without any qualifications,' he said.
It is possible under the white paper scheme that employees could find
themselves responsible for paying back training costs if they left a
company. The costs of proposed training and the length of service required
would be set out in contracts of employment.
The notion of a 'transfer fee' for valuable employees has been debated in
personnel circles for more than 20 years but has generally been viewed as
impracticable. The Confederation of British Industry has not shown
enthusiasm in the past for such a scheme.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour employment spokesman, said he could not see how the
proposals would work but the government's plan was 'at least an
acknowledgement that training could not be left to market forces'.
The plan was condemned by the independent training policy consultancy
Fullemployment UK as being 'rigid and bureaucratic' and a 'potential
leviathan'. Mr Peter Ashby, senior consultant, said the idea would 'not last
more than a few weeks'.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Quayle warns EC on Gatt talks: Failure to liberalise trade
could encourage US to pull troops out of Nato
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAN QUAYLE, US vice-president, issued a scarcely-veiled warning to the
European Community yesterday about the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade trade liberalisation talks.
He said that, if the Gatt talks failed, it would fuel protectionism in the
US and encourage those wanting to pull all US troops out of Nato.
He did not specifically link the Gatt talks and the Nato debate. However, a
series of top US politicians and defence specialists did, in a debate on the
future of the Atlantic alliance at the annual Munich Security Conference,
which brings together defence experts from all Nato countries.
The barrage of US warnings, and pleas for Europe to make concessions so that
the US can maintain its commitment to Nato, encountered concern and some
exasperation on the EC side.
For the US side, Senator Richard Lugard, in particular, warned of the
looming dangers of a transatlantic conflict with far wider security
implications.
'We are headed towards a precipice, and the Europeans don't see it, or if
they do, they don't really care,' he said.
'It is a potential tragedy in the making, which really needs to be avoided.'
Senator Bill Cohen, another leading defence expert, warned that Congress was
likely to go well beyond the troop cuts in Europe proposed by President
George Bush.
Instead of agreeing to leave 150,000 men, Congress was looking at figures of
100,000 or even 75,000, he said.
'The attitude is spreading in the US that Nato is no longer necessary or
affordable,' Mr Cohen said. 'Few are willing to pay for what they perceive
to be another's security.'
Mr Lugard said that the compromise proposals for a deal in the Uruguay round
of Gatt negotiations, drafted by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt
secretary-general, 'have not found favour with almost any lobby in
Congress'.
As for the EC, it had 'found even less favour with the agriculture section,
and we find a growing gap. It is further away from the US than ever'.
Mr Lugard said: 'That is very disturbing. It clearly will undermine all that
we are talking about in terms of the US and Nato. The US will become
preoccupied with domestic issues . . . if we are rebuffed too often in terms
of international trade issues.'
Mr Quayle launched into the debate with a lengthy departure from his
prepared speech, to urge the critical importance of the Gatt negotiations.
'This is absolutely critical,' he said. 'It is critical to the security of
Europe, to the security of the US and to the security of Asia.
'We have got to continue this Uruguay round, and finalise it. If we don't,
we have got the Cold War behind us . . . and yet we have no comprehensive
understanding of how we are going to conduct trade relations, other than to
respond in our own countries with the lowest political denominator.
'That means more subsidies, more spending, more fiscal irresponsibility.'
While he insisted that talk of protectionism in the US was exaggerated, he
admitted that 'perhaps protectionism may be advantageous in some electoral
districts'. He said Mr Bush would not use the issue in his campaigning for
president.
'Isolationism and protectionism are dead end streets,' he said. But he
closed with an implied linkage of the issues: 'Effective national and
international security does have to have co-ordination between political,
military and economic security.'
Later Mr Quayle, meeting Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, in
Oggersheim near the French border, spoke of 'undercurrents of challenges'
which need to be resolved in American-German relations.
Mr Kohl acknowledged that 'there are differences. That is normal.' However
he commended the US troop presence which defended European security.
Mr Hans van den Broek, Dutch foreign minister, said the Netherlands had put
all its efforts into reaching a deal in the Gatt round last year. It was up
to all sides to make compromises.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said the US presence in Europe
was essential.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Ex-Soviet states defer key issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADS of government of the Commonwealth of Independent States failed
over the weekend to resolve any of the urgent economic and military issues
which increasingly divide them, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
Instead, they agreed to loosen their trade links further, to go their
separate ways on foreign debt repayment and to postpone the vital issues
again to a heads of state meeting in Minsk on Friday
Ukraine, whose prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin, did not attend the meeting
because he had to ward off a motion of no confidence against him in the
Ukrainian parliament, said that it would itself repay the estimated 16.37
per cent of the Soviet debt reckoned to be owed by it to foreign creditors.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of the economy,
said at the weekend that Russia 'would not oppose' such a course. There is
as yet no agreement from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations
which established an agreement last year with the ex-Soviet states -
including Ukraine - that they would be 'jointly and severally' responsible
for debt repayment.
It now seems likely that Russia will take over debt repayment for all the
CIS states excluding Ukraine but including Georgia - which is not yet a
member but whose new prime minister, Mr Tengiz Sigua, attended Saturday's
meeting.
Moldovan radio said on Friday that the republic could not pay back its share
of the debt and was prepared to give up all claims on Soviet property if
Russia would take over its share. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, speaking
to reporters on his return from France on Friday night, said the position
was 'realistic' and that Russia would do the same for any other republic.
At the same time, the states appear to have agreed to a Russian proposal to
move inter-state trading to 'world prices'  - but, according to Mr Gaidar,
at a rouble exchange rate stronger than the present rate fixed by the
Russian Central Bank of Rbs110 to the dollar.
The rate suggested is between Rbs20 to Rbs30 to the dollar - or precisely in
the range at which Mr Gaidar has said he wished the rouble to stabilise.
In effect, this establishes a new rate for Russia's exports, many of which
go to CIS member states.
No decisions were made on the military forces.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Save Planet Earth from economists: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lawrence Summers, the World Bank's chief economist, has a fine mind. As a
young Harvard professor in the 1980s he gained a reputation for brilliance.
He sympathises with many liberal causes and served as economic adviser in
Governor Michael Dukakis's ill-fated presidential campaign in 1988. But he
appears to have one blind spot: the environment.
This matters because the World Bank is emerging as a key player in the
global environmental debate. Will the bank back efforts to impose effective
controls on carbon emissions? Will it make development loans conditional on
strict environmental controls? Will it support trade sanctions against
countries which refuse to clean up their dirty industries?
Mr Summers is well placed to mould opinion within the bank on such
controversial issues. Perhaps more importantly, he is responsible for this
year's World Development Report, always a powerful pedagogical tool. This
year's report - which will be devoted to the economics of the environment -
is being published ahead of schedule in an effort to influence debate at the
United Nations conference on the environment in Rio this June. The 'Earth
Summit' could help set global environmental policy for this decade.
In January, at the American Economics Association meeting in New Orleans, Mr
Summers made little effort to hide his feelings. He listened in exasperation
to papers arguing that global warming could prove a more serious economic
threat than hitherto realised. His own view was that it was a grossly
overrated problem. Even on the most pessimistic assumptions, it would cause
damage equivalent to only half a year's growth of gross national product
(GNP) over the next half century. The implication was that efforts to curb
carbon emissions should not be a priority.
The leaking of a confidential bank memorandum last week provided further
insight into Mr Summers's thinking. 'Just between you and me, shouldn't the
World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the LDC
(less developed countries)?' he wrote in a memo to senior staff dated
December 12. He listed three reasons:
The economic cost of pollution depends on the loss of earnings from
increased illness and death. These costs are lowest in the lowest wage
countries. 'I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste
in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.'
Pollution costs start low but rise more than proportionately with the output
of toxic substances. It thus makes sense to shift dirty production to places
where environments are still clean. 'I've always thought under-populated
countries in Africa are vastly under-polluted; their air quality is probably
vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City.'
The value attached to clean and healthy environments increases as living
standards rise. The poor, in effect, cannot afford to have scruples. 'The
concern over an agent that causes a one in a million change in the odds of
prostate cancer is obviously going to be much higher in a country where
people survive to get prostate cancer than in a country where under-five
mortality is 200 per thousand.'
Mr Summers subsequently said these comments were an 'ironic' attempt to
stimulate debate rather than serious policy proposals. The bank apologised
on behalf of Mr Summers and said that protection of the environment was one
of its main objectives. It did not condone the dumping of waste in other
countries.
The memo's purpose is unimportant; it is the tone of the remarks that is
revealing. It is hard to believe that anybody who cared deeply about the
environment would write that way, even in a confidential memo. If you cared,
you would not describe clean air as inefficient; you would not refer to an
argument for dumping toxic waste in poor countries as 'impeccable'.
For Mr Summers, the environment seems to be just a pile of raw material:
something you use up in creating GNP. It is not an uncommon attitude in
America. In dashing for growth over two centuries, the US, after all, has
despoiled its own continent. The air quality in the Blue Ridge mountains
near Washington, once a natural paradise, is now sometimes so poor that
people are advised not to leave their cars. Many rivers are poisonous. Urban
landscapes are often indescribably ugly. But, hell, most Americans are happy
enough. Why should the developing world not follow suit?
Viewed through the distorting prism of market economics, Mr Summers's
arguments may appear logical. But should decisions on the location of
factories really be determined by estimates of where human life is cheapest?
And if the answer is yes, why stop there? Environmental controls are costly.
Why should the bank - or anybody else - try to impose any environmental
restraints in the third world? Let it enjoy dirty growth. Let the factories
smoke. If the globe warms up a few degrees, so much the better: we'll all
get a suntan. If the outside world becomes totally inhospitable, we can
always live in pressurised plastic bubbles.
This is a recipe for ruin. The challenge is to find an equitable way of
financing clean growth everywhere. Rather than figuring out ways to export
dirty industries, we should be trying to prevent poor countries from
repeating our own awful environmental mistakes. This requires vision from
institutions such as the World Bank, not mean-spirited utilitarianism of the
kind Charles Dickens satirised in Hard Times.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Justinian: Press intrusions and freedoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POTHER over the public revelations of the sexual peccadillo of Mr Paddy
Ashdown, MP, and his former secretary should help to create a better balance
between press freedom and editorial responsibility.
The incident brings the day nearer when parliament will legislate to give
the individual citizen a right of action for unwarranted invasion of
privacy, fitting appropriately alongside a reformed law of libel to protect
the individual's reputation and self-esteem.
The second impact of the Ashdown affair should be to alert not just
parliamentarians but, more importantly, the legal profession to the dangers
to press freedom if lawyers indulge indiscriminately in the use of the
injunction prior to publication. Support for a law to protect private lives
can and should involve no interference with the editor's right to determine
what goes in, and what does not appear, in his or her newspaper or
periodical.
No one suggests that freedom of expression is absolute. Nor does anyone
suggest that the publication may wilfully, or even unwittingly, damage a
person's reputation. Every editor has to assess a story with the risk of
libel in mind. The libel law provides a remedy by way of pecuniary
compensation - sometimes, no doubt, juries over-compensate - to those who
establish a falsehood that lowers them in the esteem of their friends and
neighbours.
If the libel law currently bears down too heavily on newspapers, it is often
the application of the law in the particular case that errs. Yet if the law
itself is defective - and there is a case for so thinking - then it should
be put on the reformer's shopping list for early legislation. There is a
strong case for reviewing the law of libel, together with the ingredients of
a proposed privacy law.
A call for Calcutt Mark II would be a wise step for the government to take.
After all, the Calcutt committee on privacy did not say (as some
commentators think it did) that it was impossible to define a law of
privacy. It merely rejected the idea for practical reasons, to do with
providing a harvest for litigious-minded clients and their lawyers. Instead
Calcutt proposed three new criminal offences on journalistic trespass - a
most undesirable proposal that would bring the courts and the media into
unenviable confrontation. So far the government has not declared itself in
favour of such a proposal.
A privacy law is a necessary component of organised society, to mark the
right to respect for the citizen's private and family life, home and
correspondence. For the public figure's lover, there can rarely be a public
interest in publication, overriding his or her privacy. For the public
figure, there may be cases where the private matter is relevant to his or
her public life.
The Press Council in its declaration of principle on privacy in 1976 said
that entry into public life did not disqualify an individual from a right to
protection of private affairs, 'save when the circumstances relating to the
private life of an individual occupying a public position may be likely to
affect his performance of his duties or public confidence in him or his
office'. Such a situation could be judged only in the particular case, and
is not susceptible to statutory definition.
The courts have already pleaded for the ability to give a remedy to those
whom the media have declined to leave alone. In the Gordon Kaye case two
years ago, when journalists intruded into the actor's hospital room where he
was recovering from serious head injuries, all three judges of the Court of
Appeal urged the reform which the Calcutt committee thought subsequently was
inappropriate.
What is forgotten in that case was the judges' affirmation of a
long-established rule of practice in the law of defamation: that the court
will rarely grant an anticipatory injunction. To stop a prospective libel
would be to interfere with the freedom of speech. The same principle should
apply to any new law of privacy. The fact that judges have departed in
recent years from that almost invariable rule of practice emphasises how
much they desired to extend some help to those threatened with breaches of
confidentiality, which has become part of the judicial development that
covers some cases of privacy, as in the case of Mr Ashdown.
It was the solicitors' mistake of obtaining the all-pervasive injunction
against the News of the World that gave the media its only retort to the
charge that journalists had been engaging in unsavoury prurience in chasing
a supposed sex scandal. By resorting to the courts, the lawyers immediately
converted a private matter into a question of public interest. To gag the
press by not allowing it even to mention that an injunction had been sought
and obtained was calculated to arouse cries of prior restraint and
interference with the public's right to know - that the legal system was
being used to silence the press.
The door-stepping that preceded the lawyers' unthinking rush to judgment
reveals another aspect of the invasion of privacy: the pre-publicity
harassment and intrusion on private property by journalists.
If the press wishes to assure politicians that under the new Press
Complaints Commission it is behaving better, it could repair its public
image that nothing has changed. The newspaper industry should set up an
independent inquiry to examine the media activity over the last fortnight in
relation to Mr Ashdown and his secretary. We may then know how well or badly
journalists and their editors behaved, and whether they are serious in
supporting the Press Complaints Commission and the industry's code of
practice, which states that intrusions and inquiries into private lives 'are
not generally acceptable'.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Monday Interview: The Veep does it his way - US
vice-president Dan Quayle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the summer of 1991, the Washington Post dispatched its two star reporters
on a mission to discover the truth about US Vice-President Dan Quayle.
Over the next six months, David Broder and Bob Woodward conducted more than
200 interviews; they enjoyed unprecedented access to the vice-president, at
home and abroad.
The resulting seven-part series created a mild sensation in Washington,
since it corrected the caricature of the 1988 election campaign, suggesting
it was time to take Mr Quayle seriously in 1992, an election year.
Today, the vice-president arrives in London, the last stop in a seven-day
European tour. He has delivered an address on defence issues to the
Wehr-kunde conference in Bavaria, expressed US solidarity during talks with
the leaders of the Baltic republics, and lunched with the US Olympic Team.
The political rehabilitation of Dan Quayle is well under way.
On the eve of his trip, Mr Quayle invited the Financial Times to take a
closer look, to see whether the Post's magnum opus really was the last word.
The scene was the West Wing of the White House, and Vice-President Quayle
was celebrating his 45th birthday, surrounded by photographs of his family,
two aides, and the Stars and Stripes. He was wearing a broad smile.
Mr Quayle accepted graciously his birthday present - the authorised history
of the Financial Times by David Kynaston - and immediately began to talk
about recent bed-time reading material: The Americans by Daniel Boorstin and
Seize the Moment, former President Richard Nixon's latest foreign policy
tome.
'Fascinating,' said the vice-president, 'balance of power and all that.'
It seemed churlish to interrupt, but remarks by Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa of Japan about the possible decline of the American work ethic had
made front-page news from coast to coast. What was his response?
'No, No,' said Mr Quayle. All very unfortunate. Maybe something had been
lost in the translation. Japan was a very important ally.
Yes, but what about the Japanese prime minister's specific charge that many
of America's economic problems came about because too many American college
graduates went to Wall Street in the 1980s, rather than producing something
of value?
'That's not true,' Mr Quayle shot back. 'If you look at our manufacturing
numbers - as far as our total gross national product, manufacturing is up.
I'm not going to get into a discussion of statistics, but I can tell you one
statistic that I know very well, and that is that manufacturing for us is
up. So we're still producing goods as well as services.'
The vice-president is correct in one respect: figures show that
manufacturing increased its share of gross domestic product in the second
half of the 1980's. But there has been a steady erosion in the manufacturing
workforce. In the 1980s, according to Professor Robert Reich of Harvard
University, one of the country's leading economists, more than 2m jobs
disappeared, 1m in the three years since the Bush/Quayle administration took
office.
Mr Quayle is, of course, a child of the 1980s. As a 33-year-old Congressman,
he rode the Reagan tide in 1980, crushing Senator Birch Bayh, the liberal
incumbent Democrat in Indiana. Over the next eight years, Mr Quayle carved
out a solid, but not particularly inspiring record in the US Senate,
developing some expertise in defence and national security issues.
Today, he has matured, his staff say. One aide noted that he spends between
60 and 90 minutes a day with President Bush when both men are in town.
Indeed, officials stress that the Veep attends all the high-level
intelligence briefings and receives all the top-secret information
rightfully due to someone who is a proverbial heart-beat away from the
presidency.
It is fashionable to engage in political revisionism about Quayle, so what
were the vice-president's views about the 1980s - once seen as the decade
when America regained its confidence, but now viewed as the decade of greed,
the era of easy money and the stretch limousine?
The vice-president paused. Maybe things on Wall Street might have gotten a
little out of hand; but 'even some of the richest people in this country had
to go to trial, and some went to prison. I think it will certainly serve as
a reminder that nobody is above the law'.
Mr Quayle is more exercised about executive pay in the US, especially when
it is unrelated to performance. Without naming names, Mr Quayle said: 'Where
you have those exorbitant salaries, totally unrelated to performance of the
company, it's ridiculous. I will go on record to say that for some,
executive compensation is way out of line.'
We turned to his European tour which includes stops in Finland, Lithuania,
the ski slopes of France - the vice-president likes to ski almost as much as
he likes a round of golf - Bavaria and London. Today he is due to meet Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, followed by talks tomorrow with Prime Minister John
Major, her successor, and Mr Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labour
party.
Would it make a dime's worth of difference if Labour or Conservative formed
the next government? Naturally, this was a matter for the British people to
decide, the vice-president replied. 'But let me just tell you that John
Major, in our viewpoint, has been one outstanding prime minister . . . There
is a very special relationship between the president, George Bush, and the
prime minister.'
And Labour? Well, Mr Bob Hawke, the recently ousted prime minister of
Australia, said the British Labour party had changed, an impression
confirmed during a couple of meetings with Mr Kinnock and other Labour
leaders. But of all the Labour MPs, Mr John Gilbert had a firm grip on
military matters. 'A very thoughtful individual,' Mr Quayle commented.
The vice-president seemed keen to stress the continuing need for an
independent British nuclear deterrent. 'It has worked, and if Great Britain
wants to relinquish its nuclear power capability who do you to abdicate this
to? Pakistan?'
The conversation shifted to Mr Boris Yeltsin who had just left the US after
his inaugural appearance at the UN and Camp David. Mr Quayle was not present
at either meeting, but he has met the Russian president on several occasions
(his staff suggest that both men share a common experience: each had a bad
press early on in Washington).
The vice-president has top-rate staff, both on domestic and foreign policy.
Mr Quayle was consistently sceptical about President Gorbachev and his
reform intentions, even as far back as 1987. What was his impression of Mr
Yeltsin?
'I trust his instincts. Before Gorbachev was willing to let the Baltics go,
he said they were going to go. He was proud that he was the first
democratically elected president of Russia, almost in history. I found him
very direct, very forthcoming.' But did he trust him? 'Trust is something
you hope for . . . something you earn.'
It was a rare moment of reflection. Mr Quayle often seems inclined to rush
to judgment (although other members of the administration credit him for
sound political instincts when it comes to negotiating with Republicans on
Capitol Hill). Yet every so often he also comes across as being caught in a
time-warp.
Asked if the US would support Germany and Japan becoming permanent members
of the UN Security Council, the vice-president stalled, suggesting that
countries such as Nigeria or Brazil would clamour for similar treatment.
Pressed that the US could easily lead the charge toward revising the entry
rules, Mr Quayle responded by minimising US influence: 'Look how losing side
on the UN resolutions that have come up. I wouldn't say that the UN is
pro-American by any stretch of the imagination.
This is an odd judgment coming one year after the US secured UN support for
waging war against Kuwait and when the Bush administration is calling for an
expanded role for the UN. It is a view which is at least five years out of
date.
The vice-president seems much more confident than four years ago when he
suffered a thousand indignities at the hands of the television and press.
Whatever the public doubts, he remains determined to continue his political
rehabilitation, and that includes mastering the intricacies of a second
presidential campaign.
'I am doing it my way . . . And I am going to rely on myself . . . I don't
need a lot of outside advice.' The vice-president speaks with the
conviction, if not yet the authority, of someone who has his sights on
higher office.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Tough week for Dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK should mark the beginning of a more realistic approach to the
dollar, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The premise, popular for some time before last week, had been that the US
economy was set for recovery; that argument had even helped the dollar rise
some 13 pfennigs against the D-Mark in January. The betting was that German
rates would have to come down, while US rates would hold, and perhaps even
rise.
That feeling was so strong that the dollar was largely able to shrug off a
whole series of depressing numbers - until last week. Starting on Monday,
the dollar began a steady decline which was only reversed temporarily on
Thursday for a bit of profit-taking.
Two things were working against the US currency: the Bundesbank and the
actual state of the economy. Repeated statements from the Bundesbank that
German monetary policy would remain tight began to shake the market's
confidence. On Friday, severely disappointing US jobs data put the final
nail in the coffin.
Now, there are no illusions about the state of the economy and the most
likely scenario is a cut in the Federal Funds rate. Figures due out this
week will offer little argument against such a move: US retail sales are
unlikely to provide much encouragement.
However, some of the pressure might come off the dollar with the raft of UK
statistics out this week. Some attention could focus on the weakness of the
UK economy and the political consequences of that weakness, according to Dr
Mark Austin, an economist at HongKong Bank.
The retail prices index, UK retail sales, unemployment figures, and
industrial production are all due this week.

FT  10 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Regulators get to work on capital
adequacy standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE regulatory revolution which overtook the banking industry in the late
1980s will soon hit the international bond market. At the heart of the
changes are common capital adequacy standards for securities firms currently
being drafted by international regulators.
Capital adequacy standards ensure that institutions maintain sufficient
capital to back loans or bonds held on the balance sheet. Capital can absorb
losses, protecting the bank or securities firm against failure should the
assets turn bad.
International banks have been working towards common capital standards since
the Basle accord was signed in 1988.
The effect has been profound, making capital a rare commodity and forcing
banks to focus on return on capital as a key measure of profitability across
different areas of business.
However, securities firms and the securities operations of banks, including
the underwriting and trading of bonds, were not included in the Basle
framework. A striking feature of the international bond market is how few
syndicate officials have more than a sketchy idea of how much capital is
tied up in their business - and hence the return on capital they are able to
deliver.
If the bond market follows the banking industry, this will change
dramatically. The negotiations which affect the Eurobond market are taking
place at two levels.
The Basle committee of central bank regulators and the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recently agreed the
ground-rules for capital adequacy regulations for securities trading.
In addition, European Community governments are working on a capital
adequacy directive and a large exposures directive, which cover similar
ground.
Eurobond firms based in London, the heart of the primary market, currently
work under capital adequacy rules laid down by the Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA).
Under SFA rules, core capital comprises shareholders' funds, but this can be
supplemented up to four times by subordinated loans from the parent company.
The amount of capital which has to be set aside against bond holdings is
decided by: the value of securities held; the currency in which the position
is denominated (volatile Escudos carry a higher capital weighting than
dollars or Ecu, for example); the maturity of the securities (a holding of
30-year bonds requires more capital than a holding of two-year notes); and
the credit quality of the issuer.
The net result is that capital requirements can be less than 1 per cent for
a holding of short maturity bonds issued by a high-grade issuer in a
low-volatility currency. Alternatively, a holding of 20-year bonds issued by
a sub-investment grade company in a high-volatility currency can carry a 30
per cent capital requirement.
The same system applies to bonds held in the process of new issue
underwriting, except that there is 'grace' period until the closing date of
the deal, in which only half the usual amount of capital is required.
The Basle/IOSCO agreement and early drafts of the capital adequacy directive
differ from these regulations in several key respects:
The ratio of subordinated capital to shareholders' funds is lowered from 4:1
under SFA rules to just 2.5:1. If this is carried forward, the parent
companies will have to inject more pure equity capital into their Eurobond
operations, making them more expensive to run:
The credit quality of the issuer is probably given more weight than under
the SFA rules, making it more expensive to hold corporate bonds than
government or supranational paper. This could discourage trading of
corporate bonds and, possibly, raise underwriting costs:
The Basle/IOSCO agreement does not cover underwriting risks, avoiding the
debate over when capital adequacy requirements should start to 'bite' on
underwriting positions.
However, EC legislation will tackle this issue. Early indications are that
the current underwriting exemption under SFA rules may be replaced by more
onerous regulations.
The International Primary Markets Association, which represents new issue
firms, is concerned that the new regulations will impose an excessive cost
on the underwriting business.
Privately, senior bankers acknowledge that regulations which damage the
fragile profitability of the primary Eurobond market would, at best, lead to
the withdrawal of less profitable firms.
At worst, additional costs would have to be passed through to borrowers,
making the primary Eurobond market a less attractive source of funding.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Syndicated Loans: Saudi Aramco taps market for Dollars 2.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI Aramco, the Saudi state-owned oil company and the world's largest oil
exporter, is tapping the international syndicated credit market for the
first time with two loans amounting to Dollars 2.4bn.
The Saudi oil group is the latest to join a rapidly lengthening list of
Middle Eastern borrowers in the international capital markets.
Currently J. P. Morgan is assembling a group of international banks to
participate in a Dollars 1.5bn four-year general purpose facility for Saudi
Aramco, and a Dollars 900m 10-year loan for Vela International, Saudi
Aramco's wholly owned subsidiary.
The US bank has carved out a niche as the arranger for many of these
prestige Middle Eastern credits, including the Dollars 4.5bn loan for Saudi
Arabia and Dollars 5.5bn loan for Kuwait's reconstruction, both of which
were launched last year.
The facility for Saudi Aramco is quite tightly priced, with a margin of 40
basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) rising to 45
basis points during the lifetime of the loan.
Saudi Aramco carries the full risk weighting under the Basle guidelines on
international bank capital adequacy, so bankers expect to be rewarded for
the additional capital expense with generous fees - as was the case with the
loan to Kuwait.
The Dollars 900m loan for Vela International is one of the largest shipping
loans to be launched in the international markets.
The margin is 60 basis points over Libor, rising to 70 basis points and the
loan will be used to finance the purchase of several tankers.
At present Saudi Aramco pumps about 8.5m barrels a day (b/d), and it has
plans to boost its sustainable oil output capacity to 10m b/d by the middle
of the decade. The kingdom is expected to spend more than Dollars 33bn on
the development of its oil industry by the end of the decade, including at
least Dollars 10bn on upgrading its domestic refineries, Dollars 6bn on the
petrochemical industry, and about Dollars 2bn on expanding its oil tanker
fleet.
According to one bank, two other Saudi borrowers are in discussions with
bankers about the possibility of launching large loans. Sharq Petroleum may
try to launch a Dollars 300m facility while Ibn Sina (National Methanol
Company) may launch a Dollars 275m facility, although both are likely to be
domestic rather than international deals.
Lasmo, the UK oil exploration group which bid Pounds 1.1bn for oil and gas
group Ultramar, has completed a Pounds 450m three-year revolving credit
which will be used to retire some of Ultramar's debt.
The facility, arranged by Barclays, was originally launched as a Pounds 200m
revolving credit 'for general corporate purposes' at the beginning of
January. However, the deal was oversubscribed by nearly Pounds 500m, so
Lasmo decided to use the opportunity to pay off some of Ultramar's debt.
The margin on the facility is 60 basis points over Libor with a commitment
fee of 30 basis points on the undrawn balance.

FT  10 FEB 92 / New Zealand Bonds: Foreign investors turn away nervously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNACCUSTOMED nervous-ness has struck New Zealand bond markets following the
surprise failure of last week's NZDollars 350m (USDollars 194.4m) tender in
government bonds.
State tenders have customarily been oversubscribed three or more times, and
the failure, the first since 1986, has sharply focused attention on the
dwindling support for these issues from overseas.
Figures released on Friday, two days after the announcement that only
Dollars NZ233m of the tender had been taken up, show that overseas investors
practically halved their exposure to New Zealand government debt last year.
At December 31, foreign holdings were 10.1 per cent of the total stock on
issue, down from a peak of 19.7 per cent in March, or NZDollars 2.08bn,
against Dollars NZ1.24bn.
The New Zealand bond markets have always relied on offshore support. What
some observers sense as growing disenchantment is worrying policymakers as
the government is still only part way through its Dollars NZ6.2bn borrowing
programme for the financial year to June 1992.
A further Dollars NZ2.6bn of bonds is still to be sold, in seven tenders.
Originally only four were planned, but an extra three, of NZDollars 350m
each, were scheduled following the Treasury's revised December fiscal
forecasts of a NZDollars 1bn budget shortfall.
Falling overseas interest in New Zealand bonds follows a steady drop in
yields. In 1991, five-year bond yields fell from 13 per cent to 8.5 per
cent. This is in line with rapidly falling inflation which is now down to
just 1 per cent. The New Zealand dollar has fallen in value by 11 per cent.
There is pressure on the government and the Reserve Bank, which handles
monetary policy, to let rates fall further: real interest rates in New
Zealand are among the highest in the world. However the failure of last
week's bond tender suggests this is most unlikely. Rates, especially longer
term, are expected to rise.
The Treasury is expected to try to reawaken overseas interest in New Zealand
bonds. However many US and other investors tend to lump Australia and New
Zealand together for investment purposes. New Zealand is seen to be
suffering from international uncertainties over the Australian economy.
In spite of some recent firming, New Zealand bond yields are significantly
lower than Australia's. Five-year Australian rates are about 9 per cent,
compared with 8.8 per cent in New Zealand and 10-year Australian bonds are
10.10 against 9.45 per cent here.
The average interest rate for five-year bonds in the failed tender was 8.86
per cent, compared with 8.51 in the January 23 tender. An average 9.37 per
cent was paid for 10-year bonds (against 9.06 per cent).
Some traders argue the tender failure was a one-off aberration. The tender
was made one day before the Waitangi Day public holiday. Traders also argue
that the maturity schedule needs readjusting. Last week's underbidding was
in the usually sought-after November 1996 bonds, while the November 2002
were all sold locally.
The failure followed a string of more favourable economic news, but there
have been rumours that New Zealand could face a credit downgrade from
Standard and Poor's because of its stubbornly high level of overseas debt.

FT  10 FEB 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs figures check market rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE scenario was familiar. Midweek, the authorities appeared to hold out
hope of another early interest rate cut. By the end of the five trading
sessions, nobody was quite so sure.
The early excitement centred on remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal
Reserve chairman, to a Congressional committee. On Tuesday, the same day the
policy-setting Open Market committee was meeting, the Fed chairman seemed to
go out of his way to emphasise that the authorities would be willing to
lower interest rates further, should the need arise.
Stating first that he expected that the amount of 'monetary ease in the
pipeline is adequate to turn the economy on the path of sustained recovery'
 -a reiteration of his remarks a week earlier - Mr Greenspan now added that
the authorities were 'continuing to evaluate whether some additional
insurance in the way of further monetary ease would be appropriate'.
This was enough for bond dealers. Up went prices of Treasury securities and
down went yields, although trading remained fairly thin. By the end of the
day, the bell-wether long bond had gained almost a full point, to return
7.74 per cent compared with 7.81 per cent a day earlier.
But the mood quickly turned more cautious, both ahead of and after
publication of the January unemployment figures on Friday. Forecasts for
these numbers had shown an abnormally large range - with some pundits
predicting that the decline in non-farm payrolls could be as high as
125,000, and others suggesting that payroll employment could increase by as
much as 100,000.
In the event, the data rolled out at the more bearish end of these
predictions. Non-farm payrolls declined by 91,000 and manufacturing
employment by 52,000, although the unemployment rate held steady at 7.1 per
cent.
For bond market optimists, such figures should have been sufficiently
discouraging to prompt some signal from the Fed that further easing would,
indeed, be forthcoming in the short-term. Yet no signal was forthcoming.
So bond prices yo-yoed ambivalently as dealers tried to make sense of the
situation. While the stock market fell sharply, the price of the 30-year
long bond first moved higher and then ended the day marginally lower, to
offer a yield of 7.755 per cent. After all these shenanigans, however, the
situation remained little changed for the week overall; seven days earlier,
the long bond yield had stood at 7.76 per cent.
In the meantime, news from the corporate sector, in the throes of the
reporting season, has been mixed. On the plus side, there have been
relatively few new horror stories, and a lot of vaguely worded optimism
about prospects for the latter half of 1992.
Retail sales reports from the large store chains for January also showed
unexpected strength, although the comparable period a year ago was extremely
weak and promotional activity remains rife. On the minus side, the stream of
restructuring announcements (most of which involve job cuts of some
description) continues to flow.
So what will interest rates do next? Sentiment seems to split between two
camps. There is one school of thought which argues that, in the authorities'
eyes at least, the effects of December's discount rate cut have not had time
to work their way through the economy. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve may
be prepared to sit on its hands for a while yet.
The more pervasive view - in the bond markets at least - still maintains
that any 'real' recovery would be unlikely to arrive until the third quarter
at the earliest. If so, runs the argument, the Fed has ample room - and
ample reason - to ease again, in the near term.
'It remains our view that interest rates will decline in the near term,'
suggested analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette on Friday, for example.
The reasons, they suggested, were simple: 'the continued weakness of
economic activity, the likelihood of good inflation statistics over the next
few months and the likelihood of some further slight easings of monetary
policy by the Fed'.
As for the week ahead, interest will probably centre on the last two trading
days. Thursday sees the publication of the retail sales figures for January;
the general consensus here is for a very modest increase once car sales are
excluded, perhaps 0.1-0.5 per cent.
And on Friday, the producer price index for January should also arrive, with
forecasts generally suggesting a small decline overall - a reflection of
falling energy prices - or a very modest 0.1 per cent gain in the 'core'
rate.

FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Full speed ahead for IBM and
Bull - The rationale behind the computer groups' accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineers from Groupe Bull, the French computer manufacturer, will begin to
take up residence at International Business Machines' computer design centre
in Austin, Texas, within the next few days.
Their arrival will be the first and most controversial consequence of the
technological and marketing agreement concluded recently between the two
computer makers.
In Austin, the Bull team will work with IBM and its partners Apple Computers
and Motorola on the design of microchips planned to be at the heart of
tomorrow's personal computers. Bull will have a unique window into the
future of computer technology.
While almost every important detail of last week's agreement has yet to be
spelled out in detail - the size of the equity stake IBM has agreed to take
in Bull, for example, or the annual value of Bull's orders for IBM's small
disk drives - both companies appreciate the need for speed if they are to
make the most of their initiative.
Within months, Bull will be selling IBM mid-range computers badged with
Bull's green tree logo; by the end of the year, the cabinets will be Bull's
but the chips at the heart of the system will still be IBM.
The new understanding between IBM, the world's largest computer maker, and
Bull, state-owned and losing money heavily, began as a search for a
straightforward technology agreement. Bull needed a source of a new
technology called 'reduced instruction set computing (risc)' available only
from US suppliers - IBM, Hewlett Packard (HP), Digital Equipment, Sun
Microsystems and Mips. It elected to choose between IBM and HP.
IBM was looking for a partner to licence its risc technology to increase
manufacturing volumes and improve distribution. In the past year it has
struck oem (original equipment manufacturer) deals with Wang of the US for
personal computers and mid-range machines and with Siemens of Germany for
memory chips.
The deal with Bull, however, has grown into a complex, two-way relationship
which will have far-reaching consequences for the world computer industry.
'Bull's position as a viable vendor has received a much needed boost' the
Gartner Group, a well-regard-ed US consultancy said, immediately following
the deal.
Risc technology was invented by IBM. It makes possible powerful but low cost
computer systems through simple silicon chip design in combination with
complex software. It is seen as the technology of choice for mid-range
computers and, increasingly, personal computers. Typically, risc computers
run the Unix operating system, developed by AT&amp;T and set to become the
industry standard for small and medium computers.
The key to making profits from risc computers, as for personal computers, is
high volume and efficient distribution.
Mr Bob Dies, director-general, products and systems, IBM Europe, and his
opposite number at Bull, Mr Michel Bloch, managed the burden of the
negotiations. Mr Michael Armstrong, head of IBM world trade, and Mr Francis
Lorentz, Bull chairman and chief executive handled the final stages.
The French government, as Bull's majority shareholder, gave its approval to
Mr Lorentz's desire to seal a deal with IBM: 'We did not know we had been
selected until Mrs Cresson, the prime minister, announced it' Mr Dies said.
IBM lost money for the first time in 1991 and has put in place a profound
restructuring strategy to restore profitability.
There was little to choose between the risc technology on offer from IBM and
HP in the view of Bull's experts. Why then did Mr Lorentz opt for IBM? He
gave six reasons.
IBM would be prepared to take a large number, perhaps 100,000, of portable
computers a year from Bull subsidiary Zenith Data Systems to sell under its
own label.
There was the possibility of creating a separate, global, printed circuit
board business based on Bull's manufacturing facilities at Angers, France,
and Boston in the US.
Bull would take the lead in developing powerful networks of risc processors,
an advanced technology called 'symmetrical multiprocessing (smp)'. IBM would
benefit from being able to save resources it would otherwise have to pour
into its own smp project.
A computation of the profit and loss account over four years for each of the
potential partners came out in IBM's favour.
He believed that software houses - whose application programs can make or
break a hardware supplier - would be more encouraged to write for IBM
designs than for HP.
He was concerned about speculation, however absurd, that Hitachi, the
Japanese electronics giant, might launch a takeover bid for HP. HP licences
its own version of risc to Hitachi, which builds workstations based around
it.
The agreement transforms Bull's credibility but as the Gartner Group points

<TEXT>
EDISON, the stock market listed energy subsidiary of Italy's Montedison
group, is buying the Italian activities of Deutsche Shell for Dollars 230m.
The activities include a share of around 49 per cent in a series of licences
to extract natural gas from 13 fields concentrated in the Adriatic.
Edison said its share of the total gas reserves in the fields will amount to
over 20bn cubic metres. The remaining share is held by AGIP, the Italian
state-owned energy group.
The deal will boost company plans to triple its natural gas output to around
2bn cubic metres a year over the next 20 years, representing around 12 per
cent of national demand. The acquisition should make Edison the biggest
private-sector energy group in Italy, said an official.
Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement producer, has acquired 70 per cent of
Cemos Ostrava, one of Czechoslovakia's biggest cement groups. The deal
follows December's purchase by Italcementi of Cement Hranice, the largest
cement producer in Czechoslovakia.
Together, Cement Hranice and Cemos Ostrava control about 15 per cent of the
Czechoslovakian cement market. Italcementi, which is part of the
Italmobiliare group, has an annual capacity of around 20m tonnes and
controls about 36 per cent of the Italian market.

sale speculation

<TEXT>
THE share price of Mitel, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker,
has almost doubled in the past week amid speculation that Britain's BT is
about to sell its controlling interest, or that the loss-making Ottawa
company is on the verge of a long-awaited earnings turnround.
The surge in the share price, from 90 cents to CDollars 1.75, took place in
exceptionally heavy trading. Over 5m Mitel shares changed hands last week.
The share price touched a peak of CDollars 2.01 on Friday on the Toronto
Stock Exchange.
Mitel said in a statement that 'there are no developments to report'
regarding BT's two-year effort to dispose of its 51 per cent stake. But a
company official acknowledged that the management in Canada was 'not totally
aware at all times of what negotiations are going on'.
BT paid CDollars 320m, or CDollars 8 a share, almost seven years ago for its
stake in Mitel, whose specialty is small and medium-sized office PBXs. BT
will almost certainly take a sizeable loss if a buyer is found soon.
Mitel has been in the red for seven consecutive quarters, but last week
reported that its loss fell to CDollars 3.4m (USDollars 2.93m) in the three
months to December 27, from CDollars 5.9m a year earlier. The operating loss
narrowed to CDollars 4.4m from CDollars 7.2m.
The company recently won a contract to supply the US navy.

debt servicing ability

<TEXT>
PETROBRAS, Brazil's state oil monopoly, has made its first loss, turning a
Dollars 557m 1990 profit into a deficit of Dollars 237m for 1991.
The result raises fears among investors over Petrobras' ability to service
and repay the Dollars 761m in Eurobonds it has raised since last July.
For the first time since the company's creation in 1953 it will not pay a
dividend.
Petrobras pioneered Brazil's recent return to the international capital
markets using the slogan 'we're a good company with a bad address'.
However Mr Antonio Claudio Pereira da Silva, the company's superintendent of
finance, said yesterday that he considered the result was positive because
it was linked to 'financial adjustments rather than operating performance'.
He blamed the losses on new accounting laws which require assets to be
revalued according to inflation, while liabilities are adjusted against the
dollar. Last year the dollar rose 528 per cent against the cruzeiro compared
with inflation of 477 per cent.
The new accounting requirement is expected to result in many companies
presenting surprise losses.
While the parent company made profits of Dollars 118m its subsidiaries
reported losses of Dollars 355m. Petroquisa, the petrochemical arm, lost
Dollars 150.5m, Braspetro, its international division, lost Dollars 72.8m,
Petrofertil, its fertiliser subsidiary lost Dollars 50.5m and Petromisa, its
mining division, lost Dollars 113.8m.
The company's gross revenues of Dollars 13.9bn were, however, 11.8 per cent
down on 1990. Petrobras has debts of Dollars 3.8bn of which Dollars 2.6bn
are short term.

<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society which has grown
much faster than the rest of the industry since 1985, defied the recession
yet again last year by raising its pre-tax profits by 25 per cent.
The society's 1991 results, to be announced on Thursday, will show that
pre-tax profits passed Pounds 180m, up from Pounds 144.7m in 1990.
This was achieved despite sharply increased losses on bad loans. These rose
from Pounds 17m to over Pounds 100m, but more than Pounds 60m of them came
from the small Pounds 800m-assets Portsmouth Building Society, which C&amp;G
absorbed in a rescue operation early last year.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, will point out on Thursday that C&amp;G
has effectively doubled its total assets in just two years to over Pounds
14bn.
The increase has come partly from a series of aggressive mergers in which
C&amp;G has absorbed smaller societies, but also from organic growth of its core
businesses.
Unlike most other top ten building societies, C&amp;G has not diversified into
new banking activities, and concentrates on its traditional saving and
mortgage loan businesses for upmarket customers. It is the only one of the
fifteen largest societies which does not offer its customers the use of cash
machines.
As a result, its costs are among the lowest for the entire banking sector at
under 27 per cent of its income.
It is now vying with Leeds Permanent for the fifth place by asset size in
the building society industry.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
P-E INTERNATIONAL, the management and computing group which includes Mr
David Bellamy's environmental consultancy among its subsidiaries, has
appointed a new executive chairman and assured shareholders that it will pay
an unchanged dividend of 6.2p in spite of a poor trading performance.
The new chairman is Mr George Cox, 51, co-founder and former managing
director of Butler Cox, a London-based consultancy bought by Computer
Sciences Corporation of the US last year.
Mr Hugh Lang, who will be 60 later this year, has decided to retire after 30
years with P-E to give more time to other interests including the
chairmanship of Brammar, the industrial distribution and rental services
group.
The announcement came earlier than was originally anticipated as expectation
of poor results drove P-E's share price down to a low of 103p compared with
its 1991-92 high of 195p.
Profits were down by a third at the interim stage and Mr Lang warned that
the second six months would also be disappointing, although sales had picked
up since the new year.
Mr Cox intends to continue to reduce fixed costs - perhaps through
innovative remuneration schemes - while seeking new sources of recurring
revenue through longer term relationships with clients.
He thought the consultancy business could significantly improve its
marketing skills. 'At Butler Cox we were among the best at marketing
ourselves and we were terrible,' he said.

The Independent National Broadcasting Company has attacked suggestions that
its bid of just over Pounds 4m for the second national commercial channel
was too high.
Its bid for the pop music licence was more than double the Pounds 1.88m
second highest offer put forward by TV-am, the breakfast television company,
in a joint venture with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group.
Mr Michael Mallett, chairman of INBC and a former chairman of Yorkshire
Radio Network, said that as the station would be based in Sheffield its
overheads would be much lower than London.
INBC argued on Friday that it was bidding for a unique franchise - the only
national commercial pop music channel - with a potential audience of up 40m.
However, it still has to raise financing of around Pounds 12m and a
prospectus is expected in the next couple of weeks.

Petroleum
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Conroy, founder and chairman of the Irish exploration group
Conroy Petroleum and Natural Resources, was voted off the board along with
the other nine directors at a packed nine-hour extraordinary meeting in
Dublin.
The vote went about 60:40 against Mr Conroy, although around 90 per cent of
the small shareholders backed the existing board.
A new eight-man board under the control of the company's two major
shareholders takes over. The shareholders, Outokumpu, the state-owned
Finnish mining and industrial group, and Dundee Bancorp, a financial
offshoot of Canada's Corona International, have a combined holding of 43.35
per cent.
The new board announced that it was to begin 'a detailed assessment of the
company's operations immediately,' and that Mr Graham Mascall, managing
director of Outokumpu, and Mr Paul Carroll, a director of Dundee, would be
temporary joint chairmen until 'an independent Irish chairman' was
appointed.
Hostility to Mr Conroy first surfaced in 1990 when the companies' two
nominee directors, one of whom was Mr Mascall, resigned over disagreements
on ore marketing arrangements for the chief asset - the 6m ton zinc/lead
orebody at Galmoy, 70 miles south-west of Dublin. Mr Conroy objected to an
Outokumpu proposal giving it sole and exclusive marketing rights to the ore.
The boardroom coup was precipitated though by Conroy's IPounds 7.7m share
exchange acquisition last year of Atlantic Resources, an Irish oil/gas
exploration company.
The two main shareholders argued that this was overpriced, was diverting
Conroy's attention from developing Galmoy, and were clearly angered by what
they saw as Mr Conroy's effort to dilute their holding in the company.
Mr Conroy has remained adamant, though, that the Atlantic deal 'was good
value', creating total oil and gas assets which he estimated 'at between
IPounds 9m and IPounds 10m'.
The new board is likely to sell off Conroy's oil and gas assets and to focus
efforts on Galmoy, which would dovetail better with Outokumpu's other zinc
mining interests in Ireland. These are the Tara mine at Navan, western
Europe's biggest zinc mine, and its 24 per cent stake in the 13.5m ton
zinc/lead deposit at Lisheen, close to Galmoy.
At the meeting, Mr Mascall said it would be the intention to bring Galmoy
into production 'as soon as possible'. Mr Conroy said: 'I am fully
supportive of that. That is what I have been trying to do'.
Cost of developing Galmoy is put at some IPounds 65m, once planning
permission is approved. When in production the mine should be one of the
lowest cost producers in the world.

FT  10 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Royal Bank may sell Charterhouse - Merchant
banking no longer considered a core activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland may sell all or part of Charterhouse, its
merchant banking subsidiary which wants to expand on the continent.
Royal Bank bought Charterhouse in 1985 and has invested a total of about
Pounds 200m in it, but merchant banking is no longer regarded as a core
activity. Mr George Mathewson, recently promoted to chief executive of the
Royal Bank, said yesterday this view had come out of the restructuring
announced in late 1990.
To enable Charterhouse to pursue its ambitions on the continent, 'there may
be a change of ownership structure'. But this should not be seen as putting
the merchant bank up for sale. He stressed that Royal Bank did not need to
sell to bolster its financial position. 'We have the second strongest
balance sheet in the UK banking sector.'
Charterhouse, which is London-based, has retained much of its autonomy.
'That's the secret of its success,' he said. In the restructuring it was
kept separate from the group's corporate and institutional banking division.
Mr Mathewson said Charterhouse had proved a good investment. The idea of
bringing in a continental partner was not based on any failure.
In the year to September, the merchant bank contributed Pounds 38.5m to
group profits before provisions of Pounds 428.7m. Its share of the Pounds
359.5m charged for bad debts was Pounds 18.6m. Net of this, Charterhouse's
total of Pounds 22.3m was down from Pounds 48m the previous year.
Its continued profitability contrasts with TSB's experience with Hill
Samuel, although since TSB bought the merchant bank for Pounds 777m just
over four years ago, it has lumped in with it all of its lending to
companies.
Mr Victor Blank, chairman and chief executive of Charterhouse, said the sort
of partner being looked for was a big bank in Germany or France. It already
had development capital and other activities in Spain, Sweden, France,
Germany and Italy.
The new move could involve the partner taking a stake - not necessarily a
controlling one - or buying it outright. Alternatively a joint venture might
be set up, although Mr Mathewson said it was highly unlikely that any more
money would be invested by Royal Bank. While there have been 'a couple of
exploratory discussions' in the past, no negotiations are currently taking
place.
To buy the merchant bank, Mr Blank said he did not know whether the multiple
of capital would be '1, 1 1/4 or 0.8. We're in recessionary times and there
aren't many buyers around.' Such a multiple would be based on Pounds 187m of
disclosed capital plus 'some hidden reserves'.
Before the recession, in November 1989, Deutsche Bank paid Pounds 950m for
Morgan Grenfell, which made Pounds 57.2m pre-tax profit that year. After a
19 per cent profit fall in 1990, Morgan Grenfell said its returns were
measured not by the Pounds 950m purchase price, but by the Pounds 350m of
capital in it.

FT  10 FEB 92 / British Gas to spin off 15% of Consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is to spin off to the public a 15 per cent stake in Consumers
Gas, the Canadian natural gas utility which it bought in September 1990.
The secondary offering, in the form of instalment receipts, is expected to
raise between CDollars 150m (Pounds 72m) and CDollars 200m. British Gas paid
CDollars 1.1bn for Consumers, Canada's biggest gas distributor.
The public offering is to comply with conditions by the Ontario government
at the time of the acquisition. British Gas undertook to float at least 15
per cent within two years, and to make available to the public at least half
any extra equity financing over the next 10 years.
The public stake in Consumers could thus rise to about 25 per cent by the
end of the decade.
British Gas is expected to keep the offering to the minimum required under
the 1990 agreement. It said none of the proceeds of the share offering would
be received by Consumers Gas.
A Consumers official said the offering would probably take place within the
next three to four weeks. It will be handled by a group of securities
dealers led by Nesbitt Thomson of Toronto.
Investors are likely to be attracted by forecasts of growing demand for
natural gas and the guaranteed rates of return to regulated gas utilities.
Consumers Gas operations are centred on the industrial region of southern
Ontario. The utility has 1.1m customers and earned CDollars 76m from
continuing operations last year on revenues of CDollars 1.69bn.
British Gas has made few changes at Consumers since the takeover beyond
encouraging an active exchange of research and know-how. British Gas also
has a 54 per cent interest in Bow Valley Industries, a Calgary-based oil and
gas producer.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Letter: Too few share vision of good practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was one of the thousand or more international business leaders who
attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, and was a participant in a
private session of the Prince of Wales's Business Leaders Forum. I, and many
of my fellow chairmen present, were therefore surprised at the tone of your
leader, 'Princely Capitalism' (February 5). It certainly did not reflect the
warmth and enthusiasm shown towards the prince for his bold vision for
business.
Why is his view of the business world 'idiosyncratic'? As one of a growing
number of companies which give practical effect to the principles of good
corporate citizenship, my own company has supported and encouraged the
Prince of Wales in acting as an ambassador for the values of 'business
stewardship'. While you rightly state that the prince was urging what we all
regard as good practice, we share his view that too few companies around the
world have as yet fully recognised social and environmental responsibility
as an integral aspect of their business operations.
Nor was the prince advocating this approach, nor partnership with local
communities, as a prescription for an economic miracle as you implied. He
was quite rightly putting the case that business cannot be competitive in
the long run, unless it is more responsive to pressing social and
environmental issues faced by communities in their international markets.
His position may be privileged, but this has not stopped him earning his
credibility from direct experience of working with business leaders in
practical solutions to these problems in many parts of the world.
Surely, the prince's message that talking and thinking is not enough to
match the tough challenges of illiteracy, hunger or environmental
degradation - and that international business has a key part to play in
action to address these issues which directly affect our stakeholders -
deserves even greater attention.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Letter: A magician's trick to increase expenditure on
housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs R TERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a very simple magician's trick which could increase
expenditure on social housing without affecting the public-sector borrowing
requirement ('Save the PSBR', February 6). It involves changing one clause
in legislation which would give local authorities the ability to secure new
loans for housing on their housing assets, without recourse to rates and
revenues. (The government has facilitated this through recent legislation
ring-fencing the housing accounts of local authorities.)
The risk to lenders of such loans would then descend on effective
management, including rent setting and rent collection, and maintenance,
with properties having to be sold (to other social landlords) in cases of
failure. This would be private sector risk as there would be no recourse to
other parts of the authority or its income. This contrasts with the current
situation where all local authority loans are secured on the rates and
revenues of the local authority.
There are two advantages of this approach which should be welcomed by all
political parties. First, the Department of the Environment acknowledges
that there is a backlog of repair which cannot be financed out of net rental
income and current borrowing levels because of the concern about the cost of
rent rebates if rents increase too quickly and the effect on PSBR. Second,
the City would be selective in its lending decisions, financial institutions
would evaluate the performance of local authority housing departments
seeking finance and would advance loans only to those which could
demonstrate that they were managing well from both a housing and financial
point of view. What greater incentive for improvement?

Sir, In taxing ministers for parting company with reality in considering the
privatisation of British Rail, David Sawers (Personal View, February 5)
himself leaves reality forlornly on the platform in two important respects.
He expresses a fear that potential entrants may be put off by the high cost
of entering the business and 'be unwilling to pay the full cost of the
tracks they would use'. Any attempt to recoup the full cost of the track
from any private sector source is destined to fail, no matter how it is
structured, just as any attempt to recoup the full cost of roads directly
from road users would also fail, and for the same reasons. Railway tracks,
like roads, can only be financed from general taxation if one wishes to
retain anything approaching the current network size.
As for the difficulties Mr Sawers sees in franchising provincial services,
of course a potential buyer would want a commercial return. The point is
that, through franchising, unglamorous, mundane services previously done by
the public sector can provide commercial returns if properly managed.
Mr Sawers emphasises BR's weak management, yet advises keeping it intact.
Privatising British Rail as one unit would be tantamount to privatising an
east German Kombinat by leaving it to the former Communist Party officials
to manage.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing so absurd as the sound of British politicians in mortal
fear of losing an election. If one were to judge the contestants solely by
the tone of the campaign over the past few days the verdict is inescapable.
None of them deserves to win. Neither of the two larger parties has sought
to promote a credible programme of radical domestic reform. As to the
Liberal Democrats, some of their ideas may be suitable material for debate,
but that is of little assistance to the voter who wishes to make a choice
between parties likely to be able to form a government.
The first speech of an unedifying weekend was delivered by Mr Neil Kinnock
on Friday. He sought, reasonably enough, to pin the blame for the recession
on the Conservatives. His rhetoric led him into a personal attack on the
prime minister as 'an architect of cardboard city'; for Mr John Major to
pretend otherwise was 'deceit or self-delusion.' Yesterday the shadow
foreign secretary, Mr Gerald Kaufman, developed a similar theme. He asserted
that Mr Major offered 'fibs and fictions about what the Labour government
will do and flights of fantasy about what the Tories would do'.
Mr Major, who has stood aloof from direct attacks on Mr Kinnock, was content
on Saturday to greet with a smile the hiss coming from assembled young
Conservatives when he mentioned Mr Kaufman's name. The prime minister did
fantasise about the Labour party, asserting that it would raise the standard
rate of income tax to 35 per cent. The opposition's policies, he said, would
mean 'perpetual recession and terminal decline'. The chairman of the party,
Mr Christopher Patten, spoke of 'Labour's double whammy - taxes up, prices
up, economy down, living standards down'.
Rough and tumble
This kind of accusation is part of the rough and tumble of politics. It
would not be out of place two or three weeks before polling-day. Its use
now, nearly nine weeks before the likely election date of April 9, is
explained by the failure of either of the two larger parties to gain a
decisive opinion-poll advantage over the other. They still stand neck and
neck, the lead in this or that poll over the past month being well within
the statistical margin of error. This parity of public esteem is partly due
to the perceived similarities between the contestants. The Conservatives
have no really new overall vision to offer and a highly questionable record
to defend. Labour needs to prove its pretensions to respectability, which it
is doing at the cost of offering little of genuine substance in spite of its
voluminous policy proposals.
Knock down
In consequence the Conservatives are trying to set Labour up in order to
knock it down during the final weeks of electioneering. A budget that
reduced the standard rate of income tax by 1p would be a challenge to Labour
to repeat its undertaking to put the 1p back on. The chancellor is under
some pressure from his colleagues to play this card. Saturday's pledge by Mr
John Major to complete and deploy the fourth Trident submarine leaves Labour
vulnerable to the charge that it would countermand the order. In the first
instance Labour would be shown to be a party of high personal taxation, in
the second, it could be called soft on defence. Labour, for its part, is
trying to focus attention on the failings of the Conservatives since 1979.
Tax and defence policies are important, and should be fully aired. There
are, however, other issues to place before the electorate. The government
has evolved a broadly positive strategy for education. Mr Major did explain
education policy to the young Conservatives, although very much in headline
terms.
The government's health reforms are vulnerable to the charge that while the
theory may be sound there are many unavoidable cruelties in the
implementation. The Labour and Liberal Democrat proposals for constitutional
reform need a more rational response from the Tories than a blanket refusal
to contemplate any change. In short, the prime minister's call for a 'clean'
election should be amended. What is required is a serious political debate.

Suitably pacified, the Pakistani team carried on to beat England in the

Horst Urban is a hard man to keep down. Uncowed by his forced departure from
Germany's Continental tyre giant last May, when it was trying to fend off
the advances of Italy's Pirelli, he is carving out a new career as a
management guru.
After a brief stint at the Treuhand privatisation agency in Berlin, the
55-year-old Urban has popped up as a senior management consultant with Price
Waterhouse Corporate Finance where he will advise companies on strategy and
operational tactics.
Not surprisingly, he feels vindicated by events at Conti, where Pirelli beat
a humiliating retreat. It was mainly his robust defence of Conti's
independence that led to his exit after disagreements with the supervisory
board. He did not see eye-to-eye with the mighty Deutsche Bank, one of whose
directors, Ulrich Weiss, heads that board.
So he is glad his new activities will not put him under the thumb of any
bank. Hiding any bitterness well, his only aside is that he is 'not alone in
thinking the banks have too exaggerated a role on the supervisory boards of
German companies.' Weiss, for example, is also a non-executive director of
Volkswagen and Fiat, as well as being responsible for Deutsche's activities
in Italy.

Meanwhile, I hear that Sir Frank Rogers, chairman of the Newspaper
Publishers Association, is a mite embarrassed by the activities of some of
his members.
For more than 20 years now, Sir Frank, who is also deputy chairman of the
Telegraph group, has been urging the newspaper industry to fight the
competition from TV by arguing the case for newspaper advertising
collectively. In November and December the industry spent Pounds 7m on more
than 140 full page ads with provocative copy lines such as ' Some people are
being conned by TV commercials. The people who pay for them.'
Unfortunately, some of Sir Frank's fellow publishers, led by the Mirror
Group, don't seem to have much faith in their own message. Last month was
almost certainly a record for newspaper spending on TV advertising.

The advertising agency BMP DDB Needham is clearly a Janus-like creature
capable of presenting two faces at once. One is responsible for the
government's Pounds 500,000 advertising campaign for the citizen's charter
to improve the public services. The other is behind the Pounds 2m campaign
launched by the public sector union NALGO attacking cuts in public services.
According to the current issue of Campaign, the advertising industry's house
journal, BMP's double life is coming to an end. The Central Office of
Information, which buys government advertising, is to fire BMP as its
standby agency.
While the apparent conflict of interest would certainly offer a
justification, the reason for the sacking is more prosaic. Some ministers
apparently consider the citizen's charter ads too bland.
But there must be a suspicion that the government cannot stomach putting
business the way of an agency whose chief executive, Chris Powell, is a
co-ordinator of the shadow communications agency which advises the Labour
Party on its campaigning.
He is also, incidentally, the brother of Sir Charles Powell, former foreign
policy guru to the former prime minister.

Since Britain is suffering one of its worst recessions ever, the Queen was
right to veto plans to erect a fountain in her honour in Parliament Square.
Asking the population to cough up Pounds 2m for a 25ft ornamental sprinkler
at a time when many people are either out of work or homeless, would have
been insensitive.
Nevertheless, if some loyal subjects want to celebrate her 40th anniversary
on the throne in a material way, Observer has a suggestion. Why not follow
the example of the Dutch, and buy the Queen a bus? True, it will probably
have to be imported. But as Princess Diana has shown with her new Mercedes
sports car, there is nothing wrong with that.
The idea of a royal charabanc is not as silly as it sounds. The Queen
already has a 5,800 tonne yacht, a 14-carriage train, three jets and two
helicopters, costing the British taxpayer over Pounds 18m a year. By
contrast Queen Beatrix's new bus - a gift from the corporate sector  - cost
just over Pounds 100,000. Equipped with 12 plush arm chairs, lavatory and
automatic coffee maker, it is described as 'luxurious but not extravagant'.
Queen Beatrix, who is probably considerably richer than her British
counterpart, aims to travel in her new toy at least once a week. Not only is
it significantly cheaper than the normal motorcade of six royal Dutch
gas-guzzlers, but it is more environmentally friendly.
It's the sort of gift which might appeal to Prince Charles, at least.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Keeping Nato upright
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ONE message came through from the annual Wehrkunde (defence studies)
conference in Munich this weekend, it was that security is no longer, if it
ever was, purely a matter of armies and weapons. In the post-Cold War world,
political and above all economic action will often have a more direct effect
on people's security than military preparations.
Nowhere is this more true than in the transatlantic relationship. Arguments
between the US and its European allies over trade and other economic issues
are not new, but in the past they were overshadowed by the military
alliance, which both sides recognised as of primary importance. Now, with
the disappearance of the Soviet threat, this 'security glue' can no longer
be relied on. Europeans may think they no longer need American protection;
Americans, wrestling with severe economic and social problems of their own,
are tempted to make savings on overseas commitments.
In that context trade disputes can loom larger. American speakers at the
conference, from Vice-President Quayle downwards, stressed the vital
importance of the Uruguay round, not only for trade but also for the
maintenance of the alliance itself. Nothing, they said in substance, is more
useful to US isolationists than the spectacle of Europe adopting a
protectionist stance.
Failure to reach agreement before Easter will leave US presidential and
congressional candidates free to use America's trading partners - Europe as
well as Japan - as whipping boys in the election campaign, and this would
hardly improve the chances of sustaining a long-term US commitment to
European security.
Stable feature
That such a commitment is necessary was accepted by right and left alike at
the Munich conference. Nato is one reasonably stable feature in an
extraordinarily fluid European security scene. The Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe, whatever its longer-term role, is too sketchy a
structure in its present form to inspire confidence in states that see the
fate of Yugoslavia staring them in the face.
Yet, like a bicycle, Nato needs to move forward if it is to stay upright. As
one shrewd American observer pointed out, telling Americans that Europe
wants them to stay may not be enough, unless Nato can demonstrate that it
has a real task to perform in the new circumstances. And, since eastern
Europe's demand for security is the most vociferous, it is there that Nato
has to demonstrate that it has something to offer.
More cautious
Mr Manfred Worner, the alliance's secretary-general, suggested that it is
doing so, through the newly created North Atlantic Cooperation Council which
all ex-Warsaw Pact members and ex-Soviet republics have been invited to
join. He mentioned that the republics had contacted Nato to help them sort
out their quotas of conventional forces under the CFE Treaty. But he was
more cautious about offering them full membership or hard security
guarantees.
Yet that issue will have to be confronted soon. What has given the states of
post-war western Europe their unprecedentedly high level of security has not
been vague structures of co-operation but a firm commitment to each other's
defence, plus integration of their military command structures and (through
the EC) their economies, all based on shared democratic values, although
this last point was fudged when Greece, Portugal and Turkey were Nato
members with authoritarian governments.
In the new situation, all the states from Russia westwards are struggling to
adopt those values, and looking to Nato to help them achieve enough
stability, internal and external, to give them some chance of success.
Although Nato likes to think of itself as a mutual defence pact, rather than
a collective security pact guaranteeing its members against each other, the
fact is that it has done both. If it has really 'won the Cold War', as its
leaders like to proclaim, it should prepare to welcome as members all those
east European states that are ready to undertake the very serious
obligations involved.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Money, mark two: The EC's new five-year budgetary plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The EC's strained national treasuries can be relied upon to search for
evidence of padding, trimmings, or agendas to which they do not subscribe,
when on Wednesday the European Commission unveils its five-year plan to
expand and redistribute the Community budget.
Brussels is not presenting a mere budget, but putting forward the financial
framework within which it thinks the process of European political and
economic integration, agreed by EC leaders at the Maastricht summit in
December, will work.
It will be a carefully assembled package. It will have to be, to achieve not
easily compatible aims and get the 12 member states to agree priorities for
the next five years by the Lisbon summit in June.
The Commission's broad political aims are: to extract more money from the
member states at a time of recession and national budget tightening; to
ensure that in so doing it does not re-open the budget disputes which
paralysed the EC in the early 1980s; and to try to match these resources to
the ambitions of the EC's new treaty on political union and economic and
monetary union.
The treaty was formally signed last Friday in Maastricht, but will take most
of this year to ratify. Demands for more money by the poorer, southern
member states were conceded at Maastricht. But the richer states, led by
Germany, are certain to want to limit the extent to which they have to
finance their less-developed partners. Hard budgetary bargaining could spill
into the national debates on ratification in each member state.
It took a year and two fraught summits, in 1987 and 1988, to agree the EC's
first medium-term financial plan, called the 'Delors package' after Mr
Jacques Delors, the Commission president. Mr Delors is said to regard the
1988 budget deal as his most important achievement in seven years in
Brussels. It started a momentum which allowed the EC to advance further in
four years than in nearly four decades - towards the single market, and to
the Maastricht treaty.
A lot is at stake, therefore, in how well Brussels manages the 'Delors II'
package. As one senior Commission official put it: 'Whenever we argue about
money, everything comes to a halt.' If the review were to degenerate into a
table-thumping wrangle it could block, if not derail, the union train.
That is one reason why Brussels will be suggesting only a modest budgetary
increase. Officials said yesterday it would seek to raise the revenue
ceiling to 1.37 per cent of Community gross national product, from the limit
of 1.2 per cent allowed now. To put this in perspective, the Commission in
1987-88 had originally sought a 1.4 per cent of GNP ceiling. This time, a
senior budgetary official says, Mr Delors will not go after more, in order
to negotiate less: 'Tactically, he believes it is more credible to ask for
what you want and need.'
The 1.2 per cent limit proved flexible because of higher than expected
growth and tight budgetary discipline. This year's budget of nearly Ecu66bn
(Dollars 85bn) is well under the ceiling at 1.14 per cent. But there can be
no certainty about the Commission's growth assumptions for 1993-97, while it
is already clear that spending on agriculture and regional development, the
EC's two big budgets, will absorb at least three-fifths of increased
revenue.
This leaves little over to finance the greater commitments the EC is
assuming abroad, particularly as the Common Foreign and Security Policy
agreed at Maastricht takes shape. Though this will be run between the
governments of the 12 as a form of multilateral co-operation, it is the EC,
through the Commission, which will have to provide much of the external aid
to underpin it. Nor will there be much money for the industrial
restructuring policy through which Mr Delors wants to strengthen European
manufacturing - and in which Commission free marketeers already suspect a
French-inspired plan to back 'Euro-champions' against Japan and the US.
On the assumption of an average of 2.5 per cent annual growth in Community
GNP during the five years, the total budget would reach just over Ecu88bn in
1997, at 1992 prices - a modest rise when set against the EC's increasing
responsibilities.
The revenue side of the EC budget is an accretion of instruments jumbled
together over the years, in a way which regularly creates resentment among
member states which feel they are not getting a fair deal. The UK has been
getting a rebate since 1985 - worth Ecu3.3bn last year - thanks to former
prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher's advocacy. Spain has successfully
insisted that the south and periphery of the EC (Spain, Portugal, Greece and
Ireland) need greater fiscal transfers to have any hope of joining the
currency union which will be created by 1999 at the latest.
To reduce opportunities for squabbling, long-mooted plans for a new source
of revenue linked to member states' relative prosperity have been shelved in
favour of making greater use of the so-called 'fourth resource'. This is the
payment linked to each country's size of GNP. But up to now it has been used
only as a balancing item, making up the difference after customs duties,
agriculture levies and the EC's share of value-added tax receipts come in.
VAT revenue provides more than half the budget, penalising countries with
high consumption and low savings.
Beyond this rebalancing of revenue, 'Delors II' envisages doubling regional
aid to the poorest four countries. This effort would raise the Structural
Funds - for laggard and industrially stricken regions - from Ecu17.7bn this
year to Ecu29bn (at 1992 prices) in 1997. The four poorest countries will
get their doubling through the new 'cohesion fund' agreed in Maastricht.
This would be worth about Ecu2.5bn by 1997 and enable them to meet EC
environmental standards and build cross-border transport links.
The biggest spender will remain the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The
CAP still absorbs 54 per cent of spending, and because it rewards Europe's
richest farmers most, is the main reason why the Dutch and Danes do
unjustifiably well out of the budget. This should change if the Commission
wins acceptance of its plan to reform the CAP. Under the reform, farm
spending would rise from about Ecu35.3bn this year to Ecu38.6bn in 1997, but
it would be more evenly spread across the EC. Additional allocations will be
needed in 1995-96 to get over a short-term spending hump, when CAP costs
would reach nearly Ecu40bn.
The external aid budget will be made a separate rubric, and get a bigger
proportional increase, from Ecu3.3bn now to around Ecu6bn in 1997 at 1992
prices - along with a new reserve of about Ecu1bn. This novelty aims to
enable the EC to react rapidly to calls for humanitarian and food aid.
Unforeseen aid demands have caused five budget revisions since 1989, leading
to long disputes between the Council of Ministers (of the 12) and the
European Parliament, and politically embarrassing hold-ups in delivering the
aid.
The reserve would also underwrite EC loan guarantees, which now stand at
more than Ecu10bn. This, a senior official says, should enable the EC to
lend more, while guarding against default, and target the aid budget on
technical assistance - 'to transfer know-how, not build roads; loans are for
that'. Eastern Europe, the Maghreb countries and the Middle East will be the
priority recipients.
Most commissioners now appear to agree that Mr Delors' wish to finance
restructuring, retraining and research in the car, electronics, defence and
textiles industries is more than a wheeze for troubled French companies such
as Thomson and Renault to get round restrictions on state aid. The two core
ideas are to bring some research and development spending closer to the
market, enabling a response to innovation in industry, and to use part of
'Social Fund' spending on long-term and youth unemployment to intervene to
prevent job losses through retraining programmes. What is likely, officials
say, is that companies will tap something like Ecu4bn at today's prices -
against current R&amp;D spending of Ecu2.6bn and Ecu1.7bn in Social Fund money
not tied to regions.
Though in theory any company will be able to apply, France has the
industrial support system best geared to scoop up these funds. The southern
countries, which already do badly out of the R&amp;D budget because of their low
research base, are likely to resist any further drift northwards of funding.
Even this modest amount could cause ructions in what will be a very
delicately poised exercise.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Crunch in the skies: Efforts to ease air traffic congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty years ago, a British European Airways flight from London to Paris on
a Vickers Vanguard turbopropeller-driven aircraft took exactly one hour.
Today, the same journey on a new British Airways Boeing 767 jet is scheduled
to take five minutes more.
Despite advances in aircraft design and the introduction of the jet engine,
the average journey time on short-haul routes (one hour or so) takes longer
these days because of congestion in European skies and on the ground at busy
airport terminals.
Even the slump in air travel caused by the recession and the Gulf crisis
last year has done little to ease the problem. BA calculates that delays in
its operations last year at London's Heathrow airport alone totalled 233
days. Lufthansa says it loses about DM100m (Pounds 35m) a year through
delays.
The Association of European Airlines (AEA), which represents 22 European
airlines, estimates the total cost of air traffic disruptions in Europe at
about Dollars 4bn a year. The International Air Transport Association (IATA)
forecasts that this is likely to worsen to some Dollars 10bn a year by the
end of the decade if nothing is done to improve the situation.
The problems of European air traffic control are not new. But the issue is
coming to a head with a recent warning from Mr Giovanni Bisignani, the new
AEA chairman and managing director of Alitalia, that Europe's fragmented and
inadequate system could lead to another hot summer of delays and
cancellations, and, in the longer term, to a capacity crunch in Europe's
skies.
The warning coincides with both a recovery in European air traffic this year
after a 7 per cent fall last year and the completion of a detailed report by
Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based European air traffic control body,
concluding that the problems are much greater than had been thought.
The two-year study was commissioned by the transport ministers of the
23-nation European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) in 1990 as the first
phase of an overdue programme to try to harmonise and integrate Europe's
disorderly patchwork of different air traffic control systems by the end of
the decade.
Transport ministers will consider the report's findings at a meeting in
London next month to launch the next phase of ECAC's European Air Traffic
Control Harmonisation and Integration Programme.
Of 52 European air traffic control centres evaluated, half were found to
have 'significant deficiencies' requiring 'a major system upgrade'; 24 per
cent had 'major deficiencies' needing a completely new system; 9 per cent
had 'some deficiencies'; and only 17 per cent had 'no deficiencies' at all.
However, all the centres share one big deficiency. They are incompatible.
'The 51 centres from which information is available have some 31 different
systems, using computers from 18 different manufacturers with 22 different
operating systems and 33 different programming languages,' the report says.
By contrast, the US, which controls nearly three times Europe's airspace,
operates a single system in 20 centres. Investment in air traffic control
systems in Europe has also lagged way behind spending in the US.
But perhaps the biggest problem is political. Some countries, such as Greece
and Portugal, have low priorities in their national spending targets for new
aviation infrastructure programmes compared with Britain, France or Germany.
But even these countries are divided on how to resolve Europe's air traffic
control problems.
Germany, for example, has been pressing for the development of a single,
unified system using the same equipment throughout Europe. But the UK argues
that the German proposal is unworkable and is recommending integrating the
existing European systems.
'You cannot stop traffic for even one day while you develop a parallel
system,' says Mr Derek McLauchlan, chief executive of National Air Traffic
Services at Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.
According to Mr McLauchlan, the multiplicity of air traffic control
equipment in Europe is not a fundamental problem. He says a more realistic
approach to improve European air traffic controlis to adopt common standards
to enable them to communicate.
But many in the industry are sceptical about the prospects of improvement.
'The chances of getting governments to agree are limited,' says Capt Philip
Hogg, who is in charge of air traffic control affairs at BA. 'But if there
is not the political will, the public outrage in 10 years will be so great
that no government will be able to withstand the political pressures.'
The airline joke is no longer 'breakfast in London, lunch in New York,
baggage in Rome', but 'breakfast in London, lunch at Heathrow'.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: Mary Stuart - Battersea Arts Centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friedreich von Schiller's Maria Stuart (Weimar, 1800) has endured because he
found drama in history and created a fictional meeting between Queen
Elizabeth and Mary Stuart, then the most influential women in Europe.
Schiller's spark has ignited a bonfire of imitations; some, outrageously
funny (Theatre Wilde Mischung Berlin), and others, like Dacia Maraini's
version now at the Battersea Arts Centre, powerful and lyrical testimony to
the linked fortunes of two uncompromising monarchs.
Mary was executed at Fotheringay Castle on February 8 1587. She had spent 19
of her 44 years in prison. She was buried at Peterborough and then removed
to Westminster Abbey in 1612. By then, her son, James, was king of England.
The contrasts with her childless cousin Elizabeth are the fabric of
Schiller's play: marriage or single life, exile or rootedness, romance or
realpolitik.
The Battersea Arts Mary Stuart takes place in a dressing room and opens to
the strains of Mick Hucknell and Simply Red. One suspects director Nicolette
Kay (who in turn translated Dacia Maraini's version from the Italian) has
the regal coiffure in mind. But that is the evening's only levity. Pointed,
meticulous acting from Anne Firbank (Elizabeth) and Louise Jameson (Mary)
keep Schiller's issues alive: 'History,' says Elizabeth, 'asks for a choice:
either her or me.' And Mary writes to Elizabeth on the eve of her execution,
'Europe is about to watch you behave justly.'
Both actors play the lady-in-waiting to their opposite, creating an easy
symmetry and continuity in the evening. While Mary dreams of the Earl of
Bothwell, Elizabeth bullies the Parliament; while Mary goes barefoot to the
block, Elizabeth stomps around in black work-boots. The production also
emphasises the connections as well as the contrasts, trying to show that the
ties between women are the strongest and most lasting. It rests on a shrewd
feminist regard for the personality that kept Elizabeth in power and Mary in
patient exile.
What this Mary Stuart adds to Schiller is an undercurrent of sexuality.
Elizabeth taunts her maid with sexually violent language or summons a
stable-boy strip-o-gram. Mary remembers herself with a face 'flushed by the
wind' leading her men into battle. On one side of the stage, Mary gives
birth to James; on the other, Elizabeth rails about her dry, barren womb.
But there is gentler wisdom from the Virgin Queen: 'love is the consent you
give to your own subjection'.

BBC2 devotes nearly four hours to a live broadcast of Don Giovanni from
Covent Garden. Johannes Schaaf's new production is conducted by Bernard
Haitink in the presence of the Queen. Thomas Allen sings Giovanni with
Claudio Desderi as Leporello, Carol Vaness as Donna Anna and Hans Peter
Blochwitz as Don Ottavio (6.50).
A new American comedy series, Evening Shade, is launched on Channel 4 with a
special 60-minute episode. Burt Reynolds plays Wood Newton, a former
pro-footballer who returns to his home town to coach the local team. He won
the 1991 Emmy for Best Comedy Actor in this, his first sitcom (8.30).
ITV's light drama, El CID, set on the 'Costa del Crime', will cause
exclamations of amazement when it is repeated in 2002 because of the quality
of its cast, tonight John Bird, Tony Haygarth, Denis Lawson and more (9.00).

FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: Le nozze di Figaro - Theatre Royal de la Monnaie,
Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To describe the outgoing artistic director, musical director and matre de
danse of Brussels's Theatre Royal de la Monnaie as a team would be
euphemistic. Anyhow, that trio recently left the Monnaie together, bowing
out by bowing to Mozart. It is strange to think of the Monnaie as it now is:
no Gerard Mortier, no Sylvain Cambreling, no Mark Morris. And yet they were
already invisible in their new, farewell staging of Figaro. Morris directed
and Cambreling conducted, but they were wholly transparent.
I have never seen Figaro less 'produced' or more musical. Simply, we saw the
singers behaving, in character, to the music with utter spontaneity and
consistent detail. We saw a real world onstage, small and intimate, where
everyone knows each other. What a rare achievement this is amid an era of
style-laden and concept-heavy productions.
It is full of life. The setting is thoroughly Spanish (men and women all use
fans, as naturally and characterfully as the hands that hold them), the
period (rather pre-Beaumarchais) somewhere between Velasquez and Goya, the
household far from lavish. The eye is drawn throughout to details of
character and drama. Cherubino's eyes briefly blaze when the Count calls him
'picciol serpente'; a quick exchange of looks between Figaro and Susanna
summed up their intimacy in a trice. The Countess sings her great
accompanied recitative while slowly descending a staircase, lost in thought.
The fact that she does not see Cherubino disappearing with Barbarina lends
one poignance to the scene; and the way she seems suddenly to fall down a
single step while exclaiming 'O cielo]' adds another.
Adrienne Lobel's decor is a blight on proceedings. I liked its economy (each
act occurs on a separate face of a revolving set) and its lack of glitz; and
it placed all the action on a small area at the front of the stage. This
tightness lent ideal intensity to the great ensembles. But the set's
outlines are Toytown, its Spanish colours Day-Glo. The effect is
postmodern-tacky - especially wrong in so modest a staging. However, Martin
Pakledinaz's beautifully simple costumes and James Ingalls's atmospheric
lighting serve to integrate this place with what occurs within it.
What a beautiful house for Mozart the Monnaie is; I have never heard so many
of da Ponte's words. And Sylvain Cambreling's conducting was as unobtrusive
and as revealing as the production. I noted in particular a terrific
drumroll crescendo in the Count's aria and the witty oboes in the Act Four
finale as Figaro and Susanna are reconciled, but what mattered more were the
pellucid texture and the perfect 'speaking' pace. Only his own, rather
laborious, harpsichord accompaniment to the recitatives drew attention to
the workings of the machinery.
The singers seemed to create both production and score as they went along; I
have no higher compliment. (The good-spirited way they coped with doors that
either would or wouldn't stay shut heightened this impression.) Jose van Dam
 -the Belgian hero at home - was an exceptionally credible Figaro, both
stern and buffo, never cute, thunderous in anger or reproof; and Dale
Duesing, though too hard-pressed at either extreme of his voice, was a
vivid, intense Count  - singing his aria sitting tight in his chair as if
bottled up and about to explode - with superb gestures of hands and fan.
Elzbieta Szmytka, a bright Susanna, was all clarity, spontaneity and
cherishable nuance. The Countess was Hillevi Martinpelto, occasionally stiff
as an actress but making a great impression with her phenomenally clean
entry into notes. Cherubino (Monica Baccelli) and Barbarina (Laura Cherici)
were both young, Italian and unusually appealing in voice and detail. Magali
Chalmeau Damonte made much of Marcellina's aria; and Basilio and Bartolo
flourished in the veteran hands of Ugo Benelli and Jules Bastin. I could
pick holes if I chose - I heard some aspirate from several cast members -
but I can't bear to.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: Gloriana - State Theatre, Mainz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from isolated foreign tours by Sadler's Wells and English National
Opera, this is only the second time Gloriana has been staged outside London,
and Mainz has scored an unmitigated triumph.
At first glance Britten's Coronation opera seems a curious choice for a
minor German house. But his other stage works are being performed ever more
frequently in Germany, the video of Colin Graham's ENO production of
Gloriana has done good mileage on continental television and the Mainz
management just happened to foresee that 1992 was the 40th anniversary of
our present monarch's accession to the throne. The chance to revive
Britten's study of a dutiful queen growing old was too good to miss.
Mainz's anglophile interest doesn't stop there: the concert programme for
the next three months includes no less than three important Elgar works and
Delius's 'Walk to the Paradise Garden', apparently the choice of the local
music director, Peter Erckens. But it was his deputy, Gunther Bauer-Schenk,
who super-vised the opening night of Gloriana with such assurance and an
unmistakable grasp of Britten's rhythmic and textural palette. Far from
revealing traces of self-consciousness or pastiche in the score, this
performance pointed up its sincerity and range of invention, its cumulative
punch and psychological perception. The full-strength Mainz orchestra
sounded very impressive indeed - much more so than the underpowered chorus.
The Swiss stage director and designer Martin Schlumpf maintained the work's
period flavour, but with discreet modern echoes (liberally supplemented in
the programme book) which added a touch of irony to the proceedings -
underlining that the theatre of monarchy remains the same today, even if its
powers and personal dilemmas have changed. The opening scene, for example,
featured a crowd of flag-waving royal-watchers, kept in place by a police
cordon; during their fireside discussion, Cecil helped himself and the queen
to tea from a trolley, dwarfed by an ancient wall-map in which Britain
dominated the contours of the modern world; and Elizabeth herself was
complete mistress of the 20th-century royal wave.
The pared-down representational decor - a heraldic banner and arch in the
opening scene, a golden globe in the queen's ante-chamber, a star-lit bower
for Essex's garden - kept the action moving swiftly and atmospherically.
With silver-grey gowns and bustles for the ladies, stylised ruffs for the
men and a dash of colour for the principals (including a punkish pink wig
for the queen), there was no shortage of ceremonial dignity in the Act two
ball, which ended in a flickering red glow as the dancers made merry into
the night. Schlumpf's handling of the 'private' scenes - the suggestion of
physical passion beneath the royal mask, the shock of discovering royalty
off-guard - was equally masterful.
None of this would have counted without the wealth of characterisation
provided by a well-integrated ensemble of singers. Struck by a virus just
before opening night, Edith Fuhr was able only to act the part of Elizabeth,
but she did so with dignity and stern strength of character. The role was
sung from the side of the stage by Anna Sylvan, a member of the chorus who
had studied it of her own free will, and who possesses a lustrous soprano of
ideal proportions. It was a pleasure to applaud two artists for such a
smoothly synchronised performance.
John Treleaven captured Essex's impetuous, flawed ambition, but lacked the
sweetness and purity of tone for 'Happy were he'. As the principal
courtiers, Angelika Rode, Elaine Woods, Hannu Niemela and Peter Anton Ling
gave strong support. The performance was sung in Egon Waldmann's German
translation, which misses the poetry of the original. The first scene of Act
two (the assembly and masque at Norwich) was omitted.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carpetland, the management buy-out company hoping to rise from the Lowndes
Queensway ashes, has chosen Julian Lee as its non-executive chairman.
Lee appears to have been picked not for any retailing savvy but rather for
the Midas touch that he exhibited in leading the Bricom buy-out of the
non-financial interests of British &amp; Commonwealth - which he successfully
sold to a Swedish-led group of investors two years later, in a deal which
increased staff and management's investment by a factor of 25.
A chartered accountant by training and a partner at Arthur Andersen until
1982, Lee joined Phibro, the Salomon subsidiary, briefly becoming
international chief operating officer in London before moving to B&amp;C in
1985.
As Lee tells Lowndes Queensway employees involved in last August's buy-out
how to make a go of Carpetland, one of his competitors will be Sir Philip
Harris, former employer of many Carpetland staff. The carpet baron who
personally made a Pounds 70m profit when he sold out of Lowndes Queensway
two years before it collapsed in a heap of debt, is well into his next
carpet business, Carpetright, which is already doing well enough for Sir
Philip to be considering a stock market flotation.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Output rise by small companies 'delayed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPROVEMENT in orders and output expected by smaller businesses four
months ago has yet to materialise, according to the latest Smaller Firms'
Economic Report from the Confederation of British Industry.
The report for last month confirms that businesses have consistently
underestimated the extent of the recession in manufacturing.
It shows that the rate of decline in output and orders for small businesses
slowed in the four months to last month, and that a further slowdown is
expected over the coming four months.
Mr Richard Brucciani, the new chairman of the CBI's Smaller Firms' Council,
said that the slowdown in the rate of decline was a positive sign, but the
growth in orders and output for which small businesses hoped still appeared
to be some way off. More small businesses are cutting investments in plant
and machinery although spending on training is set to rise, the report says.
Spending on product and process innovation is not expected to change.
It adds that cost pressures have remained weak and that unit costs will
continue to rise only very slowly in the coming months.
However, the expected increase in export orders has not occurred, and there
has been a rise in the number of businesses reporting a decline in overseas
orders. One in three companies cited the political and economic situation
abroad as constraining export orders, apparently reflecting difficulties in
the US and German economies.

<TEXT>
MR Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, yesterday attacked the
Franco-German plan to create a combined European defence corps, warning that
it could drive the US out of Nato.
His sharp criticism immediately won the unlikely support of Sir Geoffrey
Pattie, a former junior Tory defence minister and a leading backbench
spokesman on the subject.
It also reflected a bitter attack on French attitudes to Nato by Mr Richard
Perle, the former US under-secretary for defence.
The Anglo-American front against the Franco-German plan emerged at the
annual Wehrkunde conference in Munich, a gathering which assembles some of
the top defence analysts and officials from the Nato allies.
Mr O'Neill launched his onslaught with a dismissal of fears that US trade
protectionism, and the US budget deficit, were the greatest threats to Nato
solidarity.
'These are merely signs of the illness, rather than the cause of it,' he
said. 'The cause is the uncertainty created in the last 12 months as a
consequence of the floating of the concept of the Franco-German force.
The problems this will create are of a character which go to the very heart
of the Nato alliance.'
He accused France of having 'at best, a semi-detached relationship' with
Nato, and called for clarification of how the Franco-German command
structure would relate to Nato command, who would have responsibility for
French nuclear weapons, and whether the force was intended to function
outside Europe.
The Anglo-American attacks brought an angry response from France and
Germany.
General Klaus Naumann, the Inspector-General of the Bundeswehr, said Mr
O'Neill's criticism was based on inaccurate reports about the Franco-German
initiative.
In the absence of high-level speakers, France had to be defended by Mr Serge
Boidevaix, the ambassador to Bonn. He insisted that France had always been a
loyal and trustworthy ally in Nato.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Court may plug bank insurance sales loophole
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FEDERAL appeals court ruling has threatened to block a loophole that
allowed many US banks to sell insurance policies.
The loophole allowed nationally chartered banks to sell insurance in towns
with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants. A 1986 decision by the Comptroller of the
Currency, who supervises these banks, allowed them to expand insurance sales
from their small town branches to other markets.
This extension, as well as a number of other regulatory measures which have
gradually opened up the insurance field to banks, has been hotly contested
by insurance agents, who have brought a series of lawsuits contesting the
Comptroller's interpretation.
The appeals court decision not only overrules this interpretation, however;
it says that the entire clause was in fact erased from law in 1918 by a
congressional drafting error.

<TEXT>
THE US is seeking ways of stepping up pressure on Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
President Bush is reported to have signed a 'finding' notifying Congress of
his decision to authorise covert action against President Saddam, and the
administration is also examining how to stiffen the economic blockade
imposed on Iraq by the United Nations.
Meanwhile, Mr Robert Gates, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is
touring the Middle East on a trip the White House says is 'normal'.
Mr Bush declined to comment at the weekend on efforts to oust the Iraqi
ruler. 'I've said I'd like to see him out of there. I'll just leave it right
there,' he said.
Mr Samuel Skinner, the White House chief of staff, said yesterday that Mr
Saddam was already under considerable pressure, and would inevitably lose
power eventually.
"We're not talking about military operations here, we're talking about
increasing the economic pressure on him.'
The flurry of anti-Saddam activity has, however, aroused scepticism that it
is motivated by Mr Bush's embarrassment that the Iraqi president is still in
power, a year after the Gulf war and on the eve of the first primaries.
The assiduous leaking of the presidential finding, which should normally
remain top secret, is viewed as indicating that the administration is more
concerned with gestures than with deeds.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Belgium languishes in political doldrums: Stalemate in
attempts to form a new government is testing the nation's patience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NOTHING NEW, began the lead story on one Belgian news bulletin at the end of
last week. The reporter was referring to the lack of information about last
Tuesday's kidnapping of a Flemish textile magnate's grandson, but he could
easily have been commenting on the Belgian political situation, writes
Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Held hostage for nearly 80 days by the inconclusive result of last
November's general election, Belgium is still ticking over under a caretaker
prime minister - the long-serving Mr Wilfried Martens. But the patience of
the king, the people and the politicians is beginning to fray.
Ten days ago Mr Melchior Wathelet, the impressive leader of the
French-speaking Christian Democrats, abandoned after six weeks his attempt
to form a new government. He is the second politician to fail in the task
entrusted to him by the king.
Mr Wathelet warned it would be impossible to form a new government if the
potential coalition partners did not change their stance.
Belgian electors registered a huge protest vote against the feuding
centre-left coalition three months ago. The fear now is that a new election
may have to be held, which could further splinter the political
establishment and perhaps play into the hands of extreme right-wingers who
benefited from the November poll.
The consequences of the stalemate are not only political: Air France and
Sabena, the ailing Belgian state airline, are fretting over the delay
imposed on their proposed alliance, which has been suspended since the
collapse of the last government.
Perhaps the last hopes of forming a new coalition now lie with Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, the Flemish Christian Democrat who managed to broker a deal between
the parties 107 days after the country's previous election in 1988. He must
report to the king on the current situation and, if there is a chance of
compromise, he may be asked to form a government.
Mr Wathelet had tried to bring together the former coalition of Christian
Democrats and socialists from both sides of the Flemish-French language
divide.
His efforts were thwarted partly by the Flemish Christian Democrats'
insistence on a government which could push through constitutional reforms.
The coalition suggested by Mr Wathelet would not have commanded a large
enough majority in parliament and the Flemish liberal party refuses to ally
itself with the traditional parties, which all lost seats in the last
election.
But his attempt was at least imaginative: last month Mr Wathelet tried in
vain to shift the debate to real issues by publishing his ideal government
programme, including a citizens' charter of improvements to public services.
Mr Dehaene wants to continue with the same programme, but most Belgians
doubt whether much will change even if he brings the parties together.
There is even a possibility that Belgium's protest vote will bring to power
an identical coalition under an identical prime minister - nothing new.

FT  10 FEB 92 / The European Market: Spain braces for shakeout in its steel
industry - Basque workers are opposing plans to scrap furnaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARIA Ang-eles is everything a fine Basque lady should be; tall, proud, warm
and revered. Thousands of tough Basque steelmen have sworn to protect and
preserve her. For Maria Angeles is blast furnace 2A at the sprawling
integrated steelworks of the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya (AHV) alongside the Rio
Nervion just outside Bilbao.
If the Spanish Industry Ministry in Madrid gets its way, she is about to be
shut forever.
Spain is fast approaching a steel shakeout. Its two integrated (makers and
rollers of steel) producers are thought to have lost about Pta50bn (Pounds
276.24m) last year after a recovery in the steel price in 1988 and 1989
faded away.
The only two integrated producers - state-owned Ensidesa, and AHV, which is
effectively state controlled - are floundering in three large, overmanned
and badly co-ordinated sites in the Basque country and the principality of
Asturias with little hope of economic recovery unless their steelmaking
capacity is cut and restructured.
It costs AHV about Dollars 380 (Pounds 209.9) to make a ton of hot rolled
steel and Dollars 350 at Ensidesa; on average their EC competitors can do
this for Dollars 285 a ton. And Spain is no longer a low-wage paradise. In
the last four years wages have grown at 11 per cent and 9 per cent annually
at Ensidesa and AHV.
In these, probably the two most heavily unionised, regions of Spain workers
have thrown themselves into a series of intermittent strikes to agitate,
paradoxically, for a restructuring plan. Between 7,000 and 9,000 of the
23,000 jobs at both Ensidesa and AHV will go. The government's proposals,
due out later this month, will probably cut steelmaking capacity, now at a
theoretical 6m tonnes a year, by 25 per cent.
When the European steel industry first began to make big capacity cuts after
the 1973 oil price shock, Spain was undergoing a tense political transition
following the death of General Franco. It was only after the present
socialist government came to power in 1982 that the authorities began to
take steel seriously.
In 1984 the government closed down the Altos Hornos de Mediterraneo
integrated works outside Valencia, shed jobs at Ensidesa and AHV and pumped
Dollars 900m into a new steel shop at Ensidesa's works at Aviles in
Asturias. It is now Europe's most efficient. In all, the restructuring cost
Dollars 5bn.
But steel's sad story has caught up with Madrid again.
Spain has not been able to subsidise steel shrinkage and losses the way the
European Commission allowed UK, German and French producers to do in the
1970s. By the time it joined the EC in 1986, tougher regulation was in place
and price floors had been abolished. Even worse, the sharp decline in flat
product prices in Europe in the last two years has been heightened in Spain
by the quick abolition of import tariffs required by the EC.
The Industry Ministry has already made a first move to merge Ensidesa, which
belongs to the state holding company INI and AHV which, although a private
sector company, has had to be rescued so often by the state that the
official industrial credit bank now owns about Pta50bn worth of convertible
bonds - and thus a majority shareholding - in it.
Last year the Integrated Steel Corporation was created and this year the
chairman of it and Ensidesa, Mr Jose Manuel Garcia Hermoso, will probably
take over at AHV as well. A long-serving state sector corporate doctor, Mr
Garcia Hermoso is the mastermind behind the restructuring plans about to be
presented.
These are likely to include the scrapping of AHV's three blast furnaces in
Bilbao and the four old furnaces Ensidesa has at Aviles, leaving just two at
the Ensidesa plant at the nearby port of Gijon functioning. Although the
Aviles steel shop would then become the star of the newly merged company,
managers at Ensidesa say it could easily be fed with pig iron (raw material
made in blast furnaces) from Gijon.
The problem then would be the AHV works at Bilbao. The Basque country is
politically volatile and it would be asking too much of any government in
Madrid to stop making steel there.
Madrid thinks it can get around this by shutting one AHV furnace quickly and
allowing Maria Angeles a few more years of life while the ISC builds what
will, for Europe, be a revolutionary new mini-mill.
Mini-mills make steel by melting scrap in normally small electric arc
furnaces, avoiding the heavy and expensive process of making pig iron. But
Nucor, the maverick anti-union mini-mill producer in the US, has pioneered -
with European technology - a giant mini mill in which steel is poured into
continuous casting machines and, from there, straight on to a hot strip mill
without having to make slabs first. The energy savings are immense.
Madrid is considering building such a mill in Bilbao to produce 800,000 tons
a year. That, however, would only promise profitability if the unions
accepted adequate job losses. They will only do that in the Basque country
and Asturias if the government is able to guarantee sufficient new
infrastructural investment in the north to attract new industries.
Thus Madrid's partly successful efforts at last December's EC summit in
Maastricht to force the creation of a Community cohesion fund - to channel
development funds to poorer EC members who prove they are meeting
disciplined EC economic targets - are crucial. Without the funds, the
communications infrastructure required to lock the mountainous north into
the rest of the country and Europe cannot be put in place. Maria Angeles and
her admirers would then be condemned to a less dignified end than is about
to be tabled.

THE RED FLAGS flew once more in the heart of Moscow yesterday as
demonstrators claiming to be carrying forward the ideas of Lenin - and, on
some banners, Stalin - mounted a protest against the country's economic
misery, writes John Lloyd from Moscow.
At a separate gathering of 'patriotic groups' on Saturday, Mr Alexander
Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president, took his opposition to the Russian
government a stage further when he called its policy 'economic genocide' -
the exact phrasing of a number of yesterday's posters.
However, where the demonstrators were calling for a reassertion of Communist
power to stop the rot, Mr Rutskoi, an air force general, said he feared such
a reassertion if the course were not changed.
Both Mr Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's chairman - who
has criticised economic policy on Russian television - insisted that they
supported President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Rutskoi said that he and the president
had no differences, while Mr Khasbulatov said that he was 'like-minded, in
strategic terms'.
Yesterday's neo-Communist marchers, numbering some 50,000, were led by Mr
Viktor Antipov, who is the most active of a number of leaders among Russia's
hardline groups.
A significant number of the placards blamed the policy on the Jews. Others
called for freedom for the leaders of the failed August coup, while a number
of demonstrators carried photographs of Stalin, the red banner - the banner
of the former Russian Socialist Federation - the St Andrews Cross of old
Russia; and the black, yellow and white imperial banner.
The militia, out in force, kept the march away from the Russian parliament -
its original objective - where some 10,000 to 15,000 democrats heard
speeches about the need to defend democracy and support the president.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of Krajina, the Serb enclave in Croatia, yesterday reaffirmed
their resistance to the United Nations peace plan for Yugoslavia, in the
face of increased pressure from Serbia to accept the proposals.
On the eve of a crucial session of its parliament, Mr Milan Babic, the
president of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Krajina, yesterday
said: 'A step forward has been made in the plan.' But he continued to oppose
a key element of the UN initiative to despatch 10,000 peacekeepers. He said
Serb reservists could not be disbanded while Croatia maintained its army.
Mr Lazar Macura, Krajina's information minister, added: 'The Yugoslav army
no longer exists. There are many army officers who are ready to stay in
Krajina, about 30,000 reservists are from the region. . . only the generals
who are manipulated by Belgrade will leave.'
At the same time, in a move directed by Serbia, a rival parliament in Glina,
northern Krajina, was yesterday expected to approve the UN plan.
Mr Babic dismissed the manoeuvres by Serbia, under President Slobodan
Milosevic, to marginalise the leadership in Knin, the capital of Krajina. He
said: 'It (Glina) is not a legitimate session. It is simply a continuation
of pressure from Belgrade.'
The parliament in Knin is expected to approve today the holding of a
referendum on the UN plan, which could break the deadlock between Krajina
and Serbia. Mr Babic said: 'If the people approve the plan, I will bow to
their will.'
Despite Mr Babic's defiance, the inhabitants of Knin, tired of the economic
deprivation brought on by the civil war, seem likely to approve the UN plan.
'We want peace. Any plan that will bring us peace,' said one worker.
Serbia has denounced Mr Babic as the main obstacle to peace. Serbia last
month also cut off Krajina from the monetary system, when it issued new bank
notes. The Yugoslav dinars currently circulating in Knin are practically
worthless, valid only in Krajina.

FT  10 FEB 92 / Bulgaria eases curbs on foreigninvestment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BULGARIAN parliament has passed a foreign investment law aimed at
attracting western enterprises, which may finally be part of a much more
comprehensive economic reform package.
The law, which supersedes a law implemented in 1990, abolishes restrictions
on the repatriation of profits, allows western enterprises to own Bulgarian
companies, and permits foreign investors to set up their own enterprises in
the country.
The law also permits foreign companies to acquire a share in Bulgarian
banks, or set up their own banks, subject to authorisation from the National
Bank of Bulgaria.
This is likely to have a significant effect on the country's banking system,
which until recently was highly centralised and politically controlled. It
might also make it easier for western investors to speed up their
transactions when doing business with Bulgaria.
However, the Bulgarian government, in common with some of the other
countries in eastern Europe, has yet to decide how far it is willing to
extend property and ownership rights to non-Bulgarian citizens.
For instance, foreigners may acquire a right of ownership in buildings,
presumably for business activities, and may acquire a residential property,
but only by applying to build that property. Moreover, no foreign person can
acquire the right of ownership of land, agricultural or otherwise.
The slow pace of reform is due in part to the considerable influence still
wielded by the former Communist party. As the Bulgarian Socialist party, it
continues to hold more than 30 per cent of the seats in the parliament.
In addition, the Union of Democratic Forces, the loose coalition of parties
now in government, remains divided over the pace of reform.
Despite economic problems, Bulgaria is one of the most stable countries in
the Balkans, and Mr Zhelyu Zhelev, who has been elected as president for a
second term, appears determined to proceed with economic reforms, and to
improve relations with the country's immediate neighbours.

Creation and Small Firms Development.
The conference will look at the political, cultural and practical problems
of establishing an enterprise culture and promoting the growth of small
firms. Among countries expected to attend are Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the three Baltic states.
The International Labour Organisation and the European Bank for

Twenty managers from small and medium-sized businesses in St Petersburg
arrive at Manchester Business School today at the start of a four-week
management development programme. They come from businesses involved in boat

FT  10 FEB 92 / Green light for Dublin commuters: A rail system may soon
relieve traffic congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUBLIN'S long-suffering commuters may soon find relief from the traffic that
chokes the city centre at rush hours. After years of prevarication over
public transport issues, a government green light is expected soon, for the
construction of a IPounds 500m (Pounds 463m) Light Rail Transit (LRT) system
for the city.
Detailed proposals are being drawn up for the project to be presented to the
EC Commission in the submission for the 1994-98 tranche of EC Structural
Funds (ESF) for Ireland.
Ireland is anticipating a doubling of ESF payments to some IPounds 6bn in
the next tranche, and rail systems for Dublin and nationally are top
priorities for funding.
Mr Dick Doyle, an economic adviser to transport minister Seamus Brennan,
said: 'The minister is very strongly behind the (LRT) plan. It has
cross-party support and the Dublin councillors are behind it.'
He said that 50-75 per cent capital funding by the EC would be required, but
that the system would then be able to operate without subsidies.
Major contracts will be up for grabs for engineering works, rolling stock
and even operation of the system itself. At least five different proposals
have been submitted to Mr Brennan for consideration since he first made
public the government's interest last year.
These include proposals from GEC in the UK, Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swedish-Swiss group, Annsaldo in Italy and Aer Rianta in Ireland.
Professor Simon Perry, the Dean of Engineering at Trinity College Dublin,
and the man who co-ordinates the Irish Universities Transport Studies Group
(IUTSG) says that an LRT system is 'ideally suited for Dublin's problems'.
'It is light enough to be laid on top of existing roads, can use existing
rail routes, and is less likely to have its routes blocked by car traffic
than alternatives such as guided buses'.
Route blockage is already a big problem for Dublin's 800 buses in the
narrower of the city's Georgian streets.
Dublin's city centre, is bounded on three sides by two canals that arc
around to join the River Liffey, which flows through the centre.
This boundary, known as the inner cordon, forms a rough circle with a radius
of a mile-and-a-half.
Into this seven square-mile area, containing some 27 bridges, 55,000 cars
stream every day, reducing traffic flows to a crawl during the rush hour.
Serious bottlenecks occur not only at the bridge crossings over the river
and canals, but at most road junctions in and out of the city.
A 10-mile car trip from an outer suburb can take over an hour during peak
traffic flows The Dublin Bus company estimates that, even with the existing
bus lane system, its vehicles are slowed to average speeds of less than 3
miles per hour inside the inner cordon during rush hours. Car ownership in
Ireland is increasing by some 3 per cent a year.
Most of the city's present traffic problems can be traced back to two
transport studies completed more than 20 years ago: one by a Professor Miles
Wright, and the other by the Dublin Corporation.
Both studies envisaged an increasing role for road-based private transport
and planned four 'satellite' towns to the west of Dublin to disperse
housing, factories and offices and ease traffic congestion to the centre.
The centre and these new urban suburbs were to be linked together by a new
100-km network of motorways.
Professor Wright wrote at the time: 'There is every sign that Irishmen, as
sturdy individuals and democrats, will wish to use their cars fully.'
A road-based transportation strategy, relying on the private motor car, thus
became embodied in successive Dublin Corporation transport policies. Public
transport was relegated to a secondary role, the only exception being the
building of a commuter rail line, known as the Dart, which serves the
coastal suburbs north and south of the city.
The problem, however, was that as the new western satellite towns grew up,
jobs did not grow at the same pace, and most of the transport infrastructure
plans remain to be implemented. The result has been that since 1967, the
proportion of people using public transport to enter the city centre has
fallen from 54 per cent in 1967 to only 34 per cent today.
In areas served by the Dart however, commuters still prefer to use public
transport. Indeed it has been the Dart's success, run by Irish Rail, which
has largely led to the government to finally consider an LRT system as a
long-term solution for the capital's traffic problems.
According to Professor Perry, the first phase of a commercial LRT system
could be built relatively cheaply and quickly using old abandoned railway
routes. 'What existed in terms of rail-based corridors are still there,
mostly with the right-of-way intact, and lend themselves ideally for a
modern system' he said. The first phase, linking the major southern suburbs
to the city centre would cost some IPounds 150m, he said.

THOSE looking for a bottle of champagne for their Valentine may be more
flummoxed than usual this year in a climate thick with aspersions cast at
the quality and maturity of what we were brought up to think was the only
socially acceptable mix of wine and carbon dioxide.
The specialist Champagne House of London W2 (071-221-5538) now guarantees
that all of its non-vintage champagne (apart from its 'party champagne') has
been matured for at least three years in the producer's cellar before being
disgorged - a distinct improvement on the imprudently short one-year legal
minimum. Prices start at a relatively modest Pounds 13.90 a bottle, but
since the Champagne House cannot accept orders for fewer than a dozen
bottles, even for Valentine's Day, its new scheme will suit only the
extremely or indiscriminately amorous.
Wilton's in Jermyn Street, London SW1, has always managed to retain a
simple, if expensive, elegance, wonderfully maternal waitresses and a
clientele that includes bankers, businessmen and politicians. This year the
restaurant celebrates its 250th birthday. It began as a shellfishmongery in
Cockspur Street, off the Haymarket, close to a weekly cattle market and a
twice-weekly hay and straw market. Wilton's Anniversary Book (Pounds 9.50
from the restaurant, the Savoy and Berkeley Hotels) recounts its history
including its sale for Pounds 1,200 in 1942 when a bomb landed nearby.
As part of the celebrations throughout 1992 Wilton's, with the advice of
English food expert Arabella Boxer, will be offering a four-course dinner
menu at Pounds 25 per head. 071-629-9955.
One factor which seems to distinguish the English from the rest of Europe is
that we are much less keen to travel any distance for a good meal. It is a
problem that has been exercising Ruth and David Watson since they sold
Hintlesham Hall and took over The Fox and Goose at Fressingfield, near Diss,
Norfolk, (037986-247) in the centre of Suffolk. The food and wine now
available in this country inn is acclaimed - it was voted County restaurant
of the Year in the 1992 Good Food Guide. Commercially, however, the
write-ups have not compensated for the lack of bedrooms and the consequent
dependance on local trade. Now the Watsons have agreed terms with owners of
various bed and breakfasts in the area and can offer package deals that
include dinner and a night's accommodation nearby from Pounds 40 per person.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Cookery: Savouries for sweethearts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEET talk is all very well but even a romantic can have too much of sickly,
sentimental things.
The lead-up to St Valentine's Day, with its surfeit of foodie shop-window
displays, restaurant promotions and magazine cookery features, tends to
leave the punter more sick than lovesick.
By the time February 14 arrives, many of us find it hard to stomach the
thought - let alone the taste - of yet another passion fruit pud,
heart-shaped chocolate confection or anything else drenched in a confetti of
icing sugar.
If you believe that the way to a (wo)man's heart is through the stomach, you
might find that Cupid's arrow flies faster if more macho flavours than sugar
and honey are used. Waving my match-maker's wand, I suggest you try the
vivid tastes of spices, anchovies, kidneys and that unfailing aphrodisiac,
oyster.
Use these ingredients for old-fashioned savouries to round off dinner a
deux. Serve them as light supper snacks for picnics by the fire. Or save
them for midnight feasting.
I await wedding invitations from satisfied readers.
DEVILLED KIDNEYS
This is enough for a small snack.
Skin, halve and core 4 lamb kidneys. Dice  1/2 oz butter into a small,
fire-proof dish and slip the dish under a hot grill. When the butter is
sizzling, add the kidneys and coat them all over with the fat. Grill the
kidneys cut side up for 1-1 1/2 minutes, then cut side down for 1-1 1/2
minutes.
Meanwhile, mash 1 oz softened butter with two teaspoons English mustard
powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcester sauce, and a shake each of cayenne pepper,
anchovy essence and mushroom ketchup to make a sloppy paste.
Turn the kidneys cut side up again. Dot the devilled butter over them and
add any of the devilled juices the butter has failed to absorb. Grill for a
further 1-1 1/2 minutes until bubbling, then serve on thick, hot rounds of
fluted toast.
SCOTCH WOODCOCK
Romantics will abandon the kitchen stove in favour of toasting the bread on
a fork and stirring the sauce in the fringes of a log fire.
Crush the anchovy fillets from a 50g can into a little of their oil. Toast 2
large, half-inch thick slices of bread. Cut into crust-less triangles,
spread with the pounded anchovies and keep hot.
Melt  1/2 oz butter in a small pan. Add 2 egg yolks beaten with 3
tablespoons thick cream, some black pepper and a little salt. Stir over a
very low flame until the mixture begins to thicken. Do not boil or the eggs
will scramble. Pour the thick, creamy sauce over the toast, dust with a
shake each of paprika and cayenne, and tuck in.
SPICED CHICKEN WINGS
Here is bone-picking, finger-licking food for Tom Jones fantasists.
Mix together 2 heaped tablespoons each black peppercorns, cumin and
coriander seeds. Reduce to a coarse (not fine) powder. Work in 1 1/2 -2
teaspoons chilli powder (or more for sting), some garlic cloves crushed with
salt, and 2 tablespoons or so of sesame oil to make a creamy paste.
Prick 4-6 meaty chicken wings all over with a fork. Coat them carefully with
the paste, then cover and leave them in a cool place for several hours to
absorb the flavours.
Cook on a grid close to the flame of a hot grill until the chicken skin
begins to crisp. Then, grill more gently and further away from the flame for
about 15 minutes until well cooked, turning the pieces at least once during
this time. Whizz the heat right up at the end to burnish and frazzle the
skin deliciously.
OYSTER GRATIN
Six or nine oysters per person may be enough for an appetiser, but one dozen
are better for a fireside supper dish. This way of cooking the molluscs
makes a lovely alternative to serving them raw.
Make a creamy and delicate sauce with  1/2 oz butter, 2 tablespoons flour,
3/4 pt milk,  1/4 pt thick cream, a bay leaf and a slice each of onion and
carrot. (I tie the flavourings in butter muslin and cook them in the sauce -
it saves scalding the milk and infusing it with the flavourings first.)
Simmer the sauce gently without a lid, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes
or so until rich. Remove the bag of flavourings and stir in 3/4 -1 oz each
freshly-grated Parmesan and Gruyere. Add the liquor drained from two dozen
oysters and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
Lay the oysters in their deep-curved shells in a shallow, heat-proof dish
containing a bed of sea salt to hold the molluscs steady. Spoon a little of
the hot sauce over each oyster (the sauce can be prepared ahead and
re-heated just before using) and slide the dish under the grill for 3-5
minutes until the oysters are firm, plump and hot and the sauce is glazed
lightly. A loaf of bread, a flask of wine and thou are the only
accompaniments needed.
BONE MARROW ON TOAST
Leg and shin of beef stews are back in fashion now. So, savouries made with
the fatty, rich marrow that lies in the bones surely will be next.
In The Cook's Encyclopaedia, Tom Stobart suggested an admirable short-cut to
traditional methods. He recommends extracting the marrow from the bones
before poaching, which cuts cooking time dramatically.
Use a Victorian silver marrow scoop or wield a skewer carefully to take the
marrow out of bones cut into short lengths. Poach it for just a minute or so
in salted water or stock. Drain thoroughly and lay it on fluted rounds of
hot toast. Season with plenty of lemon juice, salt, pepper and chopped
parsley.
Stobart used also to rub his toast with a cut garlic clove for extra
flavour. Others finish the dish with a shake of cayenne or Tabasco. I like a
pinch of very finely-grated lemon zest.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance And The Family (London Markets): January's revival
stutters to a halt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JANUARY rally ended with the month. Since then, the stock market has
been jumpy, with little buying or selling by investment institutions or the
public. The FTSE index ended the first week in February at 2,517.2, down
54.0.
There was another way in which the week marked a change of mood. As the
chart shows, January was a month in which shares of companies in cyclical
industries - GKN in car components, for example, Tarmac in building
materials and British Steel in metals - outperformed the market as a whole.
During 1991, these sectors lagged far behind the market as a whole where the
good news came from 'defensive' stocks - especially the health and household
sector of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index dominated by the big
international pharmaceutical companies like Glaxo.
In January, when the cyclicals were outperforming, Glaxo was unchanged
relative to the index as a whole - scarcely a sign of poor performance but a
signal that defensive stocks were, perhaps, about to give up the market
leadership. This week, cyclical and defensive stocks suffered together.
Tarmac, for instance, closed at 118p, down 3p; GKN at 315p, down 5p; and
British Steel at 74p, down 4p. Glaxo also did badly, ending the week at
816p, down 29p.
There is logic behind the cyclicals' stalled recovery, summed-up by
Kleinwort Benson's recommendation to avoid all but the strongest shares in
this category, at least until the results' season in March and April gives a
clearer picture of their financial strength and trading experience.
The imminent results of such blue-chip companies as BP, Hanson and the UK
clearing banks are certainly not helping the market's jitters. BP shares
closed the week at 275p, down 12p, after chairman Robert Horton called
publicly for an OPEC production cut to raise oil prices. The market also was
swept by apparently unfounded rumours of dissension on the board about
dividend policy. BP's results are due next Thursday.
Hanson is expected to report its first-ever quarterly decline in profits
next week; and the first of the clearers, Lloyds, will report a week next
Friday.
One important influence on the UK recovery, the interest-rate war between
the US and Germany, took a turn for the worse during the week. In Germany,
Monday saw a 6.4 per cent wage settlement for the steel workers' union,
probably too high to give the president of the Bundesbank, Helmut
Schlesinger, any incentive for a speedy cut in interest rates.
He went on to underline the need for monetary stringency in a newspaper
interview on Thursday. The next day, the US payroll numbers came in much
worse than Wall Street economists had expected, raising hopes of even lower
interest rates there.
The pound rose against the dollar sharply on Friday, establishing itself
above Dollars 1.83. That is not good news for companies exporting to the US
(although it is better tidings for the substantial band of companies with
big US operations). Against the D-mark, sterling weakened slightly but is
still above its floor.
Hopes that the UK might be able to manage a unilateral interest rate cut
before the general election seemed to have weakened: short-term money market
rates were indicating no expectations of a change in base rates in the near
future.
The car industry this week was the recipient of ambiguous news. On the one
hand, it was spared any wholesale change in its distribution arrangements by
the Monopolies Commission, which recommended a very restrained set of
changes despite evidence that UK customers were paying too much for new
cars. On the other hand, the car sales figures for January, published on
Thursday, were the lowest for that month since 1982 and 30 per cent below
those in in January 1989.
Still, the monthly year-on-year fall was the smallest since March 1990,
perhaps a sign that the slide in sales is at last slowing. Not fast enough
for Ford, though: on Friday, the company announced that 2,100 jobs would go
at its UK plant. It was just one of a series of announcements of
redundancies by big companies during the week.
While Ford was making headlines by shedding thousands of people, Granada
group was in the news for sacking one: David Plowright, the head of its
television subsidiary, who departed amid an unusually intense flurry of
petition-signing.
The share price suffered to start with but closed at 220p, down only 4p on
the week. Any share price weakness might also have reflected, of course, on
the way Granada was listed by UBS Phillips and Drew's quantitative research
team as one of seven stocks to sell.
Its recommendations, which reflected in part a shift to a belief in
continued recession in 1992, singled-out three sectors - health and
households, hotels and leisure, and telephone networks - as sells, and three
as buys: chemicals, other industrial materials, and motors.
On the face of it, these chosen sectors look suspiciously like the cyclicals
that should do well when recovery comes. So why pick them when you expect
continued recession?
The UBS team argues that the continued economic sluggishness will affect
domestic consumer and service stocks worse but that
internationally-orientated manufacturers, which have cut costs hardest, will
do well, especially if a new Labour government tilts the tax and regulatory
balance in their favour.
If that is right, the UK is about to enter a period when making things is
more profitable than moving paper, something that has not happened on a
sustained basis since the early 1960s. Let us hope it happens in the 1990s:
without such a shift, it is hard to see the UK surviving inside the ERM.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Apple Computer explores
strategic link with Sharp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE COMPUTER is in talks with Sharp, the Japanese electronics manufacture,
in connection with its recently announced plans to enter the consumer
electronics market with a range of 'personal digital assistant' products,
including electronic organisers.
Sharp is a leading supplier of hand-held electronic organisers, devices that
store phone numbers, an appointments diary and personal notes.
Apple will say only that Sharp is one of several consumer electronics
companies with which the personal computer manufacturer is exploring
potential relationships. According to reports in the US, however, the
companies are on the verge of concluding a broad strategic alliance.
The talks between Apple and Sharp coincide with Sharp's manufacturing
agreement with Intel, the leading US semiconductor company, covering the
manufacture of memory chips by Sharp for sale by both Intel and Sharp. Sharp
may also manufacture products on behalf of Apple Computer, industry analysts
predict.
According to US reports, Sharp will manufacture a personal organiser product
designed by Apple. The relationship would be similar to that between Apple
and Sony in which the Japanese company manufactures Apple's low-end notebook
computer.

FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Independent Inv Co net assets grow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the six months ended December 31 1991, net asset value at The
Independent Investment Company rose 5 per cent to 57.7p, and in January
moved up a further 11 per cent to 64.1p.
A significant factor in the January rise was the near-doubling in the share
price of the US company Read-Rite, which is now Independent's largest
holding.
It became so as a result of its public offering and subsequent share price
performance. It meant that Independent's unlisted investments at December 31
represented 51 per cent of total assets, against 64 per cent at end-June.
In the interim period total revenue was again Pounds 1.5m, but heavier
interest charges and expenses cut earnings per share to 0.4p (0.59p).

FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Fleming American asset value up 32%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 32 per cent increase to 209.3p in net asset value per share was achieved
by Fleming American Investment Trust in 1991.
Mr Iain Saunders, chairman, said that, for investors in the US market, the
year was one of the most rewarding of the last decade.
The trust benefited from good selection and its exposure to small companies.
However, gross revenue fell from Pounds 4.62m to Pounds 3.87m and earnings
per share from 2.06p to 1.26p.
The final dividend is cut from 1.25p to 0.75p for a total of 1.25p (1.75p).
The chairman explained that the reduction was a consequence of the trust
being fully invested throughout the year and was consistent with its
declared focus on overall return, which meant the dividend fluctuated from
year to year.

<TEXT>
Over the 1991 year, net asset value of Scottish American Investment
increased by 16.4 per cent, from 113.1p to 131.7p.
The trust's principal markets had shown good increases, said Mr Jack Shaw,
chairman, and the company benefited from being fully invested in the first
half and taking a more cautious view in the second.
'The cautious disposition of the portfolio at the end of the year reflects
our belief that the next few months will be difficult for equity markets,'
the chairman stated.
In the year total revenue was little changed at Pounds 18.4m and earnings
per share were 4.34p (4.42p). The final dividend is 1.06p for a total of
4.12p (3.8p), and indicates at least 4.24p for the current year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wiggins Group, the property developer and housebuilder, reported increased
losses in the six months to September 30, though the increase was steepened
by a Pounds 752,000 exceptional loss relating to provisions against the
group's development sites.
Pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 1.76m, against Pounds 889,000 in the
corresponding period and Pounds 2.54m in the year to March 31.
Turnover declined to Pounds 5.22m (Pounds 6.92m) and, despite lower
administrative expenses of Pounds 326,000 (Pounds 531,000), operating losses
were Pounds 239,000 (profits Pounds 102,000). After the exceptional,
operating losses on discontinued activities came to Pounds 1.04m, while
continuing businesses were in the black with Pounds 51,000.
Mr Stephen Hayklan, chairman, blamed high debt servicing and closure costs
for the losses. He said that there were signs of improvement in the demand
for new houses in the east Midlands, though the south-west operations had
been discontinued. Demand for industrial buildings had not improved.
An extraordinary general meeting has been called for February 26, to address
the fact that, with the continued losses, the group's net assets had been
reduced to less than half of its capital.
Losses per share emerged at 11.1p (5.6p).

The trust, which invests principally in smaller UK companies, last year

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WINDSOR, the insurance and reinsurance broking group, finished the year
ended September 30 1991 with an attributable loss of Pounds 2.29m, which was
largely the result of a number of one-off problems now resolved by the new
management.
Mr Stanley Cohen, chairman, said the company had written off Pounds 2.4m in
exceptional and extraordinary costs involving legal, reorganisation and
property matters. The latter involved a Pounds 1m write-down on the value of
the Hemel Hempstead freehold premises.
He believed the greater part of the historical problems had been addressed
and the company was now trading on budget for the current year. The strategy
had been to return to the core business of general commercial and
reinsurance broking where it had considerable strength.
Turnover in the year came to Pounds 7m (Pounds 8.13m) and there was an
operating profit of Pounds 369,000 (Pounds 482,000). After interest and
exceptionals the pre-tax loss was Pounds 1.2m (profit Pounds 242,000).

FT  08 FEB 92 / The tourist in her own country: As the Queen enters the
fifth decade of her reign, the monarchy faces challenges greater than ever
before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CANNADINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS KING Lear discovered unhappily, longevity does not necessarily make a
sovereign popular or serene. Indeed, if Queen Elizabeth II contemplates the
history of her forebears on the British throne, she must see that the record
during the past 200 years or so has been decidedly mixed.
Although she is well-loved by her subjects, it does not follow automatically
that the monarchy's reputation is high and unquestioned. Certainly, age by
itself will not assure her of greater dignity and public respect: as old
men, George IV and William IV were neither loved nor admired, while Edward
VIII threw it all away when he married Mrs Simpson.
Yet, the reasons why some monarchs have become venerated patriarchs (or
matriarchs) while others have not are complex and often obscure. George
III's reputation improved immeasurably the older (and madder) he became. At
the end of her reign, Victoria was even more selfish, obstinate and bigoted
than she had been at the start; but none of this mattered to her subjects,
who worshipped her as an imperial icon. Edward VII was scarcely a more
admirable individual than George IV, but the public perception of him was
very different. And while George V became a lovable king, he was never a
particularly lovable man.
So, at one level, royal reputation turns out to be like any other: what
Shakespeare once described as 'an idle and most false disposition, oft got
without merit and lost without deserving.' But it is fashioned also by
broader forces over which the monarchs themselves have had little control
and often have not even understood. In every reign, and in every generation,
the British have projected on to the person of their sovereign their own
collective hopes, anxieties and expectations. In so doing, they have created
and re-created their monarchy in their own self-image.
How far should the Queen be comforted or worried by this as she enters the
fifth decade of her reign? Compared with George IV or William IV she has
enjoyed a relatively good press. Compared with George V and George VI, she
has done rather less well. And compared with George III and Victoria, she
did much better at the beginning of her reign but seems less likely to enjoy
the sunset apotheosis and uncritical veneration of their later years.
Why so? As in previous ages, the answer lies in a combination of individual
royal personality and the broader tissue of national circumstances. In a
society where old age is more a commonplace problem than an unusual sign of
admirable endurance, it no longer guarantees certain celebrity in the way it
once did - witness the almost Pythonesque demise of the Kremlin old guard.
To make matters worse for the present Queen, the slot of apotheosised
matriarch is not yet even available to her. Indeed, if the Queen Mother
outlives her own century, as she seems to have every intention (and
capability) of doing, that slot is not going to become available for many
years.
As to her own personality, we know little more about it now than we did at
the beginning of her reign, despite the BBC's televised attempt on Thursday
to make her more accessible. Like her father, she is reputedly pleasant,
decent, dutiful, conscientious and high-minded. But, like him again, she is
also limited in her education and her social vision, seems lacking
conspicuously in imagination and flair, and is conservative enough to regard
most change as change for the worse. Whether these are the ideal attributes
and attitudes for a head of state in the late-20th century is, perhaps, open
to question.
And then there is her family. As the Queen surveys the tribe of which she is
the hereditary chief, she must often shudder, and it is difficult not to
feel some sympathy. When she acceded to the throne, the royal family
consisted effectively of five people: the Queen herself, her husband, her
sister, her mother and her grandmother (Queen Mary). But during the past 40
years it has developed into an over-extended, multi-generational dynasty,
devoid of any central direction, purpose or justification.
For most contemporary commentators, whose analysis is scarcely more profound
than that of the gossip columnist or the 'investigative journalist,' this is
enough to explain the unhappy state and uncertain prospects of the monarchy
today. But while individual character, the reaction between the generations,
and the creative image of the royal family undoubtedly are important, they
are only part - and perhaps the lesser part - of the whole picture. Now, as
in the past, the monarchy must be viewed in the broader context of national
development and the popular collective mood.
At the time of her Silver Jubilee in 1977, Elizabeth II was anxious to
stress that she had been crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland: that she was, like her forebears, a symbol of
British national identity. But in the course of her reign, that sense of
national identity has much weakened. Scotland wants devolution, Northern
Ireland will surely rejoin the south before the next century is many years
old, and England itself is now a multi-racial society. Where exactly does
that leave the monarchy as the traditional embodiment of Britishness?
A closely-connected subject, which also has important implications for the
monarchy's future, is the fast-changing relations with Europe. It is not
just that the Queen's head might disappear from UK bank-notes, coins, even
postage stamps - it also is difficult to envisage a serious role for
Britain's royal house in any tighter form of continental federation. What
would the British monarchy do then?
In previous times, it could have turned to the Empire or the Commonwealth to
keep it busy. But the independence of the former colonies, and the changing
identities of the old dominions, mean that the Commonwealth is no longer the
royalist, Anglophile community it was at the Queen's accession. Yet, it is
only as the sovereign of her remaining overseas possessions, and as head of
the Commonwealth, that she can lay claim to a genuinely global role. She
herself believes passionately in it - but few others do. It will not last.
Shorn of its international trappings, how would - or will - the monarchy
adjust?
As the British nation itself is re-defined; as Britain's relations with
Europe are re-ordered; as the once-British Commonwealth evolves and
disperses; and as Britain gradually - and painfully - adjusts to the fact
that it is no longer a world power, this is bound to require a fundamental
re-thinking of the monarchy's purpose and functions. The old way of doing
things - ceremonial grandeur, tax exemptions, overseas tours, gracious
smiles - which may have been right at the outset of the Queen's reign, no
longer seem acceptable or appropriate. What is to be put in its place?
This has been made all the more urgent because of the impact of Thatcherism
on popular perceptions of the monarchy. As a symbol of national identity,
Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, upstaged the Queen easily.
Norman Tebbitt, perhaps Thatcher's closest lieutenant, denounced the Prince
of Wales and many Thatcherites regarded the monarchy as just another vested
interest, an unacceptable amalgam of snobbery and frivolity. While the
welfare state consensus prevailed, the monarchy's position as benevolent
referee seemed clear and secure. But now the goal-posts have been shifted,
its position seems decidedly shaken.
There is little evidence that the Queen, or her relatives and advisers, have
recognised the full implications of these developments so far as the
monarchy is concerned. And it is here that we must return to personalities
again. Clearly, there is need for a serious re-evaluation of the monarchy in
the next few decades. Whether the present queen - 40 years in the job and,
thus, hardly likely to change her approach to it - is the person to
undertake such a re-appraisal is not clear. Nor can we know whether Prince
Charles, her heir, would - or will - do any better.
Whoever is responsible, part of the process of the readjustment ought to
involve the dismantling of the old, out-of-date imperial monarchy that
flourished from the time of Victoria's Golden Jubilee until the present
Queen's accession. The tax exemptions, the ceremonial grandeur, the
Commonwealth tours, the endless public appearances, the whole sycophantic
mythology of imperial ornamentality - all this needs to be scaled down or
swept away, and the monarchy brought into line more appropriately with the
diminished nation over which it now reigns.
Described like this, the royal future might seem rather unappealing: a moped
monarchy which is little more than an hereditary, non-elective presidency.
But while the monarchy would be well advised to abandon its recent imperial
past, its lengthy history affords other more positive and encouraging
precedents. It does not have to be like it is: passive, philistine,
bewildered, anachronistic, obsessed with protocol and tradition, and
smothered in a courtly embrace redolent of quarter-deck attitudes and
saddle-soap.
Previous monarchs have been lively, energetic, cultured, even intellectual:
what a refreshing change it would be for that to happen again. Previous
monarchs did much more than make an occasional visit to a concert or the
opera and were involved, actively and creatively, in the promotion and
patronage of the arts: that, too, would be a welcome development. The
present Queen might follow the example of George I and use a small part of
her enormous fortune to found some new university professorships. She might
even set up a Windsor foundation and establish herself as a leader in
creative philanthropy.
The real problem with the British monarchy today is that it is not seen to
be an active, serious or significant part of the life of the British nation.
Doing her boxes, going on stage-managed visits, making speeches she has not
written, meeting people only in wholly-contrived social situations - none of
this brings the Queen into authentic contact with her subjects. Like all
members of the royal family, only more so, she is little more than a tourist
in her own country. If the British monarchy is to have a future, she should
think about taking up residence for real.
These individual suggestions can take us only so far. It is not just that
the British monarchy has lost its way - it is also that the British people
no longer have any real collective sense of what they want their monarchy
for. Just as most societies get the gods they deserve, so most monarchies
get the sovereign they deserve. One reason why the British are so uncertain
with their monarchy is that they are so uncertain about themselves. For both
the Queen and her subjects, there are challenging times ahead.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Two in court over Ashdown papers: Man charged with burglary
is a paid-up member of the Conservative party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY, RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN charged with the break-in at the office of the solicitors of Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, was a paid-up member of his
local Conservative association, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Simon Leo Berkowitz, 45, a painter from Hove, East Sussex, appeared at
City of London magistrates court charged with burglary and handling stolen
documents. His former wife, Ms Maria Watson, 41, unemployed from Brighton,
also appeared charged with handling stolen documents. They were released on
conditional bail and will appear in court again on March 6.
Hove and Portslade Conservative Association said Mr Berkowitz had been a
fully paid-up member for several years. But Councillor Edward
Cruickshank-Robb, chairman of the association, said Mr Berkowitz had a low
profile and was not known to the officers.
'He has not played any active role in the association either at ward, branch
or constituency level, and, to the best of our knowledge, no part in local
government or general elections,' Mr Cruickshank-Robb said.
Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman, said he did not regard the
disclosure of Mr Berkowitz's membership as 'any great embarrassment' for the
party.
However, Mr Don Turner, Labour's candidate for Hove, said: 'I am surprised
at the denial that he was politically active in the area. This contradicts
what we know of his activities in Hove and Brighton.'
Speaking outside the court yesterday, Mr Martin Lowe, Mr Berkowitz's
solicitor said his client would plead not guilty to both charges, although
he admitted having had a document referring to Mr Ashdown.
'He has explained to the police in answer to their questions the
circumstances in which he had it and what he did with it,' Mr Lowe said.
Mr Berkowitz said in an interview on Independent Television News last night
that he was 'totally innocent'.
On Wednesday, Mr Ashdown publicly admitted to a brief affair with a former
secretary five years ago, after a document detailing the relationship was
stolen from the solicitors' offices and offered for sale to a national
newspaper.
Fears of a possible 'dirty tricks' campaign aimed at politicians were
fuelled by a second burglary at the London offices of Mr Ashdown's
solicitors, Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite, yesterday morning.
City of London police said they were investigating the incident but did not
know what had been stolen.
Since Mr Ashdown confessed his affair, it has become known that his
solicitors' offices also house confidential papers relating to other MPs.
The latest theft increased tensions at Westminster, where constant
revelations about burglaries at MPs' offices so close to the general
election have provoked accusations of 'dirty tricks'.
Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery, reacted angrily to a
report that Conservative Central Office sought information last May from a
credit agency on a Welsh Liberal Democrat activist, Mr Mike German.
Conservative Central Office denied the report, but said an application for a
pass to a Conservative conference from Miss Laura German of the same address
had been vetted. It was standard practice to use agencies to verify
credentials.
Mr Ashdown was given a standing ovation as he arrived at the annual general
meeting of his constituency party in Yeovil, Somerset, last night.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Prospects improve for Lloyd's Names deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for a negotiated end to legal action involving more than 2,000
Names - the individuals whose capital backs underwriting at the Lloyd's
insurance market - brightened yesterday.
After a lawsuit lasting more than 3 1/2 years, about 500 Names reached an
out-of-court settlement with the CJ Warrilow agency and more than 20 other
agents.
The settlement has increased the possibility that separate negotiations,
understood to be under way in a case being brought by nearly 1,000 Names
against RHM Outhwaite and more than 80 other agents, could also be
successful.
Names are alleging that negligence by their agents and, in one case, by the
Lloyd's Corporation, the body which provides regulatory and market back-up
services, was responsible for their insurance losses in these two and four
other cases.
Outhwaite Names have lost more than Pounds 200m as a result of claims
arising from US legal awards to victims of asbestosis.
Last Monday, hearings in the Outhwaite case, which began in October, were
suspended for a week for 'administrative reasons'. The talks were reported
to have taken place between the Names and their agents.
'There is no doubt in my mind that they have stood down to allow the parties
to settle,' said one solicitor.
The enormous complexity of these cases, and the cost and time involved, has
made them unwieldy, said another solicitor. 'My feeling is that these cases
are just untriable,' he added.
In the Warrilow case, errors and omissions insurers, who cover agents
against legal awards for negligence, agreed to pay Names Pounds 4m,
including Pounds 1.5m already paid in legal costs.
The Warrilow syndicate ran up losses of more than Pounds 60m in 1984.
However, Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Warrilow Names' association, said
the most Names could hope to win in the legal case was Pounds 8.5m. 'It is
not all we wanted but we have to be pragmatic,' he added.
Mr Benyon said Lloyd's played a part in 'creating the atmosphere to make the
settlement possible'.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Delors prays Britain will join the flock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MAASTRICHT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'ONE CAN always hope for a miracle,' said Mr Jacques Delors, minutes before
the signing of the Maastricht treaty on European union.
Putting his hands together and looking heavenward, the European Commission
president was referring to the infinitesimal chance that Britain might
undergo a last-minute change of heart and mind, and join its 11 partners on
social policy - the one real bone of contention at the December summit.
Maastricht is not Damascus, however, and there was no sudden Pauline
conversion on the part of Britain's two signatories - Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, and Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the
Treasury.
They and ministers from the other 11 countries quietly signed the political
and monetary union treaty - complete with its protocol allowing 11 countries
to pursue their social policy ambitions without the UK - virtually as they
had argued it out in the same hall of Maastricht's Provinciehuis on December
9-11.
Two by two, as though entering the Ark of European Union, national pairs of
ministers advanced to two books on a table in the centre of the room,
accompanied by the strains of a string quartet.
Ministers from Belgium's caretaker government came first. Further down the
line of signatories came Germany's finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, in such
a rumpled suit that it looked like physical evidence of the political
drubbing which the Bundesbank is giving monetary union.
When, at 6.08 pm local time, Messrs Hurd and Maude became the last to put
their mark on the treaty books, Maastricht was formally signed to be
presented later this year for ratification by the Twelve's parliaments. To
his own mild embarrassment, Mr Hurd confessed to not knowing precisely what
was in the two books he had signed. In fact, the fat book contained the
actual treaty and the thin one associated protocols and annexes.
But the UK foreign secretary was clear that, in spite of its provisions for
a common currency, foreign and defence policies, 'Maastricht is not a stage
towards a centralised Europe'. The logic of the Community soon having to
take in more members ran against this, and towards a more de-centralised EC
system, he said.
This was not the impression given by others. Prime Minister Antonio Cavaco
Silva of Portugal, which is the current EC president, and Dutch Prime
Minister Ruud Lubbers, who chaired the Maastricht summit, spoke of
unfinished integration business that needed to be completed at the next
inter-governmental conference, set for 1996. Mr Egon Klepsch, the EC
Parliament president, said: 'Maastricht keeps the ball rolling and
strengthens the impetus behind integration . . . but must be followed by
further stages.'
So, with the ink still moist on the treaty, were the post-Maastricht battle
lines set out.

refuses to act

Wall Street
GLOOM returned to the equity market yesterday after the Federal Reserve
signalled that it had not changed monetary policy in spite of an unexpected
decline in employment in January, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The market had expected the January employment report to show an increase of
about 30,000 in non-farm payrolls. Instead, the figure tumbled by 91,000.
The decline sparked renewed speculation that the Fed would try to stimulate
the economy by cutting its target for Fed Funds.
Although it is still widely believed that there will be further monetary
easing in the coming weeks, the Fed indicated yesterday morning that it had
not changed its 4 per cent target for Fed Funds.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced off its low of 3,209.08 to close at
3,225.40, down 30.19 on the day, but little changed on the week.
The index initially rose some 14 points yesterday before the Fed's
intervention. Declines led advances by 970 to 698. Turnover was moderate at
about 231m shares. The more representative Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.73
lower at 411.09 and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.72 to 634.95. The Dow eased
2.01 to 3,255.59 on Thursday.
The bond market was similarly affected yesterday. The treasury's benchmark
30-year bond, which rallied nearly one point on the back of the employment
numbers, was quoted  1/32 lower at 102 5/8 , yielding 7.77 per cent in the
afternoon.
Among declining blue chip issues, Philip Morris lost Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 75 3/4 , IBM fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 89 1/8 and Merck slid
Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 153 1/2 . Lockheed added Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars
43 7/8 after the company said that it was comfortable with earnings
estimates of between Dollars 5.30 and Dollars 5.80 a share for 1992.
The bank stock rally ran out of steam yesterday. Citicorp eased Dollars  3/8
to Dollars 16 1/2 but Chemical Bank, which fell in early trading, firmed
Dollars  1/8 in the afternoon to Dollars 30 3/4 .
Relief that Owens Corning had taken a smaller-than expected charge to cover
asbestos-related claims helped shares in the fibrous glass products
manufacturer add Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 after jumping Dollars 7 5/8 on
Wednesday.
In the secondary market, Immunex tumbled Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 59 1/4 on
news that the biotech company will raise its research spending by 50 per
cent.
Immunex posted fourth quarter earnings of 21 cents a share yesterday, as
compared with a loss of 63 cents a year earlier.
Canada
Stocks ended the week steady, after losing ground in the wake of a downturn
on Wall Street.
The composite index fell 10.37 points to end the week up less than one point
at 3,596.33. Declining issues topped advances 302 to 297.
Volume was 29.364 shares, as compared with 30.364 shares on Thursday, and
trading value was CDollars 307.1m, as against CDollars 323.7m.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Japanese brokers downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investor Service yesterday downgraded the long-term debt rating of
Japan's four biggest securities houses, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi in
response to what it sees as rising pressure on the profits of the four
companies, writes Steven Butler.
The downgrading reflects the US ratings agency's view that the operating
environment for the securities industry will become more difficult as
regulatory change gathers pace. Moody's said the financial scandals of last
year were likely to accelerate the pace of financial deregulation, which
could increase competition and reduce profits.
In the case of Nomura, Moody's noted, it could be called upon to assist
affiliates in the brokerage, venture capital and property business. Daiwa,
it said, would have difficulty reducing the recent increase in its fixed
cost base in spite of the troubles of the industry.
Nikko and Yamaichi faced similar difficulties.

CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving and construction
equipment, announced it would end its lock-out of 5,600 workers in an
attempt to resolve its labour dispute with the United Auto Workers, writes
Barbara Durr.
The company asked the union to return to the bargaining table during the
week of February 17. Formal talks broke off over three months ago. The
lock-out occurred on November 7 in retaliation for a partial strike
involving 2,400 UAW members that began on November 3.
Caterpillar said it will put 'important modifications' to its contract
proposal on the table. The UAW has demanded Caterpillar match its recent
contract deal with Deere &amp; Co, heavy equipment maker.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Eurocom to raise FFr660m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROCOM, the French advertising agency which last summer became a leading
player in European marketing services by buying RSCG, one of its chief
competitors, has launched a FFr660m (Dollars 122m) convertible bond issue to
finance the acquisition.
The merger between Eurocom, which is controlled by Havas, the powerful
French media group, and RSCG has been clouded by controversy. The two
agencies, now called EURO RSCG, have for years fought fiercely in the French
advertising market. Their merger was followed by a stream of senior staff
departures and account losses.
For Eurocom, the acquisition of RSCG - which is best known in France for the
involvement of Mr Jacques Seguela, one of its founders, in President
Francois Mitterand's publicity campaigns - is part of its international
expansion.
This reflects the trend for the large French agencies, including Publicis
and Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit, as well as Eurocom, to expand their interests
outside France in the face of intense competition from the powerful US, UK
and Japanese marketing services groups.
Eurocom's largest shareholders, Havas and Parthena Investissement, part of
the Suez industrial and financial group, have agreed to participate in the
refinancing, as has Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-owned bank which is
one of the biggest investors in RSCG.
Eurocom, which has long dominated the French marketing scene, expects to
have made net profits of FFr182m in 1991, a slight decrease of 5.7 per cent
on the previous year. Eurocom said the fall in profits was due to the
slowdown at Aegis, the London-based European media buying group in which it
is an investor.
RSCG, which has been burdened by the debt incurred in its acquisitions
during the 1980s, made an estimated net loss of FFr56m before provisions and
extraordinary items last year and an overall loss of around FFr280m.

A rare presentation by Great Universal Stores, the mail order, finance and
property group, to 60 institutional shareholders descended into acrimonious
heckling as investors expressed dissatisfaction with the directors' lack of
candour.
The meeting was intended to be a bridge-building question-and-answer session
but quickly became tense after some shareholders failed to receive
satisfactory answers to their inquiries. However, some observers defended
GUS and said several of the questions had been 'pretty stupid'.
Said one institutional investor who attended the meeting: 'There is a
wonderful arrogance about GUS. They do not see why they have to tell anyone
a damn thing,'
GUS has never previously gone out of its way to woo City opinion and its
decision to host a meeting was welcomed by many of the big institutions.
The company's A shares seemed little affected by the rumpus and closed 9p
lower at 1421p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WOMAN who said she produced the original stake money used by Mr John
Michael Clegg to buy into the Wace Group said yesterday that it came from a
family inheritance.
Mr Clegg abruptly resigned last week as chief executive of Wace after market
speculation had linked the company to the Irish Republican Army.
The Wace Group is conducting a 'wide ranging inquiry' into all aspects of
the company. Mr Clegg denied the allegations but told Wace's board he was
leaving because of possible speculation about his family which might
embarrass the company. No evidence of links with the IRA has been found by
the security forces.
Wace, the company he built into the world's largest pre-press printing
specialist, has launched a wide ranging investigation covering the eight
years since he bought into the group using funds supplied by his cousin, Mrs
Jayne Riley.
Mrs Riley, formerly Miss Jayne Wright, was last night traced by the
Financial Times to a suburb of Durban, South Africa, where she lives with
her husband, Mr Keith Riley.
Mrs Riley confirmed she was Mr Clegg's cousin and that she had given him
about Pounds 700,000 to invest in her name.
Asked whether Mrs Riley would be prepared to put her account of events to
the Wace board, her husband replied: 'Of course she would. Why wouldn't she?
She has got nothing to hide.' She had not been in touch with Mr Clegg since
he resigned.

the award-winning current affairs programme as well as a raft of regional
programmes.
The rash of unusual credits marked a small insurrection by programme-makers.
It was a signal of their extreme displeasure that the Granada Group, the TV
company's parent company, had just announced the forced departure of Mr
Plowright, executive chairman of Granada TV, one of the most respected
exponents of a public service concept of UK commercial television that had
produced triumphs such as Brideshead Revisited.
Mr Plowright's departure is a powerful symbol of the current turmoil within
the independent television system as it struggles with the aftermath of
competitive tenders for new franchises, recession, and government policies
for a more open network structure.
The dismissal, less than four months after Mr Plowright successfully led the
team that won Granada a new 10-year franchise with a remarkably low bid of
Pounds 9m a year, has become the focus of opposing views about the future of
UK commercial television.
To programme-makers it is a row about quality broadcasting being forced to
surrender to the desire for profit. The opposing view, endorsed within
Granada's management, is a need to limit the power of barons within the
independent television system and to emphasise the need for greater
financial accountability.
The situation is less black and white than either view would suggest. Mr
Plowright's departure is more likely to have reflected a mixture of
personality clashes, financial strains within the Granada Group and clashes
about how much programmes should cost.
For viewers, the picture for ITV appears to be entirely rosy with the BBC
being trounced in the ratings.
Below the surface, however, recession has clearly hit an industry that was
supposed to be almost recession proof. ITV revenues grew from Pounds 1.326bn
in 1987 to Pounds 1.614bn in 1989, were static in 1990 and fell last year to
Pounds 1.587bn. This year, most analysts forecast a 2-3 per cent,
inflation-adjusted increase in revenues.
In addition the ITV system is still trying to come to terms with the effects
of the 1990 Broadcasting Act with its competitive tenders for new
franchises, insistence on a new network structure and a minimum quota of 25
per cent for independent producers.
'This legislation has fouled every bit of ground. All the things we said
would fall out as a result are starting to happen,' said Mr David Shaw,
director of the ITV Association, the industry trade body.
The most pressing task is the problem of creating a network structure
acceptable to the ITV companies and to independent producers, the
Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body for UK commercial
television, and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).
At the moment the commissioning of new programmes for 1993, when the new
franchises begin, has ceased. ITV had hoped to commission the first nine
months of next year under the old network rules.
'The machine of ITV production is in pieces on the ground,' says Mr Charles
Denton, chairman of Pact, the independent producers organisation, many of
whose members are starting to suffer because of the lack of programme
commissioning.
Once that problem is resolved the OFT has to agree permanent arrangements
for the network. A network director, who will be in charge of commissioning
programmes, still has to be appointed.
The signs are that the OFT will be offered a scheme in which independent
producers will have the right to take their ideas to the network director
but will be paired with sponsoring ITV companies when the programmes are
actually being made. It is not clear whether the OFT will accept this
relationship. Mr Denton insists he will be pushing for a fair, open market
in programme production.
Such a market in turn will create huge uncertainties and pressures for the
traditional ITV companies with their studios and standing armies (although
these have been reduced over recent years). If the in-house teams lose out
to independents, further big job losses would be inevitable.
The changes add up to a big restructuring of the system of programme-making
within ITV. The process will not be helped by the wide disparity of
successful franchise bids. There are fears that costly programme ideas will
be torpedoed because high bidders such as Yorkshire Television, which paid
Pounds 37.7m for its franchise (compared with Central which bid Pounds
2,000), will not be able to pay their share.
For Granada TV the new financial realities are about to become only too
clear. Sixty staff are expected to be made redundant in the near future.
As for Mr Plowright he made it clear that despite 'having had the pleasure
of reading my own obituary, I do not yet feel dead'. He added that he would
continue to take part in the debate about the future of British broadcasting
'in the aftermath of a flawed piece of broadcasting legislation'.
It could increasingly be a voice crying in the wilderness.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Man In The News: Populist with a passion for power - Lindsey
Halstead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lindsey Halstead, the tough-talking American chairman of Ford of Europe,
has had some difficult explaining to do to his bosses at Ford's world
headquarters in Detroit over the past 12 months.
Ford last year achieved record vehicle sales in Europe. At the same time it
collapsed into loss.
Often in the past 10 years Ford of Europe has come to the rescue of its US
parent, churning out profits to help cushion the disasters being faced by
the world's second-largest vehicle maker in its domestic north American
market.
In 1991 the wheels fell off in both north America and Europe, however, with
the result that Ford will soon announce billion-dollar losses for 1991. The
worldwide automotive operations had racked up net losses of Dollars 2.47bn
in the first nine months of last year.
Mr Halstead has had an uncomfortable ride since easing himself into the
driving seat at Ford's European headquarters to the east of London three
years ago.
Though he inherited record net profits for Ford's European operations of
Dollars 1.562bn in 1988, in the past three years the profits have
evaporated, slipping to Dollars 1.289bn in 1989, Dollars 263m in 1990 and
into loss last year. The decline has been as steep as the fall of Mr
Halstead's beloved ski slopes in Colorado.
To rub salt in his wounds, Mr Halstead has been forced to watch Ford's
European glory be usurped by General Motors, its much bigger US rival, but
traditionally a loss-making laggard in the European arena.
Now the tables have been turned with a vengeance. GM (Opel in continental
Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) achieved record group net profits of Dollars
1.915bn in Europe in 1990.
Mr Halstead has not been idle. Joined by a new deputy in the bulky shape of
Mr Bill Fike as Ford of Europe president last April, he has been trying to
galvanise the bloated Ford bureaucracy into action.
Late last year, 300 senior managers from Ford's European automotive
operations gathered in Cologne to hear the new gospel according to Halstead
and Fike. The duo launched their 'Drive for Leadership' campaign. 'When we
meet again in April, we will review results, not more plans,' the managers
were told by the combative Mr Fike.
He told the managers that the Japanese are 'the critical challenge in
Europe.
'Their increased presence will create additional pressure on all
manufacturers to improve quality, reduce costs, and compete for market share
through improved products and aggressive pricing actions.
'The battle in Europe has begun - and truly only the fittest will survive.'
Mr Halstead, 61, a Ford veteran who joined the company in 1952 as a service
parts analyst, was previously vice-president of both Ford's Latin American
and Asia-Pacific operations. In Latin America he led Ford's negotiations
with Volkswagen to merge their businesses. At Asia-Pacific he confronted the
Japanese auto industry, an experience that left him with what might be
carefully described as a respectful hostility for his Asian rivals.
He did not baulk at being referred to as 'Jacques' Halstead, after one of
his more outspoken speeches appeared to put him in the same camp as the
protectionist Jacques Calvet, chief executive of Peugeot, the French car
maker.
Mr Halstead and Mr Fike have drawn up a broad agenda for change in Europe -
the job cuts announced for the UK yesterday are part of the plan - that
includes:
Attacking rigidities in organisation and structure with the so-called
'30/30/30' guidelines. The plan is to reduce the number of indirect salaried
staff, foreign service employees and certain layers of management by at
least 30 per cent by the end of 1993.
Aiming for a 25 per cent cut in investment spending by 1997 without reducing
quality. Earlier supplier participation, simultaneous engineering, and early
definition of customer requirements are all considered vital to gain greater
investment efficiency.
Improving productivity and quality, in particular at the UK Dagenham and
Halewood vehicle assembly plants.
Mr Albert Caspers, a key Halstead lieutenant as vice-president of Ford of
Europe's engineering and vehicle manufacturing group, says Dagenham improved
its productivity by 21 per cent between 1985 and 1989, but 'despite this
improvement Dagenham units (the Fiesta small car) are still substantially
more expensive to produce than Cologne's'
Of Halewood, he says simply: 'There is a long way to go, but we believe we
are making progress.'
Reducing the complexity of model lines by cutting the number of so-called
'build combinations'; introducing simultaneous engineering with the ultimate
ambition of reducing new model development times from the 72 months of the
recent past to only 36 months; and attacking design cost and materials cost
by cutting the number of components suppliers and giving them much more
research and development responsibility.
Mr Halstead admits he felt thwarted in trying to convey the urgency of his
drive-for-leadership message to Ford of Europe's middle management.
'I got frustrated with the speed at which as an organisation we were
addressing the need to be more customer driven.
'We have to make more decisions down below in the organisation. If you take
enough people out at the top, the critical work still gets done. It is
working, but it is a slow process.'
Ford has always been rightly famed for its financial control systems, for
rule by the bean counters, but Mr Halstead insists that such an approach is
deeply flawed in today's marketplace.
'We have been a cost-driven rather than a product-driven company. The
Japanese have done a good job. If you look at customer research and customer
satisfaction indices they have scored better.'
Ford of Europe has been dragged down in the past two years by its
performance in the UK, traditionally its big money spinner. It persistently
underestimated the depth of the recession and was left with capacity where
it had no sales in the UK, but with demand in Germany which it did not have
the capacity to satisfy.
Mr Halstead and Mr Fike insist that Ford's European operations are now in
better balance, but as more job cuts are announced for the UK Mr Halstead
pulls no punches over the threat facing the British operations if they do
not shape up.
'It isn't the facilities that are different, there is not a damn thing wrong
with the Halewood facility. It is the way labour is organised and the way
labour functions . . . You have to close the gap (with continental Europe)
eventually, or you have to shift capacity because eventually you will have
to say 'to hell with it'.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Bank to issue new gilt stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is creating a 20-year government bond in its first issue
of a new gilt-edged security for nearly four years.
The Bank's announcement yesterday that it is issuing Pounds 1.25bn of the 9
per cent Treasury stock due 2012 was well received in the gilt market. The
issue will be available from Monday and is expected to appeal to domestic
and foreign institutional investors such as pension and life funds.
The Pounds 1.25bn gilt is too small at present to provide a useful 20-year
benchmark, but the Bank is likely to issue further amounts of the stock to
create a more liquid issue.
With the government's return to borrowing in the gilt-edged market last
year, the Bank will have issued a total of Pounds 15bn in gilt-edged stock
in the present financial year, including the latest issue. The Bank took
advantage of the strong performance of the bond market this week to sell
Pounds 550m of medium and long-dated gilts.
Economists at UBS Phillips and Drew expect the Bank to issue up to Pounds
33bn in the 1992-93 tax year.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Blair condemns 'cuts' in funding of Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday said that Training and Enterprise Councils are breaking
government guarantees on Youth Training by building up waiting lists and
cutting spending per trainee, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said a Labour survey of 54 out
of 82 Tecs showed 'substantial cuts' in funding for training. With
unemployment rising, Tecs were being expected to provide more places for
less money.
He said: 'The government is systematically betraying our young people and
the unemployed, forcing severe behind-the-scenes reductions in government
support whilst publicly denying that cuts are taking place.'
Labour's survey shows 27 Tecs had waiting lists for places on the Youth
Training scheme. The average waiting list was 380.
The Department of Employment said the waiting lists, which built up in the
autumn when many school leavers were looking for places, had been
substantially reduced.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Engineers win BA single-union deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEU engineering union has won a single-union deal for the Boeing 747
maintenance base which British Airways is building at Cardiff Airport.
The Pounds 70m plant will employ up to 1,200 people by 1994 and is due to
open in April next year. There is a worldwide shortage of 747 hangars and
the company is hoping to attract work from other airlines.
The single-union deal is the first to have been agreed by British Airways
and will not affect current multi-union agreements at other maintenance
bases at Gatwick and London's Heathrow airports.
Four other unions competed for the Cardiff deal. They were the TGWU, MSF and
GMB general unions, and the EETPU electricians' union.
Mr Bill Jordan, the AEU president, said the proposed amalgamation with the
EETPU had counted in the AEU's favour with British Airways because the
combined union would represent the full range of skills needed on the
project.
The AEU is by far the largest of the maintenance unions within British
Air-ways.
Mr Jordan said the agreement was a 'prototype for the sort of deals that are
going to transform British industry'.
The government is expected early next week to announce details of the pay
review bodies' recommendations for doctors, nurses, professions allied to
medicine, teachers and the armed forces.
Most groups are expected to receive 6 per cent.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Labour steps up attack on SNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party yesterday stepped up its attempt to head off any surge in
support for the Scottish National Party. Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor,
subjected the SNP's spending plans to the kind of critical analysis the
Tories have applied to those of Labour.
Mr Smith accused the nationalists of trying to 'con the Scottish people'.
Speaking in Edinburgh he said it was widely accepted that identified
government expenditure in Scotland exceeded tax raised by Pounds 3.7bn. As
to unidentifiable government spending on Scotland, it was unlikely that the
cost of an independent Scotland's defence and diplomatic service would be
less than its share of the current UK expenditure under those headings.
The SNP, he said, expected to fill the Pounds 3.7bn gap with revenues from
North Sea oil but the UK government's total oil revenues this year would be
only Pounds 1.4bn and an independent Scotland would not be able to claim all
of that.
Mr Smith said that the SNP had committed itself to additional spending of
Pounds 4.67bn, according to specific commitments in the 'Queen's speech to a
Scottish parliament' presented by Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, last October.
This included Pounds 3.7bn to write off all local-authority housing debt.
Mr Salmond said that Mr Smith 'does not understand the public-sector
borrowing requirement'. The Pounds 3.7bn write-offs on local authority
council debt would be spread over four years and would be a transfer of debt
from one part of the public sector to another, which would have no impact on
the PSBR.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Major pledges more scrutiny of councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major will today reinforce the government's commitment to subjecting
local councils to more independent scrutiny. He will also underline the
extension of private ownership, individual freedom and choice in a speech to
the Young Conservatives' conference in Eastbourne.
The prime minister will use his speech to set out some of the themes
intended for his party's manifesto and to try to frustrate Labour's hopes of
exploiting voters' dissatisfaction with public services. He will reaffirm
the government's plans for league tables on councils' performance.
Details of Mr Major's speech emerged last night and were intended to counter
Labour's local government conference in Blackpool.
He will also launch a fresh attack on Labour's economic policies, saying
that the opposition party has no proposals for strengthening the economic
recovery when it comes, but many which would lead to a perpetual recession.
Councils are currently setting poll tax levels and households may start to
receive bills around the time of the general election, if it is called on
April 9.
Tory efforts so far have focused on blaming Labour councils for setting high
bills.
Details of how more independent scrutiny could be introduced have yet to be
worked out but could build on existing plans to enhance the role of the
Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog.
Mr Major's speech, described by Tory officials as 'wide-ranging' will build
on the principles behind the Citizen's Charter he unveiled last year. He
will say that the re-election of a Tory government will mean 'no more
municipal cover-ups and no hiding place for incompetent and uncaring
councils'.
Besides seeking to increase Tory appeal to young voters, Mr Major will
outline four principles of his Conservative philosophy: ownership,
responsibility, choice and individual freedom.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Motor jobs fall by the wayside: The sector's sharpest
post-war decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY the spring of this year, some 70,000 motor industry-related jobs will
have been lost in the UK over 24 months, according to an estimate by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
The estimate is necessarily a fairly broad one, embracing losses not just at
the main vehicle manufacturers, importers and large component groups but
also the myriad small parts suppliers and the retail motor trade.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing 12,000 motor traders,
says about 25,000 of those casualties will have occurred among car and truck
dealers in just 12 months, as a long-awaited sales recovery has not
materialised.
Instead the industry has plunged into its sharpest postwar decline, with car
sales down 30 per cent from the record 2.3m of 1989 to 1.59m last year, and
commercial vehicle sales sliding to nearly half 1989 levels.
Both trade groups have used the figures recently in Budget submissions to
the chancellor, trying to secure the abolition of special car tax and other
aids to kick-start the industry into recovery.
The statistics make bleak reading for an industry which can claim to be not
only the country's largest manufacturing and exports sector, but also its
biggest single retail activity. The industry still directly employs about
700,000 people.
But the figures are not quite as dismal as they seem. Like the further round
of Ford and Vauxhall job losses announced yesterday, they incorporate the
natural wastage and voluntary redundancies involved as the UK industry
fights to get itself into the leaner, more productive shape it needs to
survive the 1990s.
Both Ford and Vauxhall emphasised that their cuts were not directly
recession-related, and Rover Group, the British Aerospace subsidiary, made
much the same point about many of its job cuts announced last year.
Altogether, 2,000 jobs were lost from Rover's 40,000-strong workforce,
virtually all through voluntary redundancy and natural wastage. The impact
of recession was felt mainly through short-time working, affecting about
1,200 workers for several weeks.
Some manufacturers, however, were hit not just by the UK recession but by
reduced sales in big export markets as competition, particularly from Japan,
stiffened.
Jaguar saw 1,500 jobs go, not all voluntarily. Another Ford luxury-car unit,
Aston Martin, lost 85 out of 535 jobs.
Rolls-Royce, which suffered a near halving of its worldwide sales last year,
has lost 750 jobs at its Crewe headquarters and closed its Mulliner Park
Ward plant in north London, with the loss of a further 500.
Truck makers have been hit proportionately harder. Leyland DAF, the UK-Dutch
venture, is expected to cut another 1,200 UK jobs in the next two years,
having lost 600-700 in each of the past three years. Iveco Ford, second in
the UK truck market, has cut its workforce by 500 in the past year to 1,400
 -although its cuts, too, have been achieved through natural wastage or
voluntarily.
Smaller cuts among manufacturers such as the Cheshire-based ERF have
contributed to the SMMT and RMI's overall job-loss total.
Things would have been worse last year had not buoyant Continental markets
kept vehicle production to within a few per cent of the 1990 level.
The creation of extra employment by Japanese manufacturers offsets some job
losses. Last month, Nissan surprised the industry with a plan to lift
capacity at its Sunderland plant to 300,000, from 220,000 next year,
involving the creating of an extra 1,000 jobs.
Toyota's car plant at Derby will add 3,000 jobs from the end of this year,
and Honda's plant at Swindon another 1,400.
That presumes - as Sir Hal Miller, SMMT chief executive, asserted last week
 -that the new Japanese transplants 'don't simply move jobs from Dagenham to
Derby'.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow Trial: Points seen in favour of defendants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEFENDANTS in the Blue Arrow trial kept nothing back from the group's
directors about their handling of the 1987 rights issue and this was a 'real
point in their favour', the jury was told yesterday.
Mr Justice McKinnon said in the second day of his summing up that Mr Tony
Berry, then Blue Arrow chairman, had participated in the late taking up of
rights after the issue had closed and had not been called to give evidence.
'There can be no allegations that anything material was kept from Blue
Arrow,' the judge said. 'You are entitled to use that as a real point in the
defendants' favour.'
He will continue his summing up on Monday.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Business failures at peak last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY insolvencies in England and Wales reached a record last year with a
45 per cent increase on the 1990 total, according to Department of Trade and
Industry figures released yesterday.
However, the seasonally adjusted figures for the final quarter of 1991 fell
by 5 per cent to 5,554 compared with the previous three months, indicating
that the peak of business failures may have passed.
The figures, published in the magazine of the Association of British
Chambers of Commerce, showed that 21,827 companies became insolvent during
1991. That represents 2.3 per cent of the number of active companies
registered at Companies House during 1991, compared with 1.6 per cent in the
previous year.
The number of compulsory liquidations for companies in Scotland increased by
21 per cent to 304 last year and the number of creditors' voluntary
liquidations by 41 per cent to 309. Both showed a slight decline between the
third and fourth quarters.
Mr Eric Forth, minister for small firms, said: 'While the continuing rise in
insolvencies is of course a cause for concern, it is heartening to see that
there are further signs of an easing in the upward trend, particularly in
company liquidations.'
However, Mr Ron Taylor, director-general of the association, cautioned that
signs of economic recovery have in the past lead to an increase in the
number of insolvencies. The government should do everything it could 'to
leave cash in business' pockets', he declared.
Mr Steven Hill, a partner with Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte, said the high failure rate reflected the high growth in
company formation during the 1980s, as well as the impact of excessive
borrowing and the recession.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Nine die as clashes erupt in Algeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLASHES between the security forces and supporters of the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS) yesterday erupted in towns across Algeria after Friday prayers.
At least nine people were reported killed and scores injured. The clashes
were the most widespread and violent since the suspension of elections
nearly one month ago, after FIS candidates won 47 per of the popular vote.
The eastern capital of Constantine, the western seaport of Oran, Setif,
Tebessa, Sidi Bel Abbes and Tlemcen all witnessed violence.
Police and soldiers encircled mosques in FIS strongholds at dawn in Algiers
but this did not deter FIS militants from protesting for the fifth Friday in
succession. Two died and ten were wounded in the capital after dozens of
gendarmes swept down streets firing shots to dispersedemonstrators.
Black smoke was seen rising from FIS strongholds in Algiers, as
fundamentalists lit bonfires of used car tyres and built makeshift
barricades.
Last night, police and soldiers were holding hundreds inside Kouba mosque in
Algiers demanding that a fundamentalist who read an FIS communique before
prayers be turned over.
The French Interior Ministry said yesterday Mr Tedjini Haddam was resigning
from Algeria's five-man presidency. Mr Haddam, rector of the Paris Mosque,
had received complaints from France's Moslem community that the two posts
were incompatible.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Storms help calm troubled Mideast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS if to prove that God, or Mother Nature, or whatever higher power you
believe in, stands above mere earthly political squabbles, a reservoir on
the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights burst its banks this week and 3m cubic
metres of flood water 'defected' across the UN-patrolled frontier into
Syria.
In the Middle East, water, like just about everything else, is a source of
acute political tension, heightened recently by several years of drought.
The Golan damburst notwithstanding, however, the weather in 1992 has poured
far more balm on the area's water problems than anything achieved in the
peace talks.
Weathermen say there have been few winters like it this century.
Explanations for the deluge of rain and snow in Israel, Lebanon, Syria and
Jordan this year range from the puzzled shrug to blaming volcanic eruptions
last year in the Philippines.
So far, two blizzards have smothered Jerusalem in snow, once to a depth of
30cm, bringing down thousands of trees and power lines. More snow is
forecast today.
But it is the near incessant, drenching rain that has fallen between
snowstorms that is having the most dramatic effect.
The Jordan river, a lifeblood for Israel, the occupied West Bank, Jordan and
southern Syria, has turned from a brackish burn into a swollen torrent,
submerging and closing the two bridges that are the only border crossing
points between the West Bank and Jordan.
As recently as last November, the Sea of Galilee was within centimetres of
falling below the mark of 213 metres below sea level at which Israel ceases
pumping for fear of permanently depleting the lake.
Since the beginning of January it has risen by three metres and will soon
breach the 'maximum' level of 209 metres below sea level when sluices must
be opened to prevent flooding. This despite daily pumping of 200,000 cu
metres into underground reservoirs.
In the short term, there has been huge damage materially, especially to
agriculture. Jordanian officials estimate 50 to 90 per cent of the delicate
crops of the northern Jordan valley, such as tomatoes, aubergines and
peppers, have been damaged by frost and floods.
In Israel, farmers are calling on the government to declare an official
disaster season to trigger compensation. Citrus and soft fruits, important
export crops, have been hit at the height of the harvest.
For the longer term, the dramatic boost to badly depleted surface and
underground reservoirs will ease what was threatening to become a crisis. It
may provide a breathing space for negotiators in the peace talks to untangle
disputes over water sharing - particularly over Israel's inequitable
distribution of water in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Major invites new Dublin leader for talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, has stepped up his initiative on Northern
Ireland by inviting Mr Albert Reynolds, premier-elect of the Irish Republic,
to visit the UK for talks later this year.
Downing Street yesterday said Mr Major would meet Ulster's political leaders
on Tuesday to discuss security after one of the most violent months in the
province's history. This year 26 people have been killed by terrorists.
Officials said that Mr Major wanted locally elected Unionist and nationalist
politicians to take more of a role in expressing the hostility of most
people to terrorism.
Mr Major agreed with Mr Charles Haughey, the departing Irish prime minister,
that they would hold six-monthly meetings when they met in Dublin in
December.
No date has been fixed for the meeting with Mr Reynolds. Meanwhile, the
Northern Ireland Office is playing down any expectations that next week's
meeting will make significant progress.
Although Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, believes any dialogue
is helpful, he is aware of the danger of the Unionists believing they have
begun to set the agenda.
Some Unionists' hopes have been raised by signs from Mr Major and Mr Brooke
that the Tories might consider a pact in a hung parliament.
The proximity of the general election has already stalled Mr Brooke's
efforts to start formal 'round-table' negotiations on the province's future.
However, Unionist demands for the internment of terrorist suspects are
expected to be rejected at next week's meeting. The Northern Ireland Office
would prefer not to discuss the measure, if only because internment would
need an element of surprise in order to be successful.
Although Mr Major spoke earlier this week of how local politicians could
help restore peace if they talked together more, the Downing Street meeting
is described as more of a listening opportunity for the prime minister.
Local politicians have not had responsibility for security in the province
for 20 years and Mr Brooke has always acknowledged that his political
initiative would not necessarily end terrorist violence.

ISRAELI security forces were braced for trouble in Jerusalem today at the
funeral of a Palestinian whose death in custody on Wednesday was said by an
American pathologist last night to have been partly caused by his treatment
during interrogation, writes Hugh Carnegy.
The case of Mustafa Abdullah Akawi, an East Jerusalem resident who
complained in court the day before he died of being beaten by his Israeli
captors, is the kind of volatile confrontation between Israel and the
Palestinians that could upset their fragile peace talks. The belief is
widespread among Palestinians that Mr Akawi was tortured to death.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Ominous accord unites outlawed loyalist groups: The shadowy
connections of the paramilitaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOPPERS stood in respectful silence on Belfast's republican Falls Road
yesterday by the funeral procession of one of the 10 victims of this week's
paramilitary attacks.
While families and friends mourn the deaths, nine of them claimed by the
outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), political leaders in Northern
Ireland have renewed calls for internment of terrorists and a ban on the
loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA).
Mr John Major, the prime minister, will be pressed on these issues when he
meets party leaders from Ulster on Tuesday.
Mr Seamus Mallon, justice spokesman for the nationalist Social Democratic
and Labour Party, said: 'We want to see the UDA proscribed. They are a flag
of convenience for one of the most ruthless murder gangs in Northern
Ireland.'
The UFF claimed responsibility for Wednesday's gun attack on a Belfast
betting shop which left five people dead and seven wounded, as well as an
attack on Tuesday against a Sinn Fein office on the Falls Road which left
three dead.
The UDA denies it has any direct links with the UFF, but a source close to
the organisation claims that 'the inner council of the UDA is the UFF
leadership - they have between 1,000 and 2,000 supporters and maybe 200 to
300 active paramilitaries'.
The history of the loyalist paramilitaries goes back to 1913, eight years
before the partition of Ireland. Protestants fearful that the British
government might bow to republican demands formed the Ulster Volunteer Force
(UVF) to wage a military campaign.
Today there are five main loyalist organisations which have direct or
indirect paramilitary links. They are the UVF, UDA, UFF, Red Hand Commandoes
and Ulster Resistance. All except the UVF have grown out of the 'troubles'
of the 1970s. The UVF, UFF and Red Hand are proscribed. The UDA and Ulster
Resistance are not, but the police say: 'It is a fact that members of these
organisations have committed terrorist offences; the facts speak for
themselves.'
The Provisional IRA remains the principal security concern of the police and
Army in Northern Ireland. But the UFF now poses a growing threat starkly
demonstrated by its recent attacks.
The police said the UFF had 'certainly acquired a substantial quantity of
arms from the international market, about two thirds of which have been
seized'. Unlike the IRA, the UFF appears not to have many explosives, but it
has used automatic weapons and anti-armour weapons.
The security forces have had greater success in seizing arms from the other
loyalist groups. But it is now thought that the UFF began sharing weapons
and intelligence with the other groups last year, and that all are in effect
merging into one organisation.
The UDA claimed to have as many as 40,000 members when it was formed as a
civil-defence and militia organisation at the height of the sectarian
conflict in the early 1970s. Infiltration by the security forces was
relatively easy, and contributed to the evolution of the UFF with a hard
core of activists organised in a tight cell structure. The UDA was presented
as its political front.
Suspicion among nationalists about collusion between loyalist paramilitary
groups and the security forces has never abated.
An inquiry in 1989 after many complaints reported that collusion was
'neither widespread nor institutionalised.'
It is believed that one adverse result of the subsequent clean-out has been
the loss of intelligence sources within the Loyalist paramilitary groups.
The conviction this week of Mr Brian Nelson, a former Army intelligence
operative, on conspiracy-to-murder and other terrorist charges, is an
indication of that.
Nationalist leaders continue to ask whether there is an 'inner circle' of
rogue security force officers collaborating with loyalist groups. The police
said yesterday: 'That is arrant nonsense.' Yet Tuesday's attack on the Sinn
Fein office, claimed by the UFF but carried out by a policeman who later
killed himself, has left doubts in Belfast about whether he acted on his
own.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Halifax begins mortgage rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX BUILDING Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, yesterday
announced four initiatives to help customers unable to keep up monthly
mortgage payments and to ease the problems of the housing market.
The move follows a meeting between mortgage lenders and the government late
last year at which the lenders pledged more than Pounds 800m for schemes to
save some of the 160,000 borrowers in serious arrears.
But the scale of the schemes announced is small considering that the lenders
have pledged to save 20,000 homes from repossession this year.
Halifax is to supply an initial Pounds 18m to three housing associations
that will then purchase properties which are either under a repossession
order or likely to be subject to one soon. The occupants of the house will
become tenants of the housing association.
The scheme, described by Halifax as a model for others, will save no more
than 350 homeowners.
Halifax is supplying Pounds 8m to Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association;
Pounds 5m to Hyde Housing Association, a national association; and Pounds 5m
to North British Housing Association, based in Preston, Lancashire.
The society yesterday instructed the three housing associations not to
divulge any details of the return on the loans through rents. However, it is
understood to be less than 5 per cent, with Halifax taking part of any
profit when the property is sold.
Two weeks ago, Nationwide Building Society launched an Pounds 8m rescue
scheme with three other housing associations. The return in that case was
believed to be slightly over 3.5 per cent.
Halifax has also arranged for London and Quadrant Housing Trust and Hyde
Housing Association to lease and manage 400 empty homes in and around
London.
Two more lenders, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Leeds Permanent, are expected to
unveil rescue schemes in the first half of next week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Philippine government is to ask the International Monetary Fund to
release Dollars 250m under a suspended financing programme after congress
approved measures to cover the projected budget deficit.
In its final session under the government of President Corazon Aquino,
congress passed five of the six remaining tax enhancement measures sought by
the administration.
Approval of the measures provided the government with new sources of finance
which will almost cover the projected budget deficit for 1992 of Pesos
27.4bn.
Failure of the senate to pass a bill proposing refinements in the
value-added tax system left a gap of Pesos 1bn. The bill was designed to
expand the scope of VAT coverage, but finance officials said it was felt the
measure would effectively create new taxes, a politically unpalatable move
in an election year.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, said, however, that the
remaining gap could be covered with proceeds from the sale last week of
state-owned Philippine Airlines.
Mr Estanislao also said a proposal to override Mrs Aquino's veto on a budget
provision to limit foreign-debt payments to 10 per cent of export earnings
was 'dead'. He claimed the last-minute support for the tax measures 'came
from all party lines'.
Mr Estanislao expressed confidence that the IMF would formally approve the
release of the credit 'by Monday'.
Mr Jose Cuisia, the governor of the central bank of the Philippines, was
waiting for the IMF response before leaving for New York. The Philippines is
seeking to restructure Dollars 5.3bn of commercial debt.
The release of the IMF's credit should reactivate talks between Philippine
debt negotiators and its bank creditors.
It should also pave the way for a meeting of a consultative group of the
country's traditional donor-countries next March in Hong Kong. That meeting
is not intended to be a pledging session, but Mr Estanislao said: 'We will
not stop anybody making pledges.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Mandela explains ANC position on foreign debt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC, yesterday issued the following
statement on the alleged conflict between the ANC and himself on foreign
loans to South Africa.
'Press articles suggest that there is a discrepancy between the African
National Congress and its president on the repayment of foreign loans. In
actual fact, there is no such discrepancy. The previous statements of
secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa and other ANC spokesmen have been taken
out of context by the press.
'The articles create an impression that the ANC secretary general issued a
statement on the loans issue in relation to the attempts by the development
bank of southern Africa (DBSA) to raise funds in international capital
markets. Mr Ramaphosa did not issue such a statement. The statement was
issued by the Department of Information and Publicity of the ANC. The
articles also combine the debt issue with the nationalisation question even
though there is no direct link between the two.
'The ANC accepts, as a general policy that a future democratic state has an
obligation to pay foreign debts which were incurred by the present regime in
the normal course of administration before financial sanctions were imposed
by the international community.
'The terms of repayment of such loans may be re-negotiated to ensure that a
democratic government is not unduly burdened by foreign debts incurred by an
illegitimate regime.
'What is totally unacceptable to us is the attempt by the South African
regime, acting in concert with certain foreign financial institutions, to
bust financial sanctions adopted by the international community.
'By so doing these institutions are undermining the negotiation process in
South Africa. If they have a genuine interest in South Africa they would put
pressure for the immediate installation of an interim government of national
unity in South Africa. If these institutions lend money to the apartheid
regime now, they will in fact be acting to delay our forward march to
freedom, democracy and development.
'We therefore want to reiterate that the ANC is opposed to any bond issues
currently being launched in the international capital markets. In terms of
our sanctions policy, sanctions will be lifted (with the exception of the
oil and arms embargo) when an interim government of national unity has been
installed.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration has run into serious difficulties in its attempt to
persuade the US Congress to support a Dollars 60bn recapitalisation plan for
the International Monetary Fund this year.
The US share of the quota increase would be Dollars 12bn, the single largest
contribution since Washington is the largest IMF shareholder, with about 19
per cent of the voting shares.
Stiff congressional opposition to foreign aid in the 1992 election year
means the IMF may have to wait until next year for an increase, despite
growing demands on the world financial organisation, particularly from the
former Soviet Union.
Sen Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate foreign appropriations
sub-committee responsible for foreign aid, said there was 'no support' in
the House or Senate for a quota increase in 1992.
His judgment was confirmed by a senior congressional staff member of the
House appropriations committee who said the Bush administration had not
pushed hard for IMF recapitalisation. 'The President had a golden
opportunity to mention the IMF in his State of the Union address (last
month) - but he dropped the ball.'
The IMF argues it must receive a quota increase this year or face the
prospect of its liquidity ratios falling below historical levels. This would
come at a time when it is seeking to play a greater role in helping the
former Soviet republics led by Russia make the transition from a centrally
planned economy.
This year, the US shifted position in favour of early IMF membership for
Russia and other reformist republics. Officials justified the move by saying
they wanted a neutral body to shoulder the burden of direct financial aid to
the former Soviet Union rather than the US, which has a Dollars 400bn budget
deficit.
In congressional testimony this week, Mr James Baker, Secretary of State,
said the IMF, rather than western countries, would provide funds for
currency stabilisation in the republics.
The US agreed to support a quota increase for the IMF in mid-1990. However
Congress failed to act, and the issue subsequently became embroiled with a
controversy over Dollars 10bn of US government-sponsored housing loan
guarantees to Israel.
President Bush urged Congress to support a 120-day delay in approval of the
guarantees, halting consideration of the IMF quota. The US and Israel remain
deadlocked on the loan guarantee conditions.
Congressional officials said yesterday that foreign aid bills in the House
and Senate would likely be ready by the end of March. But it was unlikely
that the bills would mention a quota increase, though members could attach
an amendment to that effect.
In the past, however, House and Senate members have found it difficult to
vote for the IMF and World Bank quota increase - for fear of being attacked
by their opponents in an election campaign. 'It needs presidential
leadership,' said one official yesterday, 'it needs Bush to take some of the
political heat.'

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN secretariat announced a big shake-up last night, dropping fourteen
senior officials and scrapping a dozen departments and offices.
The sweeping changes were ordered by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros
Ghali, in response to demands by major cash contributors for a
rationalisation of the bloated bureaucracy.
However, Mr Boutros Ghali, by-passed a streamlining plan drafted by 30 UN
ambassadors led by Australia's Mr Peter Wilenski. This would have created a
small group of deputy secretaries general and eliminated an entire tier of
the hierarchy.
Mr Francois Giuliani, who is to continue as the UN spokesman, observed that
it was the secretary-general's prerogative to organise the secretariat as he
saw fit.
The Office for Political and General Assembly Affairs headed by Mr Ronald
Spiers, a former senior US State Department official, is among those to be
eliminated. Also to be scrapped is the Centre for Transnational
Corporations, which just this week issued a report critical of the handling
of the BCCI affair. The department was headed Mr Peter Hansen of Denmark.
Former Canadian broadcasting executive Mrs Therese Sevigny, one of the few
senior women, is to be replaced as under secretary-general for information
by Mr Eugeniusz Wyzner, a lawyer-diplomat who served the Polish communist
government before joining the UN staff 10 years ago as head of conference
services, another axed department.
Britain's Mr Marrack Goulding will head a new office of Peacekeeping
Operations, maintaining the responsibilities he held as a UN political
affairs executive. His office will also gain Mr Kofi Annan of Ghana, who
conducted the abortive talks with Iraq aimed at obtaining the resumption of
oil shipments.
Two key appointments - administration and management and emergency relief
co-ordinator - are to be announced, one of which may go to an American.
A newcomer is Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, former Soviet deputy foreign minister
who will be in charge of one of two political affairs departments. Mr James
Jonah of Sierra Leone, will head the other.

<TEXT>
TOMORROW'S first democratic local government elections in Romania for over
five decades are expected to show if the ruling National Salvation Front
(NSF) will retain its majority in the forthcoming parliamentary elections,
writes Judy Dempsey.
The NSF government was catapulted into power following the violent overthrow
of the Ceausescus in December 1989.
Despite winning a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections in June
1990, the NSF is no longer confident it can retain control over local
government which serves as one of its main power bases.
Not only is the NSF divided between conservatives/former communists, and
social democrats anxious to speed up reform; it also faces what appears to
be the beginnings of a united opposition movement.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian parliament yesterday gave President Leonid Kravchuk 10 days to
form a new cabinet and propose a new government structure for the republic.
A parliamentary resolution, which amounts to a vote of no-confidence in the
government, could force Mr Kravchuk to sack the communist apparatchiks who
dominate the cabinet and replace them with a new generation of reformers.
The resolution criticises the government's economic programme as
'unsatisfactory' and accuses 'a number of government officials of
professional incompetence and administrative ineffectiveness'.
The harsh words reflect growing popular discontent as the newly independent
republic has lagged behind Russia's fast paced move towards market reforms.
'Ukraine is severely falling behind in economic reforms', said Mr Volodymyr
Hryniov, deputy chairman of parliament a leader of New Ukraine, an
opposition party pushing for radical economic change. 'In Ukraine, there is
a great danger that we will create a new state but forget about its
context.'
For weeks, Mr Kravchuk, a former communist ideologue, has promised to sack
75 per cent of the cabinet, but, by nature a coalition builder, he has been
hesitant to purge the conservatives of the communist old guard.
Parliament's tough stance comes after Prime Minister Vitold Fokin's economic
programme, unveiled on Thursday, emphasised subsidies and controls rather
than privatisation and a free market.
Although he refused to name names, Mr Kravchuk promised to include members
of the opposition in a new cabinet of national unity.
Parliament tabled for next week Mr Kravchuk's request for expanded
presidential powers which he argued are required to implement reforms.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Bundesbank Warning Over EMU Terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank said yesterday European monetary union (Emu) should be
accompanied by eventual political union and warned against any compromise on
the strict conditions for entry, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
It said it was happy with the Maastricht agreement but fulfilling the entry
criteria was more important than meeting the 1999 deadline.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, dismissed reports of
serious internal disagreements over the Maastricht agreement and the fact
that moves towards political union lagged behind progress on the monetary
front.
This special statement, to be included in the central bank's monthly report,
was unanimously approved by the Bundesbank directors. Mr Schlesinger said:
'We wanted to get rid of such speculation. As is often the case with
speculation, it was wrong.'
However, the statement said the Maastricht accord did not yet show agreement
on the future structure of the political union and how it would operate in
parallel with European monetary union (Emu). 'The further development in the
area of political union will be of central importance for the lasting
success of currency union.'
Mr Schlesinger and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president, emphasised that
decisions over monetary and political union were for governments and
parliaments.
Mr Tietmeyer, responsible for international monetary affairs, said: 'In
substance, and this is the clear view of all Bundesbank council members, the
requirements and recommendations of the Bundesbank for the final phase (of
Emu) have been achieved.'
The bank said the timetable for the transitional and final phases of Emu
would put great demands on the EC. Monetary and credit policies could not
alone ensure that member countries would move towards greater price
stability.
Central banks should be independent and budget discipline had to be assured.
Regional financial aid granted by the EC must not weaken governments' own
efforts at stability.

JUST hours before EC ministers yesterday put their pens to the European
Union treaty in the southern Dutch town of Maastricht, an announcement to
the north underlined the probable transience of the treaty's institutional
provisions.
In a speech to the parliament in Helsinki, President Mauno Koivisto made
clear Finland would shortly become the seventh country to make a formal
application to join the EC.
This means that soon rules and structures set up originally for a club of
six will have to be re-designed for a membership approaching 20. Indeed, the
Brussels Commission has already embarked on a study of the implications of
enlargement for EC institutions.
By another irony, the idea of such a study was conceived by President
Mitterrand in the hope that it might put a brake on rapid enlargement.
Instead, it has prompted virtually every would-be applicant to think it must
make its EC entry bid before the study is completed.
Thus, Prime Minister Harlem Gro Bruntland of Norway is now expected to
express her personal preference for EC entry in early April, and even the
Swiss government is contemplating knocking on Brussels' door.
So far, the issues thrown up by enlargement are being soft-pedalled by all
concerned. It will fall to the British presidency in the second half of this
year to preside over the launching of the first enlargement negotiations
with countries of the European Free Trade Association (Efta).
A bloated EC executive will not be the only problem. A European parliament
ofmore than 700 deputies, with communication in more than a dozen languages,
would result in 156 cross-translation permutations.
The key question will be whether EC members can agree to take more of its
decisions by speedier, majority vote, just when enlargement will make their
interests even more diverse.
Volkswagen and its unions yesterday signed a landmark agreement setting up a
European works council, moving ahead of stalled European Commission
proposals on EC-wide consultation of workers in cross-border companies,
David Gardner reports from Brussels.
It is the first such agreement in Europe's hard-pressed car industry, and
was described as 'absolutely crucial ..in a climate of increased
competitivity' by Mr Martin Posth, the VW board member in charge of human
resources.
The accord covers Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Seat in Spain and VW
Belgium and will eventually extend to VW's operations in Czechoslovakia,
including Skoda.
The VW board undertakes to consult an elected council of 17 members on
investment, plant structures, labour transfers, productivity, costs, hours,
wages and conditions, new technology, safety and environment conditions. The
agreement also enshrines confidentiality clauses and upholds the right to
manage.
Mr Karl-Heinz Mihr, a German Euro-MP on VW's Kassel works council, called
the deal 'a milestone in the defence of workers' rights in Europe'.

A SHARP fall in US employment last month fuelled speculation yesterday that
the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, may cut interest rates again in
the near future.
The Labour Department said non-farm payrolls fell by 91,000 last month.
Financial markets had expected a gain of about 30,000 jobs. Bond prices rose
sharply at first on Wall Street but fell back once it became clear that the
Fed was not going to cut interest rates yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed down 30.19 points at 3,225.40.
'I expect the Fed to take out a bit more insurance and nudge rates lower,'
said Mr David Rolley, senior financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, a
forecasting group. If the Fed decides to act, it is likely to lower the
federal funds rate by a quarter point to 3.75 per cent. The fed funds rate
is the rate at which banks borrow from each other.
Some economists expect a bigger move. C J Lawrence, a New York broker,
yesterday predicted another full point cut in the discount rate to 2.5 per
cent before the end of the month. Other analysts, however, believe the Fed
will resist political pressure to stimulate the economy because of signs of
a revival in monetary growth in recent weeks.
The employment report, the first comprehensive guide to economic trends last
month, suggests the economy entered the new year in worse shape than
expected. It indicates gross domestic product may be declining, rather than
static as most economists had predicted.
Employment declined in nearly all sectors, including services. Manufacturing
and retailing each shed about 50,000 jobs. Figures for December were also
revised down to show a gain of only 3,000 rather than the 31,000 previously
reported.
The politically sensitive unemployment rate, however, held steady at 7.1 per
cent last month. It is based on a less reliable data series than the payroll
employment numbers.
Payrolls have declined by 300,000 since October, wiping out the gain in the
previous six months of faltering economic recovery. Job growth in services
has ceased in the past three months after steady gains between April and
October. Manufacturing employment has fallen significantly for five months
running.
Yesterday's report also showed a sharp decline in the factory working week
last month, a sign that industrial production may have fallen substantially.
The employment figures follow a series of gloomy statistics, including a
further fall in consumer confidence last month and a sharp drop in factory
orders in December.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Ukraine beats tactical retreat on Black Sea fleet command

THE war of words between Russia and the Ukraine over the Black Sea Fleet
based in the Crimea seemed yesterday to produce a tactical retreat by the
Ukrainian President, Mr Leonid Kravchuk.
This follows a threat by the Russian parliament this week to open the issue
of whether Crimea should be part of Russia or Ukraine.
At the same time, another senior figure in Russia's defence establishment
called for an end to delay in creating a Russian military force.
The issue of the military command is due to be discussed by the heads of the
Commonwealth of Independent States in Minsk next Friday.
Mr Kravchuk said he would insist in Minsk that Ukraine has a fleet for the
defence of its borders. 'We do not say that we want a big Black Sea fleet -
that is not necessary for us.'
His comments appear to bring the Ukrainian leadership more into line with
what has been proposed by the military commanders and the Russian leadership
 -that is, that the bulk of the Black Sea fleet remains a 'strategic' part
of the CIS naval forces, leaving a small part as a Ukrainian coastguard.
However, the issue is complicated by the growing sentiment in Russia for its
own forces - which would include the Black Sea Fleet.
Mr Alexander Kotionkov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's
committee on defence, said yesterday that the 'planned creation' of separate
republican armies and their collaboration in a Nato-type union would be
better than the 'painful uncertainty' now facing the Soviet military.
Echoing General Konstantin Kobets, military adviser to the Russian
president, earlier this week, Mr Kotionkov said that Russia needed its own
military doctrine and called for a more coherent structure of political
decision-making on military matters.
At present, he said, seven committees and organisations had some
responsibility for military decisions - meaning that no one was ultimately
responsible.
The Ukraine is willing to take over, together with Russia, the entire
foreign debt of the former Soviet Union, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics
minister said yesterday, Reuters reports from Bonn.
Quoting President Kravchuk, Mr Mollemann told reporters, 'Ukraine is
prepared to take over its part and additional parts from other republics (of
the CIS)'.
Under the Ukrainian plan, the other CIS states would be relieved of payment
obligations on their foreign debt.
The government and bank debt of the former Soviet Union is estimated to
total some Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39bn).

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE level of foreign investment in Russia will depend on the outcome of a
heated debate within the Russian government over whether or not to create a
special exchange rate for foreign companies which wish to take part in the
privatisation programme being launched, John Lloyd reports from Moscow.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the Russian privatisation minister, said yesterday he
was against a special rate - and said that 'unfortunately', it was better to
rely on administrative controls on the purchase of Russian stock until the
rouble was made at least internally convertible, a process which the
government hopes to accomplish this year.
That in turn depends, Mr Chubais said, on the provision from abroad of a
Dollars 5bn-6bn stabilisation fund to support the rouble, support for which
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, again made an urgent call on
Thursday during his visit to France.
However, evidence that some authorities plan to use a special rate came
yesterday from Mr Vladimir Klimenko, deputy chairman of the Moscow Regional
Council. He said that regional authorities intended to set varying exchange
rates for foreign investors - varying between Rbs4 to the dollar to Dollars
2 to a rouble. The latter rate is 40 cents higher than the old fixed
exchange rate.
Under the terms of the Russian privatisation law, foreigners can freely buy
enterprises which are abandoned, failing, loss-making or closed - or plants
in the food processing and agricultural products sectors. Otherwise,
foreigners are only allowed to buy into new enterprises, or to take part in
the bidding for a minority of shares at an auction. They may buy into large
companies, banking and insurance enterprises and others only by permission
of the Russian government.
Mr Chubais said the restrictions were necessary because of the low rate of
the rouble - officially standing at Rbs110 to the dollar, but selling in
interbank auctions for between Rbs160 - 170 to the dollar, and lower in the
Baltic exchanges and on the black market. 'If we sold at this rate, it would
mean you could buy a shop in Moscow for Dollars 1,000 - students could come
and buy one with their holiday earnings.'
The minister said that over the past two years, 'wild' privatisation had
meant that state assets had fallen into the hands of company managers. He
said that any attempt to prosecute those who had taken the assets for
themselves would be difficult because there was no framework of law within
which to bring prosecutions.
The government plans to sell off 25 per cent of state enterprises this year,
for a target amount of Rbs92bn - starting with shops and small companies.
The amount raised is planned to increase to Rbs350bn in 1995 and to up to
Rbs500bn in 1994. Workers will be given 25 per cent of the shares, and can
choose to buy another 10 per cent at favourable prices.

RUSSIA and France yesterday agreed on a new partnership based on
'confidence, solidarity and co-operation' in a treaty signed by President
Boris Yeltsin and President Francois Mitterrand at the end of a three-day
state visit by the Russian President, writes Ian Davidson from Paris.
Non-committally entitled 'Treaty between France and Russia', the agreement
effectively replaces the 'Franco-Soviet Treaty of Understanding and
Co-operation', which was signed with President Mikhail Gorbachev in October
1990, but never ratified.
The treaty promises co-operation on the conclusion of a European security
treaty and stresses the importance of nuclear disarmament, with the aim of
reducing nuclear arsenals to levels of 'minimal sufficiency'.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Ford to cut 2,100 jobs from UK operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, is to cut about 2,100 jobs at its UK operations by
the end of the year. The move is part of its drastic efforts to close the
large productivity gap between its British and continental European plants.
The latest round of cuts at Ford follows a year in which employment at
British vehicle makers, components suppliers and motor dealers has been hit
hard by the recession.
The steep fall in UK new vehicle sales has compounded job cuts already being
made as the European industry is forced to restructure in the face of
mounting competition from Japanese carmakers in Europe.
The Ford announcement was immediately picked up by British politicians in
the pre-election propaganda war.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour employment spokesman, called the job losses a 'hammer
blow' to the British economy. 'It underlines once again the need for
government ministers to wake up out of their complacency, cease their false
optimism about the recovery that has not yet happened and take Britain out
of recession.' he said.
Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman, said the cuts were part of a
'process of making the British car industry more competitive and more
effective in the market place'.
In a further round of job-shedding in the industry, Vauxhall, the UK
subsidiary of General Motors, announced yesterday that it was planning to
cut 300 hourly-paid jobs from the 750-strong workforce at its Luton parts
warehouse.
The cuts will come in the 12 months from September 1992 following a Pounds
20m investment to automate the operation.
BMW, the German carmaker, said it was aiming to cut 3,000 jobs by the end of
the year. Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector company, announced plans
earlier this week for 10,300 redundancies.
Ford, which incurred heavy losses in the UK last year, said it planned to
reduce its British workforce by 2,100 by voluntary means by the end of the
year. It plans to complete most of the cuts by the end of April.
It is cutting 500 jobs at its Dagenham plant (where the Fiesta model and
engines are produced), 600 at Halewood (Escort/Orion and transmissions), 450
at Southampton (Transit van) and 300 at its South Wales engine and
components plants. The cuts will cover 1,500 hourly-paid and 600 salaried
employees.
The salaried staff cuts are part of the three-year restructuring programme
announced last year for Ford's white-collar staff across Europe. The company
warned about the looming job cuts at the Southampton plant last month.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford of Britain,
insisted the cuts were not a short-term response to recessionary pressures
but part of a long-term efficiency programme. 'The domestic UK vehicle
industry faces significant challenges over the remainder of the decade as
production from Japanese car plants adds to vehicle overcapacity in Europe.'
He said productivity at Ford's UK plants had improved by nearly 40 per cent
in the last six years. But the company admitted this week its European
operations were still 'up to 50 per cent less efficient than leading
Japanese manufacturers'.
Union leaders expressed scepticism about the company's claim that the job
losses were part of a 'long-term efficiency programme', rather than a
response to recessionary pressures.
Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEU engineering union, said the Ford
statement was 'political rather than economic' and was 'designed to gloss
over a very depressing situation' for the British car industry. 'The company
should have been more honest about the real reasons.'
Government policies were 'eating like a cancer into the British motor
industry', he said.
Ford's UK workforce has fallen from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to 39,500
by late last year, an average reduction of 3,600 a year. Despite this, Ford
produced 451,996 vehicles in the UK last year against 481,140 in 1980.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Fraud office drops charges in third Guinness case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office yesterday dropped charges which would have formed
the basis for a third Guinness trial against two men. The trial, arising out
of the Pounds 2.7bn Guinness takeover of Distillers in 1986, was expected to
start later this year.
Charges against Mr David Mayhew, a partner of stockbroker Cazenove &amp; Co, and
three charges against Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at
Morgan Grenfell, currently standing trial at Southwark Crown Court, London,
in the second Guinness prosecution, were dismissed at a brief hearing.
An official verdict of not-guilty was entered against the names of both men.
Speculation has been growing that the second Guinness trial might also be
about to collapse. Guinness Two, which began at Southwark Crown Court in
September, involves Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance
director at Henry Ansbacher.
The SFO said it had decided not to proceed against Mr Mayhew after examining
fresh evidence from his solicitors.
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, the SFO director who is to be the new Director of
Public Prosecutions, said: 'After careful consideration I have come to the
view that the evidence in the case as a whole is no longer sufficient to
satisfy the test of whether there is a realistic prospect of a conviction.'
Eight men originally faced charges in what was dubbed the 'Financial Trial
of the Century'. The first Guinness trial which ended in August 1990,
involved Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief
executive, Mr Gerald Ronson, Heron Group chairman, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City
stockbroker, and the then-Sir Jack Lyons, a millionaire financier who was
subsequently stripped of his knighthood.
Mr Saunders, Mr Ronson and Mr Parnes were all jailed, but have since been
released. Mr Ronson was also fined a record Pounds 5m. Mr Lyons, who was not
jailed on the grounds of ill-health, was fined Pounds 3m.
Mr Mayhew is the only City defendant in the Guinness case not to have been
dismissed from the position he held at the time of the takeover.
Mr John Kemp-Welch, Cazenove's joint senior partner, said yesterday: 'We
have always believed in his innocence.'
Asked whether the Guinness affair had affected the firm's business, he
added: 'It would be naive to claim it had done no damage.'
However, he said that no clients had left the firm because of the case.
Last night, Mr Seelig said: 'I am delighted, not only for myself but also
for David Mayhew and for Cazenove who have so admirably stood by him
throughout his ordeal.'
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens are accused of involvement in an unlawful
share-support operation, mounted by Guinness during the takeover battle for
Distillers.
The trial has already gone beyond its original estimated length of three
months. Only 10 of the 80 potential prosecution witnesses have so far given
evidence and there is serious concern over whether the trial can be
completed this year.
The judge is expected to address the question of whether the trial has
become unmanageable when the jury returns on Monday after a week's holiday.
If Guinness Two does collapse that will leave only Guinness Four
outstanding. That trial, which concerns Mr Thomas Ward, a US Attorney and a
non-executive director of Guinness at the time of the Distillers takeover,
is due to start at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Turner in September.

MR NELSON MANDELA made a determined effort yesterday to reassure the

In an interview with the Financial Times, the president of the African
National Congress served notice of a fundamental review of his
organisation's stance on nationalising key industries, and urged foreign
companies to visit South Africa to investigate investment opportunities.
He also sought to clarify the ANC's attitude to South Africa's external debt
and hinted that a new government might try to reschedule loan payments.
'Without the support of business we cannot solve our economic problems,' he
said. 'Nationalisation is like a sword of Damocles hanging above those who
want to invest. So long as nationalisation is our policy, we will not
attract investors.'
Mr Mandela's comprehensive review of economic policy came at the end of a
week in which the ANC's credibility took a severe knock as a result of
apparently conflicting signals on the economy.
While the 73-year-old nationalist leader held a series of meetings in Europe
with senior businessmen and politicians, including talks with Mr John Major
in London yesterday, his assurances about foreign investment and loans were
contradicted by statements from ANC headquarters in Johannesburg.
Yesterday, however, speaking at Heathrow airport before his return to
Johannesburg - and days before the second anniversary of his release from 27
years of imprisonment - Mr Mandela sought to assert his authority over ANC
policy.
He denied there was any discrepancy between his statements and those issued
at headquarters.
In a formal statement, which had apparently been cleared with other ANC
leaders, he said the ANC accepted 'that a future democratic South Africa had
an obligation to service the debts which were incurred by the present regime
. . . before financial sanctions were imposed by the international
community.'
But the statement added: 'The terms of repayment of such loans may be
renegotiated to ensure that a democratic government is not unduly burdened
by foreign debts incurred by an illegitimate regime.'
Mr Mandela did, however, criticise efforts by Pretoria to raise capital
through international bond issues, saying they amounted to sanctions
busting. He also reiterated the ANC's plea for maintenance of economic
sanctions, although most have already been dropped.
Lending to South Africa by private-sector institutions is not prohibited.
But banks cut off credit lines to South Africa in 1985 and Mr Mandela
believes this hastened apartheid's collapse.
He is trying to impede the government's access to international capital
markets until an interim government is installed to oversee democratic
elections.
Foreign financial institutions arranging bond issues on behalf of South
Africa, said Mr Mandela, singling out German banks, were 'undermining the
negotiation process in South Africa. If they have a genuine interest in
South Africa they would put pressure for the immediate installation of an
interim government of national unity in South Africa'.
Borrowing is a particularly sensitive issue in light of the current
all-party negotiations on South Africa's future. The ANC believes that new
loans will bolster the position of President F W de Klerk and reduce the
pressure for reform.
Mr Mandela's comments on nationalisation seemed designed to set the tone for
a review of what has been a central and controversial plank of ANC thinking
since 1955. This, he said, was likely to be discussed at a policy conference
in April, though it is far from clear that this will resolve the matter.
The ANC leader said he had concluded that a nationalisation programme was
likely to alienate business after discussions with top executives in South
Africa and abroad, and recent conversations with world leaders, includinging
Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, and President Francois Mitterrand of
France.
Tracy Corrigan writes: The Southern African Development Bank's debut issue
of its DM200m (Pounds 70m) medium-term bond met strong demand yesterday from
German retail investors despite ANC opposition.

FT  08 FEB 92 / The trials of learning to love the hated Beattie: How the
nice guys at British Telecom made everything come right in the end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I wonder why British Telecom is Britain's most hated company. Its business
is not harmful in any way; so far as I am aware it has never been the cause
of any life threatening industrial accidents; its profits are not derived
from the corruption of minors, nor the hunting or skinning of animals; it
does not pollute our rivers, while its despoiliation of the countryside is
far less unsightly than, for example, that resulting from the gigantic
pylons which the electricity supply industry positively gloats over in its
television advertisements.
And yet, everybody seems to hate British Telecom. Is it because it makes
profits of Pounds 100 a second? This seems rather an irrelevant measure.
Perhaps it is because the company makes a rate of return of almost 75 per
cent on national calls, and not far short of 45 per cent return on local
calls. But these figures, while doubtless a national disgrace, are not, I
suspect, known to more than a very small percentage of those who moan and
complain about British Telecom.
Besides, I recall a few years ago attending a press conference at which the
then chairman of British Petroleum, Sir Peter Walters, was being castigated
for putting up the price of petrol too much and too often. Sir Peter
robustly answered that if people thought that BP was making an extortionate
return they should stop moaning and buy his shares.
This argument is even more applicable to British Telecom: many of its
customers did buy the shares when they were floated not once but twice on
the stock market, and they have probably grown accustomed to the plop of a
dividend cheque on their front door mats. That, after all, was the main, if
slightly disreputable, reason for privatising British Telecom as a near
monopoly.
I have rehearsed these arguments to myself over the past week, as an
exercise to reduce my blood pressure. You see, Doctor, I had begun to hate
the people at British Telecom, too. First, they had overcharged me on my old
London telephone number. Then they came to remove two telephones at our new
London address, omitting to bring the two new telephones that we ordered.
Then, when they did bring the two new lines, they installed them in such a
way that each interfered with the other's reception. We were told that to
have the lines more than two inches apart would be 'complicated'.
Then we were cut off on our number in the country. Our fault really, we
stupidly went on honeymoon without telling British Telecom, and in a four
week period three bills, blue, red and final, arrived, and we were
disconnected for non-payment of a bill of Pounds 65, much of it in the
inimitable manner of British Telecom rental in advance.
On Monday I paid the bill and rang up the BT disconnection unit in Bristol,
to ask when we would be reconnected.
'When we have your cheque in the system.'
'How long will that take?', I enquired.
'It's all done by computer.'
'When your computer accepts my cheque, will I be reconnected?'
'No. Then we have to get the engineers. It's not a simple business.'
'It was simple enough to cut us off. How long will it take the engineers to
put our number back into operation?'
'I don't know.'
At this point I disconnected the BT office in Bristol, and rang the BT Press
Office in London. They were wonderfully understanding, gentle and
sympathetic. Within a couple of days, we were reconnected in the country,
and in London, British Telecom engineers speedily returned to put the two
new lines where they should have been all along. And now I really can't
think why everybody hates British Telecom so much. Such charming people - if
you know the right ones.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Private View: One woman's crusade for the world's
dispossessed - Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, explains her
mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT can one small woman do for the 17m people in this world who are
refugees from war, persecution or man-made disaster?
Quite a lot, is the answer, if that woman's name is Sadako Ogata.
Mrs Ogata, a Japanese professor of international relations, became United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees a year ago. It was a baptism of fire
 -her first task in the aftermath of the Gulf war was to organise protection
for Iraqi citizens, in their own country, from their own rulers.
Born into the top drawer of Japanese society, she is well connected both at
home - she is a friend of the Empress - and abroad. Her father and
grandfather were diplomats. She was educated partly in the US. Her husband,
Shijuro, was deputy governor of the Bank of Japan and of the Japan
Development Bank and has just been appointed one of the first non-British
directors of Barclays. Their son makes avant-garde videos and their daughter
is a banker.
I asked Mrs Ogata whether she felt she had got to grips with the job.
'Yes, I think I have. But it's been a very difficult year because the
refugee problem's kind of burst out all over.'
She arrived at the agency's headquarters in Geneva with the reputation of
possessing a formidable intellect, a strict sense of obligation, determined
self-effacement and a complete lack of political guile. It sounds an
intimidating combination. Yet even during our short encounter her warmth and
gentle humour floated to the surface.
Her staff adore her. They like the way, when she is in Geneva, she eats in
the cafeteria and encourages them to chat. They are impressed by her energy
in the field, her attention to the smallest detail, her accurate memory, her
stamina, her easy way with people.
During her visit to the Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand she took the
trouble to reassure families who were worried about being parted from their
pet dogs during repatriation. Mrs Ogata sympathised: she has a dog herself,
a Yorkshire terrier called Christopher, which she has had to leave behind in
Tokyo.
'I travel, I go into the field because I have to get a sense of reality of
what the needs are,' she told me. 'I personally have to have that sense of
reality.'
Was this a job you wanted? 'I was pleased to get it but I never wanted it. I
thought after I got it about all the things I have done in the past and how
I could bring them together. That I did think. But I never wanted the job.'
What did you want to do?
'I'm a very practical person, and really I meet challenges as they come.'
So you are not a long-term career planner? 'No, I've never planned
anything.'
I asked her whether her previous work on human rights for the UN had given
her a strong sense of engagement, and whether the fact that she is a Roman
Catholic was relevant.
'Maybe, yes. I think there is a Catholicness, a Japaneseness, there's a
womanness, the fact that I am somebody who has lived through a big war, and
a defeat. These are all big personal experiences. And my involvement in the
UN with human rights . . . All these things come together. I cannot say any
one is dominant.'
Before your election your friends said it would be good for the UN to have a
Japanese and a woman. Do you agree now?
'Yes, I agree with that.'
What reasons would you give?
'In the first case, Japan has done a lot financially in contributing but
somehow there has not been a Japanese person as much in the forefront as
there should have been. This brings Japan much closer to international
co-operation; it also brings the Japanese people into it.' Her appointment
has encouraged a big increase in private donations for refugees from
Japanese business and other groups.
What about your being a woman? Does a woman bring something different to an
organisation?
'You'd better ask my colleagues. I bring myself. I don't know if a woman
necessarily brings something. I never thought of it that way.'
But for the public to see a woman at the head of a humanitarian agency might
make some sort of good connections?
'Maybe they think women are a bit more humanitarian.'
As mothers?
'Motherhood, compassion, all those things.'
What about male politicking in large organisations? Is a woman able to cut
through a lot of that?
'I'm a pretty organised person and I like to run meetings in a rather
structured way. Whether that is a manly way or a womanly way, I don't know.'
Mrs Ogata hates talking about herself but was too courteous to say so. She
was dressed in a smart tweed suit with several strands of little pearls
around her neck. Although I had been told she scarcely ever had time to go
to a hairdresser,, her grey hair was perfectly waved. She was quite
unruffled.
I asked her whether she had been able to bring a fresh analysis to bear on
the refugee problem.
'I don't know whether I would claim that much. But we must be aware that
there is a wide range of migratory movements. Refugees are just one of them.
There is immigration, foreign workers, there are all sorts of reasons why
people are moving. To understand the significance or the danger of what we
are facing we have to know the whole range. We should also come up with much
more diverse answers.'
Was she was worried by resurgent racism in Europe?
'Right now most of the people who come to Europe come as asylum-seekers when
their need is not necessarily asylum but getting jobs. We should clarify,
otherwise the institution of asylum itself is affected and undermined.
People are now talking about 'true refugees' and 'false refugees'. This is a
very wrong way of dividing them.'
You mean even the terminology can be damaging?
'The terminology is very, very damaging. There are refugees and there are
other migrants. So long as they are all lumped together as refugees we can't
get anywhere.'
She is worried that a less liberal Europe, including Britain, could
undermine one of her agency's strongest supports. She pointed out that
Europe and North America still harboured only about 12 per cent of the
world's refugees. Most of the burden was carried by developing countries.
'In that sense they are doing a wonderful job when they are poor
themselves.'
Heads of UN agencies are traditionally reluctant to point the finger. Are
you prepared to take a higher profile?
'Well, I think I have taken some clear stands from time to time, yes.' (She
has called for emergency aid for Albania and this week she reprimanded the
US for sending back Haitian boat people.) 'But just pontificating is not
what we should be doing. If we are going to criticise then we will have at
the same time to offer some kind of help.'
Do you find the UN inefficiently bureaucratic? 'Oh, it depends. But it
doesn't affect my work. That is not a problem.'
Is your agency free of it?
'No, I think there are some bureaucratic aspects to my agency, too, in the
decision-making procedures. Clearing a position takes a lot of time. But I
make sure that it's not for bureaucratic reasons that we do not act when we
have to act. In emergencies we are pretty good.'
We have heard a lot about a new world order. Has your agency benefited from
this new reinforcement of the UN ideal?
'I think we have benefited in that a lot of work has come to us, even in
Yugoslavia where there are half a million internally displaced people - in a
European country.
'The international community expects the UN to do much more. The big wars
have probably gone but there are going to be a lot of internal wars and
unrest in which the UN is expected to carry out peacemaking, peace-keeping
and humanitarian work.'
So even if the situation is grim in many countries, the impetus behind the
UN may be quite high?
'Quite high, yes. It is grim, but there are also some good parts. With the
Cold War ending, many conflicts are entering into the solution phase, like
Cambodia or Angola, South Africa, Afghanistan.
'Wherever there is peace, those who fled the conflict are ready to go back.
So we are expected to play a very large role in repatriation.' (The agency
is projecting that 3m people will be voluntarily repatriated this year
alone.) 'I think in '92 and '93 there will be a concentration of
repatriations of a kind we have never had before.'
My half-hour was up. I remembered being told that Sadako Ogata, though 64
now and not much more than 5 ft tall, is a good tennis player. One last
question, I said. How is the tennis?
'I play on weekends whenever I can. This job is a very - shall I say - hard
job and you have to keep up your physical stamina. So I try to maintain
athletic interests. Also,' she smiled sweetly, 'I like tennis.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Hawks and Handsaws: Budget reaction latest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE A trawlerman harvesting mackerel, I hauled in a wriggling catch of
pre-post-Budget quotes this week. The UK Budget is still 4 1/2 weeks away.
But to stay ahead of the news I deem it imperative to strike hard and strike
early. In the age of information, only those journalists who get ahead of
the news, who anticipate its twists and turns with high-class speculation,
stand a chance of elevating themselves above the slavering pack.
So I rang various celebrities to get their Budget reactions in the hope of
repeating last year's coup. Last year's Budget was on March 19. Yet on March
9, Hawks &amp; Handsaws quoted Labour leader Neil Kinnock as follows: 'The
decision to . . . boost VAT was particularly sensitive, thoughtful and
statesmanlike.'
As I recollect, only Hawks &amp; Handsaws predicted last year's swingeing
increase in VAT. But enough of dusty triumphs. Here are this year's
pre-post-Budget quotes:
Prime minister John Major: 'Thank you very much for ringing me on the
telephone and asking me my opinion. Above all, this was a Budget of prudence
and caution. There are signs, as you know, that Finland and the Maldives, to
name just two, are emerging from recession, and from that we can take cheer.
But it would not have been appropriate at this particular juncture to pump
up the volume in the UK economy. That is why we raised most categories of
indirect taxation yet left income tax alone. As a country we cannot spend
what we have not earned. That is what Helmut tells me, and I repose the
utmost confidence in his particular views. Thank you for telephoning me.'
Neil Kinnock: 'I have to say that I found this a statesmanlike Budget,
thoughtful and well-crafted, caring and finely-tuned, in short, a carbon
copy of the Budget we would have presented if the Tories hadn't run scared
and refused to face the country at the ballot box, stand up and be counted,
13 wasted years of Tory mis-rule and mis-management, squandering Britain's
assets, if, as I say, the Tories had had the guts to call an early election
then a Budget like this, caring and well-crafted, is very much the Budget
that a Labour government led by me would have been proud to present.'
Wing Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats: 'Nine out of
ten. A compassionate, caring Budget. The fact that the Tories have stolen
the Liberal Democrats' clothes is not something I wish to comment on.'
Environment secretary Michael Heseltine: 'This was not the right Budget. I
admire John Major personally, but he is like a cricket captain who takes to
the field with insufficient bowlers, insufficient batting strength, no
wicket-keeper, six silly mid-ons and a vague hope that rain will stop play
before tea-time. Did you get that, Michael, or shall I read it to you
again?'
Transport secretary Malcolm Rifkind: 'Go away] Go away]]'
Opposition Trade spokesman Gordon Brown: 'What a snivelling Budget. We are
back where we started at the onset of the Tory Terror 13 years ago. But the
tumbrels are greased, the guillotine hovers sharp. Away with these disgraced
tyrants and their lip-sync charters.'
As you can imagine, talking to politicians soon gets fatiguing. So I turned,
once again, to the sharp end of British novel-writing for some
red-corpuscled quotes:
Ian McEwan: 'Did you see Norman Lamont's speech? Were you watching when he
closed his eyes and breathed deeply, as though inhaling a fragrance. Then he
said in a reasonable way: 'Let me re-order the facts.''
Nicholas Mosley: 'We do not want to be made better. We want to become worse,
to make an end of it.'
Nigel Williams, author of The Wimbledon Poisoner: 'Who expected happiness?
The people with yachts and penthouses and as much sex as they want and
shares and private beaches and planes constantly at their disposal and
suntans and fantastic digestions are not, most of them, happy. Oh no.
Happiness is a more complex emotion than that.'
Gordon Burn, author of Alma Cogan: 'Reality has been digitised and broken
down into megabits or bongobytes, then replayed as a kind of endless
fidgeting or fluttering on the periphery of experience, at the edge of
vision. Motes dancing on the air. That's what I see. That's what I seem to
be constantly seeing.'
Pete Davies, author of Dollarville: 'This ain't no way to run a railroad.'
Helen Simpson, author of Four Bare Legs In a Bed: 'If you ask me, John Major
carries a lightbulb round in his pocket to illuminate whichever room he is
visiting for more than a few minutes.'
Martin Amis's executive secretary: 'Hi there. Martin's tied up in conference
but he'll fax you tonight. He knows you're time-urgent.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Heaven and Hell: The disgraced soldier who was jailed for
doing his duty - Edwina Currie, MP, recalls a sobering night in the French
countryside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWINA CURRIE, MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE SAT, my friends and I, around a white table in the soft, warm French
evening on a terrace overlooking a field and a forest. Crickets sang lustily
in the hedge and a lizard scuttled to rest under a stone.
The cheeseboard sat on the table, creamy Brie oozing, the milk-white round
of chevre reflecting the ghostly glow of the rising moon. We were full of
food and a little drunk, even as Mike brought a tarte aux poires and
Armagnac and port to the table. Laughing: 'Oh no, I really couldn't manage
any more' and 'lt's a good job we don't have far to go   . can you imagine
driving home in this state in England?'
Then, I said to them: 'Tell me your ideas on Heaven and Hell. Is this
Heaven? Sitting here, with friends, escaping from the realities of home and
work? If so, what would Hell be - going back?'
Mike lives six months in France, six months in Wiltshire. Very British, he
'retired' from business at the age of 45 more than 20 years ago. He is
tanned, moustachioed, fit, young-looking. He lives alone and fills his time
by pottering around and doing-up the ruined mill on his land, digging drains
and laying floors, and arguing with the local artisans. He loves cooking and
regarded our presence as an opportunity, not a chore, serving up a whole
salmon and trying out a new sauce with comments like 'piquant' and 'too
much?'
'This is as close to Heaven as I've ever been,' he said, leaning back, hands
behind head. 'All it lacks is someone sympa to share it.' He grinned
roguishly at Marjorie, the only unaccompanied woman in the group. Her
husband had been forced to return to his hot, sticky office in London. She
tried out a rakish smile, hiccuped slightly and dropped her eyes to the
fruit bowl, blushing.
An uncomfortable silence. Mike's two broken marriages and a life of
solitude, even in this lovely place, did not seem a recipe for Heaven to me.
And eyeing other men's wives was a hiding to nothing; when did adultery end
in happiness for all concerned?
I turned to Alain, the young local builder. The French abandon their
dilapidated old farmhouses, built of solid creamy limestone with oak beams
sprouting from every angle, in favour of modern little boxes near town with
piped water and television aerials. The English cannot believe their luck in
finding so much gorgeous stuff within easy driving of the ports, going for a
song. Nothing had made Alain happier than the day the Channel tunnel broke
through. So, he improves his English and his wife grows fat.
'I have my idea about Hell,' he mused. 'There, I would not be able to do any
sport. There would be no football, no cycles, no swimming, no-one to play
squash, no boules, no - nothing. And I would be in pain, tied down, not able
to move my arms and legs.' And he did so, energetically, knocking a glass of
wine off the table. The red stain spread on the bleached stone in an ugly
puddle. It seemed, in our alcoholic fug, incredibly funny.
He is young and fit - now. The way he goes, heaving planks and lugging
stone, will destroy his back eventually. His Hell is coming, built into his
life-style as he gets older.
For me, Heaven is a place where all the people I have ever loved are
gathered, all as young and handsome and beautiful as when first we knew each
other. My husband has rather more of his hair. My dark-haired, leggy older
daughter, now nearly 17 and happy to back-pack around the Continent, casual
about a Euro-passport and the single currency, is again four years old:
huge, brown eyes, fair hair curling around small ears, in the garden where
we used to live. Old enough to say funny, sweet things, small enough to be
carted off when naughty. Now, she is bigger than me and still growing: I'm
the shortest in the family.
My younger daughter is a baby, chubby and bald and impossible. It was not
until nine months old that she smiled, and then sunshine came into every
room. Now, she is in America with cousins and awaits her GCSE results. We
may never spend the summer all together again, just the four of us. The
babies are gone forever.
'I should have thought,' suggested Mike, looking at me sideways, 'that, with
your history, Hell would be to be disgraced.' Disgrace? Humiliation? No, you
can live through that, especially if you believe your detractors are wrong.
Put it behind you and carry on. 'What do you mean?' I asked. 'I was
disgraced once,' he said. 'I've never told anyone before; and that was Hell
on earth for me.' We settled down to listen.
'I had been a very young second lieutenant as the (Second World) war
finished and volunteered to continue in service. I found myself in the wake
of Mountbatten, in northern India, as he and (his wife) Edwina (your
namesake) and (British prime minister Clement) Attlee prepared to hand over
independence. There was trouble - a lot of it - but the British government
was not prepared to do more than offer to keep control. The Labourites
didn't care, see, they wanted out.
'I was sent with a sergeant and six or seven privates up to one area where
there had been massacres - Moslems slaughtering Hindus, trying to get them
to leave. Mostly, we got to the villages a day or two after the events and
could do no more than help with the disposal of bodies and make reports. It
was a sickening business.
'Then we had advance warning. I was ordered with my troop to one larger
stockaded village. Hundreds of Moslems, armed to the teeth, were sitting
encircling the village as night fell, just like vultures, only white: you
could see their clothes in the dark out there, hear their muttering all
night.
'The place was crowded with refugees: women, kids everywhere. God, was I
scared - I was only about 21. I posted a man to each corner of the stockade
and gave them five live rounds each. As dawn came, the whole ghastly host
started to charge, waving knives and screaming for blood. And they got it
from us, as we opened fire. It worked - the moment men fell, they turned
tail and were off. We were able to get out in one piece.'
We cheered. 'Well done] What was wrong with that?' But Mike was far away. 'I
was court-martialled - charged with manslaughter. Not orders, see; Jinnah (a
Moslem politician who became Pakistan's first governor-general) and the
others didn't like it. Found guilty, imprisoned two years. Drummed out.
Disgraced.' He reached for his brandy and drained it at a gulp. Tears were
running down his face. Hell was sitting right there among us.
It was time to leave; subdued, we said our farewells. Mike continued to sit,
alone on the terrace, refilling his glass.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: A royal hunch comes off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two-hour BBC programme documenting a year in the life of the Queen is
the latest item in a public relations campaign which has been brilliantly
conducted throughout the 40-year reign of Elizabeth II. Though Elizabeth R
has none of the overt obsequiousness which has marred some royal programmes
in recent years, it seems clear nevertheless that the picture it conveys is
one of which the Queen thoroughly approves. Why should she not? It shows her
as dedicated, hard working, devoted to her family, and occasionally funny.
Confirming what the Crawfie types have always said, she seems to be most
animated when dealing with dogs and horses.
No British institution has exploited television more effectively than the
royal family, though 'campaign' and 'exploit' may over-state: this success
seems to have come from hunch and instinct rather than the expensive sort of
adman's operation undertaken by political parties. In 1953 Winston Churchill
and the Cabinet recommended excluding television cameras from the
coronation, but the young Princess Elizabeth insisted that the cameras, and
thus the viewing public, be allowed right into the abbey. Thanks to her
shrewd move the coronation was the first great national occasion when
television attracted a bigger audience than radio.
In the following 39 years relations between Fleet Street and Buckingham
Palace have ranged from bad to dreadful but, thanks partly to television's
need to negotiate access for its equipment, the relationship with television
has been, from the crown's point of view, excellent.
Of course a law of diminishing returns applies here as anywhere: no
subsequent programme can match the novelty value of Richard Cawston's
memorable 1969 documentary Royal Family which first took us behind the
scenes of Royalty Ltd. However, this week's programme, made by Edward
Mirzoeff, is not an attempt to repeat that. Apart from a holiday scene
showing the Queen taking her grandchildren pony riding it concentrates
almost entirely on the activities of the sovereign herself, and thus shifts
the focus of media attention from the troublesome younger members of the
family back to the dutiful head of state.
We see her with politicians, at a breathtakingly grand banquet for Lech
Walesa in Windsor Castle, paying visits to the US and Africa, dishing out
gongs, and teasing Edward Heath with the remark that he could be allowed to
go to Baghdad because he was now expendable. We see the Queen run for the
first time (to catch the finish of a horse race on which she wins Pounds 16)
and we see her opening a little selection of the 200 or 300 letters she
receives daily, though typically no one explains how the lucky few are
chosen.
However gratifying for royalists, these little revelations are as nothing
compared to the major insight which this programme permits. It finally
proves what we have so long suspected: that the British monarchy has gone
from strength to strength in the second half of the 20th century because,
instead of being traditionally 'aristocratic' in its outlook and attitudes,
it is profoundly middle class. Watching this sturdy, bustling woman,
switching efficiently from glad rags to Barbour and headscarf, countless
viewers will have wondered 'Who does she remind me of?' Eventually the
answer will have dawned: Auntie Betty, bulwark of the WI and the church
flower committee.

IF YOU are looking for Anglo-French collaboration in the theatre, you could
hardly get a better title than this - an adaptation of George Orwell's first
published book. The cooperation goes deep. Down and Out had its British
premiere at the Salisbury Playhouse this week. It has already been shown in
France at a theatre called l'Abbatoir in Chalon-sur-Saone. The cast is
British, but British bilingual. The same players do it largely in French
when they cross the channel; the performance in Salisbury is mainly in
English. The bulk of the financial support, one is told, comes from France.
Any reservations are more about the play than the principle, which is to be
applauded. Orwell's Down and Out is very much a personal book, a mixture of
description, anecdote and social comment. It does not easily lend itself to
sustained drama. Still, Nigel Gearing, the writer in residence at Paines
Plough, the touring company responsible, has had a commendable shot at
adapting it to the stage.
The first impression is one of surprise at the size of the cast. At times,
there are up to 40 people among the down-and- outs. That is a very large
number for a regional theatre and even nowadays for the West End. Presumably
the intention is to show the scale of the social problem.
On the other hand, having so many people tends to limit the focus on
individuals. The exception is Orwell himself or, to give him his real name,
Eric Blair. The acting surprise is how remarkably like Blair the actor, Andy
McEwan, looks. All the nervous tension that one would expect, down to the
continuous smoking of cheap cigarettes, is thrown into the part. This is a
riveting performance.
Gearing, however, has made two major departures from the original text. In
the book one of the reasons why Orwell finds it so difficult to get a
down-and-out job in Paris is that he insists on being accompanied by a
Russian called Boris. Boris is fat, lame and sounds generally off-putting.
Yet in the stage version, where he is played by Jonathan Burn, Boris looks
eminently employable, even as a head-waiter at the Ritz. Some of the
poignancy of Orwell's personal odyssey - the sense of genuine despair - has
been lost as a result of this change. Nothing really disgusting happens,
which is not the case when the story is read in Orwell's prose.
The other change is to introduce the girl Kathleen, a rich Hampstead
socialist, for whom Orwell partially falls and she for him, though he keeps
walking out on her. One can see the point of this: it demonstrates that
Orwell looks down on conventional socialism at least as much as he does on
conventional capitalism. Yet the dialogue between them never really gets
going.
The London scenes, specialising in such places as Salvation Army hostels,
struck me as better than those in the kitchens of Paris restaurants, perhaps
because this is Orwell talking to Englishmen and possibly because the cast
are more at home in English parts. Directed by Anna Furse, the show stays at
Salisbury till February 15 and will then tour. It will open at the Riverside
Studios in Hammersmith, which seem admirably suited for it, on March 12.

<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND poet Lauris Edmond is in the habit of rocking back on her
sturdy, high-heeled shoes and chuckling a lot. It is one of the endearing
ways she has of drawing us into her intimate circle; of making us honorary
citizens of her country, a place that she described on several occasions in
the course of an hour-long reading at the Voice Box as 'the smallest and
farthest away place in the world.' Small places are homely. People talk to
each other.
Lauris Edmond came late to poetry. She had lived one whole life - as wife
and mother - before the muse began to crave some attention, too. That was in
the middle 1970s. Now, nine books later, and having won the Commonwealth
Poetry Prize in 1985, she is one of New Zealand's most distinctive female
voices and, at nearly 70 years old, something of a dignified elder
stateswoman of the art.
And that is how she seems: assured, approachable, ready to share with us
what she has found. And, for greater ease of intellectual digestion, she
divided the poems that she read that evening into groups: poems that sounded
'authentically New Zealand'; love poems; poems about relationships and so
forth. And at the end of each little section, she would stop and ask us if
we wanted to ask her something - anything, within reason. 'I'd very much
like a dialogue,' she said. 'Poems are like plays. They're created in part
by an audience.' The questions, when they came, were respectful and
predictable: 'Do you ever change your poems after you've written them?'
Reply: 'It depends . . . I like poems that appear straight off. They seem to
go on knowing what they always meant.' And the subject matter of these poems
look the very spit of their mother: they are accessible, picturesque, gently
humorous and often written more in celebration than despair - which is
unusual in a 20th-century poet.
Perhaps you can do new things with a young literature.
Last week, David Constantine was reading from his Selected Poems in the
murky, low-ceilinged basement of Islington's Market Tavern, an invitee of
the Blue Nose Poets - this last fact confirmed, with teasing obliquity, by
the two huge posters of clowns with red noses that were pinned to the walls.
And how appropriately Dantesque a venue it seemed to be] For Constantine's
poetry deals in the oddities of life - the tale of an 18th-century hermit
who is hired to embellish some grandee's grotto; the story of an old man who
launches himself off a roof, head stuffed full of the dream of Icarus; and
another one based on a terrible experience in the life of 'mad' John Clare,
that peasant poet who ate grass for want of better and believed himself to
have no fewer than two wives. These are odd, extravagant, fantastical poems,
pieced together from fragments of learning, frequently bloody, messy, and
positively nasty in their details.
But before he begins, Constantine, a short man with a delicate frame, sits
imp-like on a low stool, leafing backwards and forwards through his book,
wondering, and then wondering a little more, what to disturb us with this
evening. Should he plunge in at the deep or the shallow end first? Alas,
it's all the same depth. He never loses that questing, troubled look - the
whites of his eyes often glare, as if suddenly caught in our headlights. He
is inclined to scratch at his scalp as an aid to rumination. And then, at
last, he seems to hit upon a solution, telling us, 'The coherence of one
person's obsessions will structure it . . .'
Yet the voice and its Salford music are mild-mannered enough, and quite as
unthreatening as the rest of the candle-lit faces in that roomful of
practising poets. And he reads every one of his alarming words as if it was
the simplest in the language. The tempest has clearly blown itself out on
the page, leaving Constantine free to feel touchingly scared (as he tells
us, before he bolts out of the door) of the London Underground he might have
to re-enter, if he is to catch his late train back to Oxford. 'I find it
very creepy,' he confides.
Perhaps he should hit back at all those murderous, leering faces with a poem
or two.
David Constantine's Selected Poems and Lauris Edmond's New and Selected
Poems are published by Bloodaxe Books.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: The KGB and all that - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GORBACHEV and Yeltsin have done all they can, but in the popular mind Russia
is still the land of revolution. Saturday's Classic Serial on Radio 4 is
Conrad's Under Western Eyes, in which a St. Petersburg student, Razumov
(Patrick Brennan) is unwillingly involved in politics to help his friend
Haldin (Neil Roberts), who reckons he killed the President with his
anarchist bomb. The adaptation by Brian Miller, rather closely condensed,
moves between St. Petersburg and Geneva, where Haldin's sister is learning
English. The revolution in question is not the 1917 job, however, only a
less successful one in 1911, though Russian security seems as strict as it
is - or was - in our own time. Tonight will see the conclusion. Alison
Hindell directed.
The real KGB has been at work on Radio 5 daily from Monday to Friday, though
this is only in a serial for young listeners, Nothing Ever Happens Here by
Bill Gilham. In this, Joey, a 10-year-old American boy believes England to
be a dull place before he has seen more of it than Heathrow. Before they
have left the airport, his father, who is working on Star Wars, is kidnapped
with his mother, and he himself is held as a hostage. He makes various
brave, unsuccessful, attempts to get free, but in the end the enemy is
defeated. As a sentimental touch, the agent who has been in charge of him
escapes and sends him a thank-you card from Moscow.
I probably wouldn't have listened to all of this if Kerry Shale hadn't been
reading it. Shale, the American actor, is cunning with voices, and in this
serial he gives us American, broken English, RP, cockney and a notably
effective police-constable sound that might have come from The Bill on
television.
More seriously, he took part in Saturday's Kaleidoscope on Radio 4, which
was about teaching actors how to speak. Here he gave Hamlet's talk to the
Players, 'Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue', in a variety of accents, from standard English to
New York Yiddish. These decorated the programme, which, presented by Paul
Allen, more earnestly concerned the matter that Shaw treated in Pygmalion,
the effect of proper speech on one's life. We heard Patsy Rodenburg, Head of
Voice at the Royal National, and Cicely Berry, who does a similar job at the
RSC, and we heard Saskia Reeves of the National being polished by Andrew
Wade. The most memorable observation of the programme, I thought, was Miss
Rodenburg's demand, 'Never tell anyone that their accent is inferior.'
Shaw's Professor Higgins might not have agreed.
Wings and Landings may suggest flying, but these are also features of prison
architecture, and this is a sequence of six talks (Mondays on Radio 4) by
John Williams, who has served nine sentences in gaol, most recently doing 12
years for armed robbery. Lately he kept a journal of his daily life (a
privilege never granted to Oscar Wilde) and he makes prison sound rather
friendly, with a television lounge, the chance of carpets and curtains in
the cell, a budgie, and freedom to take tea and cigarettes with mates in
their cells. Drugs too if you had them, and that did not seem so hard. He
makes himself sound friendly, too - admittedly gay, 'what I've always found
most attractive about prison, male bodies' are for ever around.
There was little talk about the social effect of his or his
fellow-prisoners' deeds. One of his friends had killed an old lady, but was
still his friend. When television news showed a mass shooting in a village
one prisoner was avid to watch it. A request for a calendar arose from
desire for the 4-year-old girl in one of its pictures. It is easy to say
that one doesn't know how one would react to years inside; yet many of my
contemporaries were imprisoned for years by Germans, Italians or Japanese
and still seem normal. Even Terry Waite does. Produced by Chris Paling, four
more programmes are to follow the two I've heard, and one must hope that
some kind of conclusion will be reached.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: The price of Venice is eternal vigilance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY WOULD be always with us, or so we thought. But in 1966 the great
floods that devasted Florence and Venice alerted the civilised world to so
much that, for too long, it had taken too much for granted. Out of the
disaster the foreign and restoration committees, French, German, American
and the rest, besides the British, were born and in time acquired a more
particular focus.
By the end of the 1960s, when the immediate first-aid had been achieved, the
underlying and long-term precariousness of the position of Venice was
realised and, in 1971, on the initiative of Sir Ashley and Lady Clark, the
British Venice in Peril Fund established.
Since then much has been done, much changed - and much remains the same.
Venice is no longer sinking, since water for the city and hinterland no
longer comes from the artesian wells beneath the lagoon; the work on the
barriers across the entrance to the lagoon goes on, so that soon the city
will be safe from acqua alta coming in from the Adriatic; and the industrial
pollution of the atmosphere at last begins to moderate. But still the
churches and palazzi crumble and decay, and always there is too much to be
done.
The international intervention and achievement have been remarkable, not
least in the competitive example and encouragement offered to the Italians
themselves who, once roused to the shared task of preserving and restoring
their unique treasures, have performed the lion's share. But still the
political scandals and disputes continue, with the Italian money committed
often as hard to grasp as the mist itself that rolls in across the water.
Local political ambitions too - the theme-park mentality and vaulting
ambition of such grandees as Gianni de Micheles, for example - must be
watched and scotched. The price of Venice is eternal vigilance.
All this work, of the first 20 years at least, up to 1986, and setting the
British involvement in the context of the national and international effort,
is now documented in a fascinating exhibition that has ben touring the
world. It is now at the Royal College of Art, until February 15, complete
with an excellent catalogue, Venice Restored, Pounds 25, most beautifully
published by Electa. Citalia, the Italian tourist firm, has just raised
Pounds 9000 for the Fund. Please go and see the show, to read, admire,
worry, and above all to contribute in however small a way.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: A handsome 'Iguana' casts its symbolic spell - The new
production at the National
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IGUANA is a large tropical American lizard which, when captured, is
tethered by a long rope so that it has the illusion of freedom, but can
never quite escape unless someone releases it. I think I caught a glimpse of
a real live iguana somewhere below the boards at the Lyttelton on Thursday -
from the stalls it is hard to be certain - but no matter: the symbolism is
quite enough.
The Night of the Iguana was Tennessee Williams's last successful play. First
performed in New York in 1961, when it opened in London in 1965 it also
struck me as perhaps his best. It looks even better in Richard Eyre's
marvellous new production at the National.
Here one must be careful. When it pulls out all the stops, the NT can make
almost anything look good, and many are the people who have allowed the
technical brilliance of the production to inflate their view of the play.
That does not apply to Iguana, which is a piece entirely worthy of the NT's
resources.
Although the play has its imperfections - notably characters who wander in,
then disappear - it is superbly theatrical throughout. Iguana deploys the
twin virtues of wit and pathos to the full. Some of it is very funny: a
scene, for example, where a drinks trolley is shoved backwards and forwards
across the stage at accelerating pace, and a limerick which ends: 'Women are
fine, and sheep are divine, But iguanas are - Numero Uno'.
There is, too, a wonderful series of vignettes of a group of very blond,
very fat, totally unrepentant German Nazis staying as tourists at the
none-too-good hotel on the Mexican coast. Inessential to the plot perhaps,
but splendid comic relief.
Ultimately, of course, it is the pathos that counts. The Reverend Shannon,
played by Alfred Molina, is a disbarred priest who is reduced to conducting
parties of women on bus tours through the more exotic parts of the world. In
Mexico he revisits an old flame, Maxine, just widowed, who runs the hotel.
Also arriving in the hotel are a 97-year-old American minor poet,
accompanied by his grand-daughter and portraitist, Hannah.
The dialogue between Shannon and Hannah is at the heart of the play: he
sexually promiscuous and trying to stay off the drink while thinking about
returning to the church; she sexually almost untouched, but wonderfully east
coast educated and preferring an oriental form of tea. The iguana is the
symbol in the background, emphasising the fine line between captivity and
freedom.
The performance by Eileen Atkins is the finest that I ever ever seen from
this actress, which is saying something. Whenever she speaks, and she tends
to speak quietly, she commands the stage totally. In tribute to Williams,
she also has very good lines. Take, for instance, her long account of an
experience with an Australian property developer in Raffles Hotel, Singapore
and afterwards in the Straits of Malacca.
Iguana is worth seeing for that performance alone. It will be a long time
before it is matched. Being the National Theatre at its best, however, there
is much more besides. If she were not playing in a smaller part alongside Ms
Atkins, one would be tempted to give the same praise to Frances Barber as
Maxine. As it is, she excels in what becomes a secondary role.
The set, designed by Bob Crowley, is magnificent. If you want to see
tropical rain convincingly falling on stage, here you are. Even the sound of
the rain is perfect. The production is sponsored by Data General, the
company that supplies the NT with its office automation systems. On all
accounts, see it.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Gardening: The perennial pleasures of spring - Robin Lane
Fox prepares to strike an economic blow for a better garden on a shoestring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE LONG, better weather ought to have caused gardeners' sap to rise: act
now while enthusiasm is fresh and strike an economic blow for a better
garden on a shoestring. Seeds are no longer as cheap as they were and,
admittedly, I sometimes grow them for the hell of it, just to see if I can
make them come up. It is no longer time to postpone the plunge, but the
first seeds to go in are not the most obvious.
It is still too early to be sowing tobacco plants, cosmos daisies and all
the mainstays of summer bedding which grow quickly and will be too far
advanced if started before March. Perennial flowers are another matter.
Among these early sowers, I am casting my net more widely and am being
prompt with less-familiar perennials which ought to flower from July
onwards. Geraniums are obvious candidates, especially now that so many
colours have been selected and bred for seed-raising: even for amateurs,
cuttings are almost a matter of the past.
I leave most of the geraniums to others, but carnations are another matter.
Not long ago, I was editing Vita Sackville-West's old gardening columns when
I was carried away by her description of the Chabaud strain of carnation.
Their colours, she felt, had the quality of a Van Gogh painting - I remember
that she described some of them as bistre. On the spur of a good read, I
tried to grow my own, but started too late. From a sowing in mid-March, I
had none of her fancies, no bistred beauties or blooms of old blood-red. The
wretched plants never flowered at all.
Once bitten, never shy: you know the gardening instinct. So, this year I am
starting Chabaud carnations from seed in the first week of February.
Somewhere in Britain, people must still grow them happily because garden
centres stock them on open shelves in their standard ranges of seed from
Suttons or Thompson and Morgan. The seed will germinate in the usual
amateur's pot, filled with a standard seed compost and covered with a tight
stretch of cling-film to retain the heat and sweat.
Chabaud carnations like heat in order to spring into growth. They will
germinate in a warm cupboard, below the spare bath towels, if you remember
to retrieve them and roll back the cling-film at the first signs of emergent
shoots.
My other early sowings will owe much to the tremendous seed list of Chiltern
Seeds in Cumbria, north-west England. Seeds and catalogues are available by
'phone and credit card round the clock on 0229-581-137. This year's
catalogue is the company's 17th and is bigger than ever. Early sowers can
have a field day in it, but I would direct you to three of my successes from
1991: two whites and a blue which is now available in a new, exciting form.
If you sow them at once, they will flower later this summer and ought to
last for several years.
The two whites are valerian and Gaura Lindheimeri. White valerian is a
floppy plant but it is wonderfully elegant against its green-grey stems.
Most seedsmen sell only mixtures in which a few whites are confused with the
dull pink forms, but Chiltern Seeds has joined the small list of segregating
stockists (of which Butchers of Shirley, near Croydon, south London, is
another). The Snowcloud variety is a truly white valerian which is willing
to flower in its first season if sown within the next week or so. In good
soil, it might even reach 4 ft.
Here, it would equal the Gaura, my white companion. At home, these flowers
are wild in Texas, but anyone can raise them by the dozen from a seed
packet, even if they neglect them as badly as I sometimes have after sowing.
They give you masses of white flowers like a willow herb which is flushed
with a touch of deep pink, and they appear at a late season and height which
borders need badly.
Successes are good for morale and, in 1991, my happiest successes were with
Chiltern Seeds' several varieties of balloon flower. Their formal name is
Platycodon, and I first learnt to love them in botanical gardens. Their
huge, balloon-buds ask to be popped open like large, angular campanulas.
They have an awkward habit of disappearing below ground after flowering in
August and appearing again rather late in spring. Nonetheless, they are
marvellous performers in open soil.
All the forms are good, but this year we have a new F1 hybrid which sounds
sensational. It is said to flower in its first year if sown early and
reaches only about 6 in - perfect for pots. It will grow and improve in
later years, surviving the winter so long as you do not dig it up by mistake
when dormant. Anyone can raise it from seed as easily as dreary old
marigolds.
Its name is Sentimental Blue, which sounds wonderfully soft-hearted. Dozens
of plants will come up from a packet at only Pounds 1.35: nurseries would
charge you Pounds 1.80 for a single plant. Plan for your own blue balloon
show and catch the sentimental mood by sowing as soon as you can.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Gardening: In praise of the common camellia - The
development of a popular flowering shrub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE great acid-soil gardens of Britain, camellias usually are grown side
by side with rhododendrons, and these two families of flowering shrubs often
are spoken of together; but their differences are at least as notable as
their similarities. Both share a dislike for alkaline soils (which, in
Britain, means for limestone and chalk).
There are many more wild species of rhododendron than of camellia and a
great many of the rhododendrons have been brought into cultivation, which
means there is a much greater range of types, flower colours and shapes, and
foliage types from which to choose. From a practical point of view, only
five camellia species and their hybrids are available at all readily, and
their flower colours range from white and palest pink to deep crimson, with
various combinations of these.
Yellow exists in the family and might one day be available to gardeners,
perhaps maybe with intermediate colours such as orange and apricot, but this
still seems a long way off.
Camellias tolerate drought much better than most rhododendrons, which can
suffer severely in dry summers when camellias, growing side by side with
them, continue to look green and content. Their excellent foliage is one of
their best qualities.
By far the most common camellias in Britain are descended directly from C.
japonica and hybrids between it and C. saluenensis; these common camellias
are known collectively as C. williamsii. Japonica was introduced as long ago
as 1739 although its varieties long were grown almost exclusively under
glass (or, at least, with winter protection) as all were believed to be
tender.
The williamsii hybrids have never suffered from this mistake for they have
been made only since the 1930s, and for 20 years after that they were grown
mainly by specialists. But once they became available widely, they soared in
popularity.
One of the first of the williamsii camellias to appear was named Donation
and today, I believe, it has the largest sales of any camellia. All these
hybrids differ from the old japonica varieties in having narrower leaves,
more slender stems and the ability either to drop their faded flowers or to
allow them to be brushed off easily, leaving the bush looking clean and
tidy. A great deal of present-day camellia breeding is centred on this group
of hybrids.
The williamsii varieties have another advantage that is not often mentioned.
They are more tolerant of long days and short nights than the japonicas and
so are likely to flower well even in the more northerly parts of Scotland.
because they continue to produce flower buds even when the nights are very
short and the days very long.
Camellia reticulator has the largest flowers of any species and Captain
Rawes has semi-double flowers which are even more spectacular. But this
wonderful plant is seen much too rarely except in the gardens of
specialists, and is available from only a few nurseries such as Hilliers at
Ampfield, near Romsey, Hampshire; Trewidden Estate, Trewidden Gardens,
Penzance, Cornwall; and James Trehane and Sons, Stapehill Road, Hampreston,
Wimborne, Dorset. The reasons for this scarcity are that it is a little
tender and can occupy a lot of space - up to tree size in the mild Cornish
gardens.
There is also a hybrid between C. reticulator, Captain Rawes and williamsii,
named Leonard Messell. It also has very large, rose-pink flowers and is
fairly hardy. It is certainly easier to buy and can sometimes be picked up
in garden centres. Another species is sasanqua, which has the useful habit
of flowering in October and November. The plant is hardy but its varieties
need to be given a sheltered place or grown in a conservatory (which need
not be heated).
The flowers of the wild plant are pink and white like large, single dog
roses, but there are garden varieties which give a selection of colours from
white to deep rose. All are said to tolerate lime better than other
camellias. This is another species which must be sought from specialist
nurseries, such as Trehane and Trewidden.
An attractive and unusual camellia with a very long flowering season is
Cornish Snow. It is a hybrid between saluenensis and a species named
cuspidata, and it has innumerable small, single white flowers which go on
and on.
Even today, after all the intensive breeding of the past 40 years, there are
still more varieties and a greater range of flower colours and forms among
the japonica varieties than in any other race. But the williamsii varieties
are overhauling them fast as a great range of flower shapes and colours is
produced.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Property: Confusion in the country - The uncertainties
hitting the market for period houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A degree of anarchy has spread across the shires as the owners of period
properties run into a problem: the absence of a single national
country-house market.
Each urban area can have enough property stock and activity to produce, at
the least, a plausible set of comparables. Not so country homes; the only
former vicarage in the village, or its sole Georgian manor, has no direct
equivalent to which the owner, agent or prospective buyer can turn for an
up-to-date market rate. The result is a riot of unrelated asking prices.
Country agents normally get around the problem by making it their business
to know what is available county-wide. Regional knowledge can then be
applied to each sale. Owners can be shown similar properties that have sold
at one price level and failed to sell at another. But, in the aftermath of
the roller-coaster price pattern of the past few years, that flow of
information has been disrupted. News of sales activity has been both patchy
and uncertain.
Country home-owners have been staying put because of the uncertainties.
Inevitably, therefore, a higher-than-average proportion of country-house
sales has been special cases where owners have had compelling reasons to
move. Price comparisons drawn from those sales do reflect present levels -
but they are not levels in which many other prospective vendors are
interested.
The shelves full of glossy magazines carrying country-house sale
advertisements can no longer be relied upon to give an accurate flavour of
values. Advertised asking prices may represent good, moderate or bad value -
depending on whether the vendor has listened to the sales agent's advice or
the other way around. There is no sure way of telling.
In this period of sales blight, Savills' prime country residential property
index comes into its own. Because notional valuations are made on an
unchanging base of 600 period country properties, the index is not affected
as badly by the lack of actual sales evidence as are price guides based on
sales or mortgage advances.
Taking 1979 as a starting point, and the 100 base for the index, Savills had
recorded a doubling of country-house values by the mid-1980s and a further
doubling between 1985-89. Subsequent reductions have seen the index fall
from a three-year-old peak of 447.6 to 351.4. That is a 21.5 per cent drop
in values nationally - and a reduction of more than 25 per cent in the
notional re-sale value of a country house in the home counties.
Savills recalls that demand for energy-hungry country houses was at a low
ebb in the 1970s but that 'the 1980s was the decade of the country house.' A
mix of rising incomes, easy access to loan finance and new wealth released
by company flotations, plus the 'nostalgia boom' and its associated desire
for country living, 'conspired to create the perfect environment for
country-house sales.'
What of the 1990s? Savills' index, plus clear anecdotal evidence from
country property agencies, suggests a market that is far more cost-conscious
and will remain so in the foreseeable future.
Quality of property is a major element. Savills' Yolande Barnes notes 'a
marked polarisation, with properties that are in very good condition
attracting such interest as there is in the market. Anything that has
anything remotely wrong with it  .. no-one wants to know.'
While a division of the market by size is less easy to prove, it is accepted
as a fact by country agencies. The grand, 'trophy' properties, bought in the
1980s to display what often was new wealth, are fast becoming an
embarrassment to agents. Million-plus country homes became commonplace at
the end of the 1980s; they are a much rarer breed now.
There is a similar return to values based on accommodation, rather than
image, all down the country-house price scales. No-one is trading up. If the
runes for the 1990s are being read correctly, few people will want to trade
up in the foreseeable future, either.
That leaves the higher-priced 'status' houses out on a limb but does not
suggest any long-term lack of buying interest in more modest, family-scale
country properties. Buyers in the 1990s can get the life-style they want,
cheaper and as easily, in a five-bedroom house as in a 10-bedder with stone
lions on the gateposts.

MOTHER RUSSIA by Bernice Rubens Chapmans Pounds 14.99, 443 pages
THE PRECIOUS GIFT by John Bowen Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.95, 188 pages
A DUBIOUS LEGACY by Mary Wesley Bantam Prress Pounds 14.99, 270 pages
FLYING INTO LOVE by D M Thomas Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 261 pages
THE CHANGING rhythms of history mark each of these novels: the colour and
horror of 20th century Russia and America for Rubens and Thomas; the
turnabout in social mores and morals from post-war to contemporary Britain
for Bowen and Wesley. Mother Russia traces the fates of two families, one
aristocratic, the other peasant, from the same Russian village, through war,
revolution, Stalinism and glasnost. In both families, there is the
revolutionary brother and the reactionary one, and their inevitable role
reversals as victim and aggressor; and then the youngest children, Sasha and
Anna, born on the same day in 1900 and suckled together by the peasant
mother, one a poet, the other his muse, who marry across class boundaries
and continue to stand for love against ideology and brutal conviction.
They live in a heightened state of terror yet hysterical hope; separated for
years, they search Russia, by train, on foot, for one another; ending up at
the home of protective brother Ivan, they watch him turn from revolutionary
spirit to KGB torturer. Epic in conception, unflagging in moral energy, the
scope of Bernice Rubens' novel commands only admiration. Old Rubens themes
light up here in a new constellation: the need for faith, the effect of
apocalyptic movements on individuals and families. There is her
tender-rigorous prose; the purring way she enhances her shocks ('the noose
laced his neck', 'the rage comforted and clothed him', 'a ragged regiment of
thugs . . . coagulated by a raving lunatic'); her ability to draw minor
characters - the revolutionary idealist Pavlenkov, losing faith and weeping
for his wife as he is hung, the old Jewish printer Chernov, stumbling into
the hands of Tsarist police while others escape - with whom we shiver, fear,
melt at the knees.
But this is a fatally uneven work. Halfway through, Rubens' grip slackens,
precisely tuned detail gives way to a glib encapsulation of recent history.
Climax follows climax; rape, decapitation, torture, Nazi spying and
shootings occur within a few pages; parallels between families are forced;
the story becomes a history lesson ('There are other causes beside the
revolution. The making of poetry is one of them'). We get schematic writing
instead of surprise, explanation instead of authenticity - and without a
setting which is the very essence of the tale, which feels as deeply and
instantly Russian as Nadine Gordimer's novels are South African or Bashevis
Singer's Polish, Mother Russia ceases to be a serious historical novel and
ends an upmarket blockbuster.
John Bowen's The Precious Gift is a thriller which is that and much more.
Sarah, a young mother in retreat from London, finds the skeleton of a
pregnant woman in her Warwickshire garden. If this was murder, it happened
40 years ago and the police give it a low priority, but Sarah becomes
obsessed with the victim, and in playing detective she unleashes a small
torrent of fear, resentment and panicky concealment in the local village.
As in Bowen's last novel, Fighting Back, sudden rural violence is seamlessly
incorporated into what appears to be a quiet story of English village life.
The mood, crossing social realism and class satire with film noir and a
touch of Arsenic and Old Lace, is all Bowen's own; the language is deadpan,
authoritative, stylish. A psychologist as acute on the frustrated
schoolteacher and vicar's wife of the 1940s as on the 1990s desperate
professional or yuppy housewife, he manages to sketch alliances across half
a century without ever letting characters degenerate into mere types.
Fulfilment, independence, the imaginative versus the actual life, women's
roles and options are his wider themes, sensitively handled and with always
a hint that dark fantasies - any character's wildest dreams - could just tip
over into the reality of murder.
Horror in Mary Wesley's novels is of the comfortable Gothic sort: here a mad
wife causes havoc from the bedroom of a country mansion and an eccentric
cockatoo troubles guests at dinner. A Dubious Legacy is the story of wealthy
Henry, who has inherited house, spouse and bird, and his relationship from
the 1950s to the 1980s with his friends' wives Antonia and Barbara, as they
grow over the decades from innocence to worldliness. Ms Wesley breezes along
with customary grace and nonchalance, sniping maliciously at her characters
while giving them a more or less good time, chuckling in the face of
disaster, smartening up a skimpy plot with comic turns or a spot of torture
for the wretched cockatoo whenever predictability threatens to settle in.
Ms Wesley belongs to the stiff upper lip school of fiction; her chin only
wobbles at the thought of all those weekend extravaganzas and Chelsea
afternoons that peal like bells through her pages. Her hero Henry tries to
recreate his parents' pre-war lifestyle; Ms Wesley seems to me to yearn for
the guileful elegance of Coward or Maugham and to reconstitute set-piece
English marital comedy in a near-contemporary environment: brittle, amusing
but seldom staying in the mind.
Finally, back to international history and DM Thomas's look at Kennedy's
assassination through the dreams and reveries of a nun who has shaken hands
with him, of Lee Harvey Oswald, and of JFK himself. Ten thousand dreams a
night, a Dallas psychologist tells Sister Agnes in Flying Into Love, are
dreamt about Kennedy's murder. Thomas, slicing in and out of a Texas convent
and the triple underpass in Dealy Plaza through which Kennedy's motorcade
dashed to hospital, shunting between 1963 and 1992, tries to create a
meaningful melange of these illusions and fantasies, but the result is a
messy pudding of aimless episodes and overblown dramas. Flying Into Love has
neither narrative power nor a particularised vision; Thomas's skill as a
vivid scene-maker sometimes shines through, but here his energy is wasted in
empty showmanship.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Off The Wall (An Arts Diary): Competing in a cold climate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BBC is hopping into bed with businessmen with increasing frequency these
days. It has yet to tempt anyone with its Proms - the Pounds 5m sponsorship
price tag, and strict controls on the type of client it wants and what it
will permit them to do, has stalled that one - but BBC Wales has found a
buyer for its top arts programme, the Cardiff Singer of the World
Competition.
BP is putting up almost Pounds 300,000 to link itself with the 1993
competition and is also committed for 1995, with an option on 1997. With
Lloyds Bank backing the Young Musician of the Year contest with Pounds 1.3m,
the BBC has now found partners for two of its trio of prestige musical
events.
But if the BBC, under Government prodding, is forced to look towards
business for extra funding, so business is gettingmore hard headed about
sponsorship. Falling profits, mass redundancies, and carping investors have
brought an end to the days when companies joyfully proclaimed their desire
to return something to the community.
Given its current difficulties it is not surprising that BP, which spread
Pounds 1m a year over a mass of good arts causes, is changing tack,
concentrating a frozen budget on fewer but bigger sponsorships, and looking
for links - like the Singer of the World Competition - which guarantee media
coverage and corporate branding.
Unfortunately the first casualty of rationalisation has been another singing
competition, the Aldeburgh based Peter Pears, which, thanks to Pounds 80,000
sponsorship from BP, had enhanced the careers of young singers of lieder and
opera in the mould of Pears. Last year's winner, Anne-Christine Goransson,
was reckoned a great find and there are high expectations for part of her
prize, a Purcell Room concert on March 3.
There may be stronger singing in the Valleys, but Aldeburgh is numbed as it
seeks a new sponsor for its competition in a cold climate.
The recession, and the subsequent fall in land values, has, in theory,
impoverished many owners of great houses and wide acres. When the recession
combines with an unexpected death, theory can become painful fact. This has
happened at Luton Hoo, the magnificent Robert Adam home which was stacked
with treasures by the late Sir Harold Wernher, following the tragic death
last year of his grandson and heir, Nicholas Phillips.
The silence which descended on the property as the family contemplated the
tax bill and business debts is slowly lifting. Intense discussions are
underway with Christie's over what must be sold and what can be saved, with
the family pulled in many directions. There is a desire to save the Wernher
collection, a magnificent, if eclectic, assembly of medieval ivories and
bronzes, tapestries, Chinese and continental porcelain, some good Old
Masters, and the Russian icons and Faberge contributed by Sir Harold's wife
Zia, a niece of the last Czar.
So far only one work of art has been selected for disposal, Constable's view
of Harnham Bridge, Salisbury, which was first on public display at last
year's Constable show at the Tate. Given the state of demand for British
pictures it will probably carry an estimate of under Pounds 2m. It is
doubtful whether this will be enough to see off the family's creditors.
And even if the unthinkable is considered, the disposal of Luton Hoo, there
is no chance of getting a fair price for the property in the current climate
unless the Government, working through the heritage bodies, offers a
negotiated tax deal.
Canary Wharf, London Dockland's most blatant development, was full to
capacity last Thursday: indeed it was turning potential customers away by
the hundred. This is not the Olympia &amp; York office complex, of course, but
Cabot Hall, the arts centre inside the structure, which is proving a roaring
success.
The attraction was jazzman Roy Ayres. An extra attraction was that, like all
events at Cabot Hall, admission was free. This is posing problems for the
arts director, Helen Marriage, who somehow has to balance supply and demand
and the conflicting interests of Canary Wharf's 3,000 office workers - who
think the events are designed for their amusement; the local residents -
 who see them as one tangible benefit to emerge after the years of
construction turmoil; and the visiting fans who have braved the Dockland
Light Railway to get there and are in no mood to shrug and go home quietly.
There have been disappointed customers for dance, classical music, even mime
events. Only contemporary music has failed to fill the 500 seat venue,
although, in contrast, the current contemporary jazz season threatens to
stretch the free admission policy to the limit, especially when the
legendary American guitarist John Scofield plays his only British date there
on March 24. For Scofield there are plans to erect a giant screen in the
gardens to cope with the crush.
O &amp; Y used the arts to stimulate interest in its big New York office
development on the tip of Manhattan and it worked. It seems to be repeating
the trick here. The annual cost, around Pounds 1m a year for over 100
events, is negligible compared with its investment in Canary Wharf, and for
prospective tenants the sight of people excitedly milling around is an
unanticipated tonic.
Few queues meanwhile in the West End where Phantom and Joseph are the only
shows hard of access. Even so, compared with the economic state of the
nation, the theatre did not do at all badly last year. Almost 11m people
took in a West End performance, just 3.7 per cent down on the record 1990.
The most encouraging feature was the build up in audiences during the year.
Attendances were 7 per cent down in the summer but by November the fall was
only 3 per cent and in the month before Christmas they were actually 12 per
cent higher than in 1990. The revival has continued into the New Year.
Of course the fact that over half the theatres open were showing escapist
musicals, an unprecedented proportion, accounts for much of the success. By
the end of the year musicals were doing 7 per cent better box office
business than in 1990 although, because of the flood of new cabaret style
product, the overall audience had fallen from 83 per cent of capacity to 76
per cent. So if you want to take in a show tonight it might not be
impossible to get tickets.
In contrast Broadway is in deep depression. In the second week in January,
with the holiday celebrations over, four shows closed and box office
receipts fell by almost 30 per cent. Like London, New York is looking
towards musicals, especially old musicals, to save the day. Crazy for You, a
reworking of Gershwin's Girl Crazy, has just opened and Guys and Dolls and
Man of La Mancha are about to.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: Ambitious figures - William Packer admires the work of
Sarah Raphael
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE IDEA of the wunderkind is as irresistible as it is to be resisted. How
we long for the young genius lately discovered in his attic to be already
mature and working at full stretch. What allowances we make for our students
when out of college on their own, and how many prizes and generous
sponsorships there are to help them on. Did the rot set set in with David
Hockney and his chums in the 1960s, or was that only the latest setting of
the rule: that not to make it by 30 is not to make it at all? ''Tis
opportune to look back on old times, and contemplate our Forefathers', said
Sir Thomas Browne: '. . . Simplicity flies away, and iniquity comes at long
strides upon us.' Jealousy of the young, the 'oldie' syndrome, is as old as
art.
Take Sarah Raphael, for example, whose latest show of her recent paintings
and drawings fills the upper gallery at Agnew's (43 Old Bond Street, until
March 6) - her second here, and again a conspicuous success. She is now in
her early thirties, but the success that came to her early was no less than
her right.
The simple case is that she is one of the most interesting artists of her
generation, a figurative artist lucky enough to emerge at a moment when the
figurative was again become a legitimate preoccupation, but talented enough
to deserve her luck. Her work is ambitious both in its scale and the
technical and formal problems it takes on. If here certain critical doubts
arise, they are a measure of the seriousness of her engagement, ever pushing
her work into areas of difficulty and uncertainty.
Her large works on paper, with their exaggerated beasts and figures and
their theatrical, almost nightmarish light, tread a very narrow line between
merely mannered and decorative illustration of an essentially literary idea,
and an image of which the justification is truly visual. The space is
flattened, the view as high as a bird's, the composition laid out like a
map. Her figures are at times consciously grotesque, her incidents engaging
and diverting. Will those naughty boys who run in step ever catch their
squirrel? Who is that on the grass by the netting, watching, waiting, hoping
to escape? And where on earth is that strange landscape, described with such
febrile clarity, at once familiar and quite other-worldly?
And yet Miss Raphael gets away with it, convincing us that her other world
of the imagination is known and real enough. She does so in two quite
contradictory ways. The very scale on which she sets these larger
imaginative compositions, and the materials she chooses - acrylic paint or
graphite on huge sheets of paper - together present her with real technical
difficulties. To sustain any imagery across such a surface when the mark is
so much more limited and small, and the surface itself, whether painted or
drawn, inclined to be flat and uninflected, is difficulty enough.
This self-imposed material wrestling reminds us constantly that painting and
drawing are physical activities: the work is no figment of the imagination,
a mere description of something else, but an object to be realised and
understood for what it is. So the realisation comes through that the work is
closely based in direct and intense observation of the model and the
particular landscape. The small landscape studies in oil on scraps of
canvas, done on the spot, are as powerful in their presence as any of the
larger, ostensibly more ambitious works. Who knows where they might lead?
It is, too, in the nature of oil paint, as opposed to acrylic which seals
itself off within its own surface in a matter of minutes, to remain active
longer, the engagement so much more physical and direct. It is Miss
Raphael's chosen medium for the mass of tiny portraits of her friends, heads
and seated figures alike all cast onto scraps of used canvas, with their own
internal histories. They reveal that she is as good a painter of the
portrait study from life as any artist - certainly in her generation, which
seems hardly to know the meaning of objective observation. They are the
fruit of long, close scrutiny and an ever-growing understanding of what is
seen, to be rendered in paint on canvas. For me they are the most beautiful,
as they are the most exciting works in the show.

FT  08 FEB 92 / A quartet of quartets: Records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britten Quartet. Schubert: EMI CDC 754345-2. Ravel/Vaughan Williams: EMI CDC
754346-2
Takacs String Quartet. Dvorak: Decca 430 077-2. Brahms: Decca 430 529-2
Emerson String Quartet. Mozart: DG 431 797-2 (three CDs)
Borodin String Quartet. Shostakovich: Virgin VC 7 91437-2. Schubert: Virgin
VC 7 91447-2.
BY THE very nature of the discipline chamber music tends not to draw
attention to itself. This is never likely to become a world of punk
haircuts, odd socks and football rattles, even if one could put together a
quartet of Nigel Kennedys - an improbable proposition.
Nevertheless, its horizons are broadening. Even in the wintry conditions
that obtain in the depths of a recession there is no lack of opportunity for
musicians to get their performances on record these days. The blossoming of
record company contracts in the boom years has provided chances all round
and even young chamber ensembles find they are being seized first by one
company and then another.
In the circumstances it cannot be easy for newcomers to carve a niche for
themselves, which may explain why EMI's promotions department has been
working overtime for its new chamber group, the Britten Quartet. The quartet
is young, but not inexperienced on the recital platform. It has also made
recordings previously for another company. But here its members are, posing
like four Humphrey Bogarts in long raincoats with their collars up, while
one of their discs comes with a cartoon on the cover. They say that they
hope that will appeal to a younger audience.
These first two of the group's EMI releases display a fine range of
technical virtues, as anticipated, although each is on the careful side. The
main work on the Schubert disc is 'Death and the Maiden', D810, (with cover
design depicting skeletal Death leering over a Hollywood blonde.) The
playing is well groomed all round, but needs more pace and tension if it is
to force the demon within this music out into the open. The finale goes
best, with real drive.
On the second disc the performance of the Ravel Quartet is too docile to
compare with the best. Something tauter is required for this intellectually
sharp composer. The good idea is the coupling, which makes the link between
the inimitably French Ravel and his pupil Vaughan Williams, represented by
his G Minor String Quartet and the song-cycle On Wenlock Edge with pianist
Howard Shelley. Philip Langridge, the guest tenor, brings drama as well as
pastoral delicacy to his part.
The sound which EMI has given the Brittens, while nicely intimate as befits
the group, does not encourage vibrancy of colour. Even so, I prefer it to
the close balance provided by Decca for the Takacs Quartet. This is an
ensemble which we have had ample opportunity to hear in London and it is
difficult to reconcile the wiry, strained sounds on show here with its usual
tonal poise.
The Dvorak disc, including the 'American' Quartet and the A Flat, Op. 105,
is the better of the two, as it captures some of the affectionate lyrical
warmth for which the Takacs is known live. The Brahms is an altogether more
strenuous affair and it is wearing to have such tempestuous readings of the
Op. 67 Quartet and the Piano Quintet, Op. 34 (with Andras Schiff joining in
the rough and tumble) thrust so close to the microphones. One thinks back
wistfully to the stylish contributions the group made to last year's Mozart
festivities at the Barbican.
Meanwhile, on the South Bank it was the Emerson String Quartet that was
assigned the chamber music offering on the bicentenary day and by
coincidence it has just completed the set of Mozart's six 'Haydn' quartets
which it began recording a couple of years ago. This is a high quality
ensemble and the standard of its Mozart at the Royal Festival Hall invited
further investigation.
Heard here in more intimate conditions at home, in close-up as it were,
everything sounds just as impressively well detailed as it did then. The
delivery of rhythms is as cleanly cut, the textures admit no minor blemish.
But a degree of insistence has crept in, as though the players could not
quite bring themselves to give up the aggressive instincts that have given
them so brilliant and tenacious a hold on the 20th-century repertoire. In
the end one wants them to relax more and let the music sing.
And it is for that quality, among others, that I would turn to the final
quartet in this survey. The Borodin String Quartet is now well advanced in
its series of recordings for Virgin and has started on its new Shostakovich
cycle with Quartets Nos 3, 7 and 8. What depth of understanding there is
here. It may be that the physical shock of the music no longer hits home
with this quartet as it did the first time, but in its place has matured a
rare expressiveness.
The players simply get more music out of the notes on the page than do most
of their rivals and the reward per minute is golden, as it is no less on
their other new disc, devoted to Schubert with a moving account of the A
Minor 'Rosamunde' Quartet. By chance that is coupled with the early E Flat
Major, D87, which is also on the Britten Quartet's Schubert disc mentioned
earlier. But there are no surprises: it is the Borodins who make the music
sparkle.
By the way, seeing that cover of Death and the Hollywood blonde again, I
have decided that it would actually put me off buying the disc. Either the
marketing people are wrong or I am not as young as I used to be.

HIDEOUS KINKY by Esther Freud Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 186 pages
EVE'S TATTOO by Emily Prager Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 8.99, 194 pages
LOVE AND EMPIRE by Erik Orsenna Cape Pounds 15.99, 487 pages
IN THE hippy heyday, footloose families were found in odd places and Esther
Freud's autobiographical first novel, Hideous Kinky, tells the story of one
of them. A five-year-old girl is whisked off from London to Marrakesh and,
as five-year-olds will, more or less comes to terms with the exotic. She
does squirm, though, when Mum buys a prayer mat and squats down to pray in
public, and wishes she could adopt any one of Mum's lovers as a father,
particularly the street acrobat Bilal, who tries to train her as a small
fellow performer. Money troubles and itchy feet at last take them home to
London.
Briskly written in short sentences, it makes an easy read, deftly implying,
never stating, dismay or disapproval and as sweet in its portrait of the
child as the tender drawing on the jacket by the author's father, Lucian
Freud. Too sweet? Almost but not quite. Humour saves it, and the dottiness
of events. What seems technically a bit askew is the eye-level of the
narrative, which seems to imply a five-year-old's stature but is far above
the eye-level and vocabulary of any five-year-old I know. An attractive
debut, all the same.
To suggest that the horrors of the Holocaust are trivialised in Eve's Tattoo
may seem an insult to a writer as good as Emily Prager. That she feels them
with passion is clear, and that she has researched things deeply. One is as
appalled as her fictional listeners to hear, over and over, stories of what
women in Nazi Germay suffered. But the settings for her telling of them are
too glitzy, and the coincidences and coups de theatre too blatant. The
brilliant author of A Visit from the Footbinder still shows her gifts but
has picked an impossible format.
Eve, New York columnist with a dazzlingly attractive French lover she
adores, has her arm tattooed with the number of a woman in Auschwitz whose
photograph she has seen: thus she hopes to keep her memory alive.
Thereafter, whenever anyone notices the number, she says it belonged to a
woman called Eva, who had such-and-such a background and final, terrible
end: each time, a new tale. These stories are presumably true of someone,
but not of the woman in the photograph. Nor was she called Eva. She turns
out to have been a rabid Nazi, suitably named Leni.
Charles, the lover, has left Eve in horror. A Catholic, he appears in Eve's
fantasies as a Vatican cardinal. But, she realises from his reaction to the
tattoo, he is also Jewish, and with a wartime secret too shameful to share.
While she wears the tattoo he cannot touch her. So (lucky Eve, who need make
no decision about it), a convenient street accident involves an operation on
her arm, during which the tattoo is removed.
Even in fiction, fact and invention should be defined and respected. Eve's
Tattoo has moments of a kind of double-talk; literary, even philosophical
devices to suggest ambiguity and duality. Much harder to take is the
straight telling of tales as if they were fact, and belonged to a particular
woman. Perhaps they did, perhaps not: it gnaws at belief to know that their
teller doesn't say.
Gabriel Garca Marquez has a lot to answer for. Anyone who writes a long
unclassifiable novel with oddities of time, place and viewpoint, with
unconventional swirls of tense and syntax and visits a tropical rainforest,
suggests his name. Certainly the blurb of Love and Empire does.
A fictional Gabriel, mysteriously given the same surname Orsenna as his
creator, small, fat, a quarter Mexican and the rest French, everlastingly
shifting from first to third person, deals with the concerns and
surroundings rather than the facts or sequence of his own life. A series of
vignettes, ironically connected, takes him from 1882 to the 1950s, with
chance and passion plaiting events into a kind of pattern, and the century's
history looming over all, though he claims to be free of it. The tone is
gently amused, tender and idiosyncratic, particularly about family
relationships (Gabriel is with the grandmother and father who brought him up
after his mother not surprisingly bolted); and there are excursions into
motor racing, sex and books, South America, sea voyages, and Gabriel's
life-long devotion to a pair of English sisters.
Jokey interjections and even documents about this and that inserted here and
there make it seem like artfully chaotic jottings rather than narrative.
There is much in the detail to recommend it, good dialogue, quirky interest,
a lively translation (by Jeremy Leggatt) and (for Londoners) a good deal of
accurate observation in London. But the power and originality of Marquez or
anything like them? No.

from Stalin to today

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCUMENTS ON BRITISH POLICY OVERSEAS: SERIES 1, VOL V1. EASTERN EUROPE,
AUGUST 1945-APRIL 1946 HMSO Pounds 47, 395 pages
THIS VOLUME covers the post war months between the Potsdam Big Three
Conference and the Council of Foreign Ministers, including France, in Paris.
Truman and Byrnes Washington retained Roosevelt's objective of co-operation
with Stalin's Soviet Union. The new Labour government in London gave general
support with fewer misgivings than would probably have been forthcoming from
Churchill, already highly suspicious of Stalin in the closing months of the
war.
It was, however, a period during which the evidence accumulated of Stalin's
very different objectives and working with him became increasingly
difficult. The wartime hopes of Roosevelt and Churchill that, if treated as
a member of their club 'Uncle Joe' might one day behave as such, were not
realised. But Stalin wanted peace to restore the Soviet economy and he had
committed himself at Yalta and Potsdam to machinery of consultation and
co-operation, above all in Germany and Austria, even in Eastern Europe and
in the United Nations.
The major issue of Germany, on which the wartime alliance finally broke down
in 1948 with the Berlin Blockade, to be followed by the Cold War, is not the
theme of this volume. But its first chapter covers the consolidation of
Soviet hegemony, based upon the victories of the Red Army and the
introduction of Communist Party leadership in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and
Hungary. It also records the successful, although at times seemingly
desperate, struggle of the UK, again involving armed forces, this time
British, to preserve Greek independence.
The second and much shorter, although to to my mind more important chapter,
deals with bilateral Anglo-Soviet relations, above all with the reassessment
in the Moscow Embassy and in Whitehall of Soviet policies and of the
character of the Soviet regime, together with recommendations for future
British policies. These studies were carried out in parallel with a similar
American exercise. I here declare an interest, since a considerable
proportion of the published documents were from the Moscow Embassy, of which
I was then in charge, working closely with American opposite number George
Kennan and later with the new American Ambassador, General Bedell-Smith.
Germany was a central concern for the UK and US alike, as were Iran and
Turkey. The Americans naturally gave more attention to Japan, China, Korea
and the Pacific, while the UK concentrated upon the Middle East and also
upon potential Soviet influence in the forthcoming transformation of the
British Empire into the Commonwealth.
Returning to the first chapter, British interests lay mainly in Greece and
with Poland, our ally since 1939. It became increasingly clear that we could
do little to prevent the Russians from abusing their position in the
Tripartite Control Commissions in Romania, Bulgaria and even Hungary to
ensure that the minority Communist parties dominated their governments.
Tito's Yugoslavia, with whom our wartime relations had been so close, had
become openly hostile, threatening the Italians in Trieste and the Austrians
in Carinthia and above all supporting the Communists in Greece, where Stalin
preferred to remain in the background. The documents show how burdensome a
task Bevin had taken over from Churchill in Greece, one indeed which before
long had to be passed on to the Americans.
There remained Poland, where our only weapon was diplomatic pressure, in
trying, as it eventually proved in vain, to hold Stalin and his Communist
puppets in Warsaw to his Yalta commitments. This meant discreet support for
Mikolaczyk, who had some success at first, efforts to ensure the return to
Poland in safety of those in the Polish forces wishing to return, and
concern for the manner in which Poland took over the administration of its
new and formerly German territories.
But Soviet control, military, political and economic, was growing ever
stronger. While Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe came as no surprise,
Stalin's ruthlessness and disregard of his western allies were important
factors in the reassessment of Anglo-Soviet relations recorded in Chapter
II. However, the old priority of seeking to work with the Soviet Union was
not lightly abandoned. As late as the spring of 1946 Bevin was still trying
in vain to interest Stalin in a new Anglo-Soviet 50 years Treaty. It was not
until the autumn of 1946 that decisions were taken on Anglo-American
policies in Germany without the Soviet Union, and then only because there
was no prospect of Soviet co-operation in the restoration of the German
economy as an essential part of the European Recovery Programme.
There were were obviously differences of emphasis between the Foreign Office
and the Moscow Embassy and indeed between the diplomatic and military
assessments in Whitehall. But there was basic agreement on the main thrust
of future policy. The essential feature was to regard Stalin's approach as
adversarial, but not necessarily leading to military confrontation, provided
a working relationship could be maintained on a basis of Western strength
and unity and tough realism. Working with the Soviet Union, wherever
possible, remained desirable since there were issues where Soviet and
Western interests were not divergent.
It was thus in the spring of 1946 that the basis was laid in London and
Washington for policies towards the Soviet Union, to be pursued later in
NATO and elsewhere, firm enough to deter or defeat dangerous Soviet
initiatives but flexible enough to react to changes for the better in Moscow
under Khrushchev, even under Brezhnev and finally under Gorbachev. Nearly 50
years later the result has been the unification of Germany and the end of
Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and now in the Soviet Union itself.
These documents have been well selected and are, as usual in this series,
presented with objectivity and scholarship.

THE RELUCTANT PRESIDENT: A POLITICAL LIFE OF VACLAV HAVEL by Michael Simmons
Methuen Pounds 16.99, 229 pages
ALBANIA'S NATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLE: THE BITTER VICTORY by Reginald
Hibbert Pinter Publishers Pounds 30, 269 pages
VANISHING BORDERS by Michael Farr Viking Pounds 15.99
AS THE republics of the former Soviet Union attempt to shake off three
quarters of a century of communist rule, the governments of eastern Europe
are trying to create stable democratic institutions. The task is not only
difficult. For those who rule, it is often lonely.
Most of the presidents or prime ministers of these countries have had no
political experience. Moreover, they are presiding over societies which are
trying to reconstitute politics based on checks and balances, on
accountability, on the rule of law, and on a free press. But as Michael
Simmons shows in his biography of President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia,
attempts at reconciling democratic practices with political inexperience and
opportunism are easily manipulated.
Havel, perhaps all too slowly, is discovering that morality and integrity,
the underlying themes of many of his plays, are not virtues shared by
politicians. Since becoming president in the summer of 1990, the former
playwright/philosopher has seen how the Velvet Revolution which toppled the
communists from power in November 1989 has been replaced with a political
creed tainted by nationalism, populism and revenge for the past.
Slovakia, which Havel has tried very hard to feel wanted by Prague, the
capital of the Czech Lands, remains fertile ground for authoritarian
nationalists/separatists, particularly Vladimir Meciar, the republic's
former prime minister. In Prague, the rise of the right, which sees itself
as the national guarantor of the new moralism, wants all those who signed
any police document since 1968 to be excluded from the civil service. This
could polarise Czech and Slovak society and hinder the country's road to
stable democracy.
Throughout this biography, Simmons gives the impression that Havel does not
really enjoy trying to bring Czechoslovakia along that road. I wonder what
kind of plays and essays the reluctant president will write when he retires.
Whoever can bring Albania out of its current state of anarchy will deserve
more than financial assistance from the G7 group of industrial nations.
Albania is now a country beset by bandits, looters and instability. Many aid
workers have recounted how their medicine trucks have been ransacked by
people who are either clearly starving, or else, pace Harry Lime, are
requisitioning these vital supplies to support themselves on the black
market.
Albania, one of Europe's oldest peoples, was not always a den of thieves;
nor, for that matter, was it a traditionally stable region in the Balkans,
subject as it was to constant interference by the European powers, as
Reginald Hibbert shows in this fascinating, if densely written, account of
his months in Albania in late 1943.
Parachuted in by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) Hibbert and his
colleagues, including Alan Hare, Peter Kemp, David Smiley, were supposed to
continue earlier SOE missions, which started in 1941 with the aim of
fermenting rebellion against Italian rule in Albania. The British assisted
the Partisans, grouped under the late Enver Hoxha, just as they supported
Tito's Yugoslav Partisans. But towards the end of the war British policy
towards Albania became inconsistent and in the end fatal for the Albanian
people.
By the end of 1944, Whitehall policy was torn between the needs of the
military and SOE establishment, which was committed to defeating Germany and
therefore to supporting Hoxha's Partisans, and the Foreign Office, which was
then preparing to check the communist advance in eastern Europe before
Nazism had been defeated. Hibbert shows how Hoxha capitalised on this
dualist approach. '
Vanishing Borders is a lovely guide through parts of central Europe. Farr is
at his best in eastern Germany, where the shock of the vanished Wall has
left, if not quite nostalgia, then a certain bewilderment about how the east
Germans should deal with their history and identity, as the new united
Germany approaches the millennium.

SURVIVING: THE UNCOLLECTED WRITINGS OF HENRY GREEN Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
18, 301 pages
HENRY GREEN was the pen-name of Henry Yorke, managing director of the
Birmingham-based engineering company, H. Pontifex and Sons. Originally it
had made lavatories - the Pontifex Maximus was the de luxe model - but
market forces caused the firm in the 1930s to switch to the manufacture of
equipment for the catering industry.
Yorke's pseudonym unfortunately coincided in all but the absence of a final
'e' with the real name of a writer who was to rival and eventually out-strip
him in fame and reputation - one Graham Greene, a writer whose novels Henry
Green happened greatly to dislike. It so happened that both were major
novelists, Greene of socially committed fiction with Catholic themes, Green
of a radiantly comic kind of novel, strong on verbal mimicry, that was his
own unique English thing. For a while in the 1940s the two of them jointly
dominated English fiction.
From the start Green had the edge over his rival in one respect, the single
word title. This kind of title was rare when he published his first novel
Blindness in 1926. Green wrote that novel while still a pupil at Eton. By
the time it was published he was up at Oxford reading English, one of the
first batch of undergraduates at Magdalen to be taught by a newly appointed
don called CS Lewis.
Green's single-word titles continued. Apart from being a marketing gimmick,
they seemed to be saying that the novels dealt with some on-going
unresolvable condition - Living (1929), Loving (1945), Concluding (1948),
Doting (1952). In Party Going (1939) he allowed himself an extra word to
define the circle of rich people and their servants who are the book's
subject, held up by fog at a railway terminus on their way to the South of
France. Green and his wife, known always as 'Dig', would go on similar
jaunts before the war with their friend Aly Khan.
In the one work where autobiography and fiction are blended he runs in his
title to three quick monosyllables Pack My Bag (1940), but for the two
novels which cover phases of the war in England, - Caught (1943) and Back
(1946) the titles are resignedly monosyllabic. In a novel of the immediate
postwar period entirely written in dialogue - about a flighty father's
relations with his solemn son - Green teased his readers with the title
Nothing (1950).
These were all the books published by Green in his lifetime. Greatly to the
disappointment of his admirers, he gave up writing long before he died in
1973. The reserves of energy he had summoned over so many years to pursue
his various careers of bright young thing, managing director who shuttled
between London head office and the works in Brum, industrial spokesman,
novelist, Blitz firefighter, seemed to abandon him altogether on his
official retirement. He withdrew in one fell swoop not only from commerce,
manufacturing and novel-writing, but from friends and all forms of social
life as well.
For any admirer who has long thirsted for More (the title I would have given
this book - called in fact Surviving), here is a rich reminder of Green's
eccentric writing styles. It contains fascinating unpublished juvenilia,
rejected late stories and an unperformed TV play, along with pieces that
have only previously appeared in magazines, several from the war. The
collection is topped by forewords by John Updike and Matthew Yorke, Green's
novelist grandson, and is tailed by his son Sebastian Yorke, who contributes
a candid, informative, biographical memoir of his father. So far there has
been no full-length biography.
Green's radio talks on novel-writing, also included, were well worth
preserving in this form and so was the hitherto unpublished Mood. This
represents the first part of a novel about a friendship between two young
women. Later Green admitted he had abandoned the book when he fell out of
love with the girl on whom the heroine was based.
In the Bookmark programme Trapped: The Story of Henry Green, shown on BBC-2
last Wednesday, sensitively directed by Roger Thompson, we saw glimpses of
the man himself in his heyday. There he was in full close-up - that
extraordinarily handsome face he normally refused to allow to be
photographed from the front. His film-mad admirer J. Maclaren-Ross once told
me he thought Henry looked like Ray Milland.
Green's replies to the invisible interviewer ('Novel-writing? No, I've given
it up - it's too tiring') were inter-cut with shots of Forthampton Court,
near Tewkesbury, the family house where his childhood was spent (model for
the one in Loving even though that book was set in Ireland), and interviews
with former colleagues, fishermen, factory hands, servants, several highly
articulate women friends - one Japanese - trying to define the nature of his
personal magnetism, male friends like Noel Annan, and finally Jenny Rees
(Goronwy's daughter) who was supposed to take down the autobiographical
sequel to Bag, never written. Then there was Kate Broom, who served Green
with his nightly gins at the George IV in Knightsbridge opposite his London
house and was puzzled by his lonely vigils.
In my youth I once met him there when I was trying to write something about
him and we talked about his books, particularly Back. He said that it had
had about 70 reviews and not one reviewer had picked up the anecdote about
twin identities from the memoirs of Mme de Crequy, translated by him and
planted carefully in the middle of the narrative. 'I even published another
extract from her memoirs in Horizon just before the book came out', he said.
Fifty years on we now have that extract re-published in Surviving. But one
has to say that the relevance of these spurious pieces of 18th century court
gossip to the novel is at best marginal.
Green then asked me where I thought of publishing my article on him. I
mentioned some obscure little magazine. Why didn't I try Penguin New
Writing, he suggested. I replied I thought they would be most unlikely to
consider a piece by an unknown undergraduate. 'I don't know,' he countered.
'John Lehmann who runs it is absolutely besotted about a Greek poet called
Demetrios Capetanakis. Now if you could slip into your first paragraph a
comparison between his poetry and my prose, I'm sure you'd be well away.'
Green was a charming man and a real professional.
The novels of Henry Green are being re-issued in paperback by Harvill.
Currently available are Living, Loving and Caught, at Pounds 6.99 each.

HERBERT SAMUEL: A POLITICAL LIFE by Bernard Wasserstein Clarendon Press,
Oxford Pounds 45, 427 pages
ON JUNE 30 1920 Herbert Samuel arrived in Jaffa aboard a British warship to
take up his post as the first British High Commissioner in Palestine.
Dressed in the white uniform of the British proconsul, complete with plumes
and sword, Samuel was given a royal welcome. The Jews of Palestine,
overcoming earlier misgivings about Samuel's appointment, enthused with
their customary hyperbole.
Max Nurock, an Irish-born Zionist who was to be Samuel's private secretary,
noted that the occasion took on a 'messianic and a vice-regal character'.
The Mayor of Jaffa - an Arab - greeted the High Commissioner in English. But
the controversial Meir Dizengoff, Mayor of the neighbouring all-Jewish Tel
Aviv, departed from agreed procedures to address Samuel in Hebrew, thus
pointing undiplomatically to the fact that the High Commissioner was a Jew.
The hyper-sensitive local political barometer gave a nervous kick.
Accompanied by the Military Governor of Jerusalem, Sir Ronald Storrs Samuel
journeyed by train to Jerusalem. At the official residence on the 'Mount of
Olives' the transfer of authority was affected. Jokingly, the outgoing Chief
Administrator handed Samuel a typed form: 'Received from Major General Sir
Louis Bols, one Palestine, complete.' Which Samuel obligingly signed, adding
the commercial escape clause 'E. &amp; OE' (errors and omissions excepted).
Then as now, 'one complete Palestine' contained more pitfalls and
contradictions than even the swell of optimism that attended Samuel's first
steps could suppress. It was not long before these surfaced to frustrate his
efforts. By the time Samuel had left Palestine five years later he had
achieved a great deal in the areas at which he was good: he laid the
foundation for a sound civil administration, and generally improved
conditions in the country. To the consternation of Whitehall, he also went
beyond his brief to extend British authority to Transjordan - a small
expression of his robust imperialist instincts. Yet before the end of his
term, he came to be resented by the Jews, distrusted by the Arabs and, as
far as British aims in the region went, he seemed to have achieved little,
if anything.
To accept such a judgment, however, is unfair for it disregards the region's
quirky, meandering political evolution. As Professor Wasserstein wisely
suggests - albeit with the benefit of hindsight - Samuel's steady
dispassionate competence, his impeccable application of fair play, and
perhaps even his unimaginativeness in the search for a commonly acceptable
solution which anyway seemed unattainable, may well have saved the Zionist
enterprise from crashing by giving it a much-needed breathing space. If this
did not much help the Arab cause, it did not retard it either. Sir Ronald
Storrs, hardly noted for his Zionist sympathies, wrote this of Samuel's
tenure in his autobiography Orientation: 'I do not believe that any previous
five years in the history of Palestine - certainly none subsequent - can
show a legacy of accomplishment comparable with that of his orderly,
creative and passionless intelligence. And I firmly believe, if a Gentile
may express an opinion on Jewish affairs (Jews express themselves freely
enough on ours) that the names of the Big Four who will go down to history
in the rebuilding of Zion will be Theodor Herzl, who saw the vision; Chaim
Weizmann, who grasped the occasion; Arthur Balfour, who caused the world to
renew the ancient Promise in a modern Covenant; and Herbert Samuel, who
turned principle into practice, word into fact.'
Even for the well-ordered and ethically unfettered Roman Empire, Palestine
was a troublesome province. Samuel may have reflected on this as he
contemplated the appointment with considerable reluctance. He realised that
being Jewish would be disadvantageous to the task at hand, and to British
interests. Samuel was perhaps naive in believing that his own overruling
sense of justice and abilities could relegate his Jewishness to irrelevance
in Palestine.
What about the Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who could not be accused
of naivety in any sense? Lloyd George loathed Samuel, who returned the
sentiment priggishly, moralistically. Is it conceivable that in dispatching
Samuel to Palestine Lloyd George malevolently invited a disastrous failure
both on Samuel personally and on the Zionist cause, which was averted by
luck no less than by Samuel's probity and skills? I should have liked
Wasserstein to consider this possibility and its implications.
Zionists too, were apprehensive about Samuel's Palestine appointment,
despite his having been a force behind the scenes in the genesis of the
Balfour Declaration of 1917, which committed the British Government to the
creation of national home for the Jews in Palestine.
Wasserstein recounts how Chaim Weizmann responded to CP Scott, editor of the
Manchester Guardian who had offered to put him in touch with Lloyd George.
Scott said: ''You know, you have a Jew in the Government, Mr Herbert
Samuel.' Whereupon Weizmann responded: 'For God's sake, Mr Scott, let's have
nothing to do with this man''. A typical Zionist gut-reflex to influential
Jews, derived from the fear that such Jews, wanting to dispel imputations of
double loyalty, tended to bend backwards to show their impartiality in a way
which was detrimental to the Zionist cause.
In the case of Samuel, Weizmann's apprehension was unfounded. Samuel's
commitment to Zionism was deep and unwavering. Curiously, it was also
consistent with his extreme Englishness.
Never brilliant, Samuel was, nevertheless, sublimely competent and endowed
with a well-ordered mind and invaluable administrative skills. His peers
considered him incorruptible, priggish and passionless which, in the cut and
thrust world of politics, amounted to being safe, dependable, but boring.
Such indeed was the nature of his career: replete with unspectacular
achievements, but lacklustre.
Palestine was undoubtedly the high-point of Samuel's immensely long public
career. Indeed, everything which followed - he died aged 93 in 1963 - was
something of an anticlimax. Yet he became the Liberal MP for Cleveland in
1902, and went on to hold various governmental posts including Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster (1909), Postmaster General (1910 and 1915), and Home
Secretary, twice, during the First World War and after. For a while he was
leader of the Liberal Party. His loyalty to Asquith was as enduring as was
his aversion to Lloyd George.
Much to Professor Wasserstein's credit, his book, like its subject, is
admirably well-organised, and competent in every respect. Unlike Samuel
himself, however, it is far from boring.

'BONJOUR BLANC': A JOURNEY THROUGH HAITI by Ian Thomson Hutchinson Pounds
16.99, 352 pages
IAN THOMSON, a 30-year-old Briton, spent months travelling over a
God-forsaken and singular land: 'a country turned upside down', according to
one of the book's characters. This is a lively account of life in Haiti that
alternately stimulates sympathy, humour and despair.
Haiti is at this moment in the grip of military repression. The Tonton
Macoutes, the terrifying security force of the dictatorships of 'Papa Doc'
Duvalier and his son, have been resuming their positions of power around the
island. Soldiers, having ousted the elected president, are beating, killing
and arresting hundreds of people. As Thomson says: 'The horror of Haiti has
always been in the army.'
The trail of blood goes back at least to Columbus, for we know little of it
before. Within 50 years of the navigator's arrival, the half million Arawak
indians on the island had perished and the pre-Columbian culture had all but
vanished. Columbus established in Haiti the first European settlement in the
New World, 500 years ago this year. When he returned 11 months later, the
settlement had been razed and his men killed. Columbus described a land of
spices and cotton, mastic and aloes and 'a thousand other things of value'.
What Thomson finds is 'a vast slum floating a few hundred miles off Florida,
the poorest nation in the western hemisphere.'
When independence was declared from Napoleon's France on New Year's Day
1804, Haiti became the first black republic: in today's parlance, the first
third world country. Napoleon himself had cruelly deceived one of its few
unalloyed heroes: Toussaint L'Ouverture, who led the the slave revolt that
eventually brought about independence. His life ended in a dank French gaol.
His hopes for democracy have never been realised: leader after leader used
their positions to pillage the state. 'Pluck the chicken as long as it does
not squawk,' said Haiti's first leader, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Thomson
follows fascinating trails all over the land: to the probable site of that
first European settlement; on a search for the descendants of the Poles who
settled part of the island and for Alexandre Dumas the Elder, the half-caste
father of the author of the Count of Monte Cristo; to voodoo ceremonies. He
talks to a zombi; to an ancestor of Simon Bolivar; to a sad Englishman
ending his days among people who, even if they have heard of his native
land, believe it to be one of the United States of America; and to many
others.
This book is the fruit of no little courage and long research. If it has a
fault, it is the author's apparent unwillingness to leave out a fact
painstakingly gathered or an individual met along the way. There is a
surfeit of italics - French, creole, Spanish, Latin - which disturbs the
narrative. As a result, the book is perhaps overlong. It remains none the
less an achievement; a colourful, vital book of important insight.

DID YOU know there were newly-elected Relais &amp; Chateaux establishments in
Argentina, Fiji and Uruguay? Neither did I, writes Michael Thompson-Noel.
But then R&amp;C, which brings together as fine a collection of hotels and
restaurants as you will find, is cautiously extending its reach into all
sorts of nooks and corners.
The 1992 edition of R&amp;C's guide offers 387 hotels and restaurants in 40
countries: 148 in France, including eight new members, and 239 outside
France (23 new).
However, as the organisation makes clear: 'Maintaining and developing the
quality of the R&amp;C network is one of our main concerns. This is the reason
why 19 establishments (six in France and 13 outside) will be leaving Relais
&amp; Chateaux in 1992.'
The R&amp;C flag-waver in Argentina is La Cascada Hotel in San Carlos de
Bariloche; in Uruguay: La Bourgogne, a restaurant in Punta del Este; and in
Fiji: the Vatulele Island Resort.
Britain has 20 Relais members, of which three are Relais gourmand
(restaurant only). Between them, these 20 have 17 Michelin stars, 414
bedrooms and suites, and a gross turnover of Pounds 30m-plus.
The two new members are the Summer Lodge Country House Hotel at Evershot,
west Dorset - the only UK country house hotel joining R&amp;C this year - and
Albert Roux's Fortyseven Park Street (posh apartments) and Le Gavroche
(three Michelin stars) in London's Mayfair.
I have not been there, but Summer Lodge, in Thomas Hardy country, sounds
useful. It quotes various special deals. For example, two-day weekend breaks
from now until April 16, and from October 1-December 22, cost Pounds
165-Pounds 205 per person, including afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast.
Three-day weekday breaks cost Pounds 225-Pounds 300 per person in these
periods. The equivalent single rates: Pounds 195 and Pounds 275. (Tel:

FT  08 FEB 92 / Travel: Dancing in the footsteps of Columbus - Nick Haslam
fails to master either the merengue or the mosquitoes in the fast-changing
Dominican Republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK HASLAM

<TEXT>
'WELCOME TO the capital of merengue,' said the American Airlines pilot as we
taxied to a halt. We had arrived in Santa Domingo, capital of the Dominican
Republic and famed in the Caribbean for merengue, a sensual hip-swaying
dance that drove 19th-century missionaries to apoplexy.
Merengue and missionaries are still much in evidence in the Dominican
Republic. Clubs blare out the brassy rhythms until dawn and Hari Krishna,
Baptists and short-sleeved Mormons harangue passers-by in Santa Domingo
every day.
I had spent a week in the capital, and despite great efforts had failed to
master the subtleties of merengue. Determined to escape the gruelling
nightlife, I decided to visit La Isabella, Columbus's first settlement on
the island's Atlantic coast.
My merengue coach, a young Dominican doctor called Christina Gonzales,
offered to be my guide. Dominican doctors had been on strike for more than
two months over their sub-subsistence pay of Dollars 200 (Pounds 110.40) a
month, and she welcomed a break from picketing the state hospitals, now
manned by army doctors.
Columbus first landed on the island in 1492, and was so charmed by its
rolling hills and pastures that he called it Hispaniola. The country is now
bracing itself for the 500th anniversary of his arrival. An immense
British-designed monument to the Discoverer of the New World has been built
on the outskirts of the capital, causing chaos and anger among slum-dwellers
whose houses were razed to make way for it.
Numerous hotels are springing up on some of the most beautiful beaches, and
Dominicans have been exhorted in radio broadcasts to be kind to visitors and
not harm the goose that lays the golden egg.
We left the capital early one morning on a guagua, the shared transport that
everyone uses to get around on the island. I wanted to see the mountains of
the centre and we were travelling to the Atlantic via Constansa, the highest
town on the island. The guagua, an old Toyota bus, climbed slowly up a muddy
track that snaked along ridges and dipped into steep valleys. In villages
above the cloud line, ragged children played in the dirt.
We crested a last ridge and arrived in Constansa. The air was cool, and pine
forests came down to the road. It took an effort of will to believe that we
were really in the Caribbean and not the Alps. The people were different,
too, with blonde, blue-eyed peasants working in the fields by the road.
We stayed for lunch in the town and were amazed to meet a Japanese farmer.
He spoke the strongly-accented Spanish of the island: his family had been
there for three generations. His grandfather, a farmer whose family was
starving in post-war Japan, had responded to an advertisement in 1946.
Trujillo, the notorious Dominican dictator, determined to ginger-up his own
peasants by injecting new blood, offered free land to Europeans and Asians.
Initially, Hungarians and Poles had worked alongside Japanese in the
mountains. But they drank and fought too much and soon went on to
California.
The Japanese had prospered and introduced rice and vegetable-growing
techniques that trebled crop yields. 'We now have our own schools with
teachers from Japan. Some of us have married Dominican girls, but we mostly
marry among ourselves,' the farmer told us, bowing formally when we left the
restaurant.
Our next guagua was an ordinary Datsun saloon. Eight passengers were crammed
inside with the driver perched on the lap of a front-seat passenger.
Merengue blared from the loudspeakers and a venerable matron squeezed next
to me sang the chorus with gusto.
We arrived in La IsabelIa as dusk fell. We had travelled the last ten
kilometres on an ancient Honda 50 which gave up the ghost when its driver
attempted to ford a river, so we walked and waded the remaining two
kilometres into the village. As the sun set, we could see why Columbus had
chosen this site. Connected to the mainland by a narrow neck of land, it
offered natural defence against Indian attack while a shelving beach
provided an easy landing site for the Spanish.
Columbus had landed there late in 1493 after a three-month voyage. The 1,400
settlers, many of whom were escaping the privations of life in medieval
Spain, wearily disembarked and gave thanks for their safe arrival.
But their relief was short-lived. A nearby marsh supplied enough mosquitoes
to spread yellow fever and malaria through the new arrivals, who died in
scores. Water had to be brought by donkey from the same river we had crossed
two kilometres away. After five years, the site was abandoned and the
settlers moved inland to higher and healthier ground. But it was still the
first European settlement built in the New World.
We found the only bar in the simple village of one-roomed shacks and hired
two beds in the hut that served as the hotel. A chicken was killed and
cooked for us. The servant girl, named Soledad, who looked as if she had
gypsy blood, sat with us and watched as we ate in the light of an oil lamp.
She was fascinated by our conversation, and would repeat snatches of it to
other spectators invisible beyond the pool of light. That night we slept
fitfully, bitten by descendants of the same mosquitoes that had played havoc
with the first settlers.
We had been told in the capital that the site was being excavated by a
well-known Venezuelan archaeologist, and next morning found Dr Cruxent (El
Profe) wearing a stained singlet and sifting through pottery fragments on
the site. A Catalan, he had left Spain as a refugee in the civil war and had
been excavating and teaching in south and central America ever since.
We breakfasted with the professor on the site of Columbus's settlement, now
fenced off from the village. The area was flat, and lines of whitewashed
stone marked the position of the wooden stockade of the old fort. Cruxent,
in his eighties, laughed when I expressed surprise that the site was so
bare. He explained that in the 1950s a government minister had overheard
Trujillo complaining about the untidy nature of the site at La Isabella.
To curry favour, he dispatched two bulldozers to the village, flattened the
site and had the entire area concreted over and two flagstaffs erected, one
for Trujillo and one for the Dominican Republic.
As he told the story, Cruxent's face grew longer. 'That top layer is the
most valuable in a site of this age. All I can do now is attempt to
reconstruct the site from the few remaining artefacts we can find.'
We spent the day with the professor, visiting the excavations that extended
throughout the village. Many of the villagers worked on the grid of trenches
that would provide information about the lay-out of the old town.
The graveyard had recently been discovered, and a skeleton lay exposed. 'We
know he is Christian because his hands are crossed on his chest - he was
probably among the first ever to land here,' said Cruxent. The blackened
skeleton grinned up at the tropical sun. 'The trouble is we have no money to
protect this site from the weather. Another hurricane like David back in '79
and all of this will be lost.'
That night we went to bed early and caught the only guagua to the capital
that passed through before dawn. As we bumped past the professor's hut, we
saw him standing at the door with an oil lamp. He gave us a letter to post
in the capital and said: 'Come back for the celebrations in '92, and try to
raise some funds to protect this place as well.' I promised to return, and
saw him waving goodbye as the driver turned up the merengue and we rolled
off into the dawn.
Nick Haslam travelled to the Dominican Republic c/o American Airlines (res:
0800-010-151; 081-572-5555) which flies daily to Santa Domingo from Heathrow
via Miami or New York. Transport to La Isabella can be arranged from any of
the main hotels in the nearest large town, Puerto Plata. Car hire costs
about Dollars 80 a day, minimum two days, insurance included.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Golf: The last of the mega-projects - John Hopkins finds
Robert Trent Jones is bucking a depressing trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL I heard about Les Domaines de Vidauban in Provence, I had thought the
era of big golf course projects had gone the way of the small ball and the
No 10 iron. All over Europe, particularly in Britain, big projects were
being put up for sale or being restructured - victims of the recession and
concern for the environment.
Remember the Pounds 52m project on the banks of Loch Lomond that was to have
rivalled Gleneagles for luxurious facilities? Or East Sussex National, the
course that had designs on Augusta National, the site of the US Masters? The
ambitious Scottish venture is still in the hands of the receivers 15 months
after they were called in by the Bank of Scotland. No realistic buyer is in
sight. East Sussex survives, thanks to a successful rescue operation, but as
a shadow of its proposed self.
Another casualty was Slaley Hall, the Pounds 20m golf and country club in
Northumberland that went into receivership late last summer with debts of
more than Pounds 20m. Liquidators Touche Ross recently turned down a Pounds
20m bid for the property.
Clubs on mainland Europe have also been affected by the recession. In
Austria, the lavish and luxurious Gut Altentann complex, where the Austrian
Open is played on a course designed by Jack Nicklaus, has changed hands
twice at least since it opened three years ago.
Chateau les Forges, a 36-hole complex built by Swedes near Poitiers, western
France, was due to open last August. Instead, it was up for sale. The
Swedish management team have been removed, banks have taken the property
over and it remains unsold. The asking price is FFr60m (Pounds 6.14m).
And then I came across Vidauban, which is little more than a small town by
the side of the motorway that runs between Toulon and Cannes and Nice. If
the town is insignificant, the project certainly is not. Les Domaines de
Vidauban is being built on rolling, wooded land 15 miles from St Tropez.
When it is finished it will be the biggest golf-orientated project in
Europe, bigger even than Sotogrande in Spain.
It will eventually contain three golf courses, swimming pools, 40 tennis
courts, horse riding, polo, two artificial lakes equipped for water sports,
a nature reserve and six hotels. Each of the three courses will have 200
homes on it, which is not particularly dense compared with some courses in
the US and Spain.
Robert Trent Jones Snr, the golf course architect, bought the 2,500 acres at
Vidauban 20 years ago when he saw that its pleasantly undulating, wooded
landscape would be ideal for golf. He and his son Bobby have laid out the
golf courses.
'The site represents one of those happy coincidences because the farmer who
sold it to my father thought he was getting a bargain because it couldn't be
farmed. It was too rough,' says Bob Jones.
'My father wanted it because he saw the land differently. He recognised the
rolling terrain would be ideal for golf. It had lots of movement in it.'
It was not until two years ago, when Bob Jones met Pierre Schnebelen, the
Frenchman who developed Tignes as a ski resort in the French Alps, that
sufficient development skills were brought to the project to get it started.
Robert Trent Jones and Schnebelen became partners, and an initial Pounds 25m
was raised.
Then Schnebelen brought in Malik Bencheghib, chairman of Fonciere Malbe, to
help with the finance and building, and Bencheghib in turn brought in
Interconstruction, the French construction company which had built the Arche
de la Defense in Paris. With a further injection of Pounds 15m, the project
got underway in mid-summer last year.
Now they are moving ahead rapidly. The show village was opened in the
autumn. On January 1 this year a German businessman arrived from Munich and
looked around. The next day he left having paid Pounds 1.3m for a house by
the side of a fairway.
The supporters of Vidauban point out that although France has quite a number
of golf courses, and more are being built all the time, there are few if any
venues this size. Claude Temple of Vidauban describes other courses in the
region as providing 'le golf aperitif: small, short courses that do not
feature good architecture. This is golf immobiliere, golf to sell houses.'
With his tongue not too far into his cheek he says enthusiastically: 'The
world is full of people waiting for Vidauban. Its time has come.'
It is easy to be beguiled by Provence in January, when the mistral is not
blowing and there are not hordes of holidaymakers dashing to St Tropez. The
rugged red landscape stands out vividly beneath a gun-metal sky. Toulon
airport, soon to be enlarged, is only 30 minutes away by car, and when the
TGV stops at Vidauban it will be possible to travel from Paris to Vidauban
in 3 1/2 hours by train.
There are other pluses. In fire-ridden Provence, a golf course with
sprinklers is considered to be a fire break, and thus seen to be good
environmentally. It is also a bonus to have the considerable experience of
Schnebelen, a man who spends time in a monastery, has written two books
about meditation and is also building an enormous ski resort in Idaho.
At Heathrow airport, returning from Provence, I was handed a sticker
advertising a company called Pink Elephant Parking. It made me think: I hope
Vidauban is not going to be a white elephant.

FT  08 FEB 92 / As they say in Europe: Germans savour a French farce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ENGLAND means to keep its place as top European nation' is not what one
expects to see in a French paper, even one as fair-minded as Liberation. But
then last November I noted the honesty and restless search for truth that
characterises French rugby writers. In other areas things have to come to a
pretty pass before the British are held up for admiration.
The Georges Habash affair did it. Le Figaro finds it hard to maintain a
steady output of hysterical contempt for the government day after day, so
the decision to allow an alleged top terrorist into France for hospital
treatment was a gift. It gave Alain Peyrefitte and the French language the
opportunity to deploy their talent for sustained abuse.
Ridiculise', which has to be translated as 'made ridiculous,' became the
title and leitmotif for Peyrefitte as he worked steadily through government
ranks to spread the blame for this embarrassing incident as widely as
possible. He ended up with Francois Mitterrand.
'What hits us between the eyes are the vices of a system where the President
of the Republic himself declares, 'I have no cabinet, I have only colleagues
who work directly with me.' In other words: 'L'Etat c'est moi.''
Peyrefitte concluded: 'When officials of the 'Foreign Office' committed the
error of not foreseeing the invasion of the Falklands, it was not they who
paid the price. Lord Carrington nobly resigned. He was, however, on the
basis of all evidence, totally innocent. Such is the greatness of political
responsibility.'
The Germans enjoyed all this, in their rather gloomy way. Die Welt, never
exactly Francophile, wrote: 'At first Paris played the role of good
Samaritan to a world-famous terrorist. Then it pledged to investigate this
hangman. And finally it refused the promised 'humanitarian aid' and sent the
malingerer George Habash back to Tunis without investigation.'
The paper expatiated on what it saw as backstairs dealing by France in the
Middle East peace process: 'The damage to French foreign policy is great,
the position of the socialist government of President Mitterrand has again
been shattered.'
The German word for this sort of thing is Schadenfreude; in Italian the
enjoyment of others' discomfiture is piacere maligno and it is what
L'Indipendente'of Milan felt on Tuesday.
Germany had tried to make the world forget its history and now the rebirth
of nationalism meant 'the Germans regard the chaos in France next door with
indifference rather than anger. The power of habit, the weight of inertia
and automatic reflexes could prolong the special relationship between France
and Germany. But sustaining the Franco-German marriage in the new reality of
the international system demands much political goodwill between the two
countries. And today that goodwill seems to be missing.'
Footnote: In the spate of forced resignations, Andre Frossard had a solution
in his column in Figaro: 'France will have to resign, she presents herself
as great and hospitable. So France is responsible and guilty. She must be
removed.'
President Yeltsin's trip to the West last week was seen as a triumph - in
the West. In Moscow it was different. Pravda wrote: 'Boris Yeltsin succumbed
to a temptation familiar to us from the last resident of the Kremlin - go
abroad and seek solutions to domestic problems. His entourage has concluded
that the fate of Yeltsin's reforms, and hence his government, is now in the
hands of the west.'
The paper is disillusioned with the 'peace dividend.'
'What economic gains will Russia's inhabitants get from cuts in nuclear
weapons? None in the short term. Any savings will be felt, at best, in ten
years or so. And before that we shall go through the inevitable social
unrest caused by the speedy fulfilment of disarmament promises.'
Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote: 'While nuclear Russia quickly gained
understanding and money, market Russia gets very little. Only Major and
Mulroney displayed any loyalty to the economically-doomed Russian President.
Others of the 'seven' have refused to set up a stabilisation fund for
Commonwealth currencies.'
Izvestia reported that the proportion of Muscovites dissatisfied with their
existence had risen from 61 per cent to 81 per cent in a month. But of those
polled less than 1 per cent said: 'Enough is enough,' 'a military coup is
needed,' or 'let's get the government off its chairs and into the sausage
queue.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Motoring: The Scandinavian way to avoid ice follies - Stuart
Marshall travels to Norway to take a spin on a frozen lake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH Saab 9000s fired-up instantly after a sub-zero night in the open
outside my hotel in Lillehammer, Norway. But one of them shed the frost from
its windscreen and side windows much faster than the other, and created far
less air pollution in the critical first few minutes of operation.
The secret was under its bonnet - a device Saab is pioneering and plans to
offer customers on its 1994 models. Technically, it is a heat accumulator
but think of it as a giant vacuum flask. It stores surplus heat so
effectively that, 72 hours after the engine has been switched off, the
coolant inside the flask is still at 78'C.
At the next 'cold' start, there are several benefits. The pre-warmed engine
reaches working temperature very quickly and the catalytic converter is soon
cleaning the exhaust gases. (Normally, there are several dirty minutes
because a catalyser has to be hot to work properly). Engine wear is reduced
and, as I saw in Lillehammer last week, the car heater defrosts the windows
quickly.
The accumulator will be an optional extra, costing not more than Pounds 500.
Environmental benefits apart, it saves petrol - enough, Saab reckons, for
typical Swedish owners to see their money back after three years.
Driving on icy roads is something at which the British are not very good
because they do it so rarely and their cars are not prepared for it. In
Scandinavia, most motorists have to cope with conditions that would keep UK
drivers at home for about five months each year.
The first thing they do is fit the right tyres, with treads made of a rubber
compound that stays flexible and reasonably grippy at low temperatures. They
also have more than 100 tungsten carbide studs protruding far enough from
the tread rubber to bite on ice.
On surfaces the British would consider as having zero grip, studded tyres
make driving quite easy providing you are sensible about it. They are
certainly not a licence for the speed you might use on wet roads with summer
tyres.
Outside Lillehammer, I drove two Saabs on a lake: a veteran 900 with a
turbo-charged 16-valve, two-litre engine, and the latest 2.3-litre 9000CS,
also turbo-charged.
The 9000 was easier to drive in the snow-packed and slippery conditions
because it had another aid to winter motoring. TCS stands for
traction-control system. It uses the electronic sensors of the ABS brakes in
combination with electronic throttle control to stifle wheel-spin. As soon
as a tyre loses grip, power to that wheel is reduced until it stops
spinning.
Not only does TCS increase traction so that you can re-start on an icy hill
 -it also makes the car handle more stably by curbing wheel-spin even when
accelerating round a bend. In effect, TCS, which is offered on both manual
and automatic 9000s, provides many of the benefits of full-time four-wheel
drive without its cost, complication and fuel consumption penalties.
So far this year, there has been no winter to speak of in the south-east of
England and Norway's snow was the first I had seen this year. But there is
still time for an Arctic spell; last year's main snowfall in the UK was in
February.
What can motorists do to make driving on ice or snow-covered roads safer and
less frightening? Obviously, having the right car is a help (although not
all of us can afford Saabs with their heated seats, TCS and ABS systems).
Saab's former rally ace, Erik Carlsson, now in his 60s, is still faster and
safer on ice than many of us are on dry roads. His tips include:
Take off heavy outer garments as soon as the car has warmed-up - they
restrict a driver's natural movements.
Change gear as smoothly as you can; jerking could start wheel-spin.
Stay in the ruts formed by other traffic on snow-covered roads. They could
be slippery, but it is safer to be in them.
Be very careful when changing lanes, especially in cars with rear-wheel
drive which do not have so much traction as those with front-wheel drive.
Slush and deep snow on either side drags on the car when you pull out to
overtake and can cause loss of control.
If you do get stuck, turn off the radio, open the side windows and listen to
the engine as you engage first or reverse and apply minimal throttle. Do not
let the wheels spin through excess power. The car might move only an inch or
two, but let it roll back and then try again. Gradually, the distance you
move will increase and there is every chance the vehicle will rock itself
free.
Take breaks. Driving in winter demands extra concentration and is more
tiring than in summer. Stop now and again, have a short walk, a snack or
just a breath of fresh air.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Soccer: Why Taylor can't please everyone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MONDAY at 1pm, England soccer manager Graham Taylor will put his head in
the lion's mouth again. He will announce his squad for the international
against France and brace himself for a roar of public disapproval. England
is a nation of would-be managers and every fan thinks he could name a better
team.
This is part of the ritual that accompanies each of England's mid-week
internationals during the season. It starts tomorrow when the Sunday papers
offer Taylor some tips for his team, and ends two weeks later when the same
papers take him to task for not following, or following, their advice.
In Taylor's 19 months as manager England have lost only once, but the fans
are growing restive. His considerable PR skill has been stretched to the
limit as he confronts the dilemma that faces the national team managers in
every leading soccer country.
On the one hand, England expects its men to qualify for both the European
Nations Cup and the World Cup. Anything less could cost Taylor his job. On
the other, it is not whether you win or lose but by how much you win. Taylor
has picked industrious, effective teams which have been criticised by fans
and journalists who yearn for a side with flair and are reluctant to accept
that English football is short of creative players.
It is not a uniquely-English problem. Carlos Bilardo, who as a player and a
manager epitomised the pragmatic side of Argentinian soccer, steered a
mediocre squad to the last World Cup final where they lost to a dubious
penalty.
That was not enough when set against the example of Argentina's exuberant
triumph at home in 1978. President Carlos Menem criticised Bilardo's
defensive approach and he was replaced after the cup.
Taylor is fortunate that England's only World Cup win, in 1966, came under
Alf Ramsey, an uncompromising utilitarian. His midfield contained Nobby
Stiles and Alan Ball, who employed their undoubted talent strictly in the
traditional role of the combative British wing-half: tackling, running and
making sensible passes.
The manager's dilemma is particularly acute for Taylor because of his
approach to the game. As the job of managers has become less and less
secure, they try to exert more and more control over the events that
determine whether they stay in work. Since they cannot kick the ball on
Saturdays, what counts is what they do on the training field the rest of the
week. In 19 years as a manager, Taylor has never been fired. He must be
doing something right.
His last team before England was Aston Villa, where chairman Doug Ellis has
always been quick to pull the trigger on managers. Taylor says: 'I made it
very clear from the word go that I was definitely going to be in total
charge of the football side of things.'
At Elton John's Watford, Taylor was one of the pioneers of the systematic,
long-ball game. It took Watford from the fourth division to an FA Cup final
and second place in the first division. At Villa, a slicker but equally
industrious and well-drilled team went from the second division to League
runners-up in three years. He knows better than to put his fate at the feet
of creative players.
'Don't kid me football is about style.' he says, 'If that's what you want,
okay, I'll produce an England side that plays lovely football. But it won't
win us many games.'
His problem is that fans want style. At Watford, for all his success, he was
barracked and once carried a placard saying 'I'm sorry' on to the pitch -
but stuck to his winning style. England fans remember and are suspicious.
On a recent television 'phone-in, Taylor found himself defending (yet again)
his decision to drop Tottenham's Paul Gascoigne, the archetypical
unpredictable midfield genius, for an international in November 1990. The
fans have also criticised Taylor for insisting that Gascoigne must have
recovered 100 per cent from his crippling knee injury before being
considered for the European finals in July. They suspect he is giving
himself leeway to omit Gazza again.
Taylor has learnt his lesson. Against Turkey last October, he brought back
two favourites, Bryan Robson and Chris Waddle. Both played poorly in a poor
England win. The public got the message: Robson was too old; Waddle, for all
his talent, was too erratic - and Taylor had a valid reason for discarding
them.
The struggle to replace Robson and Gascoigne has highlighted the problems
facing Taylor, Colin Bell, who played 48 times for England, said it took 20
games to find his international feet.
Over the past 12 months, England have appeared in just 12 games - four of
those on a trivial summer tour. In that time Taylor has played 12
midfielders. Six were included in his squad against Poland in November.
Of these, David Platt had won 20 caps. David Batty and Geoff Thomas both
made their debuts in 1991 and none of the other three had started an England
game.
Platt's goal-scoring touch apart, this group is short on flair. They are
dependable in the Stiles' mould - and at least four of them will be in
Monday's squad. But Taylor could not pick any other sort of player, even if
he wanted to. World-class players are always a scarce commodity.
England fans may pine for the time, just six years ago, when the World Cup
squad contained Robson, Glenn Hoddle, Peter Reid and Ray Wilkins, but that
team was short of top-class defenders. Injuries permitting, Taylor will be
able to pick a back four of Des Walker, Mark Wright, Paul Parker and Stuart
Pearce to play France on February 16, and again in Sweden in July.
It is, for Taylor, a happy distribution of wealth. The talent available
suits his approach. His team may not surprise opponents, but a tight defence
and a smothering midfield means that he is not going to get any nasty
shocks, either. His team's approach play is methodical rather than
imaginative. But that is a price Taylor is prepared to pay.
With Gary Lineker in attack, plenty of well-rehearsed free-kicks and corners
plus a touch of luck - Taylor has always been lucky - some of the
unprepossessing players in his squad on Monday could find themselves
collecting European medals in six months.

WELLY-Waders are designed to meet all welly needs in one fell swoop. The
idea came to Nicholas Stafford-Deitsch one day when he went walking in the
country in his usual country attire of wellies and anorak.
It started to rain and he arrived home with the trousers above the welly and
below the anorak cold, wet and uncomfortable. When he had dried out, he set
about inventing the Welly-Wader.
Its chief charm is that converts from being a standard-size welly into a
thigh-high wader more or less in seconds. Anybody who spends days out and
about in the country will see at once how useful this is.
For those who walk or shoot, it means the area between the top of the boot
and the bottom of the jacket can be protected if it starts to rain; for
those who fish, the thigh-high extension protects them when they get into
deeper water.
The boot is made much like most good-quality wellies to which a
PVC/polyester-lined fabric is welded. When the leggings are not at full
stretch, they sit neatly round the top of the boot enclosed and protected by
a poppered cuff. Its colour is - what else? - green.
Stafford-Deitsch has patented the idea and the Welly-Waders are made
specially for him in Denmark. They come with two different sorts of soles:
cleated for everyday use, and with tungsten studs for those who might be
wading in rivers with slippery stones.
Sizes are 6-12 and they cost Pounds 54.95 for the cleated version and Pounds
64.95 with the tungsten studs, both prices inclusive of postage and packing.
Buy them directly from the Edington Development Co., Dairy House Farm,
Edington, Westbury, Wiltshire BA13 4NP (tel. and fax 0380-870-076).
Traditional heavy-duty, galvanised-steel water butts, made in England and
embellished with a cast-lead plaque are sold by Simon Griffiths of 16 Main
Street, Kirby Muxloe, Leicester LE9 9AL (tel. 0533-393-594).
All are exact copies of 17th and 18th century models (except for the fact
that, originally, they were made of solid lead) and they can be ordered with
or without tap or lid. The numbers and letters on the plaque itself can be
altered to accommodate the year and the owner.
Allow eight weeks for orders. Price from about Pounds 750 (carriage extra).

FT  08 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: Be a card . . . and make someone your
Valentine - Some ways of bringing an extra touch of romance to that very
special person in your life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are those for whom the very notion of sending even a card, let alone a
present, for St Valentine's Day is quitec incomprehensible. Surely, they
mutter, nobody could be quite so daft. Then there are others - and all the
evidence seems to suggest there are plenty of them - for whom the day never
passes without some wonderfully daffy notion winging its way across town,
country or ocean.
Hardened cynics, or those who feel they have said it all, done it all or
just cannot be bothered, need not read on. Those who feel that perhaps a
present or a charming gesture might bring a little fun or a little pleasure
into somebody's life can choose between something as conventional as
flowers, chocolates or champagne - or as off-beat as a flight in an ancient
Tiger Moth. Here are just some of the options on offer.
Poverty is no excuse - sweet, old-fashioned postcards can be found in
antique shops such as Alfies Antique Market (13-25 Church Street, London NW8
8DT, tel. 071-723-6066) for as little as Pounds 3, while for Pounds 10 you
could buy a blue, heart-shaped ashtray.
If you are disorganised and busy (and who isn't?), just ring Paradigm
Management (081-785-9822) with your Visa or Access number and they can send
a full (Pounds 30) or half (Pounds 21.50) bottle of Laurent Perrier
champagne, plus a large heart-shaped helium-filled balloon, to any part of
greater London.
The Museum Store (37 The Market, The Piazza, Covent Garden, London WC2E 8RF)
has lots of charming, inexpensive ideas: a mini-volume of Love Quotes
(Pounds 3.25) from the New York Public Library ('I like not only to be
loved, but to be told I am loved.' - George Eliot); reproduction earrings
(one black, one white faux pearl, Pounds 19.99) from the Goddess of Love in
Rubens's 17th-century painting Venus before the Mirror; or the matrimony jug
(Pounds 16.95) from the Longue Vue Collection, New Orleans.
The South Bank Centre Craft Shop and Gallery at the Royal Festival Hall,
London SE1, is the place for crafts and one-off pieces. There, four
post-graduate designers from the Royal College of Art have the sort of
avant-garde pieces that catch the eye of people like Prince, Jazzie B, Paula
Abdul and Enya, not to mention up-to-the-minute media folk. This is where
you go to show you really are in touch with what's happening NOW. Everything
from waistcoats to spectacles, from ear-rings to bodies and ties can be
found at prices ranging from Pounds 20-250.
Baskets of miniature roses, hyacinths, primulas or narcissus will be sent on
The Day for Pounds 7.50 by The Flowersmith, 34 Shelton Street, Covent
Garden, London WC2 (tel. 071-240-6688). Or a posy of fresh roses, lilies,
anemones, tulips and dill with silver/green foliage from Pounds 15.
The ultimate present for the rugger fan: Pounds 2,000 buys a 10-year
debenture for the new stand at Twickenham. Write to the Rugby Football
Union, Twickenham, London TW1 1DZ (tel. 081-892-8161).
Finally, if you are one of the not-so-little band without a nearest and
dearest - do not despair. Buy yourself a present (it's a leap year,
remember) and invest in membership of Drawing Down The Moon, the yuppie
introduction agency. Membership sounds expensive (Pounds 646.25, although
you get a 10 per cent discount if you join on your first visit), but for
that you get a personal, in-depth interview (so, of course, have all the
people to whom you are about to be introduced), and a year's active
membership (which means plenty of introductions).
Drawing Down The Moon will NOT take on people for whom it feels it will be
unable to find suitable partners (for women, I am afraid, that means you
should be under 43, and under 55 for men) and it takes on only what it
describes as graduates, professional and business people or people in the
creative world. (7-11 Kensington High Street, London, tel. 071-937-8880).
Better, perhaps, than any consumer durable is a day to remember. A
90-year-old friend of ours, for instance, had the birthday of a lifetime
when his son booked him a trip in a hot-air balloon. Red Letter will
organise a range of special experiences - from a day's rally driving at
Silverstone (Pounds 199) or a weekend learning to hang-glide (Pounds 95) to
a flight in a Tiger Moth (Pounds 125, pictured here) or a pistol-shooting
session (Pounds 39). For those whose tastes run to more passive treats, it
would fix-up a day at a health spa (from Pounds 45) or a trip on the Orient
Express (from Pounds 129); the list is endless. If you are interested, write
to Red Letter Days, Freepost, London N3 1BR (or, to order in time for
Valentine's Day, ring 081-343-0822). Red Letter sends a charming letter
explaining the gift and giving all the options on day, time and location.
The lucky recipient has about four months to decide and can also change it
for any of the other 150 ideas (with a price adjustment if necessary, of
course).
For real sentimentality, the Victorians leave the rest of us standing. When
it comes to a good old treacly wallow, Forget-Me-Nots, A Victorian Book of
Love by Cynthia Hart, John Grossman and Tracy Gill (Pounds 6.99) is hard to
beat although it carries the slight risk that it might put the loved-one off
the whole thing for life. Forget-Me-Nots (in the immortal words of the
frontispiece) 'celebrates these sweet sentiments and evokes them anew for
dear friends, lovers and beloveds.' There are lots of authentically soppy
Victorian drawings, cards and photographs to match the words.
As somebody once said, memorably: 'Once you spend more than Pounds 8 on a
watch, you are moving out of the realm of the strictly functional and into
the realm of fantasy.' If fantasy, then you might as well do it properly.
Chaumet's Anneau watch has a classically-plain and charming white face and
solid gold frame and comes with a choice of bracelets made from
semi-precious stones. The one photographed here is made from turquoise beads
but you can choose between amethyst, haematite, lapis lazuli and pearls as
well. Pounds 1,900 in semi-precious stones, Pounds 3,600 with pearl or gold
beads. Chaumet is at 178 New Bond Street, London W1Y 9PD (tel.
071-493-5403).
For HIM - some cuff-links, perhaps? But not just any old cuff-links: a
little quelque chose from a jeweller as grand as Boucheron ought to go down
a treat and could solve your present problems for years to come. First you
give him the gold base (Pounds 425) and then (one by one) you give him the
stones to put in them - leopardwood, tiger's eye, onyx and rock crystal are
all Pounds 150 while coral is Pounds 350 and lapis lazuli Pounds 525. Also
available by mail order.
Yves St-Laurent's costume jewellery has gone a bundle on hearts this year.
Whether it be necklaces, brooches, chains or earrings, hearts are
everywhere. These earrings are gold-plated on pewter, with ruby-coloured and
fuchsia stones, and come with a two-year guarantee (something that few
costume jewellers offer). Pounds 80 from most good department stores
including Harvey Nichols, Harrods, House of Fraser and Larizzi at Boston
Spa.
An 18-carat, gold-plated, heart-shaped brooch with blue stone, by Cabouchon,
Pounds 19.99. Order by telephone: 081-877-3050. Lots more inexpensive chunky
costume jewellery is available by mail order. Ask for the catalogue if you
are interested.

FT  08 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: For damask, read Denny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PENNY LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST indelible memory of many a festivity is the crumpled array of
stained napkins, red wine and gravy usually being the worst culprits. There
comes a point when no amount of laundering will erase those telltale brown
blobs and replacements are the only answer.
But where to find them? Everywhere you turn, from department store to
speciality shop, there are fancy versions: lace-edge, hand-stitched - and
expensive. What few of them can be bothered to stock is good, old-fashioned,
fine-quality and unfussy plain damask linen.
The place to head for is P. Denny, in the heart of London's Soho. A
long-standing chef and restaurant supplier (established in 1923), Denny is
used to restaurants demanding three dozen waiters' cloths 'sharpish.' Here
you can find basic kitchen and dining-room linen ranging from the humble
oven cloth to starched table napery and brocade waiters' waistcoats, all at
exceptionally low prices.
What is more, Denny runs a mail-order service, both in the UK and
internationally. The invoices carry the company logo of a saluting bell-boy
and sum-up the shop's atmosphere perfectly.
Denny is worth a visit just to see the shop fittings. Glazed window
cupboards, installed when it was built, are still in service, decked out
with statuesque chefs in chequered trousers and neckties. The original
mahogany and brass glazed counters display boxes of brightly-coloured silk
cuff knots (Pounds 4.95), Eton St George artificial silk armbands (Pounds
2.15), collar studs (35p) and a range of bow ties (Pounds 3.95).
If what you want is working linen that will not be turned into a limp rag
after the first wash, Denny has a vast range that time has revealed can
withstand the rigours of a hotel kitchen and dining-room. It ought,
therefore, to do more than just survive yours.
A white damask tablecloth can be ordered in various sizes to fit most
domestic dining tables. An average-sized cloth, 90 in by 54 in, costs Pounds
18.25. White damask napkins are only Pounds 1.80 each.
If you are tired of tea-cloths that seem to absorb only enough moisture to
dry one tumbler, Denny sells an excellent linen glass cloth (Pounds 2.35)
and the heaviest-duty oven cloth I have ever seen for just Pounds 5.45.
If you need to kit-out a chef, Denny is where you should find what you need
(in Paris, chefs' kits are all the rage among the trendy youth, who head for
La Samaritaine to buy their little white or blue-and-white checked chefs'
jackets to wear over their leggings). A double-breasted chef's jacket will
give the man of the house an authoritative presence, even if his culinary
skill extends only to whipping up scrambled egg. The traditional chef's
toque (Pounds 2.85), that sits surprisingly snugly on the head, is an
excellent fun birthday present.
For messy cooks, for whom spillage is all part of the creativity, the
caterers' chef aprons are sturdy protectors: starched white cotton
waist-to-floor wrap-arounds with tie straps are Pounds 3.10, while the
traditional striped butchers' aprons in blue, green or red are Pounds 4.75
(with pocket). And to keep the whole ensemble in shape, Denny even supplies
sock suspenders, each pair boxed individually for just Pounds 3.25.
P. Denny &amp; Co., 39 Old Compton Street, London W1V 6NP. Tel. 071-437-1654 for
the catalogue and mail orders.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Food: The pizzaiulo's secret art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIN COTTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY we begin a series evoking the pleasures of Street Food. Food that is
often at its freshest, cooked in the simplest manner and ready to attack
your digestive system at its most receptive - when your appetite has been
heightened by the smells of cooking. Street Food is inexpensive and without
pretension. It is quick, satisfying and breaks down any language barrier -
if in doubt, you just point. It is theatre, as crepes are folded, kebabs
grilled or noodles ladled. Above all it is evocative of both time and place.
We begin in southern Italy, on the streets of Naples, to taste pizza as it
is meant to be eaten.
THE TRAGEDY of eating pizza in Naples - generally regarded as the home of
true pizza - is that once you have savoured its excellence, you will never
be satisfied with anything less. And, until you return to Naples, less is
all you will get.
In this atmospheric, harsh Italian city, pizza is a part of daily life. It
is sold everywhere: in grand elaborate restaurants, popular pizzerias and in
just about every bar and cafe, where simple pizzetti are eaten as snacks
throughout the day. They come in many varieties and sizes, are inexpensive
and are always delicious.
The Brandi (Salita S. Anita Di Palazzo, 1-2), at the foot of the notoriously
dark Spanish Quarters, is Italy's oldest surviving pizzeria. It was here
that the margherita or Neapolitan pizza was created in 1889 for a party
given by the Queen of Savoy.
The pizzaiulo - pizza chef - accustomed to topping his pizza with a simple
tomato sauce and o'cacillo, a medium hard cheese simular to caciotta, wanted
to prepare something special for the monarch, and decided to cover his pizza
with the colours of the national flag. To represent red, he used a
traditional tomato sauce. To this he added fior di latte, the white,
mozzarella-type cheese that is used in pizza today, and over them he
scattered a few leaves of fresh, green basil.
His work was a simple but ingenious combination of tastes, and the result a
tremendous success. Following the praises of her celebrated guests, the
Queen came to thank the pizzaiulo. On asking him what his pizza was called,
the emotional creator repied that he would like to name it after her -
Margherita.
True to the original tradition of pizza as a simple, economical food for the
masses is Da Michele, situated in the busy Forcella Quarters of the old
city. (Via Colletta. Open 9.30am - to 11pm Friday to Saturday.) In this
small, traditional pizzeria the only pizzas on the menu are the margherita,
and marinara - covered in tomato sauce, garlic and oregano. A regular
12-inch pizza costs L3,000 (Pounds 1.70), but if you want to pay L4,000 or
more, the pizzaiulo will add cheese and sauce.
The philosophy of Da Michele, and the probable reason that queues form on
the street every day, is written on a placard hanging beside the
igloo-shaped oven: 'Ever since the days of affluence, all people can think
of is finance, and even the lowly pauper wants to buy a fancy pizza. But
don't ask us for complicated pizzas. They're a hassle to make, they empty
your purse and leave you with a stomach ache]'
Da Michele is run by four brothers, the grandchildren of the pizzeria's
founder, Michele Condurro, whose solemn portrait watches over the simple,
green-washed restaurant alongside that of Saint Antonio, the patron saint of
bakers. Antonio, the youngest brother, explains how they have continued to
sell up to 900 pizzas a day since setting up on the site in 1930:
'It is not difficult to make pizza - anybody can do it - but, to make it
well is an art. First, you have to know exactly how much flour, water, yeast
and salt to add, and how to mix it. We always make our pasta (dough) the day
before, adding only a small amount of yeast and allowing it to rise over 15
hours. This way our crust stays soft and light. From there on it is the
skill of the pizzaiulo that makes a pizza good or not. To be a good
pizzaiulo takes years of practice, and even then some people just cannot get
it right'.
The pizzaiulo at Di Michele is Antonio's uncle, Genario. To make a pizza, he
takes a small quantity of dough, gently flattens it on a marble counter,
covers it with toppings (including a generous lashing of olive oil) and
places it on a pala - a long wooden spatula, which the fornaio (baker)
places in a wood-burning oven. The pizza is cooked in the intense heat for
less than two minutes. Just before it is removed, wood shavings are tossed
into the fire, causing a surge of flame that lightly burns the crust and
cheese.
The process does not look difficult - they never 'play Frisbee' with the
dough as flashy pizzaiulos do in Britain, and, in fact, they laugh at the
suggestion - but the end product takes talent. The pizzas are served on
simple marble tables, with bottles of cola or beer. At lunchtime, an old
accordion player adds his Neapolitan gaiety to the shouts of the waiters,
chefs and customers.
For a more leisurely pizza, the nearby Trianon Pizzeria (Via Pietro Colletta
42-44-46, closed Wednesdays), is considered by many to be the best in town.
Contrary to Michele, Trianon offers an extensive selection of pizzas, from
margherita to marinaresca (shellfish, calamari, shrimp, tomato sauce, garlic
and parsley), and salsiccia e frilarielli - spicy sausage and muster greens.
The pizzas are more expensive here, but they are big - it is virtually
impossible to eat a whole one yourself. The huge, high-ceilinged dining area
is airy and relaxed - a welcome break from the chaotic streets.
In the same quarters, Bellini (Via Santa Maria di Costantinopoli 80) is
highly regarded by Neapolitans for both its pizza and traditional Neapolitan
cuisine, particularly its superb linguini in catoccio - mixed seafood baked
with linguini in parchment.
Nearby, in the main artery of the shopping area, Via Toledo - known
popularly as Via Roma - simple pizzetti to eat at the bar or on the street
is sold in the crowded Rosticcerie. Of note is LUISE, near the magnificent
galleria and San Carlo opera house. Away from the crowds, on the sea front
in Mergellina, is Ciro (closed Wednesdays) which charges Pounds 8 for pizza
and roughly Pounds 38 for a full evening meal per person, with wine.
If you can take more, La Pizza a metro (Piazza San Luigi) sells Pizza by the
metre. Loud groups of Neapolitans crowd around into this popular place,
stuffing pizza into their mouths, calling out to one another across tables
and laughing madly as a seemingly never-ending, two-metre pizza is pulled
from the huge oven and served.
In Rome, do as the Romans do. In Naples, eat pizza.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Despatches (Buenos Aires): Argentina names its Nazis - The
secret files that shed light on a murky world of intrigue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Argentina's National Archives opens its doors at 10am on Monday
morning, the bundles of yellowing, tattered memos, telegrams, letters,
forms, fingerprint cards and newspaper cuttings that constitute the formerly
top secret files on the Nazi connection will at last become public
knowledge.
The files that President Carlos Menem ceremoniously ordered declassified
this week are unlikely to reveal any sensational new clues on Nazis in South
America. But the documents depict vividly the extraordinary sense of
security some of the world's most wanted criminals felt in Argentina, not
just under the junta that first let them in, but under subsequent civilian
and military governments as well.
Shimon Samuels, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, the organisation established
to trace former Nazis, who sifted through the records for four hours on
Wednesday, says: 'They confirmed what we already knew. It's the tip of the
iceberg, the beginning of a process. But what is really striking was the
total indifference of (Argentine) governments to the Nazis.'
Although Samuels says there are gaps in the files - where they were probably
purged of embarrassing or incriminating material - we can still read that
Josef Mengele, the notorious Angel of Death, lived undisturbed in Buenos
Aires for ten years following his arrival in Argentina in 1949.
In one remarkable Federal Police document dated November 9 1956, the West
German consulate confirms Mengele's identity, providing a copy of his birth
certificate. Mengele used the certificate to shed the alias of Gregor Helmut
and assume his true identity, complete with authentic Argentine documents.
Nobody in Bonn or Buenos Aires, it seems, ever thought of arresting him.
The Nazis' quiet, peaceful life in Buenos Aires ended suddenly in 1960, when
a Mossad team captured Adolf Eichmann and took him to Israel for trial and
execution. Some Nazis, like Mengele, fled. He went to Paraguay and later to
Brazil, where he is believed to have died in 1979.
Another police letter shows why many were right to stay put. The letter,
rejecting a German request to extradite Mengele shortly after Eichmann's
arrest, states that: 'The Argentine government informs that it has denied
the request because of failures of formality and procedure, since
extra-officially it had been explained that the crimes alleged against the
accused are of political character, and thus it would not be correct to
accept the request.'
It is easy to see how lesser criminals such as Abraham Kipp, a Dutch Nazi,
were able not only to evade arrest but to acquire Argentine citizenship and
live out the rest of their Israelis, who had other concerns, decided to
abort the hunt for Mengele and other war criminals, and the Germans and
Argentines never showed much energy in arresting Nazis.
Only two Nazi suspects out of at least 16 known to have lived in Argentina
were ever arrested. During the 1980s, when Raul Alfonsin was president, the
police arrested Walter Kutschman, who died while in custody, and Josef
Schwamberger, who is awaiting trial in Germany. Both were charged with mass
murders.
Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, has claimed that the military junta that
ruled Argentina in 1945 handed out thousands of passports to fleeing Nazis
through its consulates in Lisbon, Madrid and Rome. The role of the Spanish
and Italian authorities in assisting the Nazis is now well-established. Over
the years it emerged that even Red Cross officials and Catholic churchmen
helped Nazis to escape.
Juan Peron came to power in Argentina in 1947 and remained president until
he was toppled in 1955. He was also a key figure in the previous junta and
his fascination for the Nazis, and especially the Fascist movement, is
well-known. But Tomas Eloy Martinez, an Argentine historian, says Peron's
post-war relationship with Nazis was more opportunistic.
He believes Peron was motivated by an admiration for the 'superiority' of
German technology despite the Nazi defeat. He felt Nazi brain power would
help industrialise Argentina and modernise the armed forces. Nonetheless,
Martinez comments wryly: 'Buenos Aires was short on (Nazi) brains and long
on criminals.'
Samuels adds that 'there is speculation of Nazi payoffs.' Files from the
Central Bank could throw light on the widely-held belief in Argentina that
the Nazis brought tons of bullion with them.
Anti-semitism has deep roots in Argentina and Nazi and Fascist tracts are
still widely available at the late-night bookshops in central Buenos Aires.
Following Eichmann's arrest, police memoranda show that officers were busier
tracking possible Israeli agents than in hunting for other Nazis. Indeed,
police warnings are believed to have allowed suspects to evade arrest.
Rabbi Morton Rosenthal, of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League, added
that there is a link between the Nazi presence in Argentina and the thuggery
with which the armed forces there suppressed political opposition.
The forces resorted to abductions, torture and mass murders during the
'Dirty War' of the 1970s, in which between 6,000 and 30,000 people died or
'disappeared.' Rabbi Rosenthal says: 'There are reports of torturers singing
Nazi songs and Nazi flags hanging in police stations.' Jews, some of whom
were children of concentration camp survivors, were often subjected to
especially severe treatment.
It is an irony that has not escaped human rights activists that Menem not
only pardoned a year ago the generals who sanctioned the killing, but turned
down requests that secret police and armed forces files also be opened.
Menem has also been attacked from within his own Peronist party for allowing
the memory of Juan Peron to be sullied by opening the files.
The declassification of the Argentine files coincides with the opening of
historical and security police archives in east Germany and the countries of
the former Soviet Union and the information cross-referenced.
The pressure is now on other Latin American countries to come clean. A key
target is Paraguay, where former dictator Alfredo Stroessner offered
citizenship to wanted Nazis, including Mengele. Rabbi Rosenthal says that
despite the new democratic government's promise 'to throw out all the
trash', it has not kept its word to arrest two Ukrainian criminals still
living in Paraguay.
It may be true that there are few war criminals left alive, making Menem's
decision little more than a politically astute gesture. However, Jewish
leaders are genuinely impressed by the efforts of Menem  - who is of Syrian
descent - to respond to the anxieties of Argentina's 300,000 to 400,000
Jews. He has spoken in synagogues, visited Israel, banned a local Nazi
grouping and scrapped a missile being developed with Egypt and Iraq. If
nothing else, they say, opening files will help Argentines and people
everywhere to remember the Holocaust.

I HAVE been persuaded by Midland bank to change my old-fashioned current

overdrawn.
Interest payable is of course not an allowable charged for taxation
purposes, but what of interest credited? Can I net these interest items for
tax purposes or should I just ignore both credits and debits.
The interest debited is, as you say, ignored in calculating your tax bill.
The interest credited will be net after deduction of basic-rate tax, so you
will only have more tax to pay on it if you are a higher-rate taxpayer.
The tax withheld would be repayable to you if your personal allowance etc.
had not been absorbed elsewhere, of course.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): A change of management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE used a self-select PEP plan manager since December 1988. But my
choice is sadly under-performing and I would like to make changes. It is
obvious that my ability to make good selections is inadequate and therefore
I suppose I should seek a managed investment.
My preferred route would be an investment trust and I would like to know to
what extent this is permitted.
1) Is it permitted to sell any shares in existing general equity PEPs and
buy investment trust shares - if so, is the amount restricted by year of
investment and/or by proportion?
2a) Would it be possible to make a full disposal and via the PEP apply for a
new issue of a particular class of investment trust share (income)?
2b) Could I over-apply for package units via the PEP and extract the capital
shares, leaving income shares tax sheltered?
3) How will the rules apply to the new single company PEPs viz: established
investment trusts and new issue investment trusts?
4) How do the rules on purchase of established trusts apply re dividends
accruing within the PEP?
The Inland Revenue has been good enough to provide us with the information
to help answer your points.
1) It is possible, in principle, to sell UK ordinary shares and replace them
with qualifying investment trust shares, 'provided that immediately after
the switch the total market value of the investment trust content of the
portfolio does not exceed 50 per cent of the market value of the whole
portfolio (including uninvested cash)'. A 'qualifying' investment trust
needs, broadly speaking, to be at least 50 per cent invested in UK and other
EC companies.
2a) It is impossible to make a full disposal and then, via the PEP, apply
for a new issue of income shares. 'The problem is not the class of
investment trust share applied for, but that the maximum 50 per cent
investment trust content may not be exceeded.'
2b) If you apply outside the PEP, in a public offer, then it is up to you to
decide which shares to transfer under the 42 day rule, but the amount
transferred must not exceed Pounds 6,000, less any earlier transfers or cash
subscriptions.
3) Investment trusts have no role at all in single company PEPs, unless you
happen to be employed by an investment trust which has a Save As You Earn
scheme.
This is the only way in which investment trust shares can be transferred
into a PEP, and there is no way in which they can be purchased into a PEP.
4) Dividends received in respect of investment trust shares held in a plan
enjoy full PEP exemption, according to the Revenue. Thus, both the net
dividend and the tax credit reclaimed from the Revenue can be reinvested in
further investment trust shares.
There is one exception to this - if you have a 'mixed' plan holding both
ordinary equities and investment trusts, the 50 per cent rule must not be
broken. If the equities are not performing well, this might be a limit on
performance.
The Revenue added that PEPs are deliberately not dealt with locally.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Tales from the skin trade - Nick
Garnett meets Angus Greenlees, who does chic things with chickens' feet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHEN WE had the shop people would come in wanting to buy something unusual.
They would look around the eelskin range, examine some pieces made out of
salmon skin and if they couldn't find want they wanted, as a last resort, we
would say: 'Well, we have some things in chickens' feet.' They would either
run out of the shop or turn round, like what they saw and buy it.'
Angus Greenlees is in the skin trade. Exotic skin: wallets and shoes in
eelskin, hip flasks in salmon skin, handbags in the skin and bone wrapping
which envelops the stingray. No chinchilla, sable or mink in sight, but this
year will see personal accessories in lizardskin-like chickens' feet
covering and the snake look-alike pelt of the frog.
'People like the feel of natural leathers, but with most exotic skins you
are encroaching on the environment,' Greenlees says. 'I am trying to create
an alternative which doesn't offend people, using leathers people like the
feel of, but can be assured that their use is not destroying a species or
over-exploiting the environment. They are skins from creatures caught
principally for food.'
Using factories in South Korea and Thailand as well as Northamptonshire (for
salmon skin products), Greenlees buys in a wide range of goods, from
penholders and spectacle cases to belts and briefcases. They are all made
out of the type of fishy hide that hardly comes first to mind when buying
hubby's slippers or aunt Agatha's lipstick case.
Environmentally friendly it might be, but putting Greenlees Leathers on a
sound financial footing is proving more troublesome. Sales of Pounds 100,000
in 1990 rose to Pounds 120,000 last year, providing the company with a net
profit of a few thousand pounds. Greenlees, its only employee, took a salary
of about Pounds 10,000. Stocks are expensive to hold, the recession has
badly hit the market and there is a larger competitor run by Greenlees'
former partner, Michael Benjamin. Nevertheless, the 28-year-old agriculture
graduate hopes to open a shop in central London this year, supplementing the
mail order business he runs from his home.
Benjamin had a shop in London selling eelskin products which Greenlees
joined in 1989, the partnership breaking up the following year. When
Greenlees Leathers was established, Greenlees put in Pounds 30,000 of his
own money, mainly to purchase stock. He also arranged a bank overdraft
facility of Pounds 15,000.
Members of his family out in Thailand, where stingrays are farmed for food,
supplied the names of companies using the soft but tough armour-plated skin
 -which includes the ray's central jewel bone - to make purses, wallets,
shimmering handbags and briefcases. The salmon skin is tanned in tonshire
manufacturer provides Greenlees with flasks, jewel boxes, jewellery, wallets
and waistcoats.
A wide range of eelskin-covered products form the backbone of the company.
The eel that is used is eptatretus bergeri, a primitive creature scavenging
off dead creatures deep in the Pacific. The eels are caught in something
similar to giant lobster pots and landed in South Korea. Slime is scraped
off, they are then soaked in degreasing fluids and dropped into revolving
vats with tanning chemicals and dyes. The eel's unique skin structure, with
tiny latticed collagen fibres, provides stronger material than that of a
calf but is one tenth as thick and with no smell. You would not know the
smooth material was eel except for the giveaway marking, a few millimetres
thick, which runs down the middle of the creature's back.
Items made from sea animals are not cheap. An eelskin jacket wallet retails
at Pounds 28, wholesale Pounds 11.50. An eelskin handbag retails at Pounds
108, wholesale Pounds 46. A briefcase made from the skins of four small
stingrays costs Pounds 350 retail.
For a lot of people, using the pelt of a slimy creature verges on the
creepy. So who would buy things made from these unusual pelts? 'We are in
the gift business', says Greenlees. 'We are not in the fashion business. For
one thing that would involve holding too much stock. A lot of our customers
are middle aged women buying for themselves or their husbands.'
Stocks, which are held in a warehouse, can total Pounds 40,000. 'Stocks are
what cripples me,' says Greenlees. To help defer the cost, Greenlees uses
the credit facilities of his Korean manufacturers which charge interest of 9
per cent. Retail gross margins are 75 per cent on eelskin products, slightly
less for salmon 'leather'.
Establishing a comprehensive sales operation has proved a problem. Greenlees
operates a mail order scheme with a client base of about 1,200 and uses
agents paid on commission only. He also sells wholesale directly to shops
and stores but this has proved an uphill battle. Setting up a dedicated
retail outlet in London this year will be a significant step in hooking more
customers, Greenlees argues.
'The biggest growth area will be sales to the retail trade and our own shop
will help with that.' There are also plans to make special items for
corporate purchases, such as pouches for a gift clock and mobile phone
cases.
The past year's growth has been 'disappointing', says Greenlees. 'It is just
a question of keeping my head down and consolidating and growing the
business. I may be disappointed but I am still here.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: You cannot beat the system -
Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WENT to a talk given by an eminent authority on small businesses. He was
planning a study on the administrative burden that VAT inflicted on small
businesses. The other members in the audience agreed - accounting for VAT
was a big problem. There are even consultants who specialise in teaching
businessmen how to handle VAT.
But if small businessmen are having trouble with their VAT return it is not
because VAT is difficult. It is because they are disorganised; they are not
working to any system. Because they have no system they know the VAT return
is going to be a difficult job, so they put it off until the last minute.
Late at night on the last day before the deadline, they work out the inputs
and outputs on the back of an envelope and fill in the return. Three months
later when the next return has to be filled in they look at this envelope
and cannot remember how they arrived at the figures. So it is yet more work
to unravel what they did last quarter before they can get started on the new
one.
All this is unnecessary. With even the most elementary manual system the VAT
figures virtually jump out of the daybooks straight into the VAT return.
To take a different example on a larger scale: one of your company's main
suppliers rings up and says you are behind on paying your bills and you owe
Pounds 10,512.56. Now. Otherwise he stops deliveries.
In a disorganised company, this may be the first inkling anyone has that
there is a serious problem. Managers must drop everything to handle this
emergency. First, you have to find out if you do really owe Pounds
10,512.56. Which invoices make up the total; are they all overdue? If not,
perhaps we can offer to pay some now, the balance later? So having worked
out which invoices are involved, you have to work out whether you have the
cash in the bank to cover a hefty cheque. And remember to leave enough to
cover next week's wages. If there is not enough cash you will have to chase
some customers to pay their bills. Whose invoices are overdue? Find out, and
then get on the phone to them.
In a company which is organised, you know there is a problem before the
supplier rings. A system is in operation which automatically gives you the
details of which invoices you owe, how much money you have in the bank, and
so on. Therefore, before it blows up into a crisis, you can sit down, look
at the figures and work out what to do. You can ring your supplier, tell him
that things are a bit tight because several big bills are coming due at the
same time but you propose to do A, B and C - is this OK? Usually it is.
You have taken the initiative by ringing him first. It shows you are on top
of the situation and he feels he can trust you.
Note also the enormous savings in management time. You could have wasted a
couple of hours in panic on that call. But being forewarned by a good
system, you could see the problem arising and sort it out before it blew up
into a crisis. With a good system, you might not have had to do anything at
all. Your bookkeeper saw the problem coming up, planned what to do, got your
agreement and then went ahead and did it.
The distinction is between effort and effectiveness. The organised business
is quiet and relaxed. In a disorganised business the managers waste hours
chasing their own tails.
So what exactly is a system? The designer of a system takes a complex task
and breaks it down into its parts and then puts the parts back together in
as logical and simple a procedure as possible, effectively reducing it to a
standard set of steps, a routine. Someone trained to follow these logical
steps can handle a complex task quite easily.
Designing systems is not a natural skill. In industry there are Organisation
and Methods specialists and systems analysts who specialise in this work.
But because keeping financial records is basically the same for any company,
you will find that systems to help you keep accurate financial records are
available off the shelf.
There is one key question about any system - who is going to run it? Unless
the company is very small, record-keeping needs to be the task of someone
other than the management. Managers are constantly being interrupted by
customers, employees, problems. Managers are concerned not with important
matters, but with urgent ones. Financial records are not urgent, so if the
manager has to keep them they will always be out of date.
The person who keeps the books should not be in the firing line.
Record-keeping is the task of second-line management, not first-line. This
is why big companies are so much better at running computers than small
ones. Big companies have intelligent second-line staff who can handle
problems without help from the bosses. Small companies often have no
competent second-line staff at all.
To be effective, systems have to be run systematically. The operator must be
intelligent, methodical, disciplined. Such people cost money. You have to
decide the priorities for your company here. Do you forego that big company
car and the pension scheme in order to spend the money on good quality admin
staff? It is an old adage that first-rate managers employ first-rate people;
second-rate managers employ third-rate people. What sort of manager are you?

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (An Adviser's View): Think hard before
moving offshore - The implications of Labour winning the general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSH is on, with financial advisers suddenly in demand. Usually, there
is an annual surge of activity at this time because of the coming Budget and
the end of the tax year on April 5. But now there is a powerful extra
incentive: the chance of the Labour Party winning the general election and
changing the whole tax structure radically.
Labour is thought unlikely to act retrospectively to nullify existing
arrangements, except possibly to cancel any changes made in next month's
Budget. So, people want to take advantage of existing tax-saving
opportunities while they can - just in case.
Labour's statement that it might phase-in its plan to scrap the ceiling on
National Insurance contributions by employees has created extra uncertainty.
What, for example, would happen to the proposed 9 per cent surcharge on
investment income over Pounds 3,000 a year? This is supposed to ensure that
those with 'unearned' income also are liable for the extra amount paid by
workers following abandonment of the NI ceiling. But if the ceiling is
retained, then surely it would be equally unfair just to add an extra tax on
unearned income.
There are plenty ofother questions to be answered.
Personal equity plans and business expansion schemes are on the potential
hit list for scrapping by Labour, and there are question marks as to what
will happen to capital gains tax and pensions. Traditionally, those with
accumulated wealth have looked to transfer their money abroad to try to keep
it safe from the clutches of a socialist government intent on 'soaking the
rich.' But times have changed and any such move needs careful consideration.
Labour Party representatives, including shadow chancellor John Smith, have
made clear that they do not intend to re-introduce exchange controls. For a
start, such a move would be incompatible with membership of the European
Community. And such restrictions would, in any case, be very difficult to
enforce because of the international financial networks that now allow money
to be transferred so easily and quickly.
What Labour might do is use the tax system to discourage any big flow of
funds from the UK. This could be achieved by using both the carrot and the
stick. Either favourable tax concessions could be confined to domestic
investments, or tax penalties could be imposed on money or assets being
transferred, or held, abroad by British citizens.
UK residents already must pay tax on their world-wide assets, including
earnings from offshore investments and deposit accounts, even if no money is
actually brought into Britain. Since 1989, they also must pay tax on capital
gains made from switching between sub-funds in 'umbrella' funds offshore.
Special action was taken in 1984 to block the tax loophole provided by
roll-up, or accumulation, funds which avoided any immediate tax liability by
distributing only a small percentage of any income arising from interest or
dividend receipts. Instead, the value of the fund was rolled-up.
It was decided that any gains from such funds would, when eventually brought
back to the UK, become liable to income, rather than capital gains, tax. At
that time, the top rates of income tax were a lot higher. This measure is
now less punitive because income and capital gains tax rates have been
equalised. But gains from roll-up funds cannot take advantage of the capital
gains indexation allowance or the annual exemption, which is at present
higher than the income tax allowance.
Nevertheless, an excellent guide just produced by Guinness Flight and
written by Donald Elkin, a long-time contributor to the Weekend FT, points
out that offshore roll-up funds have special attractions for UK investors -
especially those thinking about living or retiring abroad. Their main
advantage is that they enable you to defer paying tax until it suits you -
preferably when UK rates, or your personal tax liabilities, are at a low
level.
If you are planning to leave Britain, possibly on retiring, you might be
able to avoid paying any UK tax at all. So, anyone thinking of moving abroad
would be well advised to consider the offshore route.
For those remaining in Britain, however, there is a dilemma. Would moving
funds offshore before the election really be of any benefit if Labour won?
If you are strongly anti-Labour, it could allow you to sleep easily at
nights. You might also avoid any restrictive taxes that were introduced.
But you could also find yourself in an awkward situation where your overseas
investments would face unfavourable tax treatment that would cost you more
in the long run.
Anyone thinking about investing offshore also has to consider that,
normally, there are extra costs, simply because there is an additional
administrative layer. These costs are reflected in higher charges, which can
negate the benefits for a fund of operating in a tax haven.
Then, there is the extra risk, or inconvenience, factor. If the money is in
Britain, then at least the UK regulatory and legal systems can provide some
direct protection and you can even check physically on the people holding
your funds.
It is a different matter offshore, though. You might have no idea of where
your money is being held or the workings of the local legal and regulatory
systems. It will probably be much more complicated, and costly, to deal with
any disputes. In some cases, it might be a lengthy process to prove
ownership should the named holder of the fund or account die.
If you do not like the prospect of a Labour government, there is no Berlin
wall to prevent you, or your money, from going anywhere in the world. But
unless you feel that moving money into an offshore fund is justified in its
own right to suit your needs, there could be little to gain from
anticipating an event that might never happen.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Options in a busted market - What
happens to share incentives when a company collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLIGHT of pensioners in insolvent companies has been in the news. The
other big employee benefit - share incentives - is even less likely to have
any value if a company collapses. But though the shares will be worthless,
the ways in which the main employee share schemes are structured will
mitigate employee losses.
Far and away the most popular incentive plan is the executive share option
scheme. Selected executives are given the right to buy their employer's
shares in the future at a fixed price - usually the market value when the
right is created. If all goes well and the share price hardens optionholders
will be able to pick up stock at low cost.
But if the company becomes insolvent - or, for that matter, suffers a less
dramatic decline - the optionholders can let their options lapse and will
lose no more than the initial option fee, usually a nominal Pounds 1.
This assumes that corporate disaster strikes before the executive has
decided whether to exercise his option. Optionholders who take up the shares
to which they are entitled will suffer in common with all other shareholders
if their company subsequently falls from grace.
While executive options tend to be restricted to actual and potential
directors, savings-related options must be offered to all full-time staff
who have completed up to five years' service. Again, the option structure
eliminates the downside risk until the shares are actually purchased at the
end of a five- or seven-year term.
The additional factor is that these company-wide rights must be linked to an
Save As You Earn contract with a bank or building society. The key point of
reassurance for employees is that these savings contracts will be unaffected
by the insolvency of the scheme company.
Nevertheless, since the rationale of this savings plan is to fund the
purchase of option shares, the collapse of the company may well prompt
employees to cease further payments and withdraw what they have contributed.
Whether this will be the best policy will depend upon the stage reached in
the five-year saving period, and what rates of return can be obtained on
similar 'safe' investments. The interest rate to maturity is a very
competitive 8.86 per cent a year tax-free, whereas a premature withdrawal of
funds will knock this down to 5 per cent.
Thus, employees who can curb the inclination to wash their hands of anything
connected with a bankrupt employer will often be well-advised to see the
contract through to its conclusion.
Profit sharing schemes are the other government-sponsored form of share
incentive and have the same broad catchment area as savings-related options.
The company pays a proportion of its profits to trustees, who buy shares in
the company which they then allocate to employees - although the shares
usually remain registered in the trustees' names for five years.
Employees pay nothing for these shares and are generally not taxed on the
benefit of receiving them. So if the shares subsequently become worthless,
employees might be expected to adopt an 'easy come, easy go' approach.
That analysis will, however, be over simplistic if scheme participants took
shares as an alternative to a cash bonus, or if the scheme was
'contributory', ie receipt of free shares was conditional on paying for a
matching number of bought shares. In either situation employees will regret
having put extra eggs into a corporate basket-case rather than conserving
their cash.
The most important current development in employee incentives is more likely
to damage creditors than employees, if insolvency strikes. More companies
are setting up employee trusts - 'ESOPs' - which use borrowed funds to
purchase shares which are then distributed via the conventional option or
profit sharing schemes.
Banks lending to ESOPs invariably require a guarantee from the employer
company. If, after an ESOP has purchased shares, the price declines, the
likelihood of the guarantee being called will increase. So the use of an
ESOP by a shaky company risks giving a further twist to the spiral of
decline.
This scenario was played out to ultimate ruin when British &amp; Commonwealth
collapsed in 1989. Its mammoth liabilities were bloated by a Pounds 40m
guarantee in support of an ESOP which had accumulated a substantial stake in
the company.
Where the downward momentum is as strong as in B &amp; C's case, there is little
danger of any of the ESOP shares ever reaching the employees. Indeed, cynics
might speculate that ESOPs set up by ailing companies sometimes have motives
which are far removed from the extension of employee ownership.
It is true that an ESOP can use its sponsoring company's resources to prop
up a crumbling share price. This is the only lawful way in which a company
can support its own stock - but it will only be lawful if the prime
objective is genuinely to boost corporate profitability by enhancing
incentives, rather than to put a floor under the market.
Finally, the answers you and the Select Committee have been waiting for.
Yes, Mirror Group Newspapers does have an ESOP. No, there is as yet no
evidence that it was used to rig the MGN share price.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Why cheating does not pay - The taxman
will catch up with you eventually
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS NOTHING wrong, nothing criminal and nothing illegal about opening a
numbered Swiss bank account or holding investments abroad in a nominee name.
Under UK tax law you are not prevented from doing anything - provided you
tell the Revenue. If what you do is not taxable you have nothing to fear.
For example, if you are UK resident and non-UK domiciled (ie you live in the
UK but it is not your home country) with careful planning you can legally
avoid income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax  - with the
Revenue's full knowledge.
All income and gains on which you are liable to pay tax, whether in the UK
or abroad, must be notified to the Revenue within 12 months whether you are
asked to make a return or not. If you do not, you could find yourself liable
not only for the tax on the profits, but also interest for late payment and
a penalty of an amount equal to the tax foregone. In practice, the maximum
penalty is rarely imposed and depends on your co-operation with the Revenue.
In spite of the fact that more money would be payable by not declaring tax
than by declaring it, there are still some who take the bullish attitude
that what the Revenue does not know, the Revenue cannot tax. But remember:
the Revenue has access to all your tax returns from previous years and is
encouraged to have its ears to the ground and its eyes everywhere.
If, suddenly, there is a drop in level of investment income you declare but
your circumstances stay the same, or your investment income remains the same
but your circumstances improve, the Inspector could become suspicious.
Inspectors are expected to read newspapers, check trade directories, scour
the register of local planning applications and anything else which could
indicate an unexplained change in circumstances of a taxpayer. They are also
expected to have an open door to any tittle tattle, whether from scorned
spouses, discarded lovers, aggrieved employees, envious colleagues or
covetous neighbours.
Whichever way Inspectors are tipped off, once they suspect you have not
declared all your income or capital gains their powers of obtaining
information are awesome.
The first thing Inspectors will do is their homework. They will check
whether the information given is, or could be, correct. The Revenue has a
formidable array of investigative powers at its disposal. It can obtain
information from banks, building societies, HM Land Registry, ship/aircraft
registries, DSS and tax accountants.
It can also require any person to produce any document in their possession
which the Inspector may suspect contains information about the tax liability
of the person it is investigating. Where the Revenue suspects that assets
have been transferred abroad, it can ask not only for documents but can also
ask anyone anything which could give the Inspector information relating to
the taxpayer's tax liability.
To prevent any complicity, there are criminal sanctions which can be levied
against the adviser, confidante or friend who deliberately supplies false
particulars to the Revenue. He or she can be prosecuted for 'cheating'. Not
very long ago a well-known London solicitor provided false particulars to
the Revenue out of compassion for a sick, elderly client - and was
prosecuted for cheating and fined Pounds 10,000.
A common ploy if Inspectors have reason to suspect that there are profits
which have not been declared is to make an assessment on you to the best of
its judgment. It is then up to you to prove that you are not liable to pay
this tax. This shifts the onus of proof to you, the taxpayer.
If Inspectors suspect substantial undeclared tax, or if you are not
co-operating, they will usually read you the Hansard Extract (so called
after an answer in Parliament given in 1944) to encourage you to co-operate
 -it sets out the policy of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in regard to
instituting criminal proceedings for alleged frauds on the Revenue. You will
then be asked whether your business accounts and tax returns are correct and
complete. Your answers must be made in writing and signed.
In addition, the Inspectors of Taxes will usually require you to list all
the bank and building society accounts you have power to operate, to list
all your assets, and make you certify that you have not missed out anything.
If you delay in replying, or give inaccurate, misleading, negligent or
fraudulent replies, at the very least you could be fined. At worst you could
be sent to prison under the charge of submitting false accounts with the
intention of defrauding the Revenue or, if a forgery is discovered, for
forgery.
So, let us assume that your German uncle dies leaving you Pounds 250,000 in
a numbered Swiss bank account. You are now obliged to inform the Inspector
of Taxes of the profits on your windfall. You decide, for whatever reason,
not to tell the Inspector straightaway, but to tell all if ever you are
asked. The years slip by, and the Inland Revenue does not ask you any
leading questions. The fund grows substantially - as does the amount of tax
due.
Before letting this situation continue, think what could happen in the
future. You could get divorced; you could require a further injection of
cash into your business; your business could fail; you could upset an
employee; or irritate an employer; your friends and family could turn
against you - and just when you do not need any further problems, the
Revenue, like a sleeping Rottweiler, awakes. You must then disclose
everything to the Revenue, and pay the tax and penalties and interest. After
all that, you may find that your German inheritance is substantially less
than if you had declared it to the Revenue at the outset and paid tax in the
normal way.
Even if you manage to escape disaster and the Revenue during your lifetime,
you may be storing up untold miseries for your children, who may not only
have to pay inheritance tax but substantial back tax as well when they bring
the money into the UK or spend it. The worst thing of all is when you die
leaving money abroad but no record of where the money is or who is holding
it. You may have succeeded in saving tax during your lifetime but left
nothing for your family, benefiting only the Swiss banking system.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: A lifeboat for your old age - How to.
. . . pay for long-term car / Do not forget that a long life can leave you
dependent on others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PEOPLE live longer nowadays.
That's the good news. The bad news is that because of this many more of us
now face a period of dependency, or long-term care.
Private residential care is not cheap, particularly if you stay there for a
long time. It can eat up a lifetime's savings. It might, therefore, be worth
taking financial action to prepare for it.
The same thought has occurred to insurers. Over the last year, a series of
insurers have dipped their toes into the water of long-term care (LTC)
insurance. The need, for all of us, is obvious - but so are the risks, on
both sides.
Big changes in the UK's demography have created the need for LTC insurance.
These are still a long way from the fixed actuarial certainties which life
insurers use when doing business. Instead, they rely on survey evidence and
claims experience from other countries.
A few more significant medical advances over the next two decades, and the
insurers could see a sharp increase in claims.
This means that premiums are high. There is also a risk for the consumer. If
you regularly pay out premiums, on top of all your other insurance payments,
from the age of 40 through to 80, and then die suddenly in your sleep, the
insurance will not look like good value.
Add to this the fact that direct comparisons between the schemes on the
market are impossible, as none of them are identical, and life for the
consumer gets even harder. Apart possibly from experienced medics and
far-sighted actuaries or underwriters, it is difficult for anyone to tell
what is good value and what is not.
Once you have taken all these strictures on board, the guidelines should
still help you to find at least the most appropriate provisions for you.
There are three times when you might want to take action:
While you are still working
These are the most ambitious schemes. Commercial Union, MGI Prime, Aetna and
PPP are the four companies to have entered the market thus far.
All start paying once you can be shown to need long-term care. CU, Aetna and
PPP use a scale of 'Activities of Daily Living' (ADLs). For example, PPP
lists six: Mobility (the ability to get in and out of chair or bed),
washing, dressing, feeding, toileting, and continence. Once you have failed
tests for a certain number of them, you are eligible for pay-outs. Policies
also pay out on diagnosis of mental illness.
MGI Prime has a more ambitious method of measurement, and a scale of 19
qualifying disabilities, including blindness, deafness and loss of
dexterity.
MGI and PPP aim to take a 'hands-on' approach to care provision, and fees
are paid direct to the care providers which they help to choose.
CU, which does not have such a strong background in health insurance, still
offers a 'care consultant' counselling service, and will arrange for you to
be cared for at home as long as possible.
Aetna's Generations plan, unlike the others, has an investment element, so
you can stop paying the premiums and still receive some money. Your heirs
can receive the bulk of what you have paid in after you die. However, the
policy should not be used as an investment in its own right.
You choose a level of income for which you wish to insure, and then pay the
premiums. Within 90 days of your failing the ADL tests, Aetna starts paying
you the income.
The problem with all of these is the premium. These are not directly
comparable, but for example, take the following research, from the magazine
Moneywise. For cover of Pounds 300 a week, inflation-proofed, a 50-year-old
woman would need to pay Pounds 70.70 monthly to Aetna, Pounds 127.30 to CU,
and Pounds 53 to MGI Prime. By the age of 70, these figure increase to
Pounds 339, Pounds 263.26 and Pounds 160 respectively.
When you retire
One product is on the market. Cannon Lincoln offers the Oasis Plus annuity
on retirement. This gives you a 10 per cent worse initial annuity rate than
you would normally have, but then increases substantially in the event that
you need long-term care.
The pension escalates by a factor which will vary according to your sex, and
the age when you started drawing the pension, 90 days after you fail an ADL
test. The factor can be as high as 400 per cent.
Those who do not have much retirement income provision apart from their
pension will probably have to give this one a miss. But if you are
reasonably comfortable about the strength of your investments, and there is
reason to believe that you might be needing long-term care - if your parents
had a lengthy old age, for example - this adroitly thought-out product could
make sense. It may not be long before other companies, with better annuity
rates, imitate it.
When you need to move into residential care
Now the choice is much simpler - you know the costs, and the need is just to
make paying them easier. Three companies have offered tailor-made products,
all based on an annuity.
Remember that at this late stage, any method you choose is going to cost
either you, or your children. These schemes will ease financial pain to an
extent - but they are unlikely to pick up all of the bill.
However, annuities can offer value in these circumstances, because they will
normally be taken out by people with a very limited life expectancy.
Another possibility, for those anxious to preserve their estate intact for
their heirs, is to use a variation on the 'back-to-back' annuity deals
popular in estate planning. You take a lump sum, put half of it in an
annuity, and the remainder in an investment vehicle which aims for capital
growth. This then attempts to make good the shortfall in the estate caused
by buying the annuity.
That explains the general principle, but you need to do very precise sums to
make it work. You might also be happier if you buy an annuity which is
'capital-protected'. This guarantees to repay any remaining original capital
when the annuitant dies.
Another option is to take out a temporary annuity, with a fixed term of five
or ten years.
The possibilities for the 'growth' investment should be familiar to Weekend
FT readers. Unit or investment trusts, ideally held within a PEP, make
sense, as, possibly, would a with-profits bond.
Given the difficulty of the sums involved, there may be a case for choosing
one of the two 'packaged' long-term care payment plans, from Clerical
Medical and Pearl.
Clerical offers a five-year temporary annuity, into which a third of the
funds should be paid. The remainder goes into a unit trust PEP. The plan's
minimum investment is Pounds 15,000 and it is open to anyone under the age
of 95. Pearl offers a ten-year capital-protected annuity, back-to-back with
a with-profits bond.
Eagle Star offers the most ambitious scheme, which could be of use if you
have a lot of capital. You pay a large sum to Eagle Star, which then
promises to pay your care fees for life. Payments increase by the RPI plus 2
per cent each year, and rates are better if you are in particularly bad
health. There is a return of capital if death occurs within six months (or
within a longer period, if you are prepared to pay more).
This plan is expensive, but does effectively guard against the risk of
living a long time in costly care.
Finally, beware of buying insurance you do not need. A fee-charging adviser
might offer you better value, given the high commission levels of many of
these products.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Advice found wanting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British consumer takes pot luck when seeking financial advice, according
to a study in Which?, magazine of the Consumers' Association, this week.
Two Which? investigators each visited 20 financial institutions - including
banks, building societies, accountants, solicitors and insurance companies
as well as independent advisers - giving detailed case histories and asking
for advice.
A panel of experts then commented on the advice given - and found the
standard to be mixed. 'Many investments suggested would have made a lot of
commission for the advisers but were not suitable for the investors,' says
Which?
Another common mistake was not identifying investors' priorities. Which?
says: 'Many advisers didn't explain recommendations, leaving investors to
work out why they were supposed to be suitable.'
The Financial Services Act requires advisers to give clients a Buyers'
Guide, tell you if they are tied to one company or are independent, and the
regulatory body to which they belong. A third of the FSA-regulated companies
visited by Which? did not supply a guide.
The investigators noted wide variations in standards of advice within the
same class of institution. One investigator found that the Yorkshire
Building Society thought it sufficient to deal with his requirements in a
single 'phone call. The other found that 'Yorkshire conducted the meeting as
a good adviser should.'
Which? also reports a mixed performance from the life insurance companies.
One investigator found that General Accident and Friends Provident gave very
good advice, but the panel felt the advice given by insurance companies to
the other investigator did not meet his needs.
Banks were criticised, with the experts finding that they 'generally failed
to get enough personal information.' The Midland adviser's explanation of a
Tessa was described as 'inaccurate and misleading.'
Independent advisers were praised for the suggestions they gave one of the
investigators. For the second, however, the magazine says: 'The suggestions
were fairly heavy on the insurance bonds, a good commission-generating
investment for the adviser.'

IN December, the chairman and chief executive of Merchant Retail Group each
sold 500,000 shares. The former received 34.5p per share; the latter 36.5p.
On January 9, the company issued a profits warning and the shares weakened.
Another director has also been dealing in the shares, this time buying
325,000 shares at prices between 17 and 18p, less than half the price at
which his colleagues sold only weeks beforehand.
Two directors in Haemocell, the bio-technology stock, each sold 150,000
shares at 144p. Both directors still retain sizeable holdings in Haemocell,
where losses have risen over the last three years.
In December Wharfedale, the loudspeaker manufacturer, announced a placing
and open offer to raise approximately Pounds 2.25m. The terms of the deal
allowed directors Sir Gordon Brunton and Peter Totte to subscribe for up to
8m shares at the placing price. Sir Gordon, new chairman of Wharfedale, has
also bought further shares in the market, paying up to 19.25p.
Directors of Berkeley Group, the housebuilder, bought shares at 210p in July
1990 and sold some at 343p last September. Now J D Farrer, the chairman, who
is due to retire at the end of May, has sold 1m shares at 255p.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Ecus surge ahead - Scheherazade
Daneshkhu on their attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS IT now time to get serious about the Ecu (European Currency Unit)? Once a
curiosity in the foreign exchange markets, Ecu-denominated funds have
expanded considerably over the past few years. As well as Ecu bonds, there
are now Ecu deposit accounts, Ecu gilts, Ecu-denominated managed funds, even
Ecu cheque accounts - but, of course, still no Ecu cash.
While the continuing recession, plus political and economic uncertainties
caused by the coming UK general election, have made the fate of the pound
uncertain, British investors with sterling-denominated accounts may be
wondering if the Ecu is a safer haven for their funds.
The value of the Ecu is fixed as a weighted basket of the value of the
currencies of the 12 European Community member countries. Each of these
currencies is pegged within the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of
the European Monetary System (EMS). The present exchange rate of the Ecu is
around 1.4 to the pound.
The main feature of the ECU is that its value is roughly an average of the
EC currencies. It cannot perform as well as the healthiest currency but it
cannot do as badly as the weakest. Since sterling is the weakest member of
the ERM, then a switch into Ecu deposits holds out the possibility that the
value of an investor's funds will rise if the pound then devalues. There
are, however, obvious risks.
If sterling is not devalued and is, instead, defended by a rise in British
interest rates, then the investor who switches into Ecus will lose out. Over
five years, high UK interest rates made the average growth in offshore
sterling funds 68 per cent compared with 41.5 per cent for Ecu funds. Last
year's cut in interest rates meant that Ecu returns were more competitive
over one year: 9.9 per cent against 10.6 per cent for sterling.
There is also a long-term point. It is one thing to hold dollars in the
knowledge that you will be packing up to go to the US when you retire, but
quite another to hold your assets in one currency and your liabilities in
another. You are vulnerable to exchange rate rises and falls on income and
capital.
But those who hold two or three European currencies already are likely to
find it makes sense to hold Ecu funds as a way of equalising risk between
the different currencies. Howard Flight, managing director of Guiness Flight
Global Asset Management, describes the Ecu as a 'valid vehicle for someone
who wants middle-of-the-road European currency block exposure.'
For the private investor, one attractive way of holding Ecu funds is in an
offshore fund where interest is rolled-up within the fund instead of being
paid out. Although this does not avoid liability to tax, it can postpone the
evil day. You will not be taxed until you decide to redeem your investment
(wholly or in part), but the advantage is that you choose when to do this.
If, for instance, you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you can wait until
retirement when you would become a basic rate-payer. At the moment,
Rothschild Asset Management is paying 9.77 per cent on its sterling offshore
roll-up funds and 9.73 per cent on its Ecu funds. There is no minimum
deposit.
Fidelity Investments also has an Ecu money fund. The gross yield is 9.7 per
cent compared with 9.9 per cent on the sterling fund, and interest is paid
gross. You can decide whether to have it accumulated or paid out at
six-monthly intervals. There is no minimum investment and an annual 1 per
cent management charge. If you are a UK resident, you will have to pay
income tax on the interest.
Investors who prefer government bonds can buy the 10-year Ecu gilt issued
last year by the UK government and yielding around 8.4 per cent. But the Ecu
gilts do not enjoy the favourable tax treatment of sterling-denominated
bonds, which are exempt from capital gains tax. The income is paid gross but
must be declared for tax purposes.
Minimum investment is Ecu1,000 and both interest (paid annually) and
eventual redemption (in 2001) are payable through agents - usually the large
international banks and financial houses which trade in the bonds  - in
Ecus.
You would need to set up a currency account with your bank, denominated in
Ecus, to receive the proceeds of the investment. The large banks will open
Ecu current and deposit accounts but these are usually subject to a much
higher minimum deposit than for sterling. The National Westminster bank, for
example, requires a minimum deposit of the equivalent of Pounds 1,000 in
Ecus.
Although the Ecu market has grown, particularly in the corporate sector, it
is still a long way from being the everyday Euro-currency dreamed-of by its
supporters.

British Petroleum is likely to report sharply lower pre-tax profits for its
fourth quarter on Thursday, following the steep decline in oil prices late
last year. Analysts' estimates go as low as Pounds 48m, although this is
expected to be boosted to just over Pounds 100m by gains from asset sales.
This compares with a fourth quarter profit of Pounds 456m for 1990.
Full-year profits for 1991 are also likely to be down on the previous year
by about 10 per cent to just under Pounds 1bn. All sectors are expected to
have shown a decline, including refining and nutrition.
Interest in Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news group, will
focus on Wednesday not so much on its annual results, but on how trials are
going of the long-delayed second phase of Dealing 2000, its automated
trading system for foreign exchange, and of Globex, which will provide
screen-based trading of futures and options.
Their success is likely to be key to the future growth of Reuters, which has
had to cope with retrenchment in the world's financial centres. Analysts are
expecting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 334m to the end of December,
compared with Pounds 320m.
Amstrad, the consumer electronics group headed by Alan Sugar, is expected to
announce an interim pre-tax loss of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m on
Tuesday.
In a PC market disrupted by oversupply and weak consumer demand, Amstrad has
had to cut prices to combat competition from the likes of IBM and Philips.
The first half is traditionally the better half for Amstrad as Christmas
boosts sales, but this past season children bought Nintendos instead and the
company described sales in the run-up to Christmas as dramatically down on
the previous year. The one promising area, satellite dishes, has also been
weakening.
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is expected to report its first
yearly quarter fall in pre-tax profits when it announces its results on
Thursday. Forecasts for the three months to the end of December range from
Pounds 220m to Pounds 240m. Last year Hanson reported a 7 per cent increase
in taxable profits to Pounds 241m.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: It's time to top-up your Tessas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLDERS of Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) should be topping
them up on the anniversary of their opening. As well as the Pounds 3,000
maximum for the first year, a further Pounds 1,800 can be deposited during
the second.
Yearly instalments paid into the Tessa can build up to the maximum of Pounds
9,000 in the fifth year. Interest will be earned tax-free if you keep in the
capital for the full five-year term. However, you can draw net interest
during that period and the balance of the interest will be paid on maturity.
Obviously, the best returns are on maximum deposits, but the largest banks
and building societies are allowing savers to open Tessas with as little as
Pounds 1.
Christine Bayliss, investment editor of Moneyfacts, points out: 'On small
amounts, the interest paid on many Tessas is often far better than the
similar rate on normal savings accounts. Even without the tax relief, many
of them would still be best buys.'
As the table shows, gross Tessa rates vary between 10.5 per cent and 11.4
per cent, compared with 2.35 per cent and 7.4 per cent on ordinary savings
accounts. Abbey National's Tessa pays 11.1 per cent on just Pounds 1, for
example, compared with 4.8 per cent on its Instant Saver account. The best
Abbey Instant Saver rate is 9.35 per cent - and that is obtainable only on
deposits of Pounds 25,000 or more.
Given these rates, savers should take a close look at using Tessas as an
ordinary savings account. The difference is that you will not have multiple
access to your deposit. The effect of drawing out the capital will result in
the Tessa being closed and you will receive a net rate of interest on the
deposit. But, as we have seen, this will be substantially higher than the
rate a taxpayer would receive on the ordinary savings accounts.
There are two main ways of treating the Tessa like an ordinary savings
account. One is to be careful to put aside small amounts of money that you
know you will not need. Many people are tempted to put in more into a Tessa
than they can afford and then find they have to draw on the capital,
resulting in closure of the account.
Another way is simply to open a Tessa knowing you might not be able to run
it for its five-year term. If you were to put in, say, Pounds 2,000 for one
year in Abbey's Tessa, you would receive the net rate of interest of 8.325
per cent, amounting to Pounds 166.50 (assuming the present rate holds).
The same amount in the tiered Instant Saver account would earn 5.93 per cent
net, or Pounds 118.60 - Pounds 47.90 less than on the same amount in the
Tessa. Also, there is nothing to stop you taking out a new Tessa later to
gain the same advantage. Using Tessas in this way is, however, against the
spirit in which the scheme was devised, which was to encourage long-term
savings, and banks and building societies may devise penalties to prevent
depositors doing it.
It is also important to ask about any early-closure penalty. At the moment,
it is usually just the loss of gross interest, but there could be an
adminstration fee as well.

Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society has trimmed the rate on its London
postal share account from 11.15 per cent gross to 10.4 per cent. Other
accounts have also seen rate cuts of 0.75 per cent, including the
flexi-Tessa which now pays 11.25 per cent.
Net annual rates on three Leeds Permanent savings accounts will be reduced
by 0.38 and 0.45 per cent from Monday. Liquid Gold, the instant access
account, pays 6.94 per cent net or 9.25 per cent gross on balances over
Pounds 10,000. Full details of the new rates will be available in Leeds
Permanent's branches from Monday.
*****
In the wake of the recent fall in mortgage interest rates, lenders have
offered a plethora of fixed rate mortgages. Most are still over 10 per cent.
One exception is Nationwide building society which has a three year fixed
rate at 9.95 per cent (11.8 per cent APR), but this is tied to the sale of a
buildings and contents policy through the society and customers must also
take out mortgage protection insurance through Nationwide.
Norwich and Peterborough has launched two new fixed rate mortgages.
Customers can chose between 10.25 per cent (APR 11.70 per cent) fixed for
two years or 10.40 per cent (APR 11.70 per cent) for three years. There is a
Pounds 50 non-refundable application fee and a further Pounds 145 payable on
completion. The mortgages are portable.
The Mortgage Corporation has a 10.55 per cent two year fixed rate mortgage
with a guarantee that it will not rise above 12.99 per cent in the third
year.
Capital Home Loans, the French mortgage lender, has a 10.75 per cent (APR
11.0 per cent) fix for five years, subject to a Pounds 295 fee.
Birmingham Midshires's two year fixed rate offer is 10.65 per cent (APR 12.1
per cent) till January 1994, but it is not available for repayment mortgages
and on remortgages, it cannot be used for capital raising. The fee is Pounds
150.
Almost all fixed mortgages carry some early redemption penalties - usually
varying between three and six month's interest. But some lenders make their
mortgages portable, meaning that it can be transferred to another property.
*****
Balliol College, Oxford, might not seem the most needy of institutions, but
BES tax relief is available on investments into it. This was one of the most
interesting BES offers to be launched this week:
Airways V will continue to buy accommodation to be let primarily to British
Airways employees;
Blue Horizon Developments is raising Pounds 750,000 for a film adaptation of
Julian Barnes' novel Metroland - more speculative, but more fun;
Celtic Tankers will buy and operate oil and product tankers - shipping
companies, like assured tenancies, have an upper investment limit of Pounds
5m.
First Residential Properties, a 'predator'-type company, will buy property
in Greater London,
Hunter, from Property Enterprise Managers, is also a 'predator'-type scheme,
buying housing in the south east,
Oxbridge Colleges Cash Backed High Growth, sponsored by Johnson Fry, offers
the opportunity to invest in Balliol, Magdalen, Wolfson and New Colleges,
Oxford and Girton College, Cambridge. There is a buy-back guarantee of 125p
after five years for every Pounds 1.00 spent now.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Promoters give hard sell to single
company Peps - A new product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE single company personal equity plan (Pep) is one of the newest products
on the financial market and it is being promoted heavily in advance of the
end of the tax year and a possible Labour government. Investors can place up
to Pounds 3,000 of one company's shares in a plan, in addition to any Pounds
6,000 Pep they might have taken out in the tax year.
As with other Peps, returns in a single company plan are free of capital
gains and income tax. But as David Rough, director of investments at Legal &amp;
General, warned small investors this week: 'The tax advantages of single
company Peps are more than outweighed by the increased risk of linking an
investment to the fortunes of one company'.
Single company Peps are most suitable for two groups. Employees who acquire
shares through an approved options scheme can transfer them into a single
company plan without the problem and cost of a bed-and-breakfast operation
(where the shares are sold and then re-purchased).
Then there are people who already have a diversified portfolio of
investments. Those who own the shares will face transfer costs already; but
others may simply have decided to buy the shares as a long-term investment,
in any case, and use the Pep as a tax-efficient means of doing so.
The choice is between Peps sponsored by the companies themselves and the
general schemes of plan managers.
One obvious factor is cost. Many of the companies which sponsor their own
plans offer cut-rate deals. Scottish &amp; Newcastle's plan, for example, which
is managed by the Bank of Scotland, makes no initial charge and a
half-yearly management charge of 0.25 per cent. There are brokerage
commissions of 0.25 per cent on dealings within the Pep.
Normally, it will be cheaper to go for a company-sponsored Pep. There might,
however, be good reasons for turning to a plan manager. Your chosen company
might not have its own Pep arrangements.
There is also the question of transferring your plan from one company to
another. This could take considerable time if you have opted for a sponsored
Pep - time in which the share price of the new company in which you wish to
invest might move considerably. So those who expect to be reasonably active
traders of shares should opt for a plan manager's Pep.
Some of the cheaper single company Peps are being offered by plan managers
as self-select Peps. The table, compiled by Chase de Vere, shows most of the
deals on offer; but here are further details of some of the prominent
offers. (Cost assumes buying Pounds 3,000 of shares, twice-yearly dividend
collection unless indicated, and includes 0.5 per cent stamp duty).
Lloyds Bank. No initial charge but there is an annual fee of Pounds 20 plus
VAT. Lloyds puts purchases through as part of a bulk deal twice a month at a
very low brokerage cost of 0.2 per cent. Dealing at other times will be at
the standard 1.6 per cent, subject to a minimum of Pounds 25. No charge for
collecting dividends. Choice is limited to 100 single-company Peps. Cost:
Pounds 44.50.
Pilling &amp; Co (061-832-6581). No initial or annual management fees. Brokerage
is Pounds 1.65 per cent subject to a Pounds 30 minimum. It costs Pounds 6.75
for the tax reclaim per dividend. There is no charge for closure but Pilling
reserves the right to levy Pounds 25 for a transfer to another plan manager.
Cost: Pounds 78.
Killik &amp; Co (071-589-1577). There are no initial charges or annual
administration charges. There is a brokerage charge of 1.65 per cent to buy
the shares, subject to a Pounds 40 minimum, and 0.5 per cent stamp duty.
There is also a Pounds 7.50 charge for reclaiming tax on any dividends.
Killik reserves the right to charge Pounds 10 for closure. If you invest the
full Pounds 3,000 in a single company's stock you can, therefore, expect to
pay Pounds 49.50 in brokerage, Pounds 15 in stamp duty and - if it is a
company that pays twice-yearly - Pounds 15 for collecting dividends. Cost:
Pounds 79.50.
John Siddall &amp; Co (061-832-7471). You need Pounds 10 as an initial payment
to open the Pep and there is an annual administration charge of 0.5 per cent
and VAT. Commission rates are 1.25 per cent and there is no minimum rate. No
charges for collecting dividends, nor for closing or transferring the Pep.
Cost: Pounds 80.13.
Yorkshire Bank. No initial fee but there is an annual administration charge
of 1.5 per cent plus VAT. Brokerage charges are 1 per cent but you are
subject to a minimum investment of Pounds 1,500. No dividend charges but
closure will incur 0.75 per cent of the value of the Pep (half the annual
fee). Choice limited to FTSE 100. Cost: Pounds 97.88.
Bell Lawrie White (031-228-5777). No initial charge but there is a 1 per
cent annual administration fee plus VAT. Dealing charges are 1.6 per cent,
subject to a Pounds 30 minimum. One free withdrawal a year is permitted;
otherwise, there is a Pounds 25 charge. The company encourages shareholders
to let dividends accumulate within the Pep. Cost: Pounds 98.25 (excludes
dividend collection).
Reyker Securities (071-499-9097). There is an initial charge of Pounds 20
and an annual administration fee of 1 per cent plus VAT. Reyker does no
brokerage itself but uses the broker of your choice or its recommended
broker, charging 1.5 per cent commission. There is no charge for withdrawals
or closure other than brokerage costs of selling the shares. No charge for
closure, but transferring to another plan manager will cost 1 per cent of
the value of the Pep. Cost: Pounds 115.75.
Finally, a note on the choice of company. It must be a stock which you are
prepared to hold for the long term. A good yield is preferable so as to take
advantage of the income tax exemption. But shares with very high yields will
be risky and could result in a capital loss (which will not be offsettable
against CGT gains elsewhere in your portfolio). The trick is to find find a
stock with the prospect of steady dividend and capital growth.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Stolen card refund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a cash card and its personal identification number get intercepted in
the post, an account-holder can suffer needlessly if his bank does not act
promptly to put things right.
A foreign student, staying for a few months in London to learn English,
opened an account at the Fulham branch of Barclays Bank in November last
year. He deposited Pounds 2,000 and waited for his cash card to arrive. It
never came. Instead, almost all his money was siphoned from his account.
When he complained to the bank, he was told he would get a refund and given
a Pounds 150 credit to tide him over. But 10 further visits to the branch
produced no action and his requests for an interview with the manager were
refused.
An approach to Barclays' regional head office produced a promise to help -
but still nothing happened. Now, however, after being contacted by the
Financial Times, Barclays has investigated the case and the money has been
refunded in full.
A Barclays' representative said: 'The case should have been referred to our
fraud department and then the refund would have been made, but this does not
seem to have happened in this case. We are still trying to find out why. We
can only apologise.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (Serious Money): Will gilts beat the
building societies?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY BE time for a significant shift in the portfolios of UK savers. After
many years in which the rates available from building societies have been
far higher than those on long term investments, the gap has narrowed.
Take the rates on offer from a well-known building society such as Alliance
&amp; Leicester. On its 90-day notice account, it pays 9.8 per cent gross on
balances of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 24,999 and 9.25 per cent on
amounts between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 9,999. For instant access, the rates
payable on the same amounts are respectively 8.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent.
On Thursday this week, it was possible to buy long term gilts at rates of
around 9.5 per cent gross - and know that those rates would stay the same
for five years or more.
In the jargon of the industry, the yield curve has flattened. This may not
have been noticed in the high streets of Britain ('Morning, Mr Higginbotham.
Looks like rain.' 'Aye, and I see the yield curve has flattened again.'),
but it matters a lot to savers concerned with return and safety.
The indications are that, in their efforts to stimulate the housing market,
the building societies are likely to favour borrowers at the expense of
savers in the near future.
And if Britain's membership of the ERM does succeed in reducing inflation,
interest rates should fall over the next few years. That will be bad news
for those with money in the building society, but good news for owners of
gilts.
Before buying gilts, investors should be sure they know the jargon. Most
gilts have a fixed interest rate, called the coupon. A gilt with a 10 per
cent coupon and a face value of Pounds 100 would pay Pounds 10 in gross
interest per year.
Gilts are traded and do not normally sell for their face value. So investors
must pay careful attention to the yield, which has two aspects. The running
yield is the relationship between the coupon and the market price. A gilt
with a coupon of 10 per cent and a price of 80 would have a running yield of
12.5 per cent.
But the gilt will eventually be repaid, so the investor who buys for 80 can
look forward to a capital gain. The return in terms of capital gain or loss,
plus interest on a gilt, is called the gross redemption yield.
So what are the pros and cons of moving money from the building society into
gilts?
Security
Building societies are very safe, given that the industry has a habit of
rescuing troubled societies, and a compensation scheme will repay 90 per
cent of the first Pounds 20,000 an individual deposits.
But gilts offer the absolute security of the British government. Barring
revolution, one can be certain that interest will be paid and that the
capital will be repaid at face value.
Certainty of return
A building society investor can be certain that his capital will be returned
at par value. He cannot be sure - save on a limited number of accounts for a
limited period of time - of the interest rate.
A gilt investor faces short term uncertainty and long term certainty. He
knows the interest rate he will receive and what he will be repaid when the
gilt matures.
Because gilts are traded, however, in the short term his holding may be
worth more or less than the capital he invested. Gilt prices normally rise
when interest rates fall, and vice versa.
Ease of access
An instant access account at a building society is extremely convenient,
provided you can get to a branch. Gilts will never be as accessible but they
can be bought and sold through the Post Office. If you want to sell gilts,
the proceeds will be posted within three working days. This makes gilts more
accessible than a 90-day notice account.
However, gilts are not suitable for frequent payment and withdrawal of odd
sums to pay the gas bill.
Tax
The interest on both gilts and building society accounts is subject to
income tax. However, it is possible to make a capital gain on gilts, which
would be tax free.
Non-taxpayers can receive gross interest on building society accounts; they
can also do so if they buy gilts through the Post Office.
Charges
There are no charges for deposits or withdrawals at most building societies,
although Halifax is introducing the practice for accounts with low balances.
You do have to pay a charge for investing in gilts. At the post office, this
is Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250 invested, with 50p for every further
Pounds 125; a Pounds 10,000 investment would cost Pounds 20.
You cannot invest a larger sum than that in one day through the Post Office.
In any case, for large sums, you need the advice of a stockbroker. The
London-based Killik would charge Pounds 146.25 for a single trade of Pounds
25,000 (though it advises spreading your investment among a few issues).
There is also a small buy-sell spread, which is rarely more than a fifth of
a point.
Which gilts should you choose? David Kauders, a Taunton-based investment
adviser, illustrated the principles in these pages a few weeks ago. Those
gilts trading below par value will offer a lower income, or running yield,
but the prospect of tax-free capital gain. Those trading above par value
offer higher income but at the expense of capital loss.
Gilts should only be acquired by those investing for the long term, although
they might offer the chance for short term profits. But if you like security
and a guaranteed return, they could be highly attractive.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Annuity rates falling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Annuity rates are on their way down - and this time it is official. Several
life offices suggested last year that tax changes would make immediate
(non-pension) annuities significantly worse value after the end of December.
However, rates did not decline by much.
But from March 1, the capital content of the annuity - on which no tax is
paid - will be calculated using mortality rates taken from 1979 to 1982. At
present they are based on death rates between 1946 and 1948. This will
reduce the net income of a 75-year-old man by 4.1 per cent, and of a
75-year-old woman by 2.8 per cent, according to Scottish Provident. The
changes will not affect annuities bought by the end of this month.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: House prices still falling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices in the UK fell by 1.2 per cent in January, after a 1.3 per cent
fall the month before, according to the house price index produced by
Halifax, Britain's largest lender. The average price of a house last month,
at Pounds 64,470, was 3.6 per cent less than in January last year. The
annual fall in the average price of a new house was even greater, at 4.6 per
cent. The south east has suffered the largest falls.
January's figure is disappointing since it follows a series of measures
aimed at reviving the market, including the government's decision to abolish
temporarily stamp duty on houses purchases up to Pounds 250,000 and to
convert mortgages into rent. In addition, the largest building societies
announced unprompted half percentage point mortgage rate cuts. However,
Halifax has reported that these measures have prompted greater activity,
with mortgage applications increasing by 50 per cent in the seven days after
its mortgage rate reduction.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (Wall Street): Investors wait for a
political jump-start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS the air of a party which has passed its peak. The music is slowing,
the drink is running a little low. Dawn may be near.
True, Wall Street scaled new heights last week, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closing at 3,272.81 on Tuesday afternoon. But it was a
rather half-hearted effort, with an edge of less than one point on the
previous record close - set on January 28.
Even Tuesday's record close, moreover, was not mirrored in the broader
market indicators. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, for example,
remained some seven points shy of its all-time peak, although it did move
upwards. Significantly, the S&amp;P-500 reached its all-time high almost one
week before the Dow, on January 15.
The question hanging over the market, of course, remains the state of the
economy and whether - as election campaigning picks up pace - it can hope
for even lower interest rates. The gains of the past six weeks have stemmed
largely from declining yields on competing investments, coupled with a
belief that the authorities will do everything in their power to jump-start
the economy.
Accordingly, it was remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman which gave Wall
Street such a fillip on Tuesday. Appearing before a Congressional committee,
Alan Greenspan noted that while he believed that interest rates to date
should prove sufficient to provoke an economic recovery, the Fed was
prepared to ease further if necessary.
'We are continuing to evaluate whether some additional insurance in the way
of further monetary ease would be appropriate,' he remarked as the Fed's
policy-setting open market committee began its regular monthly meeting.
It did not take long, however, for worries to set in. Amid heavy trading,
Wall Street saw the Dow fall over 15 points on Wednesday, and a further
couple on Thursday, as the market awaitedFriday's unemployment report. In
the event, that was worse - which, from the market's perspective, means
better - than predicted. Non-farm payrolls in January were estimated to have
fallen by 91,000, with manufacturing employment down by 52,000.
Quite apart from the grim situation in the manufacturing sector, the retail
trade lost some 51,000 jobs in January and all service industries showed a
loss of 29,000. The unemployment rate itself remained a 7.1 per cent. Yet,
by noon there was little indication that the Fed was interpreting this data
as immediate cause for a further easing.
To some observers, at least, this was not entirely surprising: there is
certainly a school of thought which argues that there has not yet been
sufficient time to measure the impact of the December discount rate cut, and
any additional action at this stage would be premature.
Still, the market took the lack of signals to heart. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average, having initially risen almost 14 points when the jobs
figures were released, had slumped to a loss of around four points by midday
on Friday.
Meanwhile, as the corporate reporting season continues to roll, the auguries
are mixed. Although no-one could describe many of the earnings reports as
cheerful, overall they have at least presented relatively few new horror
stories.
GTE, the largest local telephone company, reported a 10 per cent increase in
net fourth-quarter earnings while Cummins Engine has forecast a return to
profit in the first quarter of the year.
By contrast Pepisco, the large soft drinks, restaurants and snacks group,
reported near-static figures, hit by restructuring charges, while a number
of large food retailers reported weaker figures as promotional activity
continues to sweep the sector.
At Chrysler, the financially-stretched car-maker, there was a fourth-quarter
profit of Dollars 97m - in line with market expectations - although a
Dollars 74m loss at the pre-tax level and a warning that it might lose
significantly more than that in the first quarter of 1992.
Like so many companies, Chrysler is pinning its hopes publicly on the latter
half of the year, helped by launches of its new Jeep Grand Cherokee and LH
series of mid-sized saloons.
As for the continuing efforts of the corporate sector to replenish balance
sheets, it was the turn of Sears Roebuck last week to announce a Dollars 1bn
offering of PERCS - the new equity-based security - while American Express
plans to raise up to Dollars 1bn via the flotation of a minority stake in
its credit card-processing subsidiary.
One thing is certain: while the good times are rolling, the canny are
certainly cashing in.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (The Bottom Line): Docklands EZT dwarfs
the competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST as the 800 ft Canary Wharf tower now dominates the London skyline, so
events in the Docklands Enterprise Zone towered above the tax shelter market
last week.
The Enterprise Zone Trust announced for Docklands on Thursday dwarfs all
previous EZTs. The Cabot Square Trust aims to raise Pounds 215m for 10 Cabot
Square, a building on the Canary Wharf development. The previous largest EZT
raised Pounds 80m.
Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property company responsible for the Canary
Wharf tower, is the developer. IPS organised the deal, and Property
Enterprise Managers will manage the trust.
EZTs offer arguably the strongest shelter from tax now available in the UK.
Money invested in EZ property qualifies for top-rate tax relief, so 40 per
cent taxpayers effectively only part with 60 per cent of the value of their
investment. Minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. There is no upper limit.
Tax treatment is this favourable because property investment in EZs -
run-down areas which the government thinks worthy of support - is
speculative. Tax relief comes to little if the investment is not safe.
But the sponsors have gone out of their way to make sure the Cabot Square
Trust does not run into difficulties.
Investors have a 'put' option after ten years. If a majority of the
trustholders vote to exercise it, O&amp;Y will have to buy back the property for
the price paid by the trust this year - Pounds 215m. For all its
well-publicised problems, it is likely to be able to pay this.
The real coup is that O&amp;Y's ability to pay has been guaranteed by Morgan
Guaranty, a triple-A rated US bank. This makes this part of the deal as
secure as can reasonably be expected of any investment. Top-rate taxpayers
effectively have a certain capital gain of 67 per cent over ten years.
It is also a great deal for Olympia and York - even if investors exercise
their 'put', O&amp;Y has negotiated a ten-year interest-free mortgage.
And even Morgan cannot guarantee a rate of inflation. Over the ten years to
the end of 1991, the cost of living index rose by 73.5 per cent. Average
inflation over the last five years has been 6.4 per cent.
Exercise O&amp;Y's 'put' option in March 2002, and you receive an equivalent
annual compound interest of 5.25 per cent. Many economists argue that
inflation will be lower than this during the 1990s, but 5.25 per cent is not
that exciting.
In return for a limit on potential 'downside', investors must accept a
series of 'call' options for O&amp;Y which limit the 'upside'. After 12 years,
O&amp;Y can buy back the building from the trust for Pounds 230m - a 78 per cent
increase over 12 years. At the end of 2006 (after 15 years) it would pay
Pounds 264.5m (105 per cent). This rises to Pounds 322m (150 per cent) after
20 years, and Pounds 382.3m (196 per cent) after 25.
O&amp;Y's purchase price rises by Pounds 11.5m each year. This steadily
diminishes the equivalent compounded annual return received by investors. In
the unlikely event that O&amp;Y leaves it this long the effective annual
interest rate after 25 years would be less than 5 per cent.
However, none of this accounts for income from the rental yield, which would
start at 7.325 per cent. This is revisable upwards after five years,
although some analysts, such as Stephen Bantoft of the Allenbridge Group,
are bearish about the chances of this happening.
The yield is just high enough to allow a self-financing investment. Tax
relief is allowed on loans taken out to finance EZ investment, if they are
serviced using rental income. Fixed rate finance is available from the Bank
of Scotland to help this.
Investors might foresake their income, but would make no effective outlay.
In return, they would receive tax relief at the beginning of the investment,
and, following the sale of the building, effectively receive the value of
their tax relief again. This aspect of the deal, which Cabot Square shares
with other EZTs, could be attractive. But the Bank of Scotland's
requirements will be strict.
This is a low risk instrument of potential use in tax-planning. Investors
wanting more chance of an 'upside' should balance their portfolio with other
tax-efficient investments, including EZTs and BES companies. They should
also seek professional advice.

FT  08 FEB 92 / The Long View: Fair play in the tax war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALREADY THERE is a powerful movement to take monetary policy out of the
grubby and inflationary hands of rresponsible politicians. Need we stop
there? At times like these it can seem an attractive idea that taxation,
too, should be made a no-go area for the squabbling and scheming
vote-catchers.
I know that the right to design and gather taxes is one of the fundamental
powers of a government. As the American revolutionary slogan put it, from
the other viewpoint: no taxation without representation. Our Conservative
government appears to think that tax is its only winning policy area in the
imminent general election. Perhaps I could make a compromise proposal: no
politician should be permitted to make a statement about tax without prior
clearance from an independent fiscal regulator.
Such an Office of Fair Taxation would never have permitted National
Insurance Contributions - now levied at 9 per cent of pay up to Pounds 390 a
week - to have remained alarmingly wide open to deception. Either NICs
should be insurance premiums, actuarially justified by defined benefits, or
they should be rolled up into income tax. Labour's proposal to levy NICs on
higher income groups without extending any corresponding benefits is surely
fiscally fraudulent. If the charge were honestly described as income tax, on
the other hand, Oftax would have absolutely no grounds for complaints
(although perhaps the voters would).
All Tory claims that the Conservatives are the party of low taxation would
come under especially close scrutiny by Oftax, bearing in mind that tax
revenues during the last period of Labour administration represented a lower
proportion of GDP than on average during the past 13 years of Tory rule.
Taxation is not just a question of the standard rate of income tax. Some
people, although Conservative ministers might not understand this, pay more
in VAT than in income tax.
Any knighthoods from time to time conferred on the distinguished
directors-general of Oftax would not be decided by either government or
opposition, but rather by a panel of impeccably objective financial and
economic journalists. Come to think of it, ageing but still serviceable
commentators might make ideal candidates for the job itself.
The greater challenge for the fiscal regulator would be to prevent the
development of ever-increasing complexity in taxation. Politicians have an
incentive to raise the nominal tax rates, but offset these with a maze of
allowances and exemptions. This is how political power is expressed, and
political reputations are made. The doziest Member of Parliament knows how
to whip up a national outcry on the issue of imposing VAT on children's
clothing. The rational economist, on the other hand, would like to see low
rates of tax, universally applied so as to prevent distortion and
favouritism.
We have few things to thank Nigel Lawson for, but one was his consistent
campaign to bring down tax rates, both personal and corporate. But he could
not resist the temptation to introduce his own tax shelters, notably
Personal Equity Plans.
And it is not only the creation but also the dismantling of tax shelters
that can cause trouble. I was reminded of this by the news during the week
that house prices went down yet again during January. Residential property
values have been consistently soft since higher rate mortgage interest
relief was abolished in last year's March Budget. There are other reasons
for the weakness, but the change was singularly ill-timed; an embarrassed
Treasury had to wriggle in December to avoid being forced into a U-turn when
the government insisted that the house market should be propped up. In the
event stamp duty was temporarily lifted instead.
Phasing out tax relief on mortgage interest was perfectly justified in
principle, but it should have been done when house prices were booming in
the late 1980s. Indeed, Lawson wanted to do it then but was overruled by
Margaret Thatcher. So when the Treasury seized its opportunity just four
months after Thatcher had gone it was overwhelmingly on political grounds,
and was without regard to the developing crisis in the housing market.
You can see a much bigger problem of the same kind with the Labour party's
tax proposals. Millions of people earning upwards of about Pounds 21,000 a
year are faced with large increases in National Insurance Contributions and,
above about Pounds 40,000, higher income tax, too. In a strong economy there
might be a reasonable case for raising higher rates of tax. But the effect
in the context of a serious recession is to make an already bad situation
worse: not so much a kick-start as a kick-stop. Again, a political decision
is being applied regardless of the circumstances.
Moreover, should Labour ever gain power the proposals would threaten to
spark off a new wave of evasion (accountants, I know, would call it
avoidance) of the kind that created so many scandals in the 1970s, when tax
was at rates up to 98 per cent on investment income.
One tax rate that Nigel Lawson actually raised was that of capital gains tax
for those in higher income brackets. This happens to be the time of year
when otherwise sane people sell securities one evening and buy precisely the
same investments back next morning. This daft procedure creates work for
stockbrokers, but benefits nobody else. It happens because CGT breaks the
rules of efficient taxation, by being applied at a comparatively high rate
(up to 40 per cent) yet with an exemption for gains of up to Pounds 5,500
within a tax year. If CGT were charged at a low rate there would be less
call for bed-and-breakfasting.
The tax avoidance and investment industries are eagerly looking forward to a
Labour government. Already the investment institutions are attracting huge
sums into Personal Equity Plans, which make little economic sense for most
people except as refuges from high future Labour taxes. Once in power, a
Labour Chancellor would no doubt create his own pet tax shelters, for
instance regional investment funds, to encourage investment in places which
few rational businessman would touch.
You cannot keep the politicians away from the fiscal honey-pot. At least we
have representation, but then we have misrepresentation too.

FT  08 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Remy Cointreau
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only in France, perhaps, could a company announce with a straight face that
it was issuing 6m shares to improve the marketability of the stock and
simultaneously disclose that the controlling family shareholder has raised
its stake to just above 50 per cent. Perhaps the Perrier and Au Printemps
affaires will ultimately improve the lot of minority shareholders. But in
Remy Cointreau's case, memories of the controversial terms of last year's
merger are presumably still fresh in the mind.
The more interesting question, though, is the likely response to 20 per cent
of the stock being offered to the public over the next few months.
Inevitably there may be some drag on the price in the short term, but it is
also arguable that conditions are in place for Remy Cointreau to mount a
serious challenge to the dominance of the big four in worldwide spirits
distribution. The company can boast a portfolio of premium products,
including a tie with Highland Distilleries and control of the Krug and Piper
Heidsieck champagnes. It has a good distribution network; and as far as one
can see, the family squabbles have been sorted out.

FT  08 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Bass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that Bass is involved in litigation over its Dollars 2.2bn purchase
of Holiday Inn is perhaps not quite as unnerving as it sounds. It may be
that Bass is merely protecting its right to claim for minor damages, rather
than suggesting it was seriously misled. All the same, it is not the best
time for attention to be drawn to the most radical and ambitious
diversification in the company's history. Two years on, it is possible
Holiday Inn is breaking even after interest costs. If so, it is only because
the slump in profits is being offset by cuts in US interest rates.
The wider question is one of fundamental strategy. Bass would doubtless
argue that it was right to reduce its dependence on UK pubs and brewing at a
time of huge upheaval and regulatory change. The contrary argument is that
this was just the time for the industry leader to concentrate on turning
change to its advantage, rather than diversifying. Nor is the case helped by
the fact that just as Bass was piling into hotels at the top of the market,
both Grand Metropolitan and Scottish and Newcastle were astutely getting
out.
Then again, Bass was scarcely the only UK company to overpay for US assets
in the last few years. Like the brewing business, Holiday Inn has
considerable potential. The question is whether Bass is nimble enough to
exploit it. There is a depressing contrast with GrandMet, which in just over
three years has abandoned hotels, betting and brewing, hugely expanded its
pub empire and absorbed the Pillsbury acquisition along the way.

FT  08 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Wolseley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tasteless jokes about the quality of French plumbing are as misplaced these
days as smug sermons on the superiority of British drinking water. In any
case, Wolseley's decision yesterday to splash out Pounds 95m for France's
leading specialist distributor of plumbing supplies is part of a more
ambitious strategy to tackle the European market.
One could easily quibble about the timing of the initiative so close to
January 1 1993, were it not for the way Wolseley spent the 1980s
leapfrogging its competitors to establish itself in the United States.
Earnings per share last year were admittedly pegged back below 1987 levels.
But then, the housing recession on both sides of the Atlantic has been
severe, and Wolseley's balance sheet has come through unscathed. Capturing
Brossette, moreover, looks to have been worth the wait. Apart from providing
new opportunities to negotiate bulk discounts from common suppliers, plus a
platform for expansion east and south, the scope to squeeze extra costs out
of even a well-run French family business ought to be considerable. Perhaps
in the interests of an entente cordiale, Wolseley's chairman, Mr Jeremy
Lancaster, is coy on this point. But while margins are unlikely ever to
match what the company has obtained in the UK, the current level of just
under 4 per cent should in time be pushed nearer 6.
Without the benefit of Brossette's full financial record,the company's
assurance that the acquisition will not dilute earnings has to be taken on
trust. Wolseley, however, has not been given to extravagant promises in the
past. Moreover, even though they have outperformed handsomely through the
bad times, the shares still look a better bet than those beleaguered players
in the sector which have slashed overheads just to survive. The mere 3 per
cent discount needed to get the placing away yesterday demonstrates the size
of the fan club.

<DATELINE>
   FT-SE Index: 2,517.2 (
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
17.1)
At the last minute yesterday, an exceptionally humdrum week for the markets
turned exciting for the wrong reasons. The US employment figures were yet
again bad enough to dash hopes of imminent economic recovery. The market,
having decided that a further cut in US interest rates was off the agenda,
is now back to expecting one shortly. The dollar, which strengthened on the
last rate cut in hopes that the economy had finally reached bottom, has
weakened sharply again. Given that the Bundesbank is meanwhile adamant that
it will not cut German rates in the face of inflationary wage settlements,
it looks rather as if the UK is stuck in the middle again.
Even before this news, the UK equity market had contrived to drift downwards
every day this week. Nothing in the background is particularly helpful.
There were no big company results in the week, or statistics on the domestic
economy. The longer the opinion polls go on depicting the two main parties
close together, the nearer the market gets to its least favourite outcome of
a hung parliament. Meanwhile, the results season looms; and whether or not
dividend payments are maintained, very few company chairmen will feel ready
to offer any hope of an upturn.
Perhaps the best that can be said for the UK market is that it is 160 points
down on its record of five months ago. But that is a mere 6 per cent. The
worrying thing is that in September the market was not only wrong about the
timing of the recovery. It may also have been wrong about its scale.

FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Osaka derivatives blamed for Tokyo
market slump / Review of the Japanese equity scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After starting the year on a bearish note, the Tokyo stock market has
managed to brush off some of its pessimism with a little help from the
authorities.
Efforts by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the ministry of
finance to reassure investors that they were concerned about the current
slump have soothed their worries that the Nikkei average could plunge below
20,000.
Fears mounted last month, when Japanese equities failed to react either to
the Bank of Japan's cut in the discount rate in late December, or to higher
bond prices and booming overseas markets. In January, the Nikkei average
fell to 20,858.30, within a hair's breadth of 20,221.86 plumbed in October
1990, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Average daily volume fell to a
10-year low of 217.4m shares.
Announcements by the LDP, of measures to revitalise the stock market, such
as companies raising dividends and the reduction of securities trading
taxes, propped up the market. 'These statements have underpinned the
market,' says Mr Jason James, equity strategist at James Capel.
This week's move by the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) to make futures and
options trading more transparent also had a favourable effect on sentiment.
The OSE will now disclose trading of futures and options by brokers and
trading hours have been shortened. Option contracts, currently exercised
once a week, will move to once a month with the June contract.
Derivatives trading in Osaka had been blamed for recent volatility in the
cash market. The bulk of Japan's stock futures trading is executed in Osaka,
although the index is based on Tokyo cash prices. The surge in activity of
the Osaka-based Nikkei 225 options and the plunge in cash trading activity
in Tokyo created tension between the two exchanges.
Last year, turnover in futures trading rose 35 per cent to Y536,729.9bn
(Dollars 4,293.8bn), while activity on the cash market fell 39 per cent to a
nine-year low of Y107,108bn. Trading in Nikkei 225 futures accounted for
56.2 per cent of the revenue earned by the OSE, while the TSE saw a heavy
fall in its revenue.
Price fluctuation in the futures markets is reflected in the cash market
through arbitrage, as traders seek to make a profit from the price
differences between the cash and futures markets. The surge in speculative
trading on the futures markets has in turn pushed up arbitrage activity in
the underlying shares.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange increased margin rates for arbitrage trading three
times last year to curb activity. It also wants a reform of futures trading
and has recently set up a task force to review trading practices and
recommend changes. Osaka has finally moved to reduce speculative activity on
its own turf.
Mr Nick Schoewe, head of derivatives trading at SBCI Securities, says that
it is 'interesting' that derivatives have been made a scapegoat for the poor
performance of the cash market. He warns that if the negative attitude
towards derivatives continues, the business will be driven to offshore
markets where Nikkei 225 futures and options can be traded, such as the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
Others agree that while the psychological impact of the OSE's recent move
was positive, the most effective way to reduce the influence of futures and
options trading on the cash market is for volume in the cash market to rise.
Meanwhile, an overhang of shares created by investors waiting to liquidate
holdings at higher levels remains a problem. Selling by investment trusts,
facing redemptions linked to trust funds set up in the late 1980s, has
continued to depress the market. Tokkin, or specified money trusts, and
trust fund cancellations by companies, which James Capel estimates at
between Y1,000bn and 3,000bn, will be concentrated in the current quarter.
Life insurers, traditionally leading buyers, are offering little comfort.
'Pension funds, which are long-term investors, will continue to buy at lower
levels around 21,000, but we also want to sell short-term investments at the
24,000 to 25,000 level,' says Mr Kaoru Shimura, general manager at Sumitomo
Life's securities investment department.
Downward revisions of earnings forecasts ahead of the March book-closing are
expected to create turmoil. Several brokerages recently reduced their profit
forecasts for electrical companies such as Hitachi and Toshiba, which
prompted heavy selling of their shares.
Small investors are reluctant to return to the stock market. They were
shaken by last year's stock market scandals and current price conditions and
meagre dividends offer little return.
Mr Shimura at Sumitomo Life expects daily turnover to remain around 300m
shares for the first half of this year. This means that share prices will
remain vulnerable to volatility in futures and options.
However, some argue that current levels make long-term stock investments
attractive. Mr Yoshinobu Isokawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities
says that with interest rates on the decline, individuals are showing some
interest in stocks again. Although they have not yet started to buy,
attendance at equity investment seminars at Yamaichi's local branches has
started to rise. 'We're telling clients that now is a great chance to buy,'
says Mr Isokawa, 'if they give the market two years.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses concentrate on
individual issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BOURSES concentrated on individual issues yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT reported thin turnover as a single order for Volkswagen pushed the
shares up DM5 to DM342 and helped the DAX index to close 4.39 higher at
1,685.52, down 0.2 per cent on the week. At midsession the FAZ was 1.75
lower at 687.40, up 0.6 per cent on the week.
Volume fell from DM8bn to DM4.6bn. Apart from continued gains in
construction, where Bilfinger &amp; Berger rose DM17 to DM977 and Hochtief by
DM29 to DM1,228, a feature of the day was the recovery of individual stocks
after varying periods of severe pressure.
VW, one of the worst performing German blue chips in 1991, has recovered
from a 1991 low of DM280 and its resilience yesterday was remarkable against
an embattled background for the industry. Mercedes said on Thursday that it
was reviewing methods of cutting production this year, and after hours
yesterday BMW said it would cut about 3,000 jobs by the end of this year.
In retailing, Asko added to another strong 1992 rebound with its shares up
DM20 to DM720 against a 1992 low of DM607. The airline Lufthansa rose DM6 to
DM157 after a three-day drop of DM30 to DM151 on Thursday, after it
confirmed that 1991 results would show a DM400m loss against earlier hopes
of a break-even.
PARIS traded in a narrow range which disguised volatility in some smaller
stocks. The CAC 40 index ended 1.00 higher at 1,861.61, down 0.7 per cent on
the week, in turnover of around FFr1.7bn.
The builder Spie Batignolles sank FFr18.80 or 5.8 per cent to FFr307 with
80,975 shares traded following the news late on Thursday that it was likely
to have lost FFr950m last year, double market forecasts of losses of
FFr400m. Schneider, which has a controlling stake in Spie, fell FFr5 to
FFr616 with 130,275 shares traded.
Michelin ran into profit-taking after its recent gains, dropping FFr3.90 or
2.4 per cent to FFr160.10 with 526,650 shares traded. But Valeo, the car
components maker which has lagged behind Michelin, rose FFr24 or 3.6 per
cent to FFr684 with a relatively heavy 66,600 shares traded.
Total built on overnight gains in New York, rising FFr17 to FFr1,059 with
79,050 shares traded. Its shares are due to be split into four on Monday.
MILAN closed weaker in thin pre-weekend trading. The Comit index fell 4.01
to 547.58, up 1.1 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at less than
Thursday's L131.8bn.
Fiat fell L89 during the session to L5,046, and lost another L6 after hours,
depressed by the previous day's industry data which showed that its share of
the domestic market was still declining.
But Generali and Mediobanca withstood selling pressure and gave some support
to the market. Generali fell L90 to L31,100 while Mediobanca eased L80 to
L15,670.
The telecoms sector fell 1.4 per cent in the wake of Thursday's confirmation
of Stet's big warrant bond issue. Stet and Sip both fell L11 to L2,384 and
L1,476 respectively.
OSLO was depressed by lower tanker rates and worries about 1991 company
results. The all-share index fell 3.66 to 434.43, down 2.8 per cent on the
week.
Hafslund A shares rose NKr1 to NKr267 after announcing record profits on
Tuesday, and made up NKr50m of the total turnover of NKr290m. Norsk Hydro
fell NKr2.5 to NKr144 ahead of its results due on February 20.
AMSTERDAM followed the dollar lower. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.9 to
121.3, little changed on the week.
The national carrier KLM fell Fl 1.40 or 3.5 per cent to Fl 38.20 in heavy
trading on reports that there was a delay in its agreement with British
Airways.
The grocer Ahold gained 50 cents to Fl 81.00 in spite of the weaker dollar,
ahead of its press conference on Monday at which it might announce another
acquisition in the US.
ZURICH recovered on a boost from Wall Street after trading lower for most of
the session. The all-share SPI index ended 1.1 up at 1,120.2 for a rise of
almost 1 per cent on the week.
Leu Holding bearers rose SFr50 to SFr1,750. Its principal unit, Bank Leu,
announced a 1991 net profit of SFr33.1m after SFr2.7m in 1990, when it had
to make provisions of SFr61m for fraud.
STOCKHOLM was pushed both ways, up by Merrill Lynch's expressed liking for
Astra and down by jitters ahead of next week's results from Ericsson. The
Affarsvarlden General index fell 2.0 to 966.8, down 0.3 per cent on the
week. Astra B rose another SKr10 to SKr580 and Ericsson B closed steady at
SKr118.
ISTANBUL jumped 4.5 per cent in active trade, on the second day of a
correction after a 14.4 per cent fall in the seven trading days to
Wednesday. The index closed at 4,576.13, up 195.09, but it was still 7.1 per
cent down on the week.

FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Caracus Stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CARACAS stock market closed yesterday with only 'a slight decline' from
the previous day, according to Mr Mario D'Alfonso, at the brokers Rafael
Alcantara, writes Joe Mann. On Thursday, when the market reopened after
Tuesday's unsuccessful military uprising, 22 stocks fell, four were stable
and one (Banco Caracas) gained.
Yesterday, small investors first pushed down share prices sharply, but most
had recovered by the close, Mr D'Alfonso said. However, foreign investors
had additional worries. On the Caracas foreign exchange market, the
Venezuelan bolivar took a beating, falling almost 3 per cent against the US
dollar on Thursday.

FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gains
as futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES trimmed early gains on a lack of fresh news ahead of the
weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rose 2.20 to 22,107.12, up 0.4 per cent on the week,
after a high of 22,373.08 and a low of 22,103.42. Continued
arbitrage-related buying pushed the index up in the morning but a fall in
futures prices in the afternoon prompted arbitrageurs to unwind their
positions.
Volume was steady at 200m shares. Advances led declines by 522 to 470 with
156 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 3.83
to 1,627.42 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.96 to 1,243.44.
Dealers dominated the market, while institutional investors remained on the
sidelines. 'Institutions have placed a lot of buying orders at the lower
levels, but no one wants to buy or sell at current prices,' said Mr Masami
Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Highly-priced, small capitalisation stocks, which had risen recently on
short-term buying, ran into profit-taking. Sega Enterprises fell Y100 to
Y13,900 and Keyence declined Y600 to Y11,300.
Sharp, the most active issue of the day, rose Y60 to Y1,430. The electronics
company saidrecently that it would sell high definition television sets at
Y1m, one-quarter of the current average prices. Sharp also announced a
semiconductor partnership with Intel, the US semiconductor maker, to develop
flash memory devices, a smaller and lighter semiconductor chip which can be
erased and reprogrammed.
Electronics makers fell on profit forecast downgradings. Hitachi fell Y5 to
Y898 and Toshiba by Y9 to Y635.
Bridgestone, the tyre maker, rose Y20 to Y1,150 on reports that Firestone,
its US subsidiary, would make a profit in the latter part of this year.
Speculators focused on Aids-related issues. Meiji Milk Products, which is
developing an anti-Aids drug, lost Y9 to Y900 on profit-taking after an
initial rise, but Okamoto Industries, the prophylactic maker, rose Y22 to
Y955.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 37.37 to 23,691.20 on small-lot selling late
in the day, in volume of 52.4m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker lost
Y500 to Y11,300.
Roundup
THE TWO remaining markets to reopen after the Chinese New Year, Hong Kong
and Taiwan, went in different directions yesterday.
HONG KONG climbed in heavy trading, the Hang Seng index closing 39.28 higher
at 4711.37, its second consecutive record high, for a 2.4 per cent rise on
the week. The index is up 9 1/2 per cent this year. Turnover hit HKDollars
2.8bn, its heaviest in two weeks, compared with Monday's half-day HKDollars
1.64bn.
Expectations of an interest rate cut, a new year rally, political
indications from China, and the sheer momentum of the recent rally were all
given credit for the gains.
TAIWAN tumbled in its first day's trading since it hit its 1992 high on
January 30, the weighted index losing 154.26 points, or 2.9 per cent to
5237.37 in turnover down from TDollars 56.6bn to TDollars 38.3bn.
Some brokers said that this was a technical correction, others that it was
also a reaction to Premier Hau Pei-tsun's call last week for a crackdown on
speculation.
The central bank is also expected to resume money market operations to
tighten liquidity next week.
KUALA LUMPUR saw buying by Malaysian corporations, supplemented by
government-controlled institutions and short-term investors as the composite
index ended up 14.03, or 2.4 per cent, at 589.84, 3.4 per cent higher on the
week.
BANGKOK featured a strong rally by Bangkok Land for the second straight day
as the SET index rose 8.99 to 780.08, 2.3 per cent better on the week, in
turnover of Bt12.4bn.
JAKARTA reported active local buying as the official index gained 7.16, or
2.5 per cent to 294.22, up 4.2 per cent on the week.
BOMBAY's bull run collided with rumours of a build-up of troops along the
border with Pakistan. The BSE index dropped 114.88, or 5 per cent to
2,194.48, although share prices were reported to be recovering after hours,
as the rumours subsided.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Appointments: Bunker's Dowty move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Bunker, finance director at Westland, is leaving the
Yeovil-based helicopter manufacturer after a 21-year stint for a potentially
much bumpier ride at Dowty, the aerospace components manufacturer in
Cheltenham.
While three times the size of Westland in market capitalisation terms, Dowty
has also suffered severely from the recession. Its flamboyant chief
executive Tony Thatcher quit for greener pastures last year and there have
been persistent rumours that TI or Smith Industries might launch a bid. 'I
hope he's got a cast-iron contract,' quipped one City observer, pointing out
that a lot could have changed by the time Bunker, 45, arrives as group
financial director at the beginning of August.
Westland, in turn, was evidently reluctant to let him go - his predecessor
at Dowty, Reg Moore, who was due to retire in March, had hoped shortly to be
on the ski slopes.
'Bunker is still quite a young man with tremendous energy,' says Dowty. 'We
might be in a bad patch now. But that may be a good time to join. This is a
very exciting company.'
Westland, while relatively secure in the longer term, is in danger of
treading water in the next two years with a very thin helicopter order book.
At Dowty, meanwhile, the excitement for Bunker - a geography graduate with
subsequent accountancy qualifications - is to try to pull the company out of
its current hole.

FT  08 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Racal active again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET was alive with rumours that a stakebuilder could have been at
work in Racal Electronics after a series of exceptionally large lines of
Racal stock - including a single block of 6m - traded via the Seaq
electronic system.
At the close of trading 35m Racal shares had changed hands, way above normal
levels of activity. But dealers pointed out that turnover in Racal
throughout the week had consistently topped levels regarded as usual in the
stock. Yesterday's heavy volume followed 5.7m traded on Monday, 31m on
Tuesday, 9.6m on Wednesday and 9m on Thursday, giving an aggregate turnover
of just over 90m shares, representing some 10 per cent of Racal's equity.
Racal shares settled a shade firmer at 51p.
It was said that much of the activity had been generated by a spate of buy
recommendations on the stock, principally from County NatWest and James
Capel. Nevertheless suspicions remained that a big buyer had been operating
in the market, mopping up any stock that came on offer. Williams Holdings
retains a 10 per cent stake in Racal, acquired during its unsuccessful bid
late last year. Tomkins, said to have been the anonymous bidder offering
Pounds 450m for Racal's Chubb division last year, was put forward as a
potential predator for the whole group. Tomkins is thought to be anxious to
expand, particularly in the security business. Specialists said a
stakebuilding exercise, followed by the purchase of Williams' stake, would
be a perfect platform to launch a bid for Racal.
Steel bought deal
British Steel was the second heaviest traded stock in the market with
business substantially boosted by a bought deal in the stock carried out by
Smith New Court, the securities house.
Smith confirmed it had bought a block of around 10m British Steel shares and
quickly placed the stock with a number of institutions.
The broker declined to reveal details of the trade but the Seaq delayed
ticker later revealed that a block of 9.5m British Steel traded at 70p
followed, quickly by a block of 1m shares at 71 1/2 p and a block of 9m
shares at 71 1/2 p.
Sun Alliance down
Sun Alliance was the biggest loser in a composite insurance sector suffering
from the effects of a further round of forecast loss increases, this time
instigated by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
Mr Stephen Dias, composite insurance specialist at Goldmans, acknowledged he
had sharply increased his estimates of losses at Sun Alliance and at Royal
Insurance.
Mr Dias said results from the composites, due to commence at the end of this
month, 'will be worse than the market expects; we don't like the sector.' He
said that damage caused by the recession 'is carrying on into 1992.'
He also increased his estimate of Sun Alliance's losses for 1991 from Pounds
437m to Pounds 470m and his estimate of Royal Insurance's losses from Pounds
285m to Pounds 320m.
The composite insurers season commences February 26.
Sun Alliance shares dropped 10 to 286p on turnover of 2.4m. Royal Insurance
dipped 4 to 286p on turnover of 366,000.
Bass, the biggest UK brewer, fell 15 to 520p in hefty trading of 6.2 million
shares, on news that the company is suing Promus, the Memphis-based company,
regarding the terms under which it acquired the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza
hotel chains in 1990.
A positive note from Smith New Court lifted Wellcome, the shares rising 6 to
1120p in muted trading. The recommendation focused on Wellcome's long-term
prospects, the house being particuarly keen on Wellcome's focus on
anti-viral drugs which inspire a bullish outlook for earnings.
BP, still buffeted by worries about the dividend cover and a boardroom rift
 -although this latter story has been vehemently denied all week, slipped 4
more to 239p; turnover was a thin 3.3m shares.
Other oil shares mirrored the market's concern that lines of stock in other
oil stocks may be unloaded in the short term. Enterprise, for example,
retreated 9 to 426p on turnover approaching 1m.
Standard Chartered continued to respond to the recent vague takeover
stories, edging up 4 more to 424p, while Midland, also viewed as a potential
takeover target, improved the same amount to 234p, albeit in thin trading.
Dowty Group eased four to 121p on suggestions the market that Cazenove, the
company's brokers, had turned cautious on the stock. The volume was 2.2m.
Vickers bounced 3 to 169 3/8 and continued to circulate that dividend
worries triggered by Smith New Court downgrading on Thursday, had been
overdone . Turnover in Smiths Industries rose to 2.8 , after a large seller
appeared leading the shares falling 4 to 275p.
Press reports from the Netherlands suggesting that corporation talks between
British Airways and KLM, had been delayed by a lack of agreement on BA's
financial injection to North West Airlines of the US sent the shares
retreating 9 to 221p. Turnover reached 5.9m. BA reports third quarter
results on Tuesday and the range of analysts' forecasts is between Pounds
40m and Pounds 50m.
The prospects of a settlement with its builders helped Eurotunnel harden 10
to 465p.
Tomkins eased another 2 to 433p with talks still circulating that the
company would soon make an offer for Racal. BTR edged 1p forward to 409 3/8
after Smith New Court found a buyer for a block of 1.6m shares at 407p.
Total volume reached 5.6m.
A pessimistic assessment of the brewing sector by County NatWest was another
factor depressing Bass, apart from news of the company's US law suit. County
suggested that Bass and Whitbread are likely to under-perform the sector in
the long term, because both are particularly vulnerable to pressure on
profit margins when the economy emerges from recession. Whitbread 'A' lost 5
to 448p. On the other hand Grand Metropolitan rose 7 to 919p, recouping some
of the week's loss, on receding fears about static pension fund surpluses.
Among food retailers Kwik Save fell another 17 to 577p as UBS Phillips and
Drew cut its profit forecast to Pounds 108m from Pounds 118m for the current
financial year, the lowest figure suggested so far. Kleinwort Benson reduced
its profit forecast for the company to Pounds 115m from Pounds 120m and
continued to strongly recommend selling the shares.
Great Universal continued to disappoint after an acrimonious presentation
given for the group by Warburg Securities on Thursday. GUS 'A' fell 9 to
1421p, shrugging off an earlier buy recommendation from company broker
Cazenove.
After a good run, SmithKline Beecham slipped back, as some buyers took
profits and a weak dollar combined to undermine the price. However, Credit
Lyonnais Laing is recommending a buy on the drugs group. The shares dropped
8 to 953p.
Selling sentiment in the US knocked Glaxo, which fell 13 to 816p. Talk of a
Nomura downgrade on ICI left the chemicals group off 20 at 1253p, although
the house denied the story.
News of Forte plans for raising finance knocked the shares in brisk volume
of 2.1m. The shares lost 4 to 219p.

Michael Stevenson, deputy editor of BBC Television's On The Record
programme, is to become the 11th secretary of the Corporation. At the age of
31 he is believed to be the BBC's youngest secretary.
Stevenson takes up his new job - which entails working closely with the BBC
Governors and board of management in policy-making and implementation - on
Monday in succession to John McCormick, who was recently appointed
controller of BBC Scotland.
Starting his BBC career in 1983 as a trainee producer in Radio Sport and
Outside Broadcasts, Stevenson moved to News and Current Affairs in 1988; he
was also chief assistant to the Policy and Planning Unit before moving to On
The Record.
A colleague says Stevenson is 'cool, with lots of political acumen and a
maturity beyond his years' - attributes that have clearly attracted the
attention of John Birt, the deputy director general.
He hails from Staffordshire and and was educated at Doncaster Grammar School
and Christ Church, Oxford.

FT  08 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POOR world economic outlook led to a dull and featureless trading
session in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealing in the March
contract opened at 2,560 but light selling soon sent it lower to touch
2,550.
A modest rally was attempted around 9am when March rose to 2,562 but the
gloomy outlook soon sent the contract into retreat once again.
The disappointing US jobless figures, together with the poor Wall Street
performance, only served to increase the selling of the contract.
March eventually closed at 2,545, down 22 on the previous session and 9
points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Volume reached
just under 5,000 contracts.
In traded options, turnover at 29,858 contracts was just shy of the 30,000
break-even level as dealers reported increased activity in the stock
options.
The FTSE 100 index option traded 6,602 contracts. Among the stock options,
BTR was particularly busy, trading 2,724 lots with the February 420 calls
the busiest series.
This was followed by Forte, which traded 1,818 lots with 220 puts. Also busy
was Hanson in which 1,694 contracts changed hands.

FT  08 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share losses increase in light
selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER negative trading session in UK equities yesterday rounded off a week
of persistent gloom for share prices. London extended its losses in late
trading in the wake of poor employment figures from the US, although the Dow
Average was still four points up when the UK markets closed for the weekend.
Government bonds lost about  3/8 of a point in nervous trading, while the
international blue chip equities were unsettled by weakness in the US
dollar.
Uncertainty over the outlook for Wall Street, where the Dow turned down
after London closed, continued to overhang confidence in the UK market. The
domestic scene also remained confused as the latest UK public opinion polls
indicated that the Conservative and Labour parties are still close together
in the public ratings.
The big institutions stayed out of the equity market, and a relatively high
total of Seaq-recorded bargains indicated some parcel-passing by the
marketmaking firms, which were busy yesterday picking up the pieces at the
end of a somewhat unsuccessful two week equity trading account.
Seaq volume advanced to 596.2m shares from Thursday's 546.2m. But Thursday's
value total of retail business remained unimpressive at Pounds 830m.
Equities opened slightly easier as the overnight Seaq ticker disclosed
further equity sales, and an attempt to steady behind the stock index
futures failed to hold.
Share prices were soon slipping away, with the brewery sector upset by
weakness in Bass on news overnight that it has filed a lawsuit in the US
regarding its Dollars 2.23bn purchase of the Holiday Inn chain.
Although there was little sign of institutional selling, traders sensed that
the sellers were not far away. The poor US jobs data, seen as a sign that
the US economy is weaker than believed, depressed share prices in London,
although the pressure was eased by hopes that the news might spark another
cut in US interest rates.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was 17.1 down at 2,517.2, virtually the low of
the day. The Index has fallen by 2 per cent (54 points) this week, giving
back almost all the gain achieved in the previous week. At last night's
close, the Footsie showed a gain of under seven points over the two week
account.
Although London money market rates were easier yesterday, the stock market's
hopes for an early cut in base rates remained suppressed. Among the interest
rate-orientated stocks, retailers and building construction groups remained
out of favour.
After falling away sharply, customer, or retail, business in equities has
revived strongly and is now well above daily averages for last year.

Wm Low, the Scottish grocery chain, announced after the close of the market
yesterday, that Colin Mitchell, md of its Supermarkets division, would leave
the company after being 'unable to resolve the future role he would play in
the organisation'.
The timing and phrasing of the announcement has all the classic ingredients
of an attempt to hush-up a boardroom row. It is believed that the forthright
Mitchell clashed with James Millar, chairman and chief executive, over their
areas of responsibility. Mitchell has worked at Wm Low since 1974, becoming

The Stafford, the luxury London hotel in St James's Place, has brought in
Alan FitzGerald as its new general manager, after French- Canadian Denis
Beaulieu moved to the United States at the end of last year.
FitzGerald, a 53-year-old Irishman, spent four years as managing director of
the Watergate Hotel in Washington which, like the Stafford, is owned by
Cunard. When it was sold he became, briefly, resort director for the Quinta
do Lago golf resort in the Algarve, before taking up the position at The
Stafford.
Starting off in the hotel business at 17, FitzGerald has spent most of his
career at Cunard or its parent Trafalgar House. For six years he was hotel
director of the Cunard line of ships, where he was among other things in
charge of the renovation of the QE2 on its return from the Falkland Islands
campaign.

The task of setting up a new government agency to handle planning appeals in
England and Wales has been given to an insider. Stephen Crow, who currently
heads the planning inspectorate division of the Department of the
Environment, will be chief executive and chief inspector of the Planning
Inspectorate when it becomes an executive agency on April 1.
Crow will head the organisation which manages the work of 800 inspectors and
other staff from its Bristol head-quarters. He will be responsible for the
day-to-day running of the Planning Inspectorate, under the same terms as
apply to more than 50 other organisations with agency status.
Crow, 57, is a fellow of the Royal Town Planning Institute. He joined the
Planning Inspectorate after a career in town planning at local government
level, and was appointed Chief Planning Inspector in 1988.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Russian
statement lifts aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM returned to the London Metal Exchange aluminium market
this week after a Russian diplomat suggested that the flood of metal from
his country that had been weighing down prices was over.
Russia 'did not supply even one tonne of aluminium in January', Mr Pavel
Smirnov, counsellor at the Russian mission to the European Community in
Brussels, told the Reuter news agency. 'It is not in our interests to supply
the market at low prices,' he added.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at the Ord Minnett trade house commented that this
confirmed observations of significantly reduced rises in LME warehouse
stocks of aluminium so far this year. Late last year, he noted, rises in the
exchange's twice weekly stocks reportings had been running at between 15,000
and 32,000 tonnes a time, but in January the rate had slowed to a little
over 6,000 tonnes. 'It would seem,' he said, 'that the metal which has been
coming onto the exchange represents vestigial 1991 material in the
pipeline.'
Mr Moore also found comfort in Mr Smirnov's observation that 'it is hardly
possible to imagine exports (of aluminium) rising (in 1992) because of many
problems with raw materials supply'.
While counselling caution, 'because rhetoric can often belie future
actions', he said: 'This latest view, the announcement. . . about Norilsk
(the biggest Russian smelter of nickel) more sensitively marketing its
nickel in 1992 and other factors such as de-stocking, demilitarisation etc.
do lend weight to our view that CIS shipments of metal to the west in 1992
will prove to be lower and less debilitating than the 1991 experience'.
The market's response to Mr Smirnov's statement was to lift the cash
aluminium price from the low of Dollars 1,207 reached in mid-week to Dollars
1,249.50 a tonne at yesterday's close, up Dollars 28 on balance.
The Norilsk factor has also helped to get the nickel market back on its
upward course late in the week. News that a compromise had been reached in
the German steel industry dispute lifted values on Monday, although traders
had already been playing down the likely impact of the threatened stoppage
on overall European nickel demand (steel-making is the main end use for
nickel). But a renewed retreat took the cash price to a low of Dollars 7,615
a tonne on Wednesday before it rallied to close yesterday at Dollars 7,895 a
tonne, up Dollars 230 on the week.
At the London bullion market the star performer was platinum, which
re-established its price premium over gold. Once again the prospect of
production cuts at Norilsk, where platinum is produced as a by-product of
nickel, played a part in the rise, which took the price to Dollars 369 a
troy ounce, up Dollars 20.75 on the week. Further impetus was provided by
speculative activity at the New York Mercantile Exchange, encouraged by
bullish chart patterns, and by talk that Impala of South Africa, the second
biggest producer, had been buying platinum to cover supply commitments.
Some traders were dubious, however, about the prospect for further gains,
arguing that the market was overbought and that 'stale bull liquidation' was
likely to emerge on any approach to the Dollars 380-an-ounce level.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices continued to fall
early in the week as any lingering hopes of real progress at this week's
International Coffee Organisation meeting in London evaporated. Assessment
of the market situation and consideration of possible measures to improve it
has been left to a working group. The group ended its meeting yesterday
morning and will meet not again until April 3, when it will prepare a report
for presentation at the ICO meeting scheduled for April 6-10.
Mr Nestor Osorio, Colombia's permanent London representative yesterday
dismissed the meeting as 'an intellectual gymnastic excercise on a static
bicycle'.
Prices steadied in mid-week but were on the retreat again yesterday, when
the May robusta price ended Dollars 12 lower at Dollars 886 a tonne, down
Dollars 20 on the week.
Cocoa prices were also under pressure and the May delivery position finished
Pounds 48 down on the week at a five-month low of Pounds 713 a tonne.
Dealers blamed persistent trade selling and investment fund liquidation
encouraged by reports of higher-than-expected arrivals of Ivorian beans and
bearish chart patterns.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar tumbles on job figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar fell two pfennigs as exceptionally bad US jobs data finally
closed the door on any hopes of a US economic recovery in the near future,
writes Peggy Hollinger.
The statistics showed that non-farm payrolls had fallen by 91,000 in
January. Although the range of forecasts had been unusually wide, the
average expectation had been for a rise in non-farm payrolls of about
40,000.
'No matter which way you slice them, they are still weak,' said HongKong
Bank economist Dr Mark Austin. 'The dollar could be moving back to the
levels at which it started the year.' That could be as low as DM1.50, he
added.
Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer with Sumitomo Bank, said the figures became
grimmer, the closer they were examined. 'The average working week went
down,' he said. 'That means factories were cutting back (jobs) and working
less.'
The dollar fell against most currencies, with the D-Mark winning the most
support. The US currency broke through strong support at DM1.57 with
apparently no trouble after the announcement. In London, the dollar closed
at DM1.5595, down from the previous day's close of DM1.5795. Against the
yen, it fell from Y125.70 to Y125.20 and weakened against sterling from
Dollars 1.8165 to Dollars 1.8380.
Speculation surrounded the next rate move in the US, with many traders
arguing that the case for a short-term cut had been strengthened by the
figures. However, some disagreed that a cut would actually happen. 'I think
Mr Greenspan (chairman of the Federal Reserve) knew how bad the figures were
going to be,' said Mr Feeny. 'The Fed is now in a watch and wait mode.'
Nevertheless, the market was betting heavily on a cut in the Fed funds rate
of 4 per cent some time next week.
The Canadian dollar, which has been weakening in recent weeks, took a heavy
blow from the declining dollar, falling as low as CDollars 1.1767. However,
aggressive intervention from the Bank of Canada pushed the currency up to
CDollars 1.1852.
While the market was coming down with a bump over the US economy, the D-Mark
was enjoying a late - albeit modest - lift within the exchange rate
mechanism.
Bundesbank President Mr Helmut Schlesinger's comments that the 6.4 per cent
pay settlement with steelworkers would be disastrous if used as a benchmark
gave virtually unnecessary support to the D-Mark.
Against the pound, the D-Mark firmed from DM2.8700 to DM2.8675. Sterling
remains firmly at the bottom of the grid, although it took some comfort from
the weakened peseta. The Spanish currency closed at 63.00/02 per D-Mark,
compared with the previous close of 62.99.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market rates eased slightly yesterday, implying more optimism about an
interest rate cut in the UK around the time of the March budget than has
been seen in recent weeks.
The key three-month interbank rate, which is a good indicator to sentiment
on interest rates, fell a touch from 10 9/16 - 1/2 at the opening to close
at 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent - the level of current base rates.
One senior trader said this was the first time three-month money had traded
around 10 1/2 for a couple of months.
Mr Nigel Newman, a senior economist with Barclays, said
the deciding factor on a UK interest rate cut would be sterling's position
within the exchange rate mechanism.
'Everything is in place for another half point interest rate cut,' he said.
However, if sterling was 'pushing against the bottom' of the ERM grid, that
could prevent a cut, Mr Newman added.
The March short sterling contract, which opened two basis points higher at
89.69, firmed to 89.70 by the close in London. This implies an interest rate
of 10.3 per cent in March.
Overnight money finished at sharply lower levels following a healthy
injection from the Bank of England. In early operations the Bank injected
Pounds 2.241bn, 'the biggest amount of help seen in one go since 1989,' said
the senior trader.
Initially, the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 2.3bn, which was later
revised to Pounds 2.55bn. Of the early assistance, Pounds 833m was comprised
of bands one and two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band three at 10 3/16
per cent, and band four at 10 1/8 - 3/32 per cent. A further Pounds 1.408bn
was purchased for resale on February 26 and 27 at 10 7/16 per cent. In the
afternoon the bank bought band one and two bills totalling Pounds 154m at 10
3/8 per cent and gave late help of Pounds 155m.
Call money eased in Germany as the market found itself with more than enough
liquidity. Rates were quoted at 9.55/60 per cent compared with Thursday's
9.60/65 per cent.
In the US, the Federal Reserve drained reserves by a weekend matched
sale-repurchase agreement at 3 13/16 per cent. The operation knocked
expectations that the Fed would cut the funds rate from 4 to 3 3/4 per cent.
The cut is still expected in the short-term, however, with early next week
leading the betting. Economists said they did not expect a cut in the
discount rate.

SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, increased
earnings in 1991 by more than 6 per cent to DM274m (Dollars 182.6m). Sales
increased by 10 per cent to DM6.3bn.
The sales gains were largely due to strong pharmaceuticals, with sales up 15
per cent. Diagnostic aids and oral contraceptives continued to be the
mainstays.
Schering's diagnostics sector accounted for 40 per cent of the
pharmaceuticals business.
An 8 per cent rise in agrichemicals was well above the sector's average,
Schering said.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Daiei bids for 42% of Chujitsuya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIEI, Japan's largest supermarket chain, yesterday launched a friendly,
partial takeover bid for Chujitsuya, a Japanese retailer active in the Tokyo
area.
If it goes through the deal will leave Daiei in control of nearly 20 per
cent of Japan's supermarket trade.
The offer, which is for up to 42 per cent of Chujitsuya's shares, at Y2,700
a share, could signal the end of a complex series of financial and share
deals that will help Daiei pursue its goal of ex-panding operations in
Tokyo.
The bid was signalled in early December, when Shuwa, the property and
retailing company, defaulted on loans to Daiei worth Y110bn (Dollars 750m).
Daiei had been holding a 33.9 per cent stake in Chujitsuya as collateral for
the loans.
At that time, Chujitsuya said it had given up efforts to stay independent
and would co-operate in a takeover by Daiei. A formal offer for the shares,
however, is required under stock exchange rules.
Under the terms of the offer, Daiei must receive acceptances for at least 35
per cent of the Chujitsuya's shares, worth Y85bn, or the offer will lapse.
It said it would purchase up to 38m shares, or just over 42 per cent of the
company.
Chujitsuya's shares were suspended yesterday, but finished with an asking
price of Y2,530 on Thursday.
Daiei is making 53.21 per cent of the offer itself, while the balance of the
offer is being placed through Maruetsu, a Daiei-controlled retailer in
Tokyo.
Daiei said that Chujitsuya would continue to operate as an independent
company and retain its separate stock market listing. However, a range of
measures would be taken to integrate the management and operations of the
two groups.
Daiei established itself as a leading retailer in western Japan, but was
hindered in its expansion into Tokyo because of high land prices. But the
steep fall in property prices, pushed the heavily indebted Shuwa to the
edge, creating an opportunity for Daiei.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Eurocom to raise FFr660m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROCOM, the French advertising agency which last summer became a leading
player in European marketing services by buying RSCG, one of its chief
competitors, has launched a FFr660m (Dollars 122m) convertible bond issue to
finance the acquisition.
The merger between Eurocom, which is controlled by Havas, the powerful
French media group, and RSCG has been clouded by controversy. The two
agencies, now called EURO RSCG, have for years fought fiercely in the French
advertising market. Their merger was followed by a stream of senior staff
departures and account losses.
For Eurocom, the acquisition of RSCG - which is best known in France for the
involvement of Mr Jacques Seguela, one of its founders, in President
Francois Mitterand's publicity campaigns - forms part of its international
expansion.
This reflects the trend for the large French agencies, including Publicis
and Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit, as well as Eurocom, to expand their interests
outside France in the face of intense competition from the powerful US, UK
and Japanese marketing services groups.
Eurocom's largest shareholders, Havas and Parthena Investissement, part of
the Suez industrial and financial group, have agreed to participate in the
refinancing, as has Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-owned bank which is
one of the biggest investors in RSCG.
The merger of the two agencies has, according to Eurocom, created the single
biggest advertising group in Europe and the sixth largest in the world.
Eurocom, which has long dominated the French marketing scene, expects to
have made net profits of FFr182m in 1991, a slight decrease of 5.7 per cent
on the previous year. Eurocom said the fall in profits was due to the
slowdown at Aegis, the London-based European media buying group in which it
is an investor.
Meanwhile, RSCG, which has been burdened by the debt incurred in its
acquisitions during the 1980s, made an estimated net loss of FFr56m before
provisions and extraordinary items last year, and an overall loss of around
FFr280m.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Honeywell wins Minolta case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONEYWELL, the US controls manufacturer, has been awarded Dollars 96m by a
US jury for alleged violation of its autofocus camera patents by Minolta,
the Japanese camera maker.
The case, which had been dragging through the courts since 1987, had been
portrayed by Honeywell as an important test case for American high
technology industry, which the US government reckons could be losing up to
Dollars 60bn a year through international piracy of its ideas.
Yesterday's award by a jury in a New Jersey federal court was substantially
smaller than Honeywell wanted, although it never put a precise figure on its
claim. The jury also decided against applying triple damages, on the grounds
that any infringement of the patent was not wilful.
Minolta denied Honeywell's claims throughout
The US company said it was delighted at the court's ruling and would
immediately seek an injunction banning the sale in the US of Minolta cameras
using the Honeywell technology. The aim would be to secure payment of the
award and encourage Minolta to reach a licensing agreement.
It would also put pressure for a settlement on 15 other Japanese companies
with which it is in dispute over the autofocus technology.
Minolta said it was gratified that the jury had rejected Honeywell's claims
of wilful patent infringement and was reviewing its options where he court
had found for Honeywell. The case stems from the invention by Honeywell in
the 1960s and 1970s of autofocusing technology for single lens reflex
cameras.
Honeywell signed 'advance disclosure agreements' with Japanese companies in
the late 1970s, giving them information which would allow them to
incorporate the technology in their cameras.
The US company claimed that the Minolta engineers involved in this set up a
secret parallel programme to develop a substitute and thus avoid royalty
payments.
However, Minolta argued in court that Honeywell's patents were not valid and
the unit at the heart of the contract claim was technically flawed.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Spie losses depress Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHNEIDER, the French electrical equipment group, yesterday announced the
resignation of Mr Georges de Buffevent, chairman of Spie-Batignolle, its
troubled building subsidiary, after disclosing that Spie's losses had
triggered a sharp fall in group net profits to around FFr300m (Dollars
55.5m) in 1991 from FFr950m in 1990.
Spie, in common with other building companies, has suffered from France's
economic slowdown. It blamed its fall into net losses of FFr950m last year -
from net profits of FFr251m in 1990 - on the sluggish state of the
construction market and the postponment of a number of industrial orders.
The 1991 performance also reflects the cost of a FFr150m restructuring
programme which Spie began in the second quarter of 1991, but will continue
throughout this year. Moreover, the company was hit by unspecified losses
from Transmanche Link, a consortium of contractors working on the Channel
Tunnel.
Spie yesterday said Mr de Buffevent had resigned because of disagreements
over strategy. He has been succeeded by Mr Claude Coppin, managing director.
Despite Spie's problems the Schneider group, which last summer won a bitter
Dollars 2.23bn hostile takeover bid for Square D, a US competitor, increased
its overall turnover by 13 per cent to more than FFr58bn in 1991. This
includes a seven-month contribution from Square D.
The Schneider board has decided to freeze its dividend for 1991. It
expressed confidence about group prospects for 1992 given the 'resilience'
of its industrial interests.

improvement
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO leading US airlines yesterday reported improved figures for both the
fourth quarter of 1991 and the latest 12-month period, although they both
remained heavily in the red for 1991 overall.
Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines holds a stake, saw the after-tax loss in the fourth quarter shrink
from Dollars 121.4m a year ago, to Dollars 79.2m. This was scored on
operating revenues up by 3.7 per cent at Dollars 1.89bn, and a pre-tax loss
which fell from Dollars 188.6m to Dollars 122.3m.
The passenger yield, however, fell from 12.80 cents to 11.97, and
comparisons with the fourth quarter of 1990 are muddied by the impact which
higher fuel prices - in the wake of the Kuwait invasion - were having on
airline profits worldwide. For 1991 overall, Northwest made a net loss of
Dollars 3.1m compared with a Dollars 10.4m deficit a year earlier.
Northwest's parent company, the privately held NWA, lost Dollars 316.9m
during the year, compared with Dollars 301.2m in 1990. The slightly worse
figure at the parent company level reflects lease and interest costs and
results from non-airline subsidiaries.
At Continental Airlines, the fifth biggest carrier, there was a small
fourth-quarter profit of Dollars 10.2m against a net deficit of Dollars
1.3bn a year earlier. For the year overall, the airline made net losses of
Dollars 340.9m, against a Dollars 1.2bn deficit in 1990. Its parent company,
Continental Airlines Holdings, reported a net profit of Dollars 4.41m in the
fourth quarter and a Dollars 305.7m deficit for the year.
The company has been in bankruptcy since late-1990, but filed a
reorganisation plan earlier this week. It claimed yesterday that results for
the last month of the year had been better than in any December since 1986
and that the 'positive trend which we are seeing is encouraging'.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Berlusconi's rescue plan for La
Cinq under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING figure in France's broadcasting establishment has criticised the
attempt by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial Italian entrepreneur, to
take over La Cinq, the ailing French TV station.
Mr Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, France's biggest single TV channel,
yesterday condemned the Berlusconi rescue bid as 'amoral'.
One reason for his criticism was what he claimed were overly long repayment
periods for La Cinq's creditors.
He was also critical of Mr Berlusconi's plans to provide programming for the
French station on the grounds that the Italian businessman would be using
his influence at La Cinq to make profits from selling his own programmes to
it.
TF1, together with two other French channels, Canal Plus and M6, has
produced proposals for a French-language news service to replace La Cinq. If
the Berlusconi bid fails, La Cinq would go off air and this service would be
one of the contenders to take its place.
However, the views of the French broadcasting establishment will play a part
in determining the success, or failure, of Mr Berlusconi's rescue proposals
which need the approval of the Paris commercial court and of the Conseil
Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the body that regulates French broadcasting, to
be implemented.
Mr Berlusconi submitted his bid, which involves a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 279m)
recapitalisation for La Cinq, of which he is one of the largest shareholders
with a 25 per cent stake, to Mr Hubert Lafont, the station's administrator

deemed suitable for further consideration.
If his bid is accepted, Mr Berlusconi is committed to reinvesting in La Cinq
to maintain his holding at 25 per cent, the maximum allowed under French
law.

FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Japanese brokers downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investor Service yesterday downgraded the long-term debt rating of
Japan's four biggest securities houses, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi in
response to what it sees as rising pressure on the profits of the four
companies.
The downgrading reflects the US ratings agency's view that the operating
environment for the securities industry will become more difficult as
regulatory change gathers pace.
Moody's said that the financial scandals of last year were likely to
accelerate the pace of financial deregulation, which could increase
competition and reduce profits.
In the case of Nomura, Moody's noted, it could be called upon to assist
affiliates in the brokerage, venture capital, and property business. Daiwa,
it said, would have difficulty reducing the recent increase in its fixed
cost base in spite of the troubles of the industry, and that while financial
deregulation would bring opportunities, these would be costly to exploit.
Nikko and Yamaichi faced similar difficulties. Yamaichi, it said, was
expected to make strategic and structural changes which could result in
charges to earnings. It was heavily dependent on wholesale business which
would be subject to increased competition, while its retail business would
expand only slowly.
Moody's none the less noted that all four companies had adequate liquidity
and a sound capital base. All four companies were expected to retain their
strong positions in the local market and continue to be active
internationally.
Reflecting the pressure on the securities industry, the Securities Dealers
Association of Japan said that employment in the securities industry had
fallen by 2,000 in the past year, to 156,500. Employment in the industry had
expanded rapidly from 110,000 in late 1986.

GENERAL DYNAMIC'S electric boat division may cut as many as 4,000 jobs in
response to government plans to cancel the Seawolf nuclear submarine
programme, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Mr Roger Tetrault, general manager of the division, said 2,200 employees
would be laid off by June 12, in addition to 300 previously announced job
losses. The programme's cancellation may force the division to reduce its
21,500 workforce by as much as 18.6 per cent by the end of the year.

HIGHER BEER sales in the US and a cleaning-services acquisition helped
Molson, the diversified Canadian brewer, lift net earnings to CDollars
110.4m (USDollars 94.3m) in the nine months to December 31, from CDollars
105.5m a year earlier, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Per share earnings dropped from CDollars 1.99 to CDollars 1.97 as a result
of a share split last July. Sales rose to CDollars 2.25bn from CDollars
1.98bn. Interest expenses jumped to CDollars 43.2m from CDollars 19.7m.
Molson Breweries, a joint venture with Foster's Brewing of Australia, raised
operating earnings by 22 per cent to CDollars 136.3m. The figures exclude
the company's return on preferred shares and the amortisation of a deferred
gain arising from the 1989 brewing merger.
The company is the second biggest supplier of imported beer to the US, with
a market share last year of 17 per cent. Molson Breweries' share of the
Canadian market was steady at 52 per cent, but volume for the industry as a
whole declined by 1.7 per cent in the nine months.
Operating earnings of Diversey Corporation, Molson's cleaning-services unit,
jumped by 39 per cent to CDollars 50m.

FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Second day of court questioning for Kevin
Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN Maxwell yesterday emerged from his second day in court, where he
had been responding to questions about the raiding of the Maxwell companies'
pension funds, to be greeted by 70 similar questions from the parliamentary
pensions committee.
Mr Maxwell, who last week lost his appeal that he had a right to remain
silent, spent nearly five hours in a private court examination under intense
questioning from the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, the manager of most of the pension funds.
Mr Neil Cooper, the provisional liquidator, from the accountancy firm Robson
Rhodes, is trying to trace Pounds 300m that has disappeared from the Maxwell
pension funds, which has left 30,000 employees and pensioners acutely
worried about their future. Mr Cooper declined to comment on the success of
the questioning, but it is understood that he may have more questions to put
to Mr Maxwell next week.
He is also likely to interview soon - outside court - Mr Larry Trachtenberg,
a director of one of the private Maxwell companies that handled some of the
pension money, and Mr Robert Bunn, finance director of many of the private
Maxwell companies.
Mr Kevin Maxwell and his brother, Ian, together with all other Maxwell
pension trustees, were also asked yesterday to reply within two weeks to 70
questions from the parliamentary social security committee which is trying
to prevent future abuse of company pension funds.
'Maxwell always went around with a gang of people and one of the things I
want to know is if any of that posse went into trust meetings,' Mr Frank
Field, MP, chairman of the committee, said yesterday.
Although the Maxwell brothers, who were trustees of the pension funds,
refused to answer questions when they appeared before the committee on
January 13, they indicated that they might answer written questions.
The questionnaire asks how much is missing from each pension funds, when the
trustees became aware it had gone, and how it disappeared.
It asks them to comment on their knowledge of secretive offshore trusts
connected with the web of private Maxwell companies with reference to a
diagram of the empire published by the Financial Times on November 6, the
day after Mr Robert Maxwell died.
The MPs ask: 'Were you ever a party to signing any transfer of funds, to
whom, and did you ever feel the need to seek professional advice'. They also
want to know why increases in benefits were not awarded in many years
despite the existence of a large surplus in the pension fund, and ask
directly: 'In whose interests did you believe you were acting as a trustee',
and 'did you ever vote against Mr Robert Maxwell'.
JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is about to be appointed by Price
Waterhouse, the administrators of MCC, to advise on the sale of the US
businesses Macmillan and Official Airline Guides. The US companies' pension
funds were run separately and are intact, making the sale possible.
Price Waterhouse yesterday moved the last two dozen employees of the MCC
central management out of the Holborn Circus headquarters into Price
Waterhouse accommodation.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in CML Microsystems fell 23 per cent yesterday to 247p after the
group issued a warning that profits for the second half of the year would be
moderately below the Pounds 2.37m returned for the first, writes Michiyo
Nakamoto.
The warning, which followed a relatively upbeat outlook for the year by the
group in November caught the City by surprise.
CML makes electronic equipment for cellular communications and traffic
control, and sells its products in international markets through agents who
anticipate sales and produce an annual sales schedule in January.
The sales schedule for this year showed many of its customers, particularly
those which buy semiconductors for cellular communications and radio,
deferring orders.
Although there had been surprise that CML seemed to be feeling the effects
of the recession much, analysts were alarmed by the high level of
rescheduling - at about 25 per cent - particularly as historically the
fourth quarter is the busiest for the group.

MR STEPHEN Dean has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Dean &amp;
Bowes, a designer and refurbisher of licensed premises and hotels. He will
be replaced by Mr Philip Sims, the company's former finance director.
Mr Dean is to buy out Dean &amp; Bowes (Contracts), a specialist public house
furnisher, for Pounds 300,000, after capitalisation of Pounds 420,000 of
inter company indebtedness and repayment of a further Pounds 1m.
Management accounts showed that the company incurred losses before interest
and management charges of Pounds 7,000 for 1991, compared with operating
profits of Pounds 488,000. Net assets of Pounds 78,000 turned round to
liabilities of Pounds 100,000.
Following the sale, Dean &amp; Bowes will concentrate on its billiards and
snooker subsidiary, EJ Riley, and several shop and interior refurbishment
businesses.
Dean &amp; Bowes has been disposing of assets in a bid to cut borrowings. In the
first half, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 301,000 (Pounds 1.71m).
The shares have collapsed since a rights issue last July at 60p raised
Pounds 1.38m. They fell 3p yesterday to a low of 17p. Mr Dean has reduced
his holding in the company from 25 to about 15 per cent following the
placing of 2m shares at 16.25p.

FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Reshuffle of management at Asda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the Leeds-based grocery chain which recently reported a severe slump
in profitability, is reshuffling its senior management with the aim of
producing a more focused retailing structure.
Mr Archie Norman, who became group chief executive at the end of last year,
will assume a more direct role in running the core retail business by taking
on the additional post of chief executive of Asda Stores.
This position was split between Mr Richard Harker and Mr Tony Campbell, who
become retail director and trading director respectively. The company also
expects to announce the appointment of a personnel director shortly.
Mr Norman is faced with a host of strategic and operational dilemmas as he
attempts to overhaul the grocery chain. But he stressed yesterday that he
wanted to return to Asda's 'traditional strengths', which he defined as real
value for money, a clear consumer image and tight cost control.
Asda has hired McKinsey, the management consultancy, to assess its financial
options and review its product offering.
The company is researching several possible trading formulas and is
especially concerned to develop a viable format for 49 of its older stores
which have been significantly underperforming its competitors. Asda intends
to launch a pilot store in June to experiment with a new approach.
The company is also working with Andersen Consulting to maximise the
effectiveness of information technology and introduce direct product
profitability (DPP) techniques. Such systems are already common among Asda's
competitors.
Last month Mr Norman argued that Asda could generate healthy growth simply
by squeezing more profits out of the company's under-exploited assets and
making a decent return on its Pounds 4bn of sales.

FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Fisons' best seller faces threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS' best-selling asthma drug, Intal, is set to come under pressure for
the first time from a newly-licensed generic competitor.
Mr Isaac Kaye, deputy chairman of Ivax Corporation, the US pharmaceuticals
group, said that Harris Pharmaceuticals, the company's UK subsidiary, had
received a licence from the UK authorities to sell a generic version of the
asthma drug. The company has also applied for licences to market the product
in Europe, he said.
The licence, for a meter-dosed aerosol inhaler system for Intal, may allow
Harris to take significant market share from Fisons. Analysts believe that
Intal sales represented Pounds 170m of the company's total revenues of
Pounds 500m during 1990. Sales in the UK alone are estimated at about Pounds
15m of those revenues. The product is highly profitable, according to
analysts.
Although Intal has been off-patent for some years, generic producers have
had problems designing an aerosol inhaler that will deliver the product
efficiently to asthma sufferers' lungs.
It is this problem that Harris, which has considerable experience in
inhaling technology, appears to have overcome. Fisons said that more than 50
per cent of Intal sales were in aerosol form.
The ability of Harris to exploit the British Intal market will depend upon
the company's ability to reach general practitioners and hospital
purchasers. The group has only a small sales team, according to analysts.
Similarly, Harris may have problems penetrating the continental market if
the product is licensed because of the strength of Intal's brand-name there.
Ivax is unlikely to exploit the Intal generic market in the US. A number of
Fisons' patents have not yet expired there.
In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration has not yet decided how to
license generic inhaled drugs. The FDA is expected to insist on expensive
clinical trials before licences will be issued.

FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hanson expected to show quarter-on-quarter
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is expected to announce its first
quarter-on-quarter fall in pre-tax profits for 28 years when it publishes
its first quarter results on Thursday.
Analysts' forecasts for Hanson's three months to December 31 range from
Pounds 220m to Pounds 240m, compared with Pounds 241m in the comparable
period.
The expected fall in profits is partly explained by the continuing effects
of the recession on both sides of the Atlantic.
Lord Hanson, chairman, has said that the UK recession was likely to continue
to affect Hanson's business for the first half of the year.
While Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the group's US arm, told
shareholders last month that 'the US economy remains sluggish' and that he
did not anticipate any beneficial effect until at least late 1992.
However, last year's first quarter figures were also boosted by the last
two-month contribution from Cavenham Forest Industries through a Dollars
1.3bn swap for its 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining.
Mr Nyren Scott-Malden, conglomerate analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said:
'The difficulty of getting organic growth from the mature businesses will
force the group to continue to grow by acquisition, which is becoming more
difficult as the group gets larger.'
Lords Hanson and White are to address institutional shareholders,
representing about 80 per cent of the equity, at a meeting in London on
Friday.

FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wolseley makes Pounds 95m French buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLSELEY, the plumbing equipment distributor, has made its first move into
continental Europe with the purchase of the Brossette group, France's
largest plumbing supplier.
Wolseley, which has already built up a dominant position in the UK and US,
will pay FFr931m (Pounds 95.1m) to buy the company from the Brossette
family, which started the business in 1841 in Lyon.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, Wolseley's chairman and managing director, said
Brossette was almost a carbon copy of Wolseley's UK business and the
acquisition would give the company a beach head for later expansion into
Europe.
'In our view, you can't go into Europe from the UK without something in
France first,' he said.
Brossette claims a 12 per cent share of the French plumbing and heating
supplies market, according to Mr Pierre Brossette, the main shareholder. Mr
Brossette, who will remain president, said he agreed to the sale because
there were no family members to inherit the business.
Wolseley is paying about 14 times historical earnings for Brossette, which
is expected to report profits before tax of at least FFr101.4m for last
year.
The consideration was satisfied by about Pounds 10m cash and the issue of
21.47m shares at 400p, which were placed yesterday by SG Warburg Securities.
Wolseley's shares were steady yesterday, closing up 1p at 414p. The shares
fell sharply on Thursday, dropping 14p, apparently ahead of the
announcement.
Gearing will rise from 20 per cent to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent,
reflecting the increased bank borrowing and FFr315m of debt being taken on
within Brossette.
Brossette has 176 outlets throughout France, more than three times its
nearest rival. Last year the company began a small operation in Belgium. Mr
Lancaster said the expanded group would also look at Spain and Germany, but
only if the right acquisition became available.
Brossette has been affected by the recession in the construction industry
and by a fall in new housebuilding in France. But profits this year were
expected to be steady, reflecting an upturn in renovation work, Mr Brossette
said.
In October Wolseley reported profits down by nearly a third from Pounds
120.7m to Pounds 80.3m in the year to end-July 1991 due to recession in the
US and UK.
Mr Lancaster suggested yesterday there had since been little improvement.
But he said March and April would provide better pointers for gauging the
extent of any upturn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DALGETY, the UK foods group, yesterday announced that it had bought Sooner
Snacks, the UK subsidiary of Borden of the US, in a further rationalisation
of the branded snacks market.
Dalgety is paying Pounds 30m for Sooner's share capital and will repay
Pounds 14m of inter-company loans.
The acquisition will increase Dalgety's share of the overall snacks market
to just under 20 per cent when it combines Borden's products with Golden
Wonder, its leading brand.
Mr Maurice Warren, Dalgety's chief executive, said the company would be able
to use Borden's fleet of delivery vans to increase Dalgety's share of
impulse sales in the pubs, clubs and garages market.
Borden, which has interests ranging from food to adhesives, has seen fierce
competition in its domestic market on the snacks side, although it has
stepped up efforts to protect its number two position in the salty snacks
market recently.
The company claimed that the sale of the UK unit had no impact on its
commitment to North America, and that its thrust into the Germany, Hungarian
and central European markets would continue.
The sale is a further commitment to the foods industry after years of
involvement with volatile activities like commodity trading. It is now
concentrating on snacks, petfoods, food ingredients and agri-business.
Sooner had sales of Pounds 57m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m in the
year to December 1990. Manufacturing in Scunthorpe, it has brands like Nik
Naks, Ghostbusters, Groovers as well as traditional crisps.
Mr Warren said Dalgety was still looking to expand with acquisitions in
continental Europe but that when a company like Sooner was for sale it was
too good an opportunity to forego.
'Its portfolio of snack and crisp brands, its wide distribution in the
impulse sector and its van sales force complement the commercial and
management strengths of Golden Wonder,' he said.

SHARES IN BASS, the brewing and hotels group, tumbled 15p to 520p yesterday
on news that it had filed a lawsuit in the US over the Dollars 2.23bn
(Pounds 1.23bn) acquisition of Holiday Inns in North America two years ago.
Bass said that it had taken the action against Promus, the US-quoted casinos
and hotels company which remained after the Holiday Inn business had been
sold, 'to protect its right to enforce its claims for indemnification for
breaches of warranties and representations'.
The warranties and representations, given by Promus in merger and
tax-sharing agreements relating to the acquisition, were due to expire last
night. They cover various aspects of the condition of the hotel chain at the
time of the takeover.
Bass said: 'It is not possible at this stage to quantify any potential
recovery from Promus under the claims for indemnification.'
The group is already pursuing one claim in excess of Dollars 10m.
Bass made substantial provisions in its accounts for acquisition costs in
both 1990 and last year. The company said yesterday:'I can confirm that the
down-side has been adequately provided for.' Analysts estimate that the US
hotels contributed about Pounds 68m or 11 per cent of Bass's total trading
profits of Pounds 616m last year.

MR STEPHEN Hinchcliffe, chairman of James Wilkes, the engineering group on
the receiving end of a hostile bid from Petrocon, was yesterday ousted from

A majority of institutional shareholders are thought to have grown
dissatisfied with the lack of progress since Mr Hinchcliffe refinanced the
leisure and computer services company two years ago and had threatened to
requisition an extraordinary general meeting to change the board.
Mr Andrew Hartley and Mr Chris Harrison, both also executive directors of
Wilkes, have also resigned from the board of Lynx. Mr Hinchcliffe is
replaced as chairman of Lynx by Mr Roger Pinnington, chairman of Telfos
Holdings.
In November the share prices of Lynx and Wilkes fell on news that Mr
Hinchcliffe had been arrested. He was not charged. West Midlands Commercial
Fraud Squad said Mr Hinchcliffe was arrested as part of an investigation
into WB Industries, a West Bromwich engineering company.

FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson chairman likely to resign
after review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW REID, chairman of Brown &amp; Jackson, the discount retailers, is
expected to announce his resignation on Monday, following the completion of
a review of the company's purchase of a subsidiary from Mr Bryan Duffy, its
former chairman.
Yesterday, Henry Ansbacher and Co announced that 75 per cent of the
subsidiary, Advanced Technology Industries, would be transferred back to its
original owners in exchange for an agreement to drop claims to nearly Pounds
11m of the original purchase price. Also, ATI's loans to Brown &amp; Jackson are
to be converted to debt and redeemable preference shares.
Ansbacher had agreed to act as B&amp;J's financial advisers last October on the
condition that Mr Reid would resign, if necessary, following an internal
review.
Ansbacher recently completed that review and concluded that as much as 40
per cent of ATI's profits between 1988 and 1990 may have been questionable.
Remuneration to the former owners, including Mr Duffy and Mr Christopher
Bailey, another former B&amp;J director, were based on profits earned by ATI in
that period.
Profits were negligible in 1987 and ATI is estimated to have made a Pounds
2.3m loss for 1991. However, in each of the three years upon which payments
were based, ATI showed profits of more than Pounds 1m. Overall, B&amp;J has paid
more than Pounds 8m for ATI.
Shareholders had urged the resignation of Mr Duffy late last spring, saying
they would not inject the needed new capital unless he left.
Last September, Mr Duffy announced his resignation following a Pounds 4.3m
loss for the first half of 1991, saying he would take responsibility for the
company's poor performance. However, he had sought to remain with the
company as a consultant, which was opposed by shareholders.
Among other things, shareholders questioned the terms of the investment in
ATI which had been recommended by Mr Reid, a director at the time.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Partners at odds in their special relationship: Japan - no
longer such an admirer of America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not new for Americans to criticise Japan, even to the extent of
smashing a Japanese car with a sledgehammer in protest at Japanese trade
practices, as happened in Detroit this week. Nor, is it new for the odd
Japanese politician to insult American workers, as Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
Japanese prime minister, inadvertently did this week when he questioned
Americans' 'work ethic'.
What is novel is the reaction these insults have provoked. In Japan, people
are at last beginning to say what they have long felt - that, in some
respects at least, the Japanese way of life is superior to America's. Mr
Takayoshi Miyagawa, a public opinion poll expert, says: 'America today is no
longer the America which we admired for so long.'
The smashing of the Honda car was widely publicised in Japanese newspapers.
One commentator said: 'This childish American stunt makes us feel even more
contempt for Americans. And, although Mr Miyazawa apologised for the
'misunderstanding' caused by his remarks, many Japanese feel that he
accurately reflected their feelings in saying that too many Americans went
to work on Wall Street and too few in industry.
Japanese employees do work longer hours than their US counterparts - an
average of 2,201 hours in 1990, compared with about 1,900 in the US -
according to German Economic Institute figures; but Japanese productivity
remains lower than in the US. In 1988 Japan was 80 per cent as productive as
the US - although the gap is narrowing.
There was also some annoyance that the comments had been reported overseas.
One former foreign ministry official said that, since the prime minister had
been talking in the Diet, he might have assumed that he was speaking only to
Japanese - a sign perhaps of the distance the Japanese still have to travel
before they are truly at home in an international environment.
Indeed, Japan remains uncertain of the position it wants in world politics.
The government's policy is to secure greater influence, through increased
participation in the UN, including a permanent seat on the Security Council.
But most Japanese people are wary - witness the popular opposition to a bill
that would allow Japanese servicemen to join UN peacekeeping missions.
Taxpayers are increasingly critical of Japan's contributions to overseas
aid. One official says that, when he spoke in a provincial city, he was
asked: 'Why spend it abroad? Spend it here.' In political affairs,
therefore, the US is likely to continue to take the lead over Japan.
Much depends on how the recent spate of Japanese criticism of the US
develops. It could die away, as did public protests about the security pact
and the Vietnam War.
Moreover, anti-US feelings mix uneasily with a love of things American.
McDonald's and Coca-Cola, baseball, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Madonna - all
are worshipped in Japan. Hawaii is the most popular holiday destination.
Equally, if some Japanese are quick to condemn Americans for being lazy,
ill-educated and spendthrift, others are sad to see a great ally humbled.
Among them is Mr Miyazawa, who during Mr Bush's visit called on the Japanese
to help the US in return for the support America extended after the war. He
has said that the US saved Japan from starvation.
During Mr Bush's visit, however, the Japanese felt deeply insulted by the
chief executives of the big three US motor companies who accompanied him,
and who demanded that Japanese carmakers agree to buy their products. If
anything can promote anti-Americanism in Japan, it is bullying over economic
issues by the US. As Mr Miyazawa says: 'When the US acts like a dictator
over Japanese businesses then we feel contempt towards the US.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: A safer method of payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CLEONE CHRISTIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'My cheque is in the post. . .', (February 1) caused me
to reflect, not for the first time, on the high-handedness of companies
which give their shareholders little option but to pay for rights issues by
cheque, sent of course at the shareholder's risk. If the safest method of
transferring money is through the inter-bank giro system, why do not
companies include on their provisional allotment letters the account number
and sorting code of the branch of their bank to which payment is to be made?
This would give shareholders the option of a safer method of payment.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Route to offering Continental car prices to
motorists in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OSMAN STREATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a simple measure which would, overnight, enable the British
motorist to buy the car of his or her choice at the lowest prevailing
Continental price. It is to change to driving on the right, in vehicles with
the steering wheel on the left.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission report mentions that the Wilson
government reviewed this situation in 1966, and again in 1969. On both
occasions, they decided that the change would cost the Treasury too much.
The MMC seems to think that a policy decision by a government whose place in
history is by no means certain and whose equivocal stance on membership of
the European Community is a matter of record must stand for all time.
Today, in the age (if it lasts) of the Consumer's Charter, can we not move
to a policy which is consumer-driven rather than Treasury-driven - and make
the obvious, overdue change to driving in cars which are inherently cheaper
because they follow a common European standard?

   From Lord STRATHALMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Grossman's attempt (Letters, February 5) to include Lloyd's in the
'regulatory disasters' of BCCI and the Maxwell pension funds is misguided.
Generalised assertions and allegations are easy to make but should not be
confused with evidence, let alone proof. In Britain, one is innocent unless
proven guilty by a court of law. Lloyd's has not been found 'guilty' of any
fraudulent conduct. Although Lloyd's has taken its own effective
disciplinary actions in a number of cases, those relate primarily to events
that occurred before the passing of the new regulatory framework under the
1982 Lloyd's Act.
Mr Grossman is a plaintiff against Lloyd's in the US and his letter has the
appearance of an attempt to argue his case in the media rather than the
proper forum.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Muddled thinking that hits N Ireland economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DAVID HITCHENS and MR ESMOND BIRNIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The media inevitably focuses on the cycle of terrorism in Northern
Ireland and this obscures the province's long-term economic predicament.
Chronic large-scale unemployment cannot but aggravate the troubles. In this
context the question as to who will became the next chief executive of the
Industrial Development Board (IDB) in Northern Ireland is of particular
importance. This appointment is especially significant since the current
rethink of government economic policy is heavily reliant on the operational
competence of the agency.
Independent academic research has demonstrated the IDB's undistinguished
record in the past and failure to address the roots of Northern Ireland's
lack of competitiveness. For example, job creation has substantially lagged
behind that in other UK regions (the troubles cannot be used to excuse all
of this difference) and the Irish Republic. Unemployment is forecast to
remain at about 15 per cent well into the next century. Inward investment
projects have experienced relatively high rates of closure (despite
assistance traceable, in some cases, to the year of closure). The
productivity of the manufacturing sector remains low.
Northern Ireland's economic weaknesses derive in part from too much reliance
on people whose training and experience is too narrow. This is reflected in
the muddled way in which the IDB, and parts of the Northern Ireland civil
service, are attempting to put their strategy into operation.
The root weakness is longstanding poor productivity and very likely what is
required is a shock which will project manufacturing on to a higher growth
path. Not only is this unlikely to be delivered by those who have presided
over failed policies, it is also doubtful if the required knowledge and
ability exists in the province. Above all, new ideas are needed and a very
generous remuneration should be offered in order to attract a widely
experienced industrialist to the IDB post. Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern
Ireland secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland Office minister,
should therefore cast their net very widely.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Grandparent's travel costs questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am intrigued to know how Mr Foster (Letters, February 6) adds one
grandparent to his group travelling from Skipton to London and increases his
costs by Pounds 200. The most expensive ticket for the journey is Pounds
132. Should the grandparent be aged 60 or over, by purchase of a Pounds 16
Senior Railcard he or she can reduce that fare to Pounds 87.10.
Would that BR were in the happy position of being able to 'mentally write
off' the cost of its vehicles.
In the real world, however, not only do the Intercity 225 trains Mr Foster
would use for the bulk of his journey cost Pounds 4m a piece but we are
expected to make a return on that investment too.
That said, those without aspirations to a BMW can travel from Skipton to
London from a little as Pounds 33 for an APEX ticket.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Partners at odds in their special relationship: US -
knee-jerk responses and second thoughts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever a prominent Japanese implies that the US is no longer a paragon of
every virtue, Americans react reflexively and negatively. It happened this
week after Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's observations that perhaps the US
(and also Japan) had its values skewed in the 1980s by the pursuit of easy
money and the sacrifice of the 'work ethic'.
American second thoughts, however - and there have been several columns and
editorials this week concurring with Mr Miyazawa's sentiments, if not with
his tact and timing - have nothing like the impact of the initial demarche
and response.
Sometimes second thoughts even translate into action. Last month, for
example, Mr Fay Vincent, the commissioner of baseball, reacted in horror to
the proposal that a Japanese-led group take control of the Seattle Mariners.
Baseball, he intoned, was an American game and the fact that the people of
Seattle welcomed Japanese ownership as the only way of preventing the team
from being moved to Florida was irrelevant.
This week Mr Vincent somewhat changed his tune, having listened to arguments
from citizens of the north-west, who are conspicuously less agitated by the
Japanese threat than most of their countrymen because they know them better
and trade with them more. He noted that the Japanese-born president of
Nintendo of America had lived in the Seattle area for 15 years and might,
therefore, be said to meet the notional stipulation that ownership of a
franchise be definably local.
However, most public rhetoric, if not substantive action, is all one way and
against Japan. This is not new, but it has been given current point by
President George Bush's trip to Japan last month. Never before had a US
president gone on such an overt begging mission. Its sad climax at a banquet
seemed to symbolise the weakness of the US against the economic might of its
former client state.
This sense, allied to the offence taken at the remarks of Mr Miyazawa and
others, has produced a scattered knee-jerk response. Several businesses have
put into effect 'buy America' discounts and subsidies for their employees.
More significant seemed the decision by the Los Angeles transit authority to
cancel an order placed with Sumitomo of Japan for light rail cars, although
it did advance the case that the collapse of American inner city public
transport meant that the country needed a revived indigenous transit
manufacturing industry.
This is also a presidential election year, which means anything can become
an election issue. This is especially so in a country still in recession,
where the dominant political theme has been not sex but the potent
four-letter word 'jobs'.
It follows, therefore, that the easy charge to make, regardless of its
truth, is that Japan is stealing American jobs. Predictable political
grandstanding apart, there has been rather less of this than might be
expected. Among Republicans, Mr Pat Buchanan, who is challenging Mr Bush in
the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday week, can get in his 'America first'
haymakers. Mr Bush finds himself obliged to proclaim that the US has not
lost its work ethic, but is now a touch reluctant to identify himself too
closely with the highly paid US car company executives whose presence in his
Japanese entourage was criticised.
Of the Democrats, only Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa, who is the closest to
organised labour, engages in mostly unadulterated Japan-bashing. Senator Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska did broadcast one TV commercial portraying himself
guarding an ice hockey net against presumably Japanese attackers, but he has
subsequently partly disowned this pitch. As a former governor, he is not
insensitive to the attractions of Japanese investment, estimated now to
provide 600,000 direct jobs in the US.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Sponsorship that is often irrelevant to the arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From S W MASSIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Antony Thorncroft's article on business sponsorship of the arts
('Identity crisis - Sponsorship', January 3) is a useful sample of the
perilous state of the arts and the irrelevance of such sponsorship to the
arts if advertising is all the sponsors want out of it. It always seems that
they get far too much in terms of 'hospitality rooms', special dispensation
for delaying the start of concerts while the sponsor's guests dawdle to
their seats and superfluous labelling on posters, programmes and the like.
For them to claim media coverage in the review as well is tantamount to
requiring Frances Barber in the National Theatre's Night of the Iguana to
have the sponsor's name emblazoned across her bosom.
The deficiencies of arts sponsorship can be exemplified by the current state
of the Parthenon - a building designed by sponsors, a column each and the
odd pediment but not the roof or heart of the building, and certainly not
the soul.
The current deplorable state of our sporting contests, cricket and football
leagues and no doubt everything else shows how these have become degraded
precisely because of the embrace of business sponsorship for the wrong
reasons. It is the quality of the play that justifies the sponsor and not
the other way about.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Better a language that confuses than one that is
over-exact?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms KATHARINE SINDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by James Morgan ('As They Say in Europe: Watch your
tongue]', January 25) on the perils of other people's languages cites German
irritation with the imprecision of the English phrase, 'Old Fish Hill
Street', in which no indication is given of whether 'old' refers to fish,
hill or street. This could beg the question, from an English-speaking
person, of who would necessarily want to know such a thing, or, indeed, why.
However, the example brought to mind Mark Twain's essay, 'The awful German
language' quoted in the book, Words and Women, by Casey Miller and Kate
Swift. After pointing to the absurdity and apparent indignity of young
ladies and wives being described as genderless, while mere turnips are
designated female, Twain continues: 'To describe a wife as sexless may be
called under-description, that is bad enough, but over-description is surely
worse. A German speaks of an Englishman as the Englander; to change the sex,
he adds -in, and that stands for Englishwoman - Englanderin. That seems
descriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he
precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to
follow is feminine, and writes it down thus: die Englanderin - which means
'the she-Englishwoman'. I consider that that person is over-described.'
Presumably, the degree of description deemed necessary is in the eyes or
ears of the variously mother-tongued and therefore biased beholders.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Home-grown recessions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's House of Commons exchanges between Britain's incumbent prime
minister and the pretender to his throne were unedifying. On both Tuesday
and Thursday, Mr Major and Mr Kinnock engaged in a row over whether the
government or the outside world should be blamed for the length and depth of
the current UK recession. The truth lies in between.
Mr Major's injured innocence is understandable. Over the past two years he
has done almost everything that both the British economic establishment has
told him to do, and that Labour said it would do. He has joined the European
exchange rate mechanism, cut interest rates regularly, and effectively
ditched his balanced budget rule. But the economy remains stuck in its sixth
quarter of recession, with no chance of a worthwhile pre-election recovery.
It is true that growth has also slowed in Japan and Europe, and turned to
recession in the US and Canada. Yet Mr Kinnock's argument carries weight.
The UK recession started first, and has proved deeper than in all these
countries. Moreover, its immediate cause is the tight monetary policy in the
two years prior to ERM membership. What does unite these non-European
countries is that they deregulated their financial markets in the 1980s;
subsequently experienced a build-up of asset price inflation and personal
and corporate debt; and have been forced to use tight monetary policy to
puncture their asset market bubbles in a painful fashion, without inflating
away the outstanding debt. These were government choices.
In addition, Britain has joined the ERM. The US, Japan and Canada have all
moved to a loose monetary policy over the past year. But UK interest rates
have been kept high by Germany's tight monetary policy. So UK real
short-term interest rates remain above 7 per cent compared with less than 1
per cent in the US.
Unwillingness
Little wonder that the UK recession has been so deep. Recovery will not
materialise until consumers start borrowing and so reduce the savings ratio
from its current high level. Their unwillingness to do so has left egg on
the face of most of the UK economics profession. Economists at S G Warburg,
for example, were forecasting as recently as November that the savings ratio
would fall to 8.6 per cent this year. They now expect it to rise to 10.7 per
cent, and have cut their 1992 growth forecast by more than half. Goldman
Sachs remains more optimistic, expecting savings to fall and spending to
pick up this year. Consumers, it argues, are saving more than 'is justified'
by past behaviour or the level of household debt.
If only someone would tell them. The truth is that not until they feel
secure about the future will consumers start spending again. When this will
be is anyone's guess, as is shown by yesterday's news that US non-farm
employment fell last month, against an expected rise. Low real interest
rates cannot, by themselves, persuade consumers that the immediate future
will be better than the immediate past.
Sustained recoveries
Only when spending on durable consumer goods picks up decisively will
sustained recoveries be assured. In the UK, the recent evidence is not
encouraging. Housing sales in the last quarter of 1991 were down on the
previous quarter and 1992 has not started any better. House prices fell
again in January compared with the year before, while sales of new cars hit
their lowest January level since 1982.
Commercial investment is no more likely to drive the recovery than consumer
investment. The latest Confederation of British Industry survey confirmed
that investment will fall throughout this year. The news that Ford is laying
off 2,100 of its UK employees, thereby clawing back the negotiated increase
in its salary bill, will have done nothing to boost consumer confidence. Nor
are export markets likely to be a source of economic growth this year. The
US recovery is still on hold, while German interest rates now look set to
remain high until the wage round is complete, depressing prospects for
growth in Europe.
Little wonder, against this depressing background, that Mr Major is looking
for scapegoats. He does have some room for manoeuvre on fiscal policy, the
one area of economic policy where a real debate continues. Labour would
offer a budget for investment; the government may well choose to cut
personal taxes. Yet neither has much room to play with.
Mr Major's one advantage is that he still retains some residual influence
over interest rates. With sterling comfortably above its floor in the ERM,
he can and should cut interest rates and soon. Further bad news in Germany
could easily force German rates up, and thereby close this rate cut window.
Then Mr Major would surely go naked into the election campaign.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Budget '92: Luck may smile on Lamont - Britain's chancellor
has more room for manoeuvre to produce an election-winning Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont has had less than his share of political good fortune since
becoming chancellor. But half way through pre-Budget purdah, his luck may be
changing.
Although the immediate outlook for the UK economy is bleak, and his second
Budget on March 10 will have to take account of a sharp downwards revision
of the government's growth forecast for this year, the chancellor has more
room for manoeuvre than only a month ago. Providing there are no disasters,
he should be better placed than at the start of the year to influence the
economy and the outcome of the forthcoming general election when he finally
reveals the secrets of Mr Gladstone's battered red and gold Budget box to
the nation.
At first sight, Mr Lamont has little reason to be pleased with his lot. The
economic recovery that was promised so many times last year has proved
elusive. Official figures, due on February 20, are expected to show that
gross domestic product resumed its decline in the fourth quarter of last
year. The economy is now thought to have shrunk by a steep 2.5 per cent in
1991 compared with the government's Autumn Statement forecast of a 2 per
cent drop in GDP.
The persistent recession is prompting the Treasury and outside forecasters
to scale back expectations of growth this year. The latest survey of UK
forecasts by Consensus Economics, a business information group, released
yesterday points to growth of 1.2 per cent this year compared with the 2.3
per cent GDP gain forecast by the Treasury last November.
Gloom has been compounded by several downbeat soundings of business opinion
over the past month, culminating in the Confederation of British Industry's
quarterly industrial trends survey which saw business optimism fall compared
with the previous quarterly poll in October.
Paradoxically, pressures on financial markets have eased. Moreover, the idea
of a more active fiscal policy to combat the recession is gaining
respectability, giving the chancellor more elbow room.
Fears of a sterling devaluation in the European Monetary System have
receded. Although the pound has been stuck at the bottom of the exchange
rate mechanism, it weathered December's sharp increase in German interest
rates without significant support from the Bank of England. Interest rates
have edged downwards. The three-month interbank rate - at about 10.5 per
cent yesterday - is now pointing to a Budget-time fall in base rates from
10.5 per cent at present, while several top mortgage providers were able to
cut their lending rates by about 0.5 percentage points last month. The
market for government gilt-edged stock has been strong while even equities
have gained moderately in the teeth of adverse company news. By last night,
the FT-SE 100 index was up by about 1 per cent compared with the start of
the year.
The thaw on financial markets has coincided with a growing acceptance in the
City that the government will be forced to increase its borrowing this year
beyond existing targets. The City consensus indicates that the chancellor
should be able to 'give away' about Pounds 2bn in his Budget. But some
economists, including Mr Roger Bootle of Midland Montagu and Mr David Kern
of National Westminster Bank, think he can cut taxes by Pounds 4bn.
A Pounds 4bn give-away is not very great in the context of a Pounds 600bn
economy. But it has to be set against rising public expenditure and a
deteriorating trend in the nation's public finances. The 1991-92 public
sector borrowing requirement is almost certain to exceed the government's
most recent forecast of Pounds 10.5bn. Even before taking Budget changes
into account, lower than expected growth suggests that the government will
be hard pressed to keep the 1992-93 PSBR down to the 3 per cent of GDP, or
roughly Pounds 18bn, assumed in November's Autumn Statement.
But rising PSBR figures have been losing their power to shock. Advocates of
greater fiscal activism argue that lower taxes or higher government spending
are a necessary response to the constraints imposed by sterling's membership
of the exchange rate mechanism. They are encouraged by Britain's low level
of government debt compared with other leading industrialised countries and
recent events abroad. This week's high 6.4 per cent wage settlement in the
German steel industry has underlined the inability of Britain and other EC
countries to cut interest rates so long as the Bundesbank is determined to
keep German rates high in the cause of low inflation.
So what can Mr Lamont do? The evidence so far suggests that he will opt for
an economically prudent Budget but with a politically persuasive cut in
personal taxation. The City and financial markets are aware that Mr Lamont
is under strong political pressure to produce a vote-winner. His scope for
action may be growing: some analysts have suggested that the markets can
tolerate a more expansionary policy if this leads to a Conservative election
victory. So long as opinion polls do not count the Tories out, parts of the
media and the City are prepared to interpret bad economic news as good news
for Mr Lamont. Thus, the worse the state of the economy, the more he can cut
taxes.
Mr Lamont seems therefore to have the luxury of choice. He can opt for a
populist 'give-away' Budget or pursue the cautious and prudent course that
has hallmarked the 14 months of his chancellorship.
He is not an unpolitical chancellor. He was Mr John Major's campaign manager
in his successful bid for the premiership. He helped stoke the election
campaign that has been under way since New Year with charges that Labour was
the party of higher taxes. By bringing the taxation of incomes into the
forefront of the party battle, he has inevitably raised expectations about
tax cuts to the point that no move to ease the income tax burden would be a
big surprise.
An FT survey this week showed that a very large majority of Tory MPs wants
the chancellor to cut taxes to boost the economy ahead of the election, a
message that was reinforced at a meeting between Mr Lamont and backbenchers
this week. Although most MPs said they would prefer increasing the
thresholds before people pay tax, the odds on a cut in the basic rate of tax
are shortening. There are strong political arguments in favour of lowering
the basic rate to 24 pence in the pound from 25 pence. It makes for better
headlines and would force Labour to declare in an election campaign whether
it would raise taxes again.
But income tax cuts are expensive. One penny off the basic rate of tax would
cost Pounds 1.95bn. Raising allowances by more than inflation is a
potentially cheaper option. But each percentage point increase in the
allowances still costs Pounds 210m. Although the chancellor could, for
example, increase allowances by double the 4.5 per cent statutory rate
determined by December's inflation rate at a cost of about Pounds 950m, he
might still have to claw back money elsewhere, perhaps by trimming the
benefits that would accrue to higher-income earners through any tax cut.
Earlier this week, the bandwagon behind a tax-cutting Budget was gaining
such strength that it was causing some alarm in the Treasury. It is also a
moot point whether such expectations are entirely welcome to Mr Lamont. As a
former City banker and a Treasury minister since 1986, he knows that markets
are fickle and can withdraw support without warning.
Before he disappeared into purdah last month, he repeated his long-standing
objection to fiscal activism by telling a meeting of the National Economic
Development Council that abandoning the idea of a balanced budget over the
economic cycle would risk a build-up of problems when economic growth
returned.
After a recent meeting with finance ministers from the Group of Seven top
industrial countries, he appeared to rule out radical moves to stimulate the
economy. 'The recovery,' he said, 'had been delayed, not cancelled.'
The Bank of England is also advising caution. In a speech to the Overseas
Bankers Club in London this week, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's
governor, argued that the conditions for recovery were in place and that
only 'selective, well-designed measures' should be considered for boosting
activity.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's comments suggest that a good deal of thought is being
given to those parts of the Budget which can offer help for industry and
businesses. The Treasury has come under intense lobbying from the CBI, the
Institute of Directors and other trade groups to make this year's Budget one
for business. Among ideas put forward have been increased incentives for
investment, a lowering of the burden of inheritance tax on family businesses
and action to reduce the impact of rising uniform business rates,
particularly in the hard pressed south-east of England.
Such lobbying can bear fruit. In last year's Budget, Mr Lamont announced
cuts in corporation tax rates and other tax breaks for business following
representations from industry. This year, however, he may pause before
announcing such far-reaching steps because - last year's sharp rise in
company failures and receiverships notwithstanding  - the UK company
sector's overall financial position has improved over the past 12 months.
This underlying improvement has encouraged suggestions that the chancellor
should introduce time-limited investment incentives, just to give the
economy an extra push. These could be along the lines of the pre-Christmas
package of measures to help the housing market, in which the government
suspended stamp duty on most house purchases until August. But so far Mr
Lamont has underlined that the housing package was a specific measure to
deal with a particular problem and has rejected further fiscal fine tuning.
Some observers said he should bank on a recovery of business and consumer
confidence that should follow an early general election, now looking likely
on April 9. In recent months there has been growing concern among
businessmen that uncertainty about the election date and outcome is acting
as a brake on activity. Some companies may be holding back from investment
in the hope that an incoming Labour government would provide more generous
incentives. A more widespread grumble is that fear among higher earners of
an effective 59 per cent upper rate of income tax in the event of a Labour
victory is restraining demand and the purchase of big ticket items such as
cars.
These fears, if true, imply that a government election victory would be
followed by an upsurge in investment and demand.
Such a scenario could persuade Mr Lamont against too open-handed a Budget
that would jeopardise his medium-term goal of returning to budget balance
over the course of the economic cycle. Being prudent might be a really bold
move for a chancellor who, between now and the Budget, will be under heavy
pressure from Tory backbenchers anxious about their re-election prospects.
The feral nature of politicians in fear of defeat should not be
underestimated.
However, it must not be forgotten that Mr Lamont has proved himself to be a
determined fighter against inflation and also has ambitions to be a
tax-reforming chancellor. Although the pressures on him are strong to
deliver a 'feel good' Budget, he will not want to risk his credibility with
financial markets or exhaust room for future fiscal manoeuvre in the event
of his being re-appointed chancellor.
