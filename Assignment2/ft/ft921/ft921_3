FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Scots interest rates may have peaked too soon
 -Media Watch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ROW of four men (there are few women in Scottish politics) in armchairs
arguing on television about Scotland's constitutional future is the best
media entertainment in the general election in Scotland.
There is usually Jim Sillars, the eloquent deputy leader of the Scottish
National party, who can silence others by the power of his voice; Donald
Dewar, now looking more confident that Labour can hold off the SNP; Malcolm
Bruce or Menzies Campbell from the Liberal Democrats; and Ian Lang, the
Scottish secretary, who is never ruffled but looks worried.
What makes watching the TV debates more fun than reading the newspapers is
hearing the electorate directly. Scottish Television has assembled a panel
of 500 people at Lanark in the Clydesdale constituency in the central belt
whose voting pattern in 1987 was close to the Scottish average. But if the
constituency's 23.5 per cent quota of Tories is there they are keeping very
quiet.
The election is different here. There is one first-rate issue unique to
Scotland: the question of the country's constitutional future. Yet it does
not produce much news.
Although John Major was here on Wednesday and Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday,
most of the big election news is still being generated in London, and the
Scottish broadsheets usually lead with the same issues as their national
counterparts.
The only good Scottish election story was the publication of a letter from
Ian Lang to John Major in which Lang outlined what most people suspected -
that the Tories want to use the SNP to split Labour's vote.
The newspapers cannot really complain. The heavyweights, The Scotsman and
The Herald, have kept the flame of devolution alight in the years when it
seemed a colourless abstraction. They had their reward when interest in it
soared two months ago, triggered by a Scotsman opinion poll.
However, these papers account for only a small part of Scottish newspaper
readership. In Fife and Tayside in eastern Scotland, people read The
Courier, published in Dundee. It far outsells The Scotsman, still has
classified advertisements rather than news on its front page and has almost
daily editorials backing the Conservatives.
Further north, in the Grampian and Highland regions, the daily broadsheet is
the Press and Journal, which is also inclined towards the Tories.
The tabloids should have been predictable. The Daily Record, like its sister
paper the Daily Mirror, is firmly behind Labour and devolution. However, the
decision in January by the Scottish edition of The Sun to switch its backing
from the Tories to the SNP and independence surprised more than a few
readers.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems education pledge scores a hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats appear to have scored a hit with their pledge to
increase the basic rate of income tax by 1p to finance a Pounds 2bn boost in
spending on education, Ivor Owen writes.
According to the NOP poll published in yesterday's Independent, 78 per cent
of all voters approve of the proposal.
Mr Paddy Ashdown has good reason to be encouraged, too, by the Gallup
finding in yesterday's Daily Telegraph on the campaigning efforts of the
three party leaders. That accorded him top rating with 34 per cent. Mr Neil
Kinnock secured second place (28 per cent) and Mr John Major trailed with 17
per cent.
Labour led in the ratings for the overall party campaigns at 32 per cent -
LibDems (24 per cent) and Conservatives (12 per cent).
The poll showed that 46 per cent of voters would like to see the
first-past-the-post electoral system replaced with proportional
representation. Also 56 per cent of voters want to scrap the government's
NHS reforms.
About 67 per cent back a statutory minimum wage of Pounds 3.40 an hour, as
proposed by Labour, and 26 per cent of all voters, 45 per cent of
Conservative voters, back privatisation of British Rail.

THE STOCK market seemed to judge the Tories the net gainers from the
exchanges between the two parties over Labour's health broadcast. Shares
that might benefit from a Conservative victory rose by more than the FT-SE
100 index of big company shares, while stocks that might gain if Labour
formed a government dropped back. The steady advantage to Labour shown in
the first full week of the campaign has faded this week.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Standard ad - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's qualms about the influence in London of the staunchly Tory Evening
Standard did not deter it from placing a full-page ad. 'Someone is killing
600 businesses in London every week,' it says. 'We all know the guilty
party.' A party official said: 'We feel it is the only way we can achieve
balance in London's only daily newspaper.' The Standard was unlikely to
reject the money.

Photographers downed cameras, however, when the doctors turned out in suits,

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Brittan's roles - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, Britain's senior commissioner to the European Community,
was in Edinburgh yesterday to support the Tories.
His main task was to use his position to warn that if Scotland became
independent, it would not automatically become a member of the EC, which is
what the Scottish National party claims.
Echoing the words of Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Sir Leon suggested
that an independent Scotland would have to negotiate membership rather than
obtaining it on a plate. The process could take several years.
'For better or for worse, the EC is quite good at delay at times,' he said.
Sir Leon explained that he was giving his independent personal view as a
Tory who happened to be a member of the Commission.
'All my Commission colleagues take an interest in political developments in
their own countries,' he said. Sir Leon went on to canvass for Paul Martin,
Tory candidate in the Labour-held seat of Edinburgh Central.
However, little has been heard from Bruce Millan, his Labour counterpart in
Brussels who was once Scottish secretary. Unlike Sir Leon, Millan has almost
certainly given up the idea of a return to Westminster.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Cosmic contest - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major has a new challenger. Charles Seaton Cockell is standing against
him in his constituency of Huntingdon as the sole candidate of the Forward
to Mars Party.
Do not mock. Cockell convinced the FT in a telephone interview yesterday
that he is serious. Now 24,
he led the first officially recognised British expedition to Mongolia in
1990 and discovered a new species of black widow spider which now resides in
the Natural History Museum. 'It is a false black widow,' Cockell says. 'It
doesn't sting.'
Then he went off to the former Soviet Union and, in co-operation with
Leningrad zoologists, extracted the genetic code from the extinct woolly
mammoth. 'The animal is bigger than an elephant,' he explains.
Having started at Bristol, Cockell is doing his PhD at Oxford on genetic
blood- clotting. His real subject is exobiology, which means the study of
extra-terrestrial life. It can't be done properly without space research:
hence his interest in the mission to Mars and its potential evidence of
early molecules.
Cockell says he will be happy to win 200 votes and hopes that people,
including John Major, will notice his programme. When his PhD is complete,
he has an offer of a job with Nasa, the American space agency, working on
the Mars programme - provided it is not abandoned.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour's swinging spirits - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What accounted for the brightening of mood in the Labour camp yesterday
afternoon?
A few minutes prior to the scheduled press conference on London, the
atmosphere was tense: the battle of Jennifer's ear appeared to have taken
its toll. Shortly afterwards, all was sweetness and light. Messrs Cunningham
and Gould seemed to have all the time in the world to field additional
questions.
One factor might be credible rumours circulating that a London poll very
much to the party's liking is to appear later today. Labour would need a
swing of getting on for 8 per cent compared with 1987 to win enough seats in
the capital to send Mr Neil Kinnock to 10 Downing Street. According to the
rumours, the poll, by Harris for London Weekend Television, indicates such a
swing is within the party's grasp.
If the swing were replicated capital-wide, the Putney seat of chief Treasury
secretary David Mellor would be among those put in danger - a thought that
is guaranteed to cheer up any Labour gathering.
But then again, it might
just have been something
that they put in the mineral water.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Temperatures soar in health quarrel - Day of
Claim and Counter-Claim over 'Leak'; Voters not swayed by row; Prime
Minister joins the fray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a day of extraordinary allegations over the 'leak' that disclosed the
identity of Jennifer Bennett, the girl who was the subject of Tuesday's
Labour election broadcast, some facts had become clear while others remain
in heated dispute.
Jennifer's name apparently found its way into the newspapers through a
combination of two factors. The first was inquiries by The Independent which
had discovered Jennifer's identity and questioned the consultant involved.
The second was Conservative Central Office's suggestion to the consultant,
after he contacted it, to get in touch with other newspapers, and the
party's own call to the Daily Express.
The sequence of events seems to have been as follows:
End of February: Labour begins work on the election broadcast, The Story of
Two Girls with the Same Problem, in consultation with Mr John Bennett,
Jennifer's father.
March 15: Mr Peter LeeRoberts, Jennifer's grandfather and a former
Conservative mayor of Faversham, Kent, sends a fax to Central Office warning
about the broadcast. The Tories have repeatedly stressed this did not
include the name of the child. But her grandfather insisted Mr Bennett's
name was mentioned.
According to Labour, Mrs Margaret Bennett, the mother, also telephones the
Tories.
March 24: Midday. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, shows journalists
a preview of the broadcast. In Manchester, Ms Julie Hall, Mr Neil Kinnock's
press secretary, tells journalists in an off-the-record briefing that the
child's first name is Jennifer. She does not divulge any more details.
That afternoon, The Independent learns the identity of the girl and the
consultant, Mr Alan Ardouin, from its 'own journalistic sources'. The paper
said yesterday that these were neither the main parties, the hospital
consultant, Jennifer's family, another news organisation, the film crew nor
the film's producer.
2pm-3pm. The newspaper telephones Mr Ardouin. He rings back when he has the
details of the case. The Independent understands that he has not spoken to
any other newspaper.
6.15pm. Mr Ardouin contacts Central Office, and is 'helped', in the words of
Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, to contact newspapers.
7pm-8pm. The consultant telephones the Labour party to refute the
allegations in the film. Labour says this is the first time it is aware that
Jennifer's name is now in the public domain. The Daily Express, and The
Independent in its later editions, run stories naming the child.
March 25: The political row about the film mounts throughout the day.
Yesterday: 9.30am. Mr Kinnock calls on the source of the leak to come
forward and denies it was anyone within the Labour party.
9.40am. Ms Hall interrupts the press conference to acknowledge that she gave
the name Jennifer to journalists before the film was shown, but claims this
would have been insufficient for them to establish her identity.
Mr Peter Hitchens, the journalist who broke the story in the Daily Express,
says he is 'not in reception of leaks from the Labour party' and that he
received the information from a 'second-hand' source. He says 'nobody could
possibly have known who this girl was unless the leak came from within the
Labour party organisation which made the film'.
Mr John Major, the prime minister denies that the Conservatives leaked the
name of the girl: 'Most certainly not.'
12.30pm. Sir Nicholas Lloyd, editor of the Daily Express, alleges that
Jennifer was first named to The Independent, 'probably by Labour party
sources'. The Independent denies it received the information from a
political source.
3.30pm. Mr William Waldegrave admits that Mr LeeRoberts's fax was received
nine days before the broadcast but claims it was ignored. He adds that when
Mr Ardouin made contact with Central Office before the broadcast 'I think we
helped the consultant get in touch with the newspapers'.
5.30pm. Central Office clarifies that it advised Mr Ardouin to contact the
newspapers, and also telephoned the Daily Express to inform it of this. The
Express then rang Mr Ardouin. Central Office denies that it revealed - or
even knew  - Jennifer's name.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major challenges Kinnock over policy on
private care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORIES sought to regain the initiative on health yesterday as Mr John
Major called on Labour's leadership to make clear its attitude towards
private health care and accused the party of 'shroud-waving'.
Visiting York District Hospital, the prime minister challenged Labour over
the thrust of its election broadcast - that people who paid for private
health care could be treated more quickly than if they used the National
Health Service.
Such a charge was 'inaccurate unless they (Labour) are going to say that
they are going to stop all private health care', he said. 'If this is what
they are going to say, then let them say it, and say it clearly.' Ending
private health care would reduce the total amount of health care available,
'ensuring that queues in the National Health Service rise', he added.
Mr Major said that previous examples of individual emotive cases produced by
Labour had not lived up to the claims made about them. 'They have been
shroud-waving in one form or another for a long time and case after case
that has been examined has not been what it was held out to be in the first
instance,' he said.
Mr Major's visit to York hospital, which will become a self-governing trust
next week, was arranged to coincide with the BMA conference, which the
Tories had predicted would be hostile to the health reforms.
The prime minister said that Labour's success in the opinion polls on the
NHS argument did not reflect the real improvements that had been made. He
contrasted the small group of demonstrators he had met on his way into the
hospital with the work being carried out inside it.
'You saw people outside waving Labour placards but if they were in here
looking at what has happened in the health service, at the improvements in
care, perhaps the climate might be different,' he said.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Striking lack of reality undermines
yesterday's image - The Issues / Union Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSERVATIVE party election poster shows a mass meeting of workers voting
for strike action by a show of hands. The slogan reads: 'Labour in,
everybody out. Don't vote for strikes, strikes, and more strikes.'
Yesterday the Conservatives tried to make industrial relations an election
issue, but the poster describes a state of affairs that no longer exists.
The fact is that, after the introduction of secret ballots in 1984, it has
been impossible for unions to call strikes on a show of hands. Labour has no
plans to change the law.
The problem for the Conservatives is one of success. Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
union reforms and the quiescent mood of organised labour for the past few
years have reduced the impact of the union bogey.
Most voters seem aware of Labour's more arm's-length relationship with the
unions and acceptance of aspects of the reforms, including abolition of the
closed shop, restrictions on picketing, and ballots for strikes and
elections. The philosophical gulf between the two main parties remains wide
but the debate about employment law and labour market regulation is now more
subtle.
The Conservatives persist in playing the union card, believing there is
still ambivalence about unions and stressing that much has not changed in
Labour's union links.
For example, pivotal Labour commitments - including the minimum wage and
equal rights for part-time workers - are priority policies because of union
pressure. The union block vote at Labour conferences is on the way down, and
possibly out, but it still counts for 90 per cent of the votes.
The Conservative attack has concentrated on those aspects of the Thatcher
legacy that Labour would reverse. These include banning ex parte injunctions
which can be granted to an employer without the union being represented and
stopping employers from creating artificial companies to exploit the law
banning secondary action.
By concentrating on these arcane aspects of union law, it is possible to
lose sight of how radically a Labour government would change industrial
relations. Labour does not like much of the labour-market deregulation of
the past decade, believing that it increases insecurity and creates only
low-pay, low-productivity jobs easily blown away in recession.
It recognises that the labour market, and the working class, has changed.
There has been a permanent shift to services and to non-manual work which
has brought with it a probably permanent decline in union membership and
collective bargaining.
Labour thus proposes to introduce rights for all employees, in all their new
diversity, rather than for unions. It intends to continue dismantling
Britain's voluntarist system of industrial relations and replace it with a
more continental system in which employees have positive rights to balance
the restrictions and deregulation of the Thatcher years.
A selection of legislation which could be on the statute book after Labour's
first term includes equal rights for part-time workers, employee right to
consultation, improvements to the equal-pay laws, better maternity pay - 14
weeks on full pay  - and a law banning age discrimination in employment.
Labour's commitment to reverse the government's Maastricht opt-out from an
extension of European Community employment law would lead to legislation on
working time and works councils for larger companies, and perhaps much more.
Conservative deregulation policies, such as the extension of the qualifying
period for employment protection from six months to two years, would also be
reversed.
Labour has a neo-corporatist agenda and here the unions are still important.
It wants to reform public-sector pay, although how is not yet clear. It will
also try to influence pay-setting more generally through the guidance
offered to bargainers in the annual National Economic Assessment.
Labour thinkers are sceptical about devolved pay bargaining and want the
unions to deliver responsible pay agreements in the hope of a better
trade-off between pay and employment. In return, Labour offers not only the
positive rights but also a law on union recognition which will require
employers to recognise and bargain with unions if more than 50 per cent of a
workforce votes for recognition.
Most employers are worried by the cost of Labour's plans. Those in low-pay
sectors are unhappy about the national minimum wage, and especially its
effect on differentials. Conservative plans, which mark no significant
departure from their current approach, will be more to their taste.
The Tories believe their policies run with the grain of an increasingly
flexible, individualistic, white-collar workforce. They say that patterns of
industrial relations based on unions and collective bargaining are in
decline and that individuals and employers increasingly want to deal with
each other directly.
They would encourage the trend towards individual contracts, promote
performance related pay in the public sector, and may even abolish the wages
councils which set a floor for wages in some industries. In spite of the
Tories saying in 1990 that their programme of union reform was complete, it
has recently been revived. Specific industrial relations pledges include new
rules governing the automatic 'check-off' of union dues, removing the power
of the Trades Union Congress to regulate which union workers can belong to,
seven days' notice of strikes, and postal as opposed to workplace ballots on
strikes.
The differences between Labour and the Liberal Democrats are less marked
than those between Labour and the Conservatives. Some aspects of Labour
policy, such as employee involvement and signing up to the Social Charter,
would have Liberal Democrat backing. Other policies, such as the minimum
wage, would not.

THE ELECTION campaign in Northern Ireland heated up yesterday over the issue
of the Anglo-Irish agreement and the future of inter-party talks, Tim Coone
writes.
The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist party leader, launching his party's
manifesto, said 'the shutters will come down' on talks if any attempt is
made to put the union on the negotiating table. 'The union is not
negotiable. Full stop.'
His remarks run counter to those of Mr John Hume, leader of the Social
Democrat Labour party, at the launch of his party's manifesto on Wednesday,
that 'everything will be on the table', when talks resume after the
election.

LABOUR'S commitment to abandoning the government's 'opt-out' from tougher
European Community employment legislation at the Mastricht summit was
attacked by the CBI yesterday.
A CBI document, Social Europe After Maastricht, published yesterday, says:
'The Maastricht outcome leaves UK firms relatively protected from the wrong
sort of regulations and from unnecessary burdens.' The document says there
are grounds for concern that Europe is losing its competitive edge as a
result of slower productivity growth and rising non-wage labour costs.
Sir Brian Corby, CBI president, said: 'A greater EC level regulation of
working conditions is patently not needed.'
The CBI did not cost any of the EC proposals that might become law if Labour
signed the full Maastricht agreement.
The Department of Employment has costed one directive, that on working time,
at Pounds 5bn. An internal departmental memo on the estimates reveals the
sketchy basis of the calculations. The memo says: 'The basic approach is to
estimate the proportion of hours worked annually contrary to the directive
restrictions and then to calculate the wage cost of those hours.'
The memo also states that transport is likely to be excluded from the
directive, which will reduce the cost by about Pounds 400m. The memo reveals
that the government hopes to be able to avoid the imposition of the
working-time directive.
It says: 'We will argue that it would be in the spirit of the Maastricht
agreement for those aspects of the working time proposals that give the UK
the greatest problems to be set aside.'

FT  27 MAR 92 / Lonrho hotel deal could fall foul of US embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is seeking further details on the Lonrho sale of a share of Metropole
Hotels to Libya before deciding whether the deal brings the hotel group
under the terms of its six-year-old embargo on US dealings with Libyan
institutions.
US companies and individuals would be barred from doing business with the
hotel chain if the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)
decided the deal brought the hotels under the embargo's terms. Breach of the
embargo is punishable by large fines or even prison sentences.
The US ban on dealings with Libyan interests was established in 1986 after
US intelligence alleged Tripoli was behind the terrorist bombing of a
nightclub in Berlin which killed a US soldier and wounded 60 American
citizens.
More than 60 companies are on the OFAC list of proscribed institutions -
most of them wholly Libyan-owned or Libyan-controlled.
US officials said yesterday it was unclear whether the state-run Libyan Arab
Foreign Investment Company's one-third share of Metropole Hotels was enough
to make it count in OFAC's eyes as a Libyan entity.
OFAC blacklisting could bar US citizens from staying in Metropole hotels.
Most are in Africa and the UK.
The US is so far the only country barring trade with Libya, although the EC
has had an arms embargo in place since 1986 and restrictions governing the
number and movements of Libyan diplomats.
Many observers suggested that Libya's willingness to go ahead with the deal
indicated that Tripoli was confident the United Nations would not impose a
full trade embargo or freeze on Libyan assets to follow the arms and civil
air ban likely soon to be voted upon by the Security Council.
British officials say they will rule out no measures to increase pressure on
Tripoli, but suggest an assets freeze would by no means be the next step.
Libya has nevertheless shifted up to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) of its
liquid assets out of British and other European banks to safer havens in the
Middle East apparently to safeguard against a possible freeze.
However, Tripoli has so far done nothing either to liquidate its other
European assets or to change their ownership structures.
Most of its interests lie in its Tamoil petroleum distribution network in
Italy and Switzerland. Moreover, Libya has recently bought both hotels in
Egypt and several office blocks in London - again suggesting that it does
not feel immediately threatened by an assets freeze.

SOUTH Korea's Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) yesterday regained a shaky grip
on power by persuading two independents to join the party, giving it a bare
majority following Tuesday's National Assembly election.
The DLP originally won 149 seats out of 299 in the poll.
However, there are signs that the party could be heading for a split. Rival
factions within the party blame each other for the loss of 50 assembly
seats.
Mr Kim Young Sam, the DLP executive chairman who headed the election
campaign, refused to accept responsibility for the party's poor performance.
Mr Kim defended his record in a bid to save his chances of becoming the
party's nominee in December's presidential election. His opponents within
the DLP are demanding his resignation.
In an attack on the supporters of President Roh Tae Woo, Mr Kim blamed the
government's unsuccessful economic policy, rather than the DLP's election
strategy.
There has been friction between the Kim and Roh factions within the DLP
since Mr Kim's opposition group joined the ruling party in 1990.
President Roh and Mr Kim are to meet today to discuss the post-election
situation. Mr Kim and his supporters might leave the DLP if he is forced to
resign as party co-chairman and be denied the presidential nomination.

International Court to restrain US, Britain and France from using force
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA WENT to the International Court of Justice yesterday seeking an
emergency injunction to restrain the US and Britain from using force or
imposing sanctions in their campaign to get Tripoli to surrender two Libyans
alleged to have been involved in the Lockerbie bombing.
In its application, Libya requested that the US and Britain be told to stop
'taking any action against Libya calculated to coerce or compel Libya to
surrender the accused individuals to any jurisdiction outside of Libya.'
Libya saw 'no reason why it should give into this illegal and arbitrary
blackmail,' Mr Mohammed Al-Fatouri, Libya's ambassador to Brussels, said.
Addressing the court's 16 judges in the main chamber of the Peace Palace,
the court's seat in The Hague, Mr Al-Fatouri drew attention to what he said
were the 'progressively more explicit threats' from the US and Britain.'
He recalled in court that Libya had been the target of US air raids in 1986,
when the US had linked Libya to the bombing of a Berlin disco frequented by
US servicemen.
Professor Ian Brownlie, an Oxford law don speaking on behalf of Libya,
described the refusal by high-ranking officials such as US President George
Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle to rule out the use of force, coupled
with their demands for extradition of the two Libyans, as a 'pattern of
ultimatums not seen for some decades'.
Britain said the case was an attempt by Libya to ward off UN Security
Council-mandated sanctions. Mr Frank Berman, a Foreign Office legal adviser,
told the court that the case was 'directed at interfering with the function
and prerogatives of the Security Council under the United Nations charter'.
Professor Rosalind Higgins, counsel for the UK, said Libya's request for
provisional measures were too 'vague, imprecise and unsuitable' to be
ordered by the World Court.
Mr Alan Rodger, solicitor general for Scotland, said Libya's legal reasoning
was fundamentally flawed. 'Libya will say anything, however inconsistent, to
postpone the day that it may have to accept responsibility for its actions.'
The hearings are expected to continue today but it is likely to take at
least several weeks before the court rules on Libya's request for
'provisional measures'.
The US, Britain and France have already said that they will not wait for the
verdict before putting a sanctions resolution before the Security Council.
Mr Edwin Williamson, a legal adviser to the US State Department who will
address the court later in the proceedings, said yesterday, 'This (court)
action in no way inhibits what the Security Council is doing.'
Britain and the US wish to put the two men on trial for the 1988 bombing of
Pan Am flight 103 above the Scottish town of Lockerbie in which 270 people
died.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Indonesia disbands Dollars 4.75bn aid donor group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indonesian government yesterday called in ambassadors from leading donor
countries following its unilateral decision on Wednesday to dissolve the
Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), the forum through which aid is
pledged.
Last year Dollars 4.75bn (Pounds 2.74bn) was pledged through the IGGI, but
Jakarta has disbanded it after accusing the Netherlands, which chairs the
group, of political intimidation. The Netherlands is currently financing 175
projects in Indonesia involving about 250 foreign experts; all the projects
have to be terminated within a month. The decision is likely to disrupt work
on aid-related projects including education, family planning and
development.
The Indonesian government said it was reviewing projects financed by the
Netherlands. Some would be financed with aid from other donors or funds from
the Indonesian government itself and others would probably be postponed.
Mr Moerdiono, the state secretary, said relations between Indonesia and the
Netherlands, the former colonial power, had 'deteriorated sharply as a
consequence of the reckless use of development assistance as. . . a tool for
threatening Indonesia'.
He said a letter rejecting new and continuing Dutch aid had been delivered
to Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, although he stressed all debt
repayments would be met.
He cited the Netherlands' review of future aid following the killing of
civilians by security forces in East Timor last November, and Dutch
criticism of the execution in 1990 of six prisoners accused of participating
in the 1965 coup attempt, as examples of intimidation.
In its official response, the Dutch government said yesterday it was
disappointed with the decision and 'deeply regretted the words in which it
was phrased'.
Mr Moerdiono said that Japan and US, the two leading bilateral donors, had
been informed of the decision, although western diplomats in Jakarta
described the announcement as a complete surprise. They said the move raises
questions over future aid from Canada, which pledged Dollars 40m last year
but is also reviewing new aid following the East Timor shootings. Indonesian
government officials denied that similar action against Canada was planned.
Indonesia has a public and private international debt of about Dollars 65bn
and, with a debt service ratio approaching 30 per cent of export earnings,
aid-flows are an important source of foreign exchange.
For the 1991-92 financial year (ending in April), the Netherlands had
pledged Dollars 91m, behind Japan (Dollars 1.3bn), the US (Dollars 133m) and
France (Dollars 111m). The World Bank pledged Dollars 1.6bn and the Asian
Development Bank, Indonesia's main multilateral donors, Dollars 1.1bn.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UN vote on sanctions expected early next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RESOLUTION calling for sanctions against Libya could go to the United
Nations Security Council for formal consideration today, with a vote likely
to be taken early next week.
Diplomats at the UN indicated this last night as the US, Britain and France
resumed their drive for UN-mandated measures against Libya for failing to
hand over the two alleged Lockerbie bombers for trial.
The diplomats stressed that the current hearing of Libya's plea to the
International Court in The Hague would not be allowed to delay Security
Council action on the sanctions resolution.
After Security Council members discussed the situation at a private meeting
last night, Mr Thomas Pickering, the US delegate, told reporters: 'The court
is moving on its own time schedule and independently of the Security Council
 -and vice versa.'
He said the draft resolution sponsored by the US, Britain and France could
be submitted for formal consideration by the Security Council as early as
today.
But he and other delegates added that voting probably would not take place
until early next week.
Mr Pickering dismissed Libyan moves to deflect the sanctions drive by again
offering to turn over the two Lockerbie suspects to the UN.
The council would insist on compliance with its earlier resolution calling
for the surrender of the Lockerbie suspects to the US or Britain. The wanted
men are accused of masterminding the explosion of the Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie in Scotland in December 1988 with the loss of 270 lives.
The discussion by Security Council members last night was apparently about
relatively minor details of the proposed resolution, including the effect of
restrictions on Libyan diplomats accredited to international organisations
as well as national capitals.
The issue of possible economic damage to Libya's neighbours through the
proposed air embargo has already been addressed in a revision of the
original draft which would give 'special attention' to such cases.
Diplomats' patience with Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, now
seems just about exhausted and western delegates said that punitive measures
were the only recourse.
Delegates on all sides seemed more than confident yesterday that a sanctions
resolution drafted by the western permanent members of the Security Council
would pass by a sizeable majority.
The resolution would apply a mandatory ban under the enforcement provisions
of the UN Charter on civil aviation links with Libya, prohibit sales of
aircraft, parts and arms and direct governments to end Libyan diplomatic
representation in their capitals.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Japan's electronics companies face price-fixing inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission has struck at the heart of the country's
distribution system, launching an investigation into alleged domestic price
fixing by subsidiaries of four leading electronics companies, Matsushita
Electric Industrial, Toshiba, Sony and Hitachi.
In the past, the FTC has been condemned by Washington for failing to
investigate leading manufacturers' alleged maintenance of high retail prices
on the domestic market, allegedly to provide them with profits needed to
expand their international market share.
FTC investigators raided distribution subsidiaries of the four companies
over the past two days, following claims that they had drawn up price
schedules for product discounts. The companies allegedly controlled
retailers' advertised discounts to try to lift prices in the face of slowing
domestic demand and product oversupply.
It is also alleged that some retailers, who did not abide by the discount
schedules, were told that the supply of consumer audio-visual equipment
would cease unless they obeyed the distributors' demands.
All four companies confirmed that subsidiaries were raided and said they
were co-operating with the FTC, but none would comment on the substance of
the allegations. The FTC said an investigation was under way and could take
several months.
The investigation comes at a difficult time for Japanese electronics
companies, which are expecting sharply lower profits this year because of a
downturn in domestic and international demand. The move also highlights the
growing role of the FTC, Japan's anti-monopoly body, whose number of formal
cease-and-desist orders rose from only five in 1988 to 24 last year.
A rush of new electronics releases on an already weak market has forced
heavy discounting within Japan in order to clear old stock, though
manufacturers are known to be concerned that excessive discounting could
damage their products' image and change consumer perceptions about
'acceptable' retail prices.
Prices of video cameras, video-cassette recorders and televisions have
fallen by as much as 35 per cent over the past year, creating friction
between specialist discount shops, which offer the largest cuts, and shops
tied to manufacturers, which are under pressure to support prices in return
for privileged access to products.
Eight sales companies run by Matsushita were investigated, and a company
spokesman said that 'we are taking the investigation very seriously'. Two
Toshiba subsidiaries, Toshiba East Japan Home Electronics and Toshiba
Central Home Electronics, are also under investigation, as is Hitachi Home
Electronics and a Sony subsidiary.
The companies are part of the manufacturing keiretsu groups targeted by US
trade negotiators as a structural barrier to imports. US officials say the
parent company's control over product distributors leads to agreements,
either explicit or implicit, that restrict imported goods' market access.
Hitachi Home Electronics said it abided by anti-monopoly laws and was 'not
aware' of price restrictions.
If the FTC finds the companies did try to fix prices, it will issue a
cease-and-desist order, but will not impose a fine. If that order is
ignored, the FTC can prosecute.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RESIDENTIAL land prices fell in Japan last year by 5.6 per cent, the first
decline in 17 years, the National Land Agency said yesterday.
The decline in prices comes after a period in which the Bank of Japan held
interest rates high in order to deflate an enormous speculative bubble in
asset prices left over from the 1980s.
Residential land prices in the Osaka area plunged 22.9 per cent, while the
Tokyo area suffered a 9.1 per cent fall. The average decline in Japan's
three largest cities, including Nagoya, was 12.5 per cent.
Industry specialists, however, said the government statistics appeared to
have significantly understated the actual declines, which they put closer to
30 per cent.
The land agency said prices in other cities continued to rise, by 2.3 per
cent, although this was well below the 13.6 per cent rise recorded a year
earlier.
Commercial land prices nationwide declined by 4 per cent, while the prices
in the three largest cities fell by 10.3 per cent.
Although the decline in city land prices appears sharp, it reverses even
steeper rises in earlier years. The 22.9 per cent decline in Osaka, for
example, followed prices increases of 32.7 per cent, 56.1 per cent, and 6.5
per cent in the previous three years.
Sales at Japan's large retailers in February grew by 1 per cent in February,
compared to a year ago, after adjusting for the extra business day due to
the leap year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
The figures are consistent with other recent data showing a slowdown in
consumer spending.

JAPAN'S ministry of finance is to investigate an alleged loss-compensation
guarantee by Yamatane Securities, a second tier broker, in connection with
manipulation of a client's investment account.
Mr Nobuhiko Matsuno, head of the ministry's securities bureau, said they
would search for a written contract guaranteeing compensation, which is
outlawed by last year's Securities and Exchange Law.
If such a written guarantee is found, Yamatane will be the first offender of
the revised law.
Brokers manipulated clients' accounts in order to help dress losses by
transferring loss-making investments from one client to another. Brokers,
under great pressure from clients, transferred investments in the hope that
the stock market would eventually recover.
The continuing slump in prices has broken the cycle, with investors refusing
to accept loss-making portfolios. Clients left holding the loss-making
investments have started to demand the brokers take the stock off their
hands and pay damages.

SYRIA'S parliament has approved draft agreements for the purchase of two
small nuclear reactors from China, the Lebanese newspaper Al Hayat reported
yesterday.
Damascus promised to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty during a
recent visit by Mr Hans Blix, director of the UN's International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA).
In exchange for its compliance, Syria will be allowed to operate a 24
megawatt Chinese-made research reactor under IAEA supervision, according to
Al Hayat.
Syria also announced this week it had established diplomatic relations with
the Moslem former Soviet Republics of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan during a
tour of central Asian republics by Mr Farouk Al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign
minister.
Mr Al-Sharaa will also visit Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. He is
accompanied by officials from the ministries of planning, economy,
agriculture, information, culture and energy.
Syria has a substantial Armenian population and established diplomatic
relations with Armenia this month.
Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Moscow was Syria's principal arms
supplier and a leading trade partner. Syria's diplomatic initiative may be
an attempt to restore military and commercial exchanges with the independent
republics.

FRENCH commandos boarded the flagship of the environmental organisation
Greenpeace yesterday after it sailed into an exclusion zone around France's
South Pacific nuclear testing site, Reuter reports.
French military officials said the Rainbow Warrior II was intercepted within
a few miles of Mururoa atoll, where the crew had planned to land to set up a
'peace camp' to protest against nuclear tests.
The French said gendarmes and navy staff were in control of the ship and
there was no violence.
France has tested nuclear weapons since 1966 despite protests from Pacific
neighbours. French secret agents sank the Rainbow Warrior's predecessor in
New Zealand in 1985, killing a photographer. Defence minister Charles Hernu
was forced to resign after the sinking.
In Paris, environment minister Brice Lalonde, who once tried to sabotage
nuclear tests by sailing to Mururoa himself, said his Generation Ecologie
movement supported an international nuclear test ban.
France's other major ecologist group, the Greens, said it backed
Greenpeace's efforts to enter the South Pacific testing zone.

<TEXT>
THE western part of Germany is poised to be 'back on the growth track' next
year, Deutsche Bank's chief economist predicted yesterday. In an upbeat
assessment of west Germany's medium-term prospects, Mr Norbert Walter said
in Berlin that economic growth there would rise to 3 per cent next year
after growing only 1 per cent this year.
He acknowledged that many conventional indicators, such as the fact that
short-term interest rates are higher than long-term ones, suggested Germany
was on course for a serious recession. But 'structural changes' in Europe
would help ensure this did not happen.
Germany would not have to rely on US recovery. Impetus for growth would come
from implementation of the EC's single market at the start of next year, and
closer trading links with Efta countries. Germany would benefit from high
immigration. An increase of 2.5m in west Germany's population since 1987 had
ensured a flexible labour market, and stimulated the economy through demand
for housing and consumer durables.
'For the short term, the outlook is bleak,' Mr Walter said. 'It is
moderately good for the second half. A good chance exists that structural
factors will take over next year and (west German recovery) will help Europe
recover from the present doldrums.'
A 'dramatic' downturn would occur in west German inflation rates in the
second half of the year, with year-on-year rates falling decisively below 4
per cent, against an expected 4.7 per cent peak for March and April. The
Bundesbank was unlikely to relax its tight monetary policy until early June.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Exports to eastern Europe fall by third

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY suffered a drastic reduction of almost a third in its exports to
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union last year, as a result of the
virtual collapse of the economies in that area.
Hardest hit were exports from the former East Germany, which were cut by 60
per cent, while overall German exports were down 29 per cent to DM37.9bn,
according to the private sector Ost Ausschuss, responsible for promoting
trade with eastern Europe.
At the same time east European sales to Germany fell by 10 per cent to
DM32.9bn.
Within those figures German exports to the Soviet Union, as it was, fell by
more than 35 per cent to DM18.2bn and imports from the Soviet Union by 20
per cent to DM14.6bn.
The figures were published as the economics ministry revealed that Hermes
export credits to the former Soviet republics are still completely blocked
because of failure to agree with Russia on counter-guarantees.
Mr Lorenz Schomerus, head of the ministry's external trade department,
blamed differences of opinion within the Russian government, or simply
problems of comprehension, for its refusal to confirm an agreement reached
in Bonn. The deal provided for standard counter-guarantees by Russia to be
given for export credits insured by Hermes.
As a result, German exports to Russia and other former Soviet republics,
already subject to a DM5bn ceiling on export credits, have come to a virtual
standstill since January.
Mr Schomerus said 'intensive negotiations' were being reopened and would
continue in Moscow next week.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Germany halts arms to Turkey

<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday suspended supplies of military equipment to Turkey, its
Nato partner, and bitterly criticised the government in Ankara for its
attacks on Kurdish settlements in the south-west of the country.
Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, called on the
European Community to condemn the Turkish actions, which he described as in
'total contravention' of the Helsinki Final Act, and contrary to its
commitments as a member of the CSCE and Nato alliance.
The sharp confrontation comes only days after Mr Helmut Kohl, the German
chancellor, bluntly rejected an appeal by President George Bush to support
full Turkish membership of the EC.
Officials in Bonn said the German leader did not disguise his opposition to
the Turkish membership application, and observers said that the latest
dispute can only strengthen German resistance.
'Everyone is opposed to Turkish membership, but no one dares say so
publicly,' a senior official said. Germany instead is pushing for EC
enlargement negotiations to include up to five Efta countries - Austria,
Sweden, Finland, Norway and Switzerland - as well as Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Poland before Turkey is considered.
German outrage at the Turkish operations against the Kurds has been stoked
by alleged evidence that military equipment supplied by Bonn from the former
East German army has been used in the raids, and by a Turkish accusation
that Germany was harbouring terrorists from the PKK Kurdish nationalist
movement.
The arms suspension was announced yesterday in a formal government
declaration, demanding an answer on whether and how armaments supplied by
Germany had been used in the military operations.
Germany also reminded Turkey 'that the requirements of the relevant
agreement make it clear that this materiel may be used exclusively by the
Turkish armed forces to defend itself against an armed attack on the Nato
treaty area.'
On Wednesday, the German government announced its concern at the use of
security forces against the civilian population in Turkey. It condemned
every form of terrorism, and rejected Turkish accusations that it supported
the so-called PKK.
The Bonn statement went on to insist that: 'Turkey must measure itself as a
subscriber to the values of the western community - in particular as a
member of the Council of Europe and the CSCE - and according to the
corresponding conventions on human rights and the protection of minorities.'
The German government has provided Turkey with military assistance worth
DM5.5bn (Pounds 1.92bn) since the mid-1960s, including DM1.5bn in connection
with the Gulf War.

WESTERN bankers agreed yesterday to grant the former Soviet Union a further

The decision was announced by Deutsche Bank, which chairs a 12-bank panel
representing 600 banks worldwide, after talks between western bankers and
officials of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But the committee
won a promise from the CIS representatives to improve controls on their
export revenues, a key source of money for servicing the massive debt.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Russians braced for flood of job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is bracing itself for a flood of bankruptcies and
redundancies, as large enterprises grapple with a lack of credit and
investment.
The government, assisted by the central bank, is determined to stick to a
policy of relatively tight monetary discipline, rejecting demands for
credits from most enterprises. But it will have to face the political
fallout from large job losses and the collapse of some major enterprises.
Companies now face interest rates of 50 per cent on six-month loans, and few
banks will advance money for longer periods. The central bank has raised its
requirements for collateral on loans to commercial banks to 20 per cent.
Enterprises are making matters worse by raising their prices beyond the
reach of many consumers, instead of lowering them to ensure cash flow. They
are trying to maintain prices while demanding new credits from the bank or
the government as they did under the old regime. The vast majority are
refusing to pay back loans or honour bills, and many are already putting
their workers on reduced working schedules.
On central bank figures, overdue loans it has made have have soared from
Rbs39bn on January 1 to Rbs532bn on March 10. At the same time,
institutional mechanisms to channel the savings held by individuals and
companies, estimated at Rbs300bn, into profitable investment have not been
developed.
Mr Georgi Matiukhin, Russian central bank chairman, last month sent an
appeal for help in developing such institutions as investment funds and
merchant banks to Mr Frans Andriessen, deputy president of the European
Commission. Mr Matiukhin was 'concerned about the lack of effective
mechanisms to convert savings into productive investments, and the dearth of
institutions capable of attracting foreign investments'.
Western economic advisers in Moscow are worried by the lack of structural
reform undertaken by the government, an omission which could undercut and
render useless the stabilisation programme worked out between the government
and the International Monetary Fund. The IMF board is due to consider
Russia's application to join the fund next week, though agreement could be
stalled by a continuing argument about Russia's ranking in the IMF league.
Mr Alexander Ruptsov, managing director of the consulting company
Vneshconsult and a member of the recently created presidential Council of
Entrepreneurs, said yesterday: 'I would think about 80 per cent of big
enterprises are now actually insolvent.
'They are not reacting in a market way, by increasing productivity or
cutting labour. They are trying to borrow money to pay salaries and no one
is paying their bills.'
One reason for the refusal by enterprises to lower prices is the expectation
of a further dramatic price rise when energy prices are freed, probably in
June.
The current price of oil, at Rbs350 a barrel, is expected to rise by about
eight times to between Rbs2,000 and Rbs2,700 a tonne. One western expert in
Moscow said yesterday: 'This is the equivalent of the 1973 oil shock in the
west, and more.'
Privatisation, the main structural reform, has hardly happened yet, though a
'showcase' privatisation of small enterprises is due to be unveiled in
Nizhni Novgorod, Russia's third city.

FT  27 MAR 92 / BMA hits at central elements of reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Medical Association yesterday rejected the central elements of
the government's health reforms at a conference which its leaders had
struggled to prevent becoming party-political.
Ministers have claimed the reforms, a year old next week, are beginning to
win the support of the medical profession.
Some BMA members believed that yesterday's conference, arranged before the
election was called to discuss the health reforms and a programme for
improving health standards in the 1990s, should not have taken place at such
a politically sensitive time. But a bid to adjourn it received little
support.
The BMA is politically neutral, but while overtly party-political points
were avoided during the conference, the debate revealed continuing hostility
and suspicion among doctors. This will be welcomed by Labour as it maintains
efforts to keep health at the forefront of the campaign.
The conference adopted resolutions which:
warned that widespread GP fundholding would lead to 'fragmented funding,
progressive operational instability and no base for strategic and capital
planning';
said that the government's internal market would jeopardise the training of
junior doctors;
declared that no further trust hospitals should be established until the
first and second waves had been 'fully evaluated over an adequate period of
time and found to enhance patient care'.
A motion which sought to give BMA support to separating the purchasing of
health care from its provision - the central aim of the reforms  - was
defeated.
The three main political parties all favour versions of the
purchaser-provider split, and BMA leaders clearly expected this to be a less
controversial issue. Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, BMA council chairman, said many
people now believed that the 'centralised command economy' of the old-style
National Health Service was unsuitable.
But Sir Anthony Grabham, one of the BMA's most distinguished council
members, said doctors were now 'in an inappropriate commercial competition'.

FT  27 MAR 92 / West rejects Lockerbie proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA was diplomatically marooned last night over its alleged role in the
Lockerbie bombing after the west rejected another proposal from Tripoli, and
the Arab League said it had suspended attempts to mediate.
Arab diplomats in Tunis reported that Libya's latest offer entailed handing
over the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 wanted by the
US and Britain for trial, but on condition they were not interrogated in
either country. Tripoli reportedly proposed that the pair should be
interrogated by the United Nations or a UN body.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, last night rejected the
proposal while repeating his demand that Libya supply a written declaration
that it will hand the two suspects to the US or Britain.
British officials characterised the Libyan offer as vague and a further
attempt to stall a UN Security Council vote to impose sanctions. They said
the UN had neither the competence nor mechanism to deal with 'civil criminal
matters'.
Officials stressed that UN resolution 731 calls simply for the two men to be
handed over to the US or Britain for trial.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Lonrho sells Libya Pounds 177m stake in Metropole Hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, has sold to Libya a one
third stake in the group's Metropole Hotels for Pounds 177m, in spite of the
continuing western outcry over Libya's alleged involvement in terrorism.
Mr Rene Leclezio, chairman, told a noisy annual general meeting of Lonrho
that the Libyan deal had been masterminded by Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, Lonrho's
chief executive.
But Lonrho refused to say whether the deal, flamboyant even by Mr Rowland's
standards, was clinched in a personal meeting between Mr Rowland and Colonel
Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. The sale has worried some of Lonrho's
institutional investors.
The deal between Lonrho and the Libyan Arab Investment Company was signed as
Libya faces the growing possibility of economic sanctions and asset seizures
over its alleged role in the bombing of the Pan American airliner in 1988.
Mr Leclezio said: 'The deal was Mr Rowland's personal achievement. It was
his deal. Not many people could have even followed Mr Rowland round while he
did the deal.'
He added that Mr Rowland's contacts with African leaders illustrated why he
was irreplaceable in the group.
Mr Leclezio criticised the press for subjecting Lonrho to a 'persistent and
misleading campaign of hysteria'. He added: 'Let the jackals bark, the
caravan carries on.' Lonrho share price fell 8p to 95p yesterday.
While there are no immediate plans in the UN to press for a freeze on Libyan
assets, the US has since 1986 barred American companies and individuals from
dealing with Libyan owned or controlled institutions.
The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces the ban,
said it would be seeking further information on the Metropole deal before
deciding whether the hotel chain would be included on the list of 60
proscribed Libyan businesses.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said checks with certain
organisations had been made before the deal was signed. He confirmed that
the Pounds 177.5m from the Libyans had already been banked by Lonrho.
Asked about the concern expressed by institutional shareholders, Mr Spicer
replied: 'I refuse to debate ethics. This is a business deal. Not one single
shareholder objected to it. Our institutional shareholders understand the
deal because they are businessmen.'
Arab bankers and businessmen in the City close to Libyan affairs claimed the
Metropole share purchase was a purely commercial affair.
But one Arab businessman said: 'The timing will puzzle everyone.' Libya's
decision to purchase the Metropole stake appears the more baffling given
that Tripoli has for the last few months been shifting up to Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.7bn) of its liquid overseas assets out of Britain and other
European centres towards friendlier Middle Eastern institutions - apparently
to protect the assets from a possible freeze.
The state-run Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company, which has only three
offices outside Tripoli - in Malta, Athens and Rome  - is Libya's main
vehicle for its non-bank overseas assets. The bulk of Libya's other
non-liquid European assets are oil-related, lying mainly in petroleum
distribution networks in Italy and Switzerland.
Libya has in the past few months also bought several hotels in Egypt and
some office blocks in London.
Lonrho's institutional shareholders yesterday expressed their 'uneasiness'
about the timing of the deal, given the intense pressure on Libya.
The sale values the Metropole Hotels at Pounds 531m, which is around Pounds
300m more than most analysts believed they were worth.
Lonrho will continue to control the hotels, most of which are in Africa and
the UK, by appointing six of the eight directors.
Mr Leclezio said net debt has fallen from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 850m.
However, the debt had already fallen from disposals of other assets.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Charges fly in health leak row: Agenda eclipsed by naming of
girl portrayed in Labour broadcast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEROCIOUS row over who leaked the name of the sick child whose case was a
model for Labour's controversial political broadcast last Tuesday drove
other general election issues off the agenda yesterday.
Amid scenes of near pandemonium in the camps of both main parties, the
Conservatives and Labour vied repeatedly to take the high moral ground by
charging their opponents with cynically abusing a family's privacy for their
own political ends.
But after a series of increasingly acrimonious and rowdy news conferences
which first put Labour on the defensive, the day ended with the Tories in
the spotlight when Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, conceded
that party officials had 'helped the consultant' at the centre of the case
to contact a newspaper.
By early evening, Tory officials had felt obliged to issue a 'categorical
denial' that Mr Major had known anything of the party's contacts with the
child's family, the consultant or the media. They added: 'We did not know
the name of the child. When the consultant rang us, he did not give us the
name of the child.'
The Conservatives also admitted that they had received, but overlooked, a
fax alerting them to the imminent broadcast from the child's grandfather, a
Tory activist, nine days before the programme went out. While Central Office
insisted that this carried no mention of the girl's name, Mr Peter
Lee-Roberts confirmed last night that he had named his son-in-law.
Jubilant Labour officials refused to accept the disclaimer, however. Hinting
the Tories were responsible for the leak they demanded a public apology to
Mr Kinnock from Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative chairman, for his remark
that the Labour leader's endorsement of the broadcast had raised 'serious
questions about his leadership'.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, later called for Mr Waldegrave's
resignation.
The beneficiary from the bitter, two-party dogfight may turn out to be Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, who lambasted both his rivals
for descending into 'personal vituperation and abuse' while failing to offer
'a single positive idea' for the National Health Service.
There seems little doubt, however, that the row has damaged the standing of
both main parties as the Tories have charged Labour with inaccuracy and
scaremongering, while their opponents counter-claimed that the Conservatives
were dodging the issue of NHS underfunding by 'smearing' Mr Kinnock.
Yesterday began with Labour in disarray when Mr Kinnock was swiftly
embroiled in a renewed dispute over who had identified Jennifer Bennett, the
five-year-old whose wait for ear surgery was highlighted in the broadcast.
His defence of Labour's actions turned to embarrassment, however, when his
denial that Miss Julie Hall, his press officer, had disclosed the girl's
first name to journalists was contradicted by Miss Hall herself. She
acknowledged that she had divulged the girl's first name, but had given no
further details.
Efforts to trace the 'mole' then concentrated on the two national
newspapers, The Independent and the Daily Express, which first ran stories
identifying the girl.
Last night Sir Nicholas Lloyd, the Express editor, denied that his newspaper
had obtained the name of the girl or her family from Conservative Central
Office. But he acknowledged that the paper did obtain the name of the
consultant involved 'from a Conservative source probably connected with
Central Office'.
Adding that The Independent had had the name of the consultant and the name
of the family, he said: 'I am quite confident they got those from Labour
Party sources.'
But The Independent insisted it had found the Bennetts by means separate
from the parties, the consultant, or the family. In a further twist, Sir
Nicholas later contradicted a Tory claim that the Express had known the
family's name when it first called the consultant.
As reporters continued to dig for more details of the leaks last night, the
central debate over the future of the NHS appeared to have been all but
ignored.
Labour said it had received more than 1,000 calls from sympathisers, many of
whom had volunteered stories of lengthy delays in hospital treatment.
However, several examples of these were also subject to criticism when
reporters discovered factual inaccuracies in those Labour publicised.
The Conservatives, meanwhile, attempted to make the case for their NHS
reforms by producing a number of doctors strongly supportive of the changes.
The impact of the leak row on opinion polls remained unclear last night.
Pundits believe it will be the weekend at the earliest before its effect, if
any, shows through.
It emerged last night that Mr Kinnock has issued a libel writ against The
Sun in connection with a statement in the paper today on the affair.

FT  27 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hotel deal knocks Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONGLOMERATE Lonrho fell sharply as a result of mixed feelings about its
annual meeting and consideration of a hotel chain deal with Libya.
As the market opened, Lonrho gained 4 on news that it had sold a one-third
share in its Metropole Hotels (Holdings) to the Libyan Arab Foreign
Investment Company for Pounds 177.5m. The price was seen to be good and the
cash was welcomed as a counterbalance to an estimated debt of Pounds 850m.
However, as analysts considered the political implications of the deal,
particularly the prospect that any potential buyer of Lonrho might be
discouraged by the link, they took a more cautious view.
This view was compounded by murmurs of disquiet over general trading voiced
at the annual meeting. Lonrho traditionally has a very loyal body of private
shareholders behind it, but observers said the cracks were beginning to show
yesterday.
The stock slipped back in the afternoon to close a net 8 lower at 95p - one
of the biggest percentage falls in the London market - with a hefty turnover
of 10m shares.
Rank shines
Political considerations helped Rank Organisation as buyers sought the
leisure and office equipment group as a hedge to a possible Labour victory
in the UK general election next month. The shares climbed 15 to 660p in
brisk turnover of 1.1m.
Smith New Court initiated the Rank rise yesterday as it put out a strong buy
note. The broker highlighted the group's credentials of a reasonable rating
in an underperforming leisure sector that is poised to improve markedly as
the economy recovers. 'Rank has the right profile in the right sector at the
right time,' said Mr Bruce Jones.
The point highlighted by Smith and taken up by most investors, however, was
that Rank could be a key stock under a Labour administration, with its
domestic leisure side - such as bingo halls and holiday centres - largely
unaffected by the party's tax plans and economic policies. It also has a
large international exposure through its Rank Xerox subsidiary, which will
also be unmoved by a change of UK government.
Burmah pleases
Lubricants to specialist chemicals group Burmah Castrol was one of the
strongest performers in the market after announcing 1991 profits at the top
end of analysts' forecasts and a confident trading statement. The shares
jumped 41 to 523p with 2.2m traded.
The rise was accentuated because expectations had been dampened ahead of the
results announcement and analysts were pleased that profit margins had been
maintained in spite of a fall in volume. County NatWest said Burmah still
looked inexpensive. The house remains a buyer and has lifted its forecast
for this year by Pounds 1m. It has also raised its dividend forecast by a
penny to 25p.
Reflection on the prospects for TSB following the bank's annual meeting left
the shares looking weak against the market on heavy turnover of 8.2m. The
stock lost a penny to 130p.
Kleinwort Benson's banking team, which was already at the low end of
analysts' forecasts, cut its profits estimate for the year to October by
Pounds 20m to Pounds 205m. The house also shifted the stock from a buy
recommendation to a hold following recent outperformance of TSB against the
market.
Glaxo retreated 22 to 802p as the recent positive run on the shares appeared
to peter out. Talk that Glaxo formed part of a large sell programme carried
out by US brokerage house Salomon Brothers late on Wednesday also helped to
depress the stock.
Strong interim results helped Wellcome to rise 15 to 1014p. Profits were
roughly in line with market forecasts, but the meeting was bullish and
analysts liked the underlying sales growth, especially of its Zovirax herpes
drug and its anti-Aids drug Retrovir.
ICI was firm on reports that Tamoxifen, a drug used against breast cancer,
might also strengthen a woman's bones, reducing the risk of osteoporosis
that normally accompanies ageing. Tamoxifen is produced by a subsidiary of
ICI and the chemicals giant gained 16 to 1255p.
Burton Group was the most heavily traded stock in London on turnover of 15m
shares. Morgan Stanley and Cazenove were said to be involved, as blocks of
around 3m shares, including an agency cross at 40 1/2 p, changed hands. The
stock closed  1/2 higher at 40p.
Supermarkets had a firm tone following higher profits from Wm Morrison and a
strengthened buy recommendation for J. Sainsbury from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Northern England food retailer Morrison, recently described as a rising star
by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, moved ahead 15 to 328p on announcing profits of
Pounds 62.65m, compared with Pounds 50.28m previously. The company also
proposed a two-for-one scrip issue.
Sainsbury moved forward 6 to 387p after UBS upgraded its 1992-93 profits
estimate to Pounds 725m from Pounds 706m.
News of possible trouble ahead for Rolls-Royce, the aerospace engine maker,
seeped into the market and restrained the shares, which showed no change at
154p. Trade unions, unhappy at the loss of 3,000 jobs, held a meeting at the
company's Derby factory yesterday and could ballot the workforce on
industrial action.
Figures from food processing equipment group APV came in at the lower end of
the range of City forecasts and were accompanied by a warning that current
first-half trading had been difficult. In spite of a held dividend the
shares fell 8 to 108p.
Exposure to US markets helped Siebe to put on 10 to 627p and TI 7 to 652p.
Publishers and printers were helped by 1991 profits of Pounds 85.2m from
United Newspapers. The profits were at the top end of forecasts and United
advanced 13 to 373p, with SG Warburg hardening its buy stance on the stock.
Pearson was lifted 18 to 796p and Reed International 14 to 520p.
Paper, plastics and building materials group Bunzl appreciated 4 to 90p on
6.4m shares traded after a sharp fall in 1991 profits. Analysts felt that
the company had hit rock bottom and was set for a revival of fortunes.
Slough Estates, Britain's fourth largest property group, won a generally
warm reception for its final results yesterday. The shares firmed a penny to
177p in exceptionally high volume of 3.8m.
Bass, the UK's biggest brewer, came closer to achieving the sale of 2,740
public houses that it is required to dispose of under a Department of Trade
ruling. The shares rose 8 to 536p.

FT  27 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei starts new fiscal
year on easier note

Tokyo
THE Nikkei average had an early gain reversed in dull trading as investors
refrained from activity on the first trading day for the April account and
the new fiscal year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 341.29 on balance at 19,885.49 after setting a
high for the day of 20,350.66 in the morning and later falling to the
session's low of 19,885.29.
Volume dropped to 180m shares from 350m as year-end activity petered out.
Foreign investors, who have been leading buyers of lower-priced blue chips,
were also absent.
Declines finally led advances by 500 to 432, with 144 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 2.02 to 1,446.76, but in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 2.71 to 1,131.99.
A stronger futures market initially led the Nikkei index higher, but
scattered selling later depressed share prices. Traders, who had hoped that
individuals and investment trusts would start buying for the April account,
were disappointed.
Dealers put the decline in the Nikkei down to sharp falls of low-liquidity
component stocks. These had previously been relatively firm while leading
blue chips had fallen, since arbitrageurs held the issues in their baskets.
However, persistent rumours that the issues will be replaced in the Nikkei
average triggered liquidation. Godo Shusei weakened Y200 to Y1,270 and
Shimura Kako lost Y100 to Y880.
Okamoto Industries, the leading condom maker, gained Y10 to Y1,180 as
investors were encouraged by the lifting of margin trading restrictions by
Japan Securities Finance, which is closely linked with the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
High-technology issues were weaker on news that a US company had filed a
suit for damages against some Japanese electronics makers on alleged patent
infringement charges. Sony fell Y110 to Y4,040 and Matsushita Electric
Industrial slipped Y20 to Y1,280.
Rumours that funds from the bribery scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin, the
package delivery company, were used to rig speculative issues depressed
speculative favourites. Clarion suffered a setback of Y140 to Y1,040 and
Nippon Carbon dropped Y300 to Y1,230.
In Osaka, the OSE average eased 14.60 to 21,526.50 in volume of 73.5m
shares. The index rose on early buying by dealers, but then lost ground on
small-lot selling. Trading volume, lifted of late by cross-trades for
year-end book closing, declined on the first trading day for the new fiscal
year.
Roundup
THE FALL in Tokyo weighed on some Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG sentiment was dampened by rumours of a possible rights issue by
Jardine Strategic. The Hang Seng index receded 14.52 to 5,037.71 in turnover
of HKDollars 2.58bn, against HKDollars 2.28bn. Jardine Strategic was 10
cents lower at HKDollars 22.30 ahead of 1991 results.
AUSTRALIA closed at its worst level this year, with the All Ordinaries index
off 10.8 at 1,571.2 in ADollars 190.8m turnover.
NEW ZEALAND fell a further 1.45 per cent to its lowest point since last
August. The NZSE-40 index finished 20.40 down at 1,390.60 amid turnover of
NZDollars 15m.
SINGAPORE declined on disappointing corporate results, the Straits Times
Industrial index losing 9.94 to 1,439.72 in volume of 33.8m shares.
Overseas-Chinese Banking, on announcing a smaller than forecast rise in
group net profits, shed 15 cents to SDollars 8.95.
KUALA LUMPUR featured the debut of the car maker Proton, which ended at
MDollars 6.60 for a premium of MDollars 1.60 over the offer price. The
composite index, however, closed 3.13 lower at 604.27 in volume of 59m
shares, up from 38.8m.
TAIWAN was encouraged by a statement late on Wednesday that the future
president will be chosen through direct election. The weighted index rose
71.29 to 4,792.54 as turnover improved to TDollars 20.31bn.
SEOUL's index fell below 600 on a report that the government was working on
measures to restrain expansion of business conglomerates, but rebounded on
buying by the Stock Market Stabilisation Fund to end at 611.70, up 3.87.
Turnover came to Won442.4bn.
MANILA surrendered early gains to profit-taking. The composite index was off
2.35 on the day at 1,086.60 in turnover of 39m pesos, after 55m pesos.

FT  27 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Recovery undermined by fragile
stability since coup - The discontent in Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over Venezuela's political and military stability in the wake of a
frustrated military coup in February has been depressing stock prices.
The Caracas Stock Exchange index closed at 28,284.23 on Wednesday, down 17.2
per cent from the year's peak of 34,142.60 on February 3, the day before the
coup attempt against the government of President Carlos Andres Perez.
While this shows a fall of just 3.5 per cent in the index since the end of
1991, clearly investors were shaken by the frustrated rebellion, the first
of its kind in the country since the early 1960s, and by subsequent events.
Over the last few weeks, opposition parties have been calling for the
resignation of the president. His five-year term is due to finish in
February 1994.
Along with frequent rumours of another military uprising, there have also
been a rash of anti-government protests and two popular demonstrations in
which tens of thousands of Caracas residents, calling out from rooftops and
balconies, demanded that the president should quit.
Mr Perez and the three-year-old economic reform programme he initiated are
the main targets of this wave of discontent, but the president has asserted
repeatedly that he will not resign.
The Caracas stock index fell by more than 9 per cent in the four trading
days after the market reopened on February 6, following a two-day closure.
Prices then rallied briefly, and it seemed that the market - in dollar terms
its stocks grew by 555 per cent in 1990 and by 34.3 per cent in 1991 - was
headed for a recovery, at least in local currency terms. However, the brief
upswing ended in mid-February, since when the market has continued to slide.
The Venezuelan bolivar, which lost 23.1 per cent of its value against the
dollar in 1991, has also been hit hard by the general lack of confidence.
The currency closed at the end of last year at 61.63 to the dollar, and had
fallen 5.5 per cent to 65.00 by March 25. The general declining trend
steepened after the putsch.
With inflation expected to be between 20 and 30 per cent this year, the
bolivar will continue to fall. Large exporters believe it should decline
even faster than it has so far this year, asserting that the currency is
still somewhat overvalued.
All of this is somewhat ironic, since the economy grew by 9.2 per cent in
1991, the biggest rise in Latin America, and expansion of 5 to 6 per cent is
expected this year. But aside from a lack of confidence, perhaps the biggest
problem for the economy is inflation, which reached 148.2 per cent for the
1989-91 period. Last year inflation dropped to 30.7 per cent, compared with
36.5 per cent in 1990. But government promises to reduce it to 20 per cent
by the end of 1992 are viewed sceptically by most businessmen and investors.
The government has said that it means to attack inflation with renewed
vigour this year, but it is not clear yet how it will proceed in terms of
interest rates. One thing is certain: the government will continue to
intervene actively on the foreign exchange market, which is dominated by
bolivar-dollar trading.
Senior officials are worried about the domestic political effect of a
bolivar that devalues 'too quickly' this year, and the administration is
likely to use its large dollar reserves (Dollars 13.2bn at the end of the
1991 year) to attenuate the devaluation trend.
Although the bolivar's exchange rate is supposed to depend on a free float,
the government, which controls most of the country's foreign exchange, has
traditionally intervened actively on the market.

FT  27 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate results provide the
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE results provided the interest on most bourses yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT traded in a narrow range as attention remained on Veba and
Schering. Further evidence that the Bundesbank was still not on top of
inflation held the market back. The DAX index rose 2.76 to 1,719.02 while
the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, eased 0.26 to 698.21. Turnover fell
to DM5.2bn from DM5.5bn.
Schering dropped DM9 to DM826.80 in heavy volume of 327,142 shares on
disappointment about the delay in selling off non-core businesses.
Veba, which announced a rise in the dividend after the close on Wednesday,
jumped DM5.50 to DM383.30.
Retailers were depressed by a trade association report which predicted that
growth in west German retail sales would slow to a real 1.5 per cent in 1992
from 5.6 per cent last year. Kaufhof fell DM3.50 to DM513 while ASKO, a
recent favourite, gave up DM10 to DM890 in big volume of 403,716 shares.
Less liquid stocks were on the move, with Linde up DM6 to DM819 while the
haircare products company Wella eased DM8.50 to DM619.
PARIS saw volatility in some stocks while the broad market moved higher.
Turnover was modest at just under FFr2bn as the CAC-40 index added 6.47 to
1,934.75.
CMB, the packaging company, fell FFr11.20 or 5.6 per cent to FFr186.40 after
analysts were told at a meeting with the company that the first quarter of
1992 had been disappointing. Several brokers said they were trimming their
1992 earnings forecasts as a result, with Cheuvreux de Virieu making the
most noise about it. Dealers said profit-taking in CMB had been inevitable
in view of its 30 per cent outperformance over the last 12 months.
Cerus, the French holding company of the Italian entrepreneur Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, rose FFr7.50 or 5.6 per cent to FFr140.50 on rumours that it
would sell it Banque Dumenil-Leble unit.
Poliet for once gave the market a pleasant surprise by releasing good 1991
results, and was rewarded with a FFr21 or 3.9 per cent increase in its share
price to FFr550.
Generale des Eaux rose FFr52 to FFr2,290 on reports of positive developments
in its property interests.
MILAN's depression deepened, following this week's poor banking results and
further evidence of the massive divergence in the government's public sector
borrowing requirement. Analysts saw little prospect of the market recovering
after the general election and some said optimism that Mr Bettino Craxi, the
Socialist leader, would be the next premier was misplaced.
The Comit index fell 2.32 to 496.97, a new low for the year but still above
the 480 chart support level, while turnover was estimated at L83bn after
L91.9bn. Dealers detected some support buying by the big corporate groups.
The banking sector remained weak, with Banca Commerciale Italiana falling
L62 or 1.7 per cent to L3,540. In telecoms, Stet rose L26 to L2,110 ahead of
its board meeting later in the day while Sirti rose L25 to L10,440 after
announcing a 14 per cent rise in 1991 consolidated net profit.
ZURICH focused on the chemical sector with Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz reporting
1991 earnings. Ciba-Geigy, which announced a five-for-one share split, shed
early gains and its certificates closed steady at SFr3,450, while its
bearers dipped SFr20 to SFr3,430. Sandoz, which is to raise its dividend by
SFr5, saw its bearers and registered shares both fall SFr20 to SFr2,590
each.
Roche, which has yet to release 1991 results, went against the trend with
certificates up SFr50 to SFr3,050 and bearers gaining SFr10 to SFr4,280. The
SMI index finished up 5.5 at 1,835.6.
AMSTERDAM featured Daf after the truck manufacturer reported a net loss for
1991 of Fl 395m and then said it was holding talks with the government and
banks to strengthen its capital base. The shares closed unchanged at Fl
24.20 but analysts said that in spite of forecasting a stronger second half,
prospects remained unfavourable. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.6 to 125.6 in
turnover of Fl 485.7m.
KLM was up 20 cents to Fl 36.50, on news released after the close on
Wednesday that it was to expand its European flight network. Nutricia was
down 80 cents at Fl 172 ahead of its results. Polygram, which is to raise Fl
250m from a commercial paper issue, advanced Fl 1.00 to Fl 45.00.
STOCKHOLM fell on profit-taking with the Affarsvarlden General Index falling
5.2 to 1,004.1 in turnover of SKr617m after SKr845m.
Volvo, which has been actively traded this week following news of management
restructuring, slipped back with its B shares down SKr4 to SKr426. Procordia
B also fell back, losing SKr2 to SKr197.
MADRID's general index closed 1.52 ahead at 255.57. Corporacion Mapfre,
which announced plans to raise Pta10bn through three-year convertible bond
issue, shed Pta230 or 5 per cent to Pta4,270.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM to build zinc smelter in
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIM, THE Australian mining and metals group, yesterday said it had completed
a joint venture deal to build a Y50bn (Pounds 216m) zinc and lead smelter in
Japan with three of its biggest Japanese customers.
MIM said it would own 30 per cent of the smelter, to be built at Hachinohe,
in the Aomori prefecture. Nippon Mining will own 48.5 per cent, Mitsui
Mining and Smelting 18.5 per cent and Mitsubishi Materials 3 per cent.
The smelter is MIM's first large investment in East Asia, where it forecasts
long-term growth for zinc products. The plant will be operated by Hachinohe
Smelting, which is part-owned by Nippon and Mitsui.
Mr Norm Fussell, MIM managing director, said the joint venture would
strengthen the group's relationship with the three Japanese companies, which
are significant purchasers of zinc concentrate from its Australian mines.
'Japan is the region's biggest single zinc market, and other markets can be
supplied conveniently from there. Increasing demand for differentiated zinc
products can be more effectively met from a plant located close to the
customers,' Mr Fussell said.
The Hachinohe plant will have an annual production capacity of 120,000
tonnes of zinc and 60,000 tonnes of lead. It will smelt metal for the joint
venture partners in proportion to their shareholdings.
The plant will use the energy-efficient Imperial Smelting Process, which is
capable of treating most feedstocks, including low-grade and bulk
concentrates and recycled material. Hachinohe Smelting, which operates a
similar smelter on the same site, is regarded as a highly efficient
producer.
MIM has been discussing the smelter project with the Japanese companies for
some time as part of its strategy of focussing on the major zinc consuming
regions of North America, Europe and East Asia.
Asian demand for zinc has been sluggish in the last year as a result of
recessions in the region's export markets in North America and Europe.
However, the joint venture partners said they were confident that demand
would recover in the medium to long term in response to growth in eastern
Europe, the former Soviet Union and China.
They said there were also signs that a shortage of smelting capacity was
emerging as production from new mines increased. The smelter is expected to
begin production in late 1994.
MIM has significant interests in the downstream zinc business in Europe
through shareholdings in a number of German companies, including Duisburg, a
zinc smelter, and Hutten-werke Tempelhof Verwaltungs, a zinc alloy producer.
It also owns 22.5 per cent of Cominco, the Canadian producer, which accounts
for 10 per cent of world zinc production, including the huge Red Dog mine in
Alaska and the world's largest zinc refinery in British Columbia.
In Australia, MIM produces copper, lead, silver and zinc from its Mount Isa
and Hilton mines in Queensland. It also operates several coal mines, and has
a major interest in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea.
MIM blamed low prices and coal production problems for a 76 per cent fall in
interim net operating profits to ADollars 16m in the six months to December.
The group says it is on target to achieve a reduction of ADollars 100m a
year in operating costs at Mount Isa, where the workforce has been reduced
by 700 to 4,360 over the past year.

<TEXT>
GOLD JEWELLERY demand last year in the six key markets rose by 2 per cent to
a record 602.1 tonnes, according to preliminary estimates by the World Gold
Council, the promotional organisation supported by gold producers
world-wide.
This was in spite of a slight fall, by 1 per cent to 219 tonnes, in the US,
the largest individual market. Also recession in the UK caused a 17 per cent
drop, to 40.1 tonnes, there.
The council says it is possible the US total might have been 15 tonnes
higher but 219 tonnes 'remains the best figure at present.' It suggests an 8
per cent rise in Italy, to 130 tonnes, 'is an indicator of the strength in
demand world-wide since exports to a great number of countries account for
about two-thirds of Italian gold jewellery fabrication.'
Japan, the second largest market, took 5 per cent more gold jewellery last
year or 126.6 tonnes; France saw a 3 per cent increase to 40.4 tonnes; and
the biggest increase was in newly-unified Germany: 12 per cent to 46 tonnes.
The council's statistics are estimates of the fine gold content of jewellery
purchases by retailers. It says its research corrects the impression -
caused by 'the well-publicised difficulties of Ratners in the UK and Zale in
the US' - that gold jewellery sales were down last year.

ZINC was the outstanding performer on the LME, although all other base
metals moved ahead yesterday. Three-month zinc rose Dollars 32 at one stage
to a 14 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,265 a tonne. Traders said they could
see no fundamental reason for the rise, and expect hedge selling to be
attracted by the higher levels. However, charts were constructive, with
recent consolidation above Dollars 1,230 signalling a rise to around Dollars
1,260. European Zinc Institute data showed February world smelters stocks
down 17,300 tonnes, but this reflected shipments to LME warehouses and not
into consumption, traders said. LME stocks rose around 35,000 tonnes in
February. London COFFEE closed lower despite a statement from Brazil's
president supporting talks on a new international agreement with economic
clauses and export quotas. New York COTTON futures remained higher at midday
on buying inspired by bullish fundamentals and technical factors. US cotton
consumption for February (9.73m bales) marks the highest consumption for
that month in 25 years, the National Cotton Council of America said.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Car manufacturers forecast to
use 40 per cent more aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM WILL benefit most among the traded metals from developments in car
design in the next decade. Nickel will also make big percentage gains from a
very low base. But the outlook for copper and zinc is not so positive,
suggests the Brook Hunt &amp; Associates consultancy group.
It says in a report published today that more than 1m tonnes of aluminium a
year will be consumed by new cars and automotive spare parts by 1997-98, a
40 per cent increase from present levels. Some of the gain will be from an
increase in car output but Brook Hunt says the average car is likely to
contain 30 per cent more aluminium.
In percentage terms, the greatest growth in use will be in aluminium body
parts, which are forecast to consume more than 100,000 tonnes a year by the
end of the decade against 12,000 tonnes in 1990. More significant uses for
aluminium in tonnage terms will remain transmission casings, cylinder heads
and alloy wheels.
However, the report says European car makers are not likely to make a
substantial switch to aluminium for engine blocks to save weight, given the
generally small size of European car engines.
Car producers are being driven to make changes by a renewed emphasis on
weight saving, tougher exhaust emission standards and the development of new
materials, the report points out.
Nickel's main use in cars so far has been as an alloying addition to steel
employed in drivetrain applications such as gears. Future use will continue
to be in these steel alloys, particularly in stainless steel exhaust systems
and in high nickel alloy required for turbochargers, says Brook Hunt.
Although nickel use is forecast to increase by nearly 40 per cent by the
middle of the 1990s, it is starting from a low base of just over 1 kg a car.
Copper already has suffered from the substitution of aluminium, in radiators
for example. Copper's use in wiring may fall because of the introduction of
multiplexing (in which many components are powered through a single
conductor), although no big changes are foreseen until the second half of
the decade. In the meantime, says the report, more electrically operated
components and electronic engine management systems in high-volume cars
should ensure that the amount of copper per car will continue to increase.
Brook Hunt says growth in the car industry's consumption of zinc depends on
an increase in the use of galvanised steel sheet. The report estimates that
about 35 per cent of steel sheet used in car manufacturing in 1990 was
galvanised on at least one side. This proportion is forecast to rise to 48
per cent by 2000. Over the same period the use of zinc per car for
galvanising is predicted to grow by 65 per cent. This gain will, however, be
offset to some extent by losses elsewhere - particularly by the widespread
introduction of fuel injection systems using aluminium instead of die-cast
carburettors made largely from zinc. Metals Use in the West European Auto
Industry: Dollars 4,000 from Brook Hunt, 11, London Street, Chertsey, Surrey
KT16 8AP, England.

Asked during a breakfast with foreign correspondents in Brasilia whether
Brazil supported a new coffee pact with economic clauses and quotas, he
replied:
'Yes, with quotas. But the details of the economic clauses will be discussed
in the London meeting.'
Brazil, the world's leading coffee producer, will meet other world producers
and consumers for talks at the International Coffee Organisation in London
early next month.
Collor's remarks are the first official confirmation that Brazil will back
talks on a pact with export quotas.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uzbeks see oil gusher as answer
to their prayers - A blowout that could herald self-sufficiency for the
former Soviet republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN OIL began gushing out of the ground the day Uzbekistan joined the
United Nations, inhabitants of the newly independent state saw it as a gift
from God
After flowing for almost a month, the awesome oil blowout is now spilling
out about 15,000 tonnes of light crude a day. Experts at the site in
Uzbekistan's impoverished Fergana Valley say it is still too early to
estimate the size of the reserves below. But this Moslem nation of 20m
people is already praying it will become a self-sufficient oil producer
after decades of depending on neighbouring Russia, which first conquered
Uzbek territory in the middle of the 19th century.
'This is a major discovery for Uzbekistan,' declared a delighted Mr Anwar
Narmatov, director of Uzbekneft, the republic's state-owned oil company.
But like his colleagues at a crisis centre set up less than a kilometre away
from the sky-high fountain of oil and white smoke, he says that more
drilling around the area is necessary to determine whether this discovery
represents a freak occurrence or holds the promise of an oil bonanza.
The unexpected find of 'black gold' could not have come at a better time as
the most populous of the former Soviet Union's central Asian republics
struggles to find its feet as an independent country.
Even the name of the collective farming area where the oil discovery was
made on March 2 - Mingbulak, meaning 'One Thousand Sources' - seems to
support suggestions of divine planning. The oil was struck after Uzbekneft
drove down to 5,200 metres - it had not expected to hit oil for another 600
metres.
Experts have now decided that a necessary preliminary to tackling the
blowout is to set fire to it within the coming week. Mr Efim Katznelson,
Uzbekistan's expert at capping oil blowouts, says: 'Working under fire' is
the only way to build new valves and pipelines to channel the oil in an
orderly manner.
The fire is also expected to burn the oil that has flooded surrounding
farmland. If the oil is not brought under control quickly, it could not only
damage large quantities of cotton farmland on the eve of the sowing campaign
but pollute the neighbouring Syr Daria, which irritates crops for miles
around.
'We can't do anything now with all the smoke and oil everywhere,' he said,
his protective clothing spattered with oil droplets. He expects to produce a
flame 100 metres high, after simulating a test operation.
The blowout has already produced some 350,000 tonnes of oil. Some of it has
been collected and dispatched to the republic's two refineries. But an army
of battered trucks, assembled from all over Uzbekistan are clearly unable to
cope with so much wealth all at once.
Mr Joe Bowden, the Texan oil man whose Wild Well Control company is helping
the Uzbeks along with experts from Russia, says it will take 15 days to cap
the oil flow.
Mr Katznelson says the last crisis of this kind in the former Soviet Union
occurred six years ago, when a blowout at the Tenghiz oilfields in nearby
Kazakstan took a year to cap.
A decree issued by President Islam Karimov orders Uzbekistan's economic
experts to draw up plans to attract foreign capital to help develop
reserves.
Mr Rustam Azimov, chairman of Uzbekistan's Natinal Bank for Foreign Economic
Activity said that existing joint venture legislation already exempted
foreign investors from taxation for the first two years from the date
profits were declared. They are entitled to a 50 per cent reduction for the
following three years and there are no restrictions on repatriating profits
in hard currency.
As a major producer of gold and cotton, Uzbekistan is already keen for
foreign investors to help it process more of its wealth internally rather
than export raw materials. Oil could provide a major boost to the republic's
balance of payments.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian mine to be privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONDESTABLE mine, which produces about 4,000 tonnes of fine copper
concentrate a year, is to be Peru's first wholly state-owned mining concern
to be sold off to the private sector. Mineroperu's 100 per cent holding will
be offered on the Lima stock exchange between 27 April and 8 May.
Condestable has been in state hands since 1976 when its previous Japanese
owners (Nippon Mining, Mitsui and Hidemasa Kubo Fukomara), decided it was no
longer worth exploiting.
Since then, however, it has become one of the Peruvian state's few mining
success stories - at least in relative terms - having turned in profits
almost every year.
According to Mr Luis Palacios, Condestable's general manager, the mine - one
third open pit and two-thirds underground - has above average productivity
despite its relatively low grade ore. The concentrator plant has capacity to
treat 1,200 tonnes of ore a day and it has its own electricity generating
plant. Before the privatisation announcement, the company had planned to be
producing copper cathodes by 1993.
Another attraction of the mine is its location only 90 km (56 miles)from the
capital, Lima, and 5 km from the Panamerican Highway. Production last year
totalled 3,952 tonnes of copper concentrate, bringing in revenue of around
Dollars 6.3m. The company has been selling all its output recently to
Brainco, the Peruvian branch of Brandeis.
The cash-strapped Peruvian mining industry received a small boost with this
week's announcement that the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) will
provide a Dollars 20m credit line for the sector. Bladex, the Latin American
Export Bank is to come up with a further Dollars 30m, mostly for mining
companies, according to local sources.
The Peruvian government has requested a further Dollars 200m from CAF to
establish a special fund to refinance short-term company debts. Much of this
would be directed to the mining sector. The credit request is due for
discussion at the next CAF board meeting.
A call for Cipec, the copper exporters' group, to be disbanded was made at
its meeting in Paris yesterday by Chile's mining minister, who cited
dwindling membership and lack of income.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEA PLANTATIONS in India and Sri Lanka, the two largest producers, are
affected by drought and neither country is likely to meet its output targets
for 1992, officials say, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
In Sri Lanka, the world's main tea exporter, production has dropped by 16.2m
kg, or about 6 per cent of its total output for 1991, in the first three
months of this year, officials said. 'From favourable conditions enjoyed in
1991, the pendulum seems to have swung completely in the opposite
direction,' said Mr Maxwell Fernando of tea auctioneers Forbes and Walker.
"We have suddenly reached a doom situation from the boom conditions last
year,' Mr Fernando said.
Drought also prevails in the plantations of south India, which account for
about 40 per cent of the country's output.
Production in January and February was down by about 6m kg to 20.7m kg,
according to the United Planters Association of Southern India.
The shortfall has affected factories and slowed down picking, the
association said.
But government officials in New Delhi were confident that there would not be
much of a shortfall against India's output target of 765m kg for the year,
up from last year's record 741m kg, about half the world's tea.
'It's too early to make any prognosis,' said Mr G. Sundaram, a top official
in India's Commerce Ministry, which follows tea production figures. 'The
projection will be more realistic after a period of six months.'

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Generously-priced new issues raise
little enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE uncertain tone continued in the international bond market yesterday,
with even generously-priced new issues finding little enthusiasm among
investors.
Tohoku Electric Power, the fifth largest of the Japanese power utilities,
launched a Dollars 250m five-year issue via Yamaichi International. The 7
3/4 per cent bonds were reoffered to investors at a fixed price of 99.90,
for a yield 66 basis points more than US Treasury bonds.
Participants said that the pricing was fair, with bonds of a similar
maturity issued by other Japanese power companies offering a yield spread of
around 60 basis points.
However, demand for the paper was restrained against the background of a
weak US Treasury market.
In addition, few investors are familiar with a borrower making its first
Eurodollar bond issue since 1984. The bonds traded down to 99.85 bid, where
the yield spread over US government paper was 69 basis points.
Osaka Gas, another Japanese utility, launched a DM300m five-year deal, lead
managed by Westdeutsche Landesbank, into an equally lacklustre German bond
market.
The paper carries a coupon of 8 1/2 per cent and was priced to yield 8.79
per cent, or 49 basis points more than German government bonds. Again, the
pricing was seen as generous by participants, offering a higher yield than
bonds issued by European corporations. For example, five-year bonds issued
by Fiat offer a yield of around 8.62 per cent.
But the deal struggled to find buyers in a market dominated by negative
sentiment. The bund futures contract on the Liffe fell to 87.20 during the
day, having opened at 87.37.
From an issue price of 101.375, the Osaka Gas bonds traded down to 99.10
bid, just inside full fees.
Nacional Financiera, the Mexican state-backed financing agency, launched a
Dollars 100m seven-year issue, lead managed by Bear Sterns International.
The 9 3/8 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.25, where the yield is 205 basis points more than US Treasury bonds.
Participants reported reasonable demand for the paper, despite a yield
spread seen as tight for a Latin American borrower.

JAPAN plans to lift its ban on foreigners buying stock in Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone (NTT), the nation's telecommunications giant, AP-DJ reports
from Tokyo.
Today, the cabinet is set to approve a bill allowing foreign holdings
totalling up to 20 per cent of the 15.6m shares in Japan's largest company,
the Post and Telecommunications Ministry said yesterday.
NTT's shares reached a price of more than Y3m each in mid-1987, soon after
the company was converted from a government monopoly to a private
corporation, but closed yesterday at 640,000 yen. Since the group's
privatisation Tokyo stocks have fallen, NTT has been hit by a bribery
scandal and investors' interest in the telecommunications sector has fallen.
Mr Masakazu Oyama, a dealer at Daiwa Securities, said the stock's
unpopularity in Japan left NTT with no choice but to target foreign
invest-ors.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Plans advance for single
European credit rating agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES to establish a single European credit rating agency look set to be
stepped up following the announcement this week of merger talks between
IBCA, the London-based agency, and Euronotation of France.
If the two parties can agree terms, the merger will bring together the
French agency's coverage of the domestic corporate sector with IBCA's
international coverage of banks and UK corporations.
It remains unclear whether the merged Anglo-French agency will be able to
reach agreement with a German consortium which is close to finalising plans
for a pan-European rating agency.
The consortium of German banks, corporations and institutions has been
working on the project for three years. According to Mr Olivier Eveling,
member of the project committee, full plans for an agency will be announced
by the year-end. 'There are large areas of similarity between our
methodology and that of IBCA,' he said.
There remain differences between the approach favoured by the German
consortium and the way in which IBCA has built its business. In particular,
IBCA undertakes some unsolicited ratings based only on published
information, without access to confidential material from the company rated.
The German approach favours an agency which only makes solicited ratings.
If the IBCA/Euronotation merger goes ahead it will receive equity backing
from Centenaire Blanzy, the French holding company with interests ranging
from publishing to market research.
The German project is still looking for an equity backer. Mr Eveling said
the consortium which financed the study is unlikely to provide equity
finance for a fully-fledged agency. There could be a conflict of interest if
the agency was asked to rate a shareholder, he said. Funding is more likely
to come from outside the financial sector, possibly from a publishing firm.
Both sides agreed that a European rating agency is desirable to provide
competition for Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
rating agencies which dominate the fledgling market.
'It is crazy that an industry as important as credit rating should be
dominated by two companies, however good they are,' commented Mr Robin
Monro-Davies, managing director at IBCA. Earlier attempts to challenge the
dominance of Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's in Europe have ended in failure.
In 1989, Fitch, another US rating agency, closed its Euroratings subsidiary
following four years of losses.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Finnish banks downgraded by
Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE crisis in the Finnish banking industry prompted Moody's, the US rating
agency, to downgrade the debt of three Finnish banks yesterday, despite the
announcement last week of a rescue package from the government, designed to
halt the crisis.
Kansallis Osake Pankki, Okobank, and the Union Bank of Finland all had their
debt ratings lowered yesterday, affecting Dollars 8.6bn of outstanding debt.
KOP's senior debt was downgraded from Aa3 to A2, and its subordinated debt
from A1 to A3; Okobank's senior debt rating fell from Aa2 to Aa3, while its
subordinated debt dropped from Aa3 to A1; and Union Bank of Finland's senior
debt was knocked from Aa3 to A1, and its subordinated debt from A1 to A2.
The commercial paper of all three banks was not under review and is
unchanged at Prime-1.
Despite recent attempts by the government to stimulate the economy, 'the
(Finnish) banking environment will remain under significant stress for the
inter-mediate term,' according to Moody's.
The rating agency attributed the problems in the banking industry in part to
the over-expansion of credit during a period of rapid deregulation.
'Current levels of capital are likely to be eroded as core earnings contract
and loan losses mount,' the agency said. Many Finnish banks reported large
losses in 1991.
However, proposed capital injections by the government and the establishment
of a deposit guarantee mechanism were welcomed.
On Wednesday, it was announced that Skopbank, which was rescued from
collapse last autumn, is to receive a capital injection of FM1.5bn (Dollars
333.3m) from the Finnish central bank, its main shareholder.

PETROLEOS de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's national oil company, recorded
net earnings of Dollars 1.86bn in 1991, an increase of 45 per cent over the
Dollars 1.3bn recorded in 1990, according to official estimates.
Mr Andres Sosa Pietri, president, said the company was able to post strong
financial results, even though the average per barrel price of Venezuela's
petroleum exports fell by 22 per cent last year to Dollars 15.92.
He said PDVSA compensated for lower oil prices in 1991 by maintaining strict
cost controls, and by increasing oil production, refining and exports.
The company's worldwide gross sales were Dollars 22.3bn in 1991, down 3 per
cent on the previous year, while operating profits were Dollars 8.08bn,
about the same as the previous year.
PDVSA, one of the world's largest petroleum companies, last year produced an
average of 2.48m barrels per day of crude oil, condensates and natural gas
liquids. This was the highest production level since 1976, when the company
began operations.

<TEXT>
FORD Australia, a subsidiary of the US motor group, yesterday announced a
net loss of ADollars 114m (USDollars 87m) for the year to the end of
December, compared with a net loss of ADollars 83m in the previous year.
However, Ford said the net loss fell to ADollars 61m after deducting the
cost of restructuring and charges relating to prior years' operations. On
that basis, the loss was ADollars 22m smaller than in 1990.
Ford said revenue was down 19 per cent to ADollars 2.3bn. The total
Australian market for cars and trucks fell by 17 per cent to 514,566
vehicles, the lowest for 20 years with the exception of 1987.
The group lost overall market leadership during the period to Toyota, the
Australian subsidiary of the Japanese motor group, but claims to have
recovered its lead in the last six months of the year.
Mr Jac Nasser, president, said the group had improved product quality and
productivity and was well prepared for a recovery in the vehicle market when
confidence returned to the economy.
But he said long-term recovery for the Australian vehicle industry would
depend on government action to boost the economy, including lower interest
rates, tax relief and increased export incentives.
He said the urgency of the problem confronting the industry was highlighted
by forecasts that imports would take 53 per cent of the market in the first
quarter of this year, compared with about 45 per cent in the comparable
period of last year.
Mr Nasser said the industry's difficulties were likely to be worsened by
recently-announced voluntary restrictions on Japanese car exports to the US,
which would cause Japanese manufacturers to consider increasing exports to
Australia.
Statistics released by the federal government yesterday showed that new car
registrations fell by 3.5 per cent in February, compared with the comparable
month of last year.
However, the trend figures, which smooth out fluctuations in monthly
figures, showed an increase of 2.2 per cent, the strongest rise for more
than two years.
Mitsubishi Motors Australia plans to buy out minority shareholders and
delist its shares from the Australian Stock Exchange, Reuter reports from
Adelaide.
Mr Mike Quinn, managing director, said the decision was taken because of
exchange rules requiring an adequate spread of shareholders and because of
illiquid trading in the shares.
It would pay the shareholders, who own 2.9 per cent of the company, ADollars
7.75 a share, for a total of ADollars 1.86m.
At the same time, MMAL reported a fall in net losses to ADollars 23.79m for
1991 from profits of ADollars 13.72m. Sales fell to ADollars 1.23bn from
ADollars 1.29bn.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Merloni profits rise to L11.7bn

MERLONI Elettrodomestici, the Italian white goods group, reported a surge in
net profits of 80 per cent to L11.7bn (Dollars 9m) last year, due to
improved sales and an improved debt-equity ratio.
Turnover of the company, known for its Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes brands,
rose by 3.4 per cent to L1,192bn, while investment spending jumped almost 69
per cent to L59bn.
Merloni, which has expanded quickly in recent years through acquisitions,
had been blighted by general over-capacity in the European white goods
industry and saddled in particular by its heavy borrowings used to finance
growth.
Net borrowings last year amounted to L194bn, compared with shareholders'
funds of L212bn.
However, results were less satisfactory at parent company level. The parent
company slid into a L8.6bn loss last year after having broken even in 1990.
Around L3.6bn of the loss stemmed from contributions to an early retirement
scheme, which will continue to affect future earnings, and L7.9bn from
advance depreciation. Nevertheless, the company has decided to tuck into
reserves to pay a dividend of L45 for ordinary shares and L65 for savings
shares.
La Rinascente, Italy's biggest department store chain, owned by Fiat, raised
group net profits by 4.7 per cent to L100.9bn last year. Sales climbed by 10
per cent to L4,595bn, excluding value-added tax.
The improvement led the company to raise the dividend by L10 a share to L180
for ordinary shares and L140 for savings stock. Group net cash rose by
L46.4bn to L529.3bn.
Rinascente confirmed its commitment to an ambitious expansion programme,
particularly for new hypermarkets, with three openings planned this year.
The group's total network of stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets rose by
38 to 740, including affiliates, by the end of last year.
In the first two months of this year, turnover rose by around 12 per cent to
L721bn. Further growth will come through a L2,000bn investment programme to
1996, involving around 100 store openings, notably in southern Italy.
Rinascente gained government approval last month for a restructuring
programme linked to its new investment plans, with some existing stores
being converted and others closed.
Saffa, the boxboard and packaging group, reported a 24 per cent jump in
group sales to around L640bn last year.
Consolidated profits will not be released for some time, but Saffa said
parent company earnings had risen to around L27bn.

BOLS, the Dutch spirits group which is expanding rapidly into wines and
low-alcoholic drinks, announced a 17 per cent increase in 1991 net profit
and a 11.5 per cent rise in its annual dividend.
Net profit rose to Fl 105.4m (Dollars 56.4m) last year from Fl 90.1m in
1990. Sales were up 11.3 per cent at Fl 1.33bn, due partly to the first-time
consolidation of Ottavio Riccadonna, an Italian producer of vermouth and
sparkling wine, and of the French wine house Domaines Michel Bernard.
Operating profit advanced by 14.6 per cent to Fl 144.3m.
The company, which did not make a profit prediction for 1992, said it would
raise its 1991 dividend to Fl 1.36 from Fl 1.22 the year before.
In 1991, Bols' financial expenses nearly doubled to Fl 21.1m, mainly
reflecting acquisitions in Brazil, France, Italy and Spain.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Komatsu to unveil European
excavator
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOMATSU, the world's second biggest construction equipment manufacturer, is
about to become the first Japanese producer to develop, design and make a
new model outside Japan.
Komatsu UK, based in Birtley, near Newcastle, will unveil its new wheeled
excavator later this month at the Bauma construction equipment exhibition in
Munich.
The move is a sign of the growing Europeanisation of Japanese construction
equipment producers, and of Komatsu's increasing confidence in its
wholly-owned UK subsidiary. The Birtley plant, formerly owned by
Caterpillar, began production in 1987.
The launch is also intended to plug a gap in Komatsu's range and enhance its
position in the German construction equipment market, where wheeled
excavators are an important product.
Virtually all other European markets are in recession of varying depths, but
German demand has risen at least 50 per cent since reunification.
Mr Toshitaka Suketomo, Komatsu UK's managing director, said 80 per cent of
shipments from Birtley were now being exported to Germany. That compares
with about 40 per cent before reunification.
However, other markets have declined and the plant's total production has
fallen. Shipments to the UK market are running at about half the level seen
in busy times, while deliveries to France have virtually halted.
Mr Suketomo said Komatsu UK had slightly adjusted downwards its forecast for
1992 sales, and was now less optimistic than at the beginning of the year.
He believes production at Birtley will fall 10 per cent this year, but this
would be offset by the launch of the new PW170-5 excavator.
Mr Clive Morton, director of personnel and administration, said Komatsu UK
was talking to the Department of Trade and Industry about the local content
rules.

AU PRINTEMPS, the Paris stores group, unveiled a six-fold increase in

the Euromarche and Viniprix supermarket chains.
Group net profits rose to FFr1.86bn (Dollars 330m) from FFr317m in 1990, on
sales up by 6 per cent at FFr31.28bn from FFr29.38bn. Earnings included a
FFr1.84bn exceptional gain, against a FFr41m one-off gain in the previous
year.
Au Printemps received FFr2.26bn for the sale of its stakes last June in
Euromarche and Viniprix to rival chain Carrefour.

ATLAS Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, a leading Philippine
mining company which operates the biggest copper and gold mine in the Far
East, yesterday reported a 1991 net loss of 490.8m pesos (Dollars 20.197m),
compared with a net profit of 309.9m pesos the year before.
Net revenues amounted to 4.2bn pesos, down 14.3 per cent, as low metal
prices and reduced world demand took their toll on the company's
performance.
The company, whose shares are traded in Manila and New York, said the 1991
loss could have been higher but for 'drastic cost reductions in all areas,
combined with a higher level of efficiency in operations'.
It said copper prices were not likely to improve significantly in the short
term, so it had refocused its strategies.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: South Africa adopts a new stance
 -The Reserve Bank's move into the financial rand market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision this week by the Reserve Bank of South Africa to intervene in
the financial rand market should make the country a more attractive
investment proposition for foreigners by reducing currency risk.
The decision has been welcomed by users of the market, who say the Reserve
Bank's intervention will increase stability. The market has traditionally
been very volatile, trading on thin volumes. The bank will intervene by
buying or selling financial rands against US dollars.
The financial rand is a fixed pool of investment currency for foreigners,
introduced in 1985 at the time of the country's debt standstill, to protect
the balance of payments.
The reasoning was that foreign holders of South African equities should be
treated on the same terms as those who had loaned money to the country,
which had then been blocked by the standstill.
Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said intervention should have
five main advantages:
The total supply of financial rand would reduce if, as expected, the bank is
a net purchaser;
The bank's intervention should narrow the discount between the commercial
and financial rand;
The market will enjoy greater stability;
The application of gold and foreign exchange reserves will provide an
additional means for the bank to control domestic liquidity;
Foreign creditors with claims within the debt standstill net will be able to
sell the balances indirectly through authorised dealers in foreign exchange
to the Reserve Bank.
Mr Jaap Meijer, deputy governor of the bank, stressed the money market angle
behind the decision to enter the market.
He noted that a marked improvement in the country's balance of payments
position in the first nine months of 1991 led to an easing of liquidity in
the money markets such that the bank struggled to keep an adequate shortage.
It was useful, he said, to have this additional instrument to regulate
liquidity. He said the amounts involved would probably be fairly small
compared with the monthly shifts in reserves.
Mr Mike Brown, economist at Frankel Max Pollak, the stockbroker, said he
thought the move was designed to increase confidence in the country. 'They
want to normalise the country's involvement in international capital markets
and they don't believe you can do that with a major discount between the
commercial and investment currencies.'
A large discount raised doubts in investors' minds as to the discount they
would have to pay to get money out of the country.
Mr Brown said that although the new policy could dampen equity prices, which
traditionally gain from a weak financial rand, it would probably boost
investment in gilts because a narrowing of the financial rand discount
offered a capital gain.
The volatility of the financial rand is shown by the fact that the discount
to the commercial rand widened from 8 per cent at the beginning of December
to 33 per cent in mid-February amid rumours of a new tax on foreign
investors.
One aspect of the new policy is that it could provide investors with a
one-way bet. If the discount widens perceptibly, investors will feel safe to
buy financial rands in the expectation that the Reserve Bank will be
intervening to support the price.
The Reserve Bank has often said that it would like to abolish the two-tier
currency system, thus removing the stigma of an unsound economy. Bank
officials believe, however, that there remains too much uncertainty to
contemplate abolishing it.
Other determing factors will be the country's balance of payments position
and its reserves, as well as whether it obtains IMF support.

KLOCKNER-Humboldt-Deutz, the German motor and engineering group, yesterday
announced a 67 per cent decline in profits for 1991, but declared the year a
success.
Progress in the last six months of the year had more than compensated for
first-half losses, the company said. There was also a 'realistic chance'
that it would record a profit in 1992, despite severe market conditions.
Reporting profits of DM10m (Dollars 6m), compared with DM30m, on turnover up
2 per cent to DM4.12bn, KHD said most of the sales growth had come from
plant manufacture, its smallest division.
Sales of engines, which account for half the group's business, were down 6
per cent to DM2.2bn. Turnover from farm equipment fell 2 per cent, while
plant sales rose 33 per cent to DM849m.
Overall orders fell 10 per cent during the year, and order books at the end
of December were 21 per cent lower than 12 months earlier.
Mr Werner Kirchgasse, chief executive, said recently that profits would have
to exceed DM100m before shareholders could expect a dividend. The last
payout was in 1986.
Peine-Salzgitter, the steel division of Preussag, has forecast falling
profits for this year ending September 1992
Mr Kurt Stahler, chief executive, told the annual meeting that conditions in
the steel market were becoming more difficult and price increases were
urgently needed.

UNICORP Energy, once a key holding of Toronto financier Mr George Mann, has
refinanced CDollars 320m (USDollars 268.90m) in loans and preferred stock
due to mature on March 31. However, it must sell or merge its most prized
asset, Union Energy, one of Ontario's two natural gas distributors.
Unicorp has raised Dollars 440m from six banks to repay a Dollars 120m loan
to National Bank of Canada, and repay preferred stock held mainly by the
Edper group and the Reichmann family of Toronto.
Under the refinancing terms, Unicorp has a fixed period in which to sell or
merge Union Energy.
Unicorp lost Dollars 12m, or 2.80 a share, in 1991 against a loss of Dollars
1.62 a share in 1990. Besides the profitable gas distributor, it owns a
troubled portfolio of property, financial services and other energy assets.
Diners Club, through Citibank Canada, is buying Air Canada's enRoute credit
card business.
With it goes a contract to supply the credit cards used by federal
government employees when they travel. Air Canada has been trying to sell
enRoute for more than a year.

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group bidding for Perrier, made clear yesterday it
would not be prevented from buying shares in the French mineral water group
during the European Commission's four-month investigation into the bid.
The Swiss company expects to launch its FFr15.46bn (Dollars 2.76bn) bid
officially in the next few days. Technically, the merger will be suspended
during the EC's investigation, announced two days ago, but Nestle is allowed
to go ahead with the public offer.
Under EC rules, the group will be unable to exercise the voting rights
attached to any Perrier shares it buys, except to 'maintain the full value'
of its investment.
If the Commission decides the bid is anti-competitive, it can ask Nestle to
unwind the merger. However, it seems more likely that Brussels will try to
amend the deal - for example, by asking Nestle to sell some mineral water
brands.
Since new rules came into force in September 1990, the Commission has only
once outlawed a merger - the Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the
Canadian aircraft maker - and has never quashed a public offer.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Varity slides into red on
USDollars 108m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARITY, the international farm and industrial machinery group, suffered a 12
per cent drop in sales last year. After a special USDollars 108m
restructuring charge, it posted a net loss of Dollars 178m, or Dollars 7.87
a share. This compares with a profit of Dollars 94.4m, or Dollars 2.77 a
share, in fiscal 1991.
Varity's biggest markets were hit by the recession. Overall sales were
Dollars 3.2bn for the year ended January 31 1992, against Dollars 3.6bn in
fiscal 1991. Farm equipment sales were down 19 per cent and diesel engine
sales fell 15 per cent.
Vehicle components, accounting for nearly half the business, dipped 7 per
cent.
In the final quarter, after the restructuring charge, Varity's loss was
Dollars 115.3m, or Dollars 4.80, against net profit of Dollars 19.1m, or 56
cents. Sales were Dollars 899m, against Dollars 896m.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman, said Varity's restructuring was aimed at improving
operating performance in fiscal 1993 'whether or not there is an economic
recovery'. Worldwide payroll will be cut by 1,300, or 7 per cent, to lower
operating costs by Dollars 45m. Varity has reduced manpower by nearly 3,000
already since 1989.
The job cuts will take Dollars 40m of the special charge, while Dollars 68m
comprises non-cash writedowns for future asset sales. Over the next 18
months, Varity hopes to raise up to Dollars 175m from asset sales, to be
applied to debt.
Varity sees moderate improvement in some sectors this year, and overall
operating results should be substantially better.
The Kelsey-Hayes vehicle component subsidiary had operating income of
Dollars 106m in fiscal 1992, against Dollars 135m.
Perkins was badly hit by the UK recession and operating income was Dollars
35m, against Dollars 61m. Demand will continue to be sluggish, but Perkins
will benefit from a 10-year engine supply pact with Caterpillar of the US,
worth an estimated Dollars 1bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY investors and analysts are concerned that the financial
difficulties of Olympia &amp; York Developments may exacerbate the slump in the
North American property market.
The prospect of O&amp;Y buildings being put up for sale as part of its financial
restructuring has led Canadian institutions to delay decisions on property
investments, according to one Toronto property consultant.
The company's financial problems are expected to encourage existing and new
tenants to bargain more aggressively for inducements in O&amp;Y buildings.
O&amp;Y is the largest office landlord in Manhattan and central Toronto. It is
also a big landlord in Calgary and Ottawa.
Property experts say O&amp;Y's problems are likely to most affect Canada, where
there are relatively few institutional investors willing or able to buy
large chunks of real estate. Also, European and Japanese investors have
retreated from the North American market over the past year.
Mr Ross Cowan, analyst at Levesque Beaubien in Toronto, said he expected
that O&amp;Y's bank lenders may end up holding buildings for several years to
avoid flooding the market.
The skittishness of investors was illustrated on Wednesday, when almost
CDollars 2m (USDollars 1.60m) of bonds in First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's
Toronto flagship building, changed hands at a discount of 22 per cent to
face value.

SWIRE PACIFIC, the Hong Kong-based aviation, property and trading group,
announced a 26 per cent increase in net profit in 1991, despite the impact
of the gulf crisis on earnings from its 52 per cent-owned airline, Cathay
Pacific.
Swire, headed by Mr David Gledhill, posted net profit of HKDollars 3.08bn
(USDollars 398m) in 1991, up from HKDollars 2.45bn in 1990. The results were
boosted by a profit estimated at more than HKDollars 200m from the sale of a
bottling factory. But there was a substantial increase in earnings from
rental income and its diversified industrial businesses.
The company said the prospects for 1992 were 'encouraging'. A continuing
demand for air travel, improved contributions from industrial businesses as
a result of a cyclical up-turn and the impact of a rationalisation
programme, and the effects of its enlarged property portfolio should ensure
a similar rate of earnings growth in 1992.
Swire recommended a final dividend of 66 cents per 'A' share and 13.2 cents
per 'B' share, making a total payout of 89 cent and 17.8 cents respectively.
Rental income increased to HKDollars 1.23bn from HKDollars 792m, as a result
of maiden contributions from phase II of its Pacific Place development and
upward rental revisions from phase I.
The group's three hotels in the Pacific Place development continued to lose
money in 1991, but they should benefit from the pick up in tourist arrivals.
Offshore oil and shipping services experienced increased profitability and
on the industrial side, there were improvements from Coca-Cola bottling
operations and former loss-maker Swire Technologies, a semi-conductor
company.
The group's net asset value increased to HKDollars 34.84bn, following a
HKDollars 4.87bn increase in the estimated value of its property portfolio.

Whampoa profit

<TEXT>
PROBLEMS with Husky Oil, a Canadian oil and gas producer, forced Hutchison
Whampoa, the large Hong Kong trading company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing,
to announce a 5 per cent fall in after-tax profits yesterday to HKDollars
3.3bn (USDollars 426.4m) in 1991 from HKDollars 3.5bn in 1990.
Hutchison took an above-the-line write off of HKDollars 763m - its share of
a provision Husky, of which it owns 49 per cent, has made for the fall in
the value of its oil and gas reserves. Last week, Cavendish International, a
Hutchison subsidiary, made a provision of HKDollars 462m for its share of
Husky's write-off.
Mr Simon Murray, managing director of Hutchison, said it was too early to
say when Husky would improve, but he did not expect any in the short-term.
If oil and gas prices did not rise 'then we will have to take another look
at it.'
Mr Murray scotched rumours of an imminent rights issue, saying there were no
plans to have one this year. He said the company was financially strong and
had no need of an issue to fund existing operations.
The Husky write-off took the shine away from what analysts described as a
very impressive underlying growth in profits from Hutchison's businesses,
especially those in Hong Kong. Operating profit was up 15.5 per cent and, if
the write-off was added back to pre-tax earnings, they would have shown an
18.8 per cent improvement, they said.
Looking ahead, Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said the continued strength of the
Hong Kong property market, increased container traffic, and general growth
with in the colony's economy due to its proximity to China, should all
benefit the company's operations.
The directors declared a final dividend of 48 cents, which makes a total for
the year of 68 cents - up 4.5 per cent on 1990.
Mr Li said that the company's property interests continued to make good
contributions to profit in 1991. The property division benefited from the
continued strong demand in Hong Kong for medium-sized residential units.
Record growth was achieved in its container terminal operations through its
60 per cent subsidiary, Hongkong International Terminals (HIT). HIT handled
2.5m 20ft equivalent units (TEUs) through Kwai Chung container port. 'Future
growth will be enhanced by the formation of a partnership with the China
Ocean Shipping Company (Cosco) to develop half of the new Terminal 8 and
Kwai Chung,' he said.
The acquisition of Felixstowe Port, the biggest container port in the UK,
was ahead of planned targets, Mr Murray said.
Hutchison Telecommunications will shortly be launching its telepoint (CT2)
business in the UK. This venture, of which it owns 65 per cent, has and will
require large investment and that spending reduced profits from the
telecommunications group last year.
In terms of capital spending, Mr Murray said about Pounds 800m would be
spent on CT2 and PCN (personal communications network) over the nest four to
five years. Hutchison's share of that will be about Pounds 500m. He
anticipated profit to flow from CT2 in two to three years and from PCN in
about five years.
Mr Li said while the initial operating losses in the start up phase of the
telecommunications businesses overseas will erode profits from the cellular
and paging businesses in Hong Kong, the potential of the company would be
realised in the long term.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Cheung Kong pays more as
earnings surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEUNG KONG, the property development vehicle of Hong Kong's richest man, Mr
Li Ka-shing, yesterday posted a 50 per cent jump in 1991 net earnings to
HKDollars 4.88bn (USDollars 630.5m) from HKDollars 3.25bn in 1990, writes
Simon Holberton.
Mr Li announced a final dividend of 51 cents which, with the interim of 17
cents, makes 68 cents for the year - a rise of 42 per cent over 1990.
Cheung Kong's results, though not unexpected, underline the strength of Hong
Kong's residential property market and the profits of companies exposed to
it.
Mr Li said in his chairman's statement that in 1992 the area of buildings
completed was the largest ever and that, in a rising market, the group's
profits rose very sharply.
He warned that Cheung Kong was likely to produce in 1992 a lower growth in
earnings than that achieved last year.
The great proportion of the buildings expected to be completed this year
have already been pre-sold.
Mr Li said that the confluence of low interest rates and relatively high
inflation had prompted the public to invest in property to safeguard the
value of their savings.
'This new trend in property buying and the fact that the supply of
residential land and buildings is not sufficient have caused the steep rise
in the prices of residential buildings in the second half of 1991,' he said.
'Demand for such buildings is expected to remain strong and the market will
continue to be active in the foreseeable future.'
Mr Li added that the group would continue to identify various investment
opportunities and would continue to enlarge its land bank - both in order to
lay a good foundation for future growth.

<TEXT>
THE CLAL group, Israel's biggest publicly-traded industrial group, almost
doubled net profits in 1991 to Shk81.6m (Dollars 35.8m) from Shk42m the year
before, mainly due to a big surge in profits in its core holding, Clal
Industries.
Consolidated sales in the sprawling group, which encompasses electronics,
textiles, construction and insurance among its interests, rose to Shk2.5bn
from Shk2.36bn. Return on capital rose to 9.5 per cent from 5 per cent.
Strong performances by Clal electronics subsidiaries, which include Scitex
and ECI Telecom, two of Israel's fastest-growing companies, played a large
part in the increased profitability. There were also benefits from Israel's
immigration-fuelled construction boom and the associated acceleration in
infrastructure building.
The 75 per cent-owned Clal Industries, which includes the electronics
companies, had a net profit of Shk146m, against Shk53m in 1990.
At the group level, one-time revenues of Shk44m from the sale of shares in
Scitex, ECI Telecom and Electra were offset by Shk47m costs incurred in the
reorganisation of Clal's real estate business and some of its high-tech
activities.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Jardine Strategic issue surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JARDINE Strategic, the investment holding company of the Jardine Matheson
group, yesterday surprised the market when it said it was considering a
Euro-convertible preference share issue.
The company released no details of the proposed issue but said, if it
proceeds, the funds would be used to strengthen its balance sheet and
provide funds for further investment.
Analysts were taken by surprise because Jardine Strategic only last July
moved to convert compulsorily the remainder of a convertible preference
issue it floated in 1989. That issue raised USDollars 200m and analysts
expect Jardine to raise a similar amount this time around.
Earlier in the day, Jardine Strategic directors had declined to comment on
talk in the Hong Kong stock market that it was about to make a rights issue.
Rumours of a rights issue earlier knocked 50 cents off the shares.
Speculation concerning rights issues by various blue-chip companies have
swept the Hong Kong market during the current financial results reporting
season.
The Euro-convertible preference share issue announcement came with annual
results for the company which showed a 9.5 per cent growth in net earnings
to USDollars 233.2m from USDollars 212.9m.
Mr Henry Keswick, the chairman, said the companies in which Jardine
Strategic has an interest were financially strong and were well placed to
take advantage of dynamic growth prospects in the Asia-Pacific region.
'While it is too early to make any forecasts for the current year, the
underlying businesses have made and encouraging start and the longer term
prospects for Jardine Strategic remain excellent,' he said.
Directors declared a final dividend of US cents 7 a share which, together
with the interim of US cents 3.5 makes a total of US cents 10.5 - 163 per
cent higher than in 1990.

<TEXT>
BANK Austria, Austria's largest bank, yesterday announced a 13 per cent
decline in 1991 operating profits and a charge of Sch7.5bn (Dollars 640.5m)
against earnings, mostly to cover losses from foreign loans.
Mr Alfons Haiden, chairman, traced the earnings drop to the costs of last
year's merger between Landerbank and Zentralsparkasse, which led to the
creation of the bank. He also cited a weak Austrian stock market and growing
competition in the Austrian financial sector.
Operating profit fell to Sch3.31bn from Sch3.88bn in 1990, the year before
the merger. Partial operating profit, which does not include trading income,
declined 9 per cent to Sch2.06bn from Sch2.25bn. The dividend is being held
at 14 per cent.
The bank's biggest headache was the disastrous investments made by the US
and UK branches of the old Landerbank. For 1991, Bank Austria had to take
charges of Sch700m for troubled loans in the US and Sch2bn for those in the
UK. The acquisition of the UK leasing company Soverign generated a deficit
of Sch1.2bn.

PLANS to create a new Swedish savings bank group would go ahead, despite
concern about the huge losses incurred by one of the 11 banks due to form
the enterprise, bankers said yesterday.
News that Forsta Sparbanken, a savings bank with business interests
concentrated in the Stockholm and Gothenburg regions, had suffered a loss of
SKr5.48bn (Dollars 908.7m) in 1991 came as a shock to the banking community.
Forsta's credit losses amounted to SKr5.7bn, equivalent to 11 per cent of
the bank's total loan portfolio.
Government officials are currently discussing the future of Forsta
Sparbanken with senior management of the new savings bank group, which will
be called Sparbanken Sverige and which hopes to be listed on the Stockholm
bourse.
Two of Sweden's commercial banks - Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska
Handelsbanken - said that some of Forsta's retail customers had started to
transfer funds to them. Mr Tommy Lindell, Forsta's executive vice-president,
admitted some customers were shifting funds, but said there had not been a
run on deposits.
The government has tried to restore confidence in the troubled bank by
saying none of the depositors will lose their money.

CREDIT Commercial de France, one of the largest private-sector French banks,
yesterday announced a 17 per cent increase in net profits on a comparable
basis to FFr917m in 1991 from FFr813m the previous year.
Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman, cited a 'prudent policy on credit' as one of
the chief reasons for the profits increase.
The board proposed raising the dividend from FFr3.5 a share in 1990 to
FFr3.8 the previous year.
CCF - together with other French banking groups - has been hit by an
increase in corporate bad debts, particularly in the computer sector and
among small businesses, although it suffered less than its competitors from
defaults on consumer loans.
The group has been taking steps to improve efficiency by scrutinising costs
 -the increase in general costs was held to 2 per cent last year  - and by
more stringent control of credit provision.
The bank, whose activities are divided equally between commercial and
investment banking, managed to hold its risk provisions at FFr1.15bn, which
is roughly the same level as in the previous year, 'despite the
deteriorating economic situation', said Mr Pebereau.
In 1990, CCF was forced to implement a steep increase in provisions for
customers' defaults, although it did manage to shrink its country risk
provisions.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AEROSPATIALE, the French state-owned aircraft and missile group, yesterday
reported a sharp swing into profit, but warned that the outlook was
worrying.
The group made a FFr213m (Dollars 37.7m) net profit last year, against a
FFr396m loss in 1990, on sales up 16 per cent to FFr48.6bn. The rise was led
by an increase in deliveries by Airbus, the European aircraft consortium of
which Aerospatiale is a leading partner.
However, the French group's orders had fallen 50 per cent to FFr35bn, said
Mr Henri Martre, the chairman. Orders now stand at just over
two-and-a-half-years' work.
Orders were affected 'by the atmosphere of crisis which has dominated the
market all year, the fall in air traffic, company losses, the general
economic slowdown and budgetary restrictions which have brought about the
greatest caution among buyers,' he said.
Aerospatiale's experience is in line with the gloomy outlook for rest of the
French aerospace industry. According to Gifas, the industry's trade body,
the French aerospace industry's overall order book fell 30 per cent to
FFr235bn last year, reflecting a decline in both military and commercial
orders. Gifas expects sales to fall 25 per cent in real terms by 1995, with
heavy reductions in the number of people working in the sector, currently
118,300.
Mr Martre said Aerospatiale had aircraft orders for three to four years,
depending on whether clients confirmed options, but the outlook was 'more
worrying' for the helicopter and missiles divisions.
Aerospatiale last year pooled its helicopter business with MBB of Germany.

to SFr1.28bn
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIBA-GEIGY, the largest Swiss chemical group, yesterday reported 1991
post-tax profits up 24 per cent to SFr1.28bn (Dollars 847.6m) from
SFr1.033bn the previous year.
The performance was described as outstanding by Dr Alex Krauer, president
and managing director.
The outlook remained bright, said Dr Krauer. Both the agriculture and
pharmaceuticals operations had made very healthy progress during the first
two months of 1992. Currency had been highly favourable for the first
quarter of 1992, although this was unlikely to continue throughout the year.
During the last two months there had been no sign of improvement in the
demand for industrial products, except in the US, where there were some
signs of recovery.
Last year, the healthcare divisions increased sales 10 per cent in local
currencies, while agricultural sales increased 18 per cent. Operating
profits in the divisions were respectively up 20 per cent to SFr1.25bn and
15 per cent to SFr507m.
Sales at the industrial divisions were 4 per cent down in local currencies,
while operating results improved 44 per cent in Swiss francs to SFr349m.
Group turnover increased 7 per cent to SFr21bn, from SFr19.7bn, although
sales were helped by a strong dollar. On a currency adjusted basis, sales
growth was 5 per cent.
Dr Krauer also announced proposals to split shares and bearer participation
certificates on a five-for-one basis.
The company is to issue one new registered share for every 25 old shares of
any capital unit category. The company said it expected the price to be
equivalent to about two-thirds of the share price at time of issue.
Net earnings of Sandoz, another Basle-based pharmaceutical and chemical
group, jumped 15 per cent in 1991 to SFr1.1bn on sales up 9 per cent to
SFr13.4bn.
The dividend is increasing 17 per cent to SFr35 per share and participation
certificate.
The group said dynamic growth and strict cost control had contributed to the
improved profit performance. Excluding currency gains, the sales increase
was 7 per cent.

<TEXT>
MR Soren Gyll, who is to take over as chief executive of Volvo, the Swedish
car and truck group, was named yesterday as the new chairman of Procordia,
the Swedish pharmaceuticals and food group which wants to merge with Volvo.
Mr Jan Ekberg has been named to succeed Mr Gyll as president and chief
executive of Procordia with effect from May 13. Mr Ekberg is currently head
of Procordia's pharmaceuticals business, Kabi Pharmacia.
Volvo will put forward Mr Gyll's name at its annual shareholders' meeting on
May 12 as the successor to Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the present chairman of
Procordia (who is also chairman of Volvo).
Both Mr Gyll and Mr Ekberg are understood to be strongly in favour of
merging Procordia with Volvo.
Sweden's business community was surprised by the latest round of management
changes because it was still not certain that the proposed SKr38.7bn
(Dollars 6.4bn) merger between Volvo and Procordia would go ahead.
The Swedish government, which has a 42.7 per cent voting stake in Procordia,
blocked the original merger plan in January on the grounds that the terms
were not attractive enough and that the deal did not make sound industrial
sense.
Volvo also has a 42.7 per cent voting stake in Procordia.
However, talks are still taking place between Volvo and the government
concerning Procordia's future.
Whatever the outcome of those talks, Mr Gyll is due to take up his position
as chief executive of Volvo in the middle of May.
Mr Gyll, who has been chief executive at Procordia since 1984, is credited
with masterminding the turnround in the group's fortunes by concentrating on
the food and pharmaceutical sectors.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Booker turns in marginal advance to Pounds
103.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKER, the food group which spans breeding to distribution, barely
increased profits in 1991 and saw earnings per share drop 13.4 per cent as
the recession and dilution from the acquisition of Fitch Lovell in 1990 had
their effect.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 103.9m (Pounds 102.9m) and earnings were 36.3p
(41.9p).
However, Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive, said the year had seen the
group become sharper and more focused and debt had been reduced. Booker is
increasing its final dividend to 14.25p (14p) to give a total of 21.75p
(21.25p).
Group sales were 12.4 per cent higher at Pounds 3.29bn and operating profits
rose 2.6 per cent to Pounds 122.8m. Higher interest charges of Pounds 18.9m
(Pounds 16.8m) reflected the extra debt from the Fitch purchase.
The tax rate rose to 23.5 per cent (22.1 per cent). Extraordinary gains of
Pounds 2m (Pounds 28.7m) were mainly profits less losses on disposals and
closures.
Pre-tax profits from food distribution were 17.5 per cent higher at Pounds
57.8m, on sales 12.1 per cent ahead at Pounds 2.61bn, helped by Fitch.
Bad debt provisions had trebled to Pounds 4.5m.
Agribusiness profits fell 10 per cent to Pounds 21.6m but the fish and
prepared foods side grew from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 17.1m.
Profits from health products fell from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 6.8m, while
other activities lost Pounds 2.8m (profit Pounds 8.7m) mainly because it
includes a Pounds 9m increase in the central interest charge.
Disposals raised Pounds 64.7m and a further Pounds 20m is expected from the
sale of P Leiner, the US health products business. Net debt was cut from
Pounds 199.3m to Pounds 138.2m, gearing of 76 per cent.
COMMENT
There is no denying that Booker is a much tighter company than it was 10
years ago when its divisional list included shipping, engineering and rum.
And what it has left ought to provide good growth opportunities. But Booker
has often promised more than it has delivered, and niggling problems, like
turkeys, salmon and mushrooms, keep appearing. Profit forecasts for the
current year are about where they started last year before repeated
downgradings. On a forecast of Pounds 115m the prospective p/e is under 11
and the yield with a maintained dividend is 6.7 per cent. The rating is
cautious.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLEYARD GROUP, the motor distributor, dipped into reserves to pay a
maintained and uncovered dividend despite a 70 per cent tumble to Pounds
1.81m in pre-tax profits for 1991.
Mr Paul Chambers, finance director, said the group had held the 5.2p final -
which maintains the total at 7.8p - in light of the 'medium term prospects
for the industry and the company . . . Everything is in good shape, the only
thing we are lacking is volume.'
However, trading continued to be difficult with any benefits from changes in
car tax still some way off. 'People are waiting until the election is out of
the way,' he said.
The group suffered an unusually severe second half, recording profits of
just Pounds 294,000 in the second six months. Ian Skelly, the Audi/VW dealer
purchased in 1989, had suffered supply problems, and sharply lower sales.
Skelly broke even in the year, said Mr Chambers.
Group turnover fell 18 per cent to Pounds 390m. A net exceptional gain of
Pounds 1.1m eased the decline in operating profits which fell from Pounds
11.4m to Pounds 5.8m.
Mr Chambers said the group had taken action to cut costs and had managed to
maintain car margins.
Sales of new cars had fallen by about 21 per cent and of used cars by 12 per
cent. Commercial vehicle sales declined by 30 per cent.
Appleyard sold its remaining two Ford franchises for Pounds 2m, a book loss
of Pounds 300,000. The remaining 41 dealerships were all in good shape, he
said.
The group had also taken its first steps towards multi-franchising by moving
one of its new Nissan dealerships to a Skelly site. This would help to
recover some of the fixed costs of the large site, despite the downturn in
sales.
Net debt was reduced from Pounds 16m to Pounds 14m, although gearing
remained unchanged at 46 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 8.7p to 2.5p.

Bad debts in its printing industry supply side left pre-tax profits at

The bad debt charge increased from Pounds 256,000 to Pounds 847,000.
Turnover for 1991 increased to Pounds 53.4m (Pounds 42.5m) mainly resulting
from the acquisition of PS&amp;E in November 1990. The Lancashire-based company,
which also makes metal powders, said that the economic climate was making
business difficult but it expected to make progress this year.
Earnings per share were 20.5p (30.4p) but a maintained final dividend of 10p
is proposed for an unchanged total of 16.3p.
Gearing increased from 43 per cent to 50 per cent at the year end resulting
from the purchase of PCO towards the end of the year.

Pounds 6.24m (Pounds 8.2m).
Mr Tony Craven-Walker, chief executive, said that the company had enjoyed
considerable exploration success, increasing oil reserves last year by 50
per cent to some 120m barrels.
The company said it would continue its policy of not paying a dividend in
order to conserve capital to invest in its substantial oil and gas fields.
Turnover was Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 33.4m).

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Seafield Resources achieves Pounds 136,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seafield Resources, the oil and gas exploration company which obtained a USM
quote in December, reported net profits of Pounds 136,000 for the 15 months
to December 31.
For the year to September 30 1990 there were losses of Pounds 8,000.
Earnings per share amounted to 0.6p (0.1p losses).
The company said that the exploration portfolio was enhanced by the addition
of interests in five UK 12th round licences plus acreage offshore in
Australia and Tunisia.
In August the acquisition of a 5 per cent stake in the Victor gas field was
completed and the group's share of production provided cash flow and tax
shelter for its activities.
Turnover was Pounds 5.41m (Pounds 1,000) and the pre-tax result Pounds
256,000 (Pounds 38,000).

<TEXT>
Bostrom, the vehicle seating and specialist engineering group, saw pre-tax
profits for 1991 dive from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 830,000 on turnover down
from Pounds 35.2m to Pounds 33.3m.
Directors said that for the second successive year many of the markets
served by its three divisions, KAB Seating, KAB Pressings and Specialist
Engineering, contracted.
Hardest hit by the recession has been specialist engineering where the
majority of work is sub-contracted from larger manufacturers, primarily
around the Midlands.
The total dividend is maintained at 6p with a proposed final of 3.5p.
Earnings per share were 6.4p against 24.8p.

Burford Holdings, the property and publishing group, lifted pre-tax profits
by 30 per cent, from Pounds 2.65m to Pounds 3.45m, in 1991.
Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said the success of the property acquisition
programme had resulted in a 5 per cent increase to 52.5p in net asset value

The property side contributed Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 2.33m) but publishing
profits fell from Pounds 637,000 to Pounds 493,000. Holding company losses
were reduced to Pounds 223,000 (Pounds 319,000).
Turnover improved to Pounds 9.84m (Pounds 8.99m). Earnings per share rose
from 1.5p to 1.8p and the dividend is lifted to 0.95p (0.85p) with a

<TEXT>
BEAUFORD, a designer and manufacturer of materials handling equipment and
machine tools, saw a sharp downturn in its fortunes in 1991 with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4.54m being turned into a Pounds 2.1m loss.
Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman, said that recessionary trading conditions
experienced in the first half of 1991 deepened for the remainder of the
year, adversely affecting every part of the engineering and ceramics
businesses.
While there were no signs that the overall market conditions were changing
for the better, Sir Trevor said that the company had seen some improvement
in the order intake.
Turnover was 18 per cent down at Pounds 50.7m (Pounds 61.5m); an operating
profit of Pounds 1.53m compared with Pounds 6.55m in the previous year.
Losses per share were 24.2p, against earnings of 17.1p. The final dividend
is passed making 1.85p for the year - the 1990 total was 6.07p.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help boost Jeyes to over
Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HELPED BY acquisitions, Jeyes Group, the Norfolk-based manufacturer of
cleaning and hygiene products, lifted pre-tax profits by 17 per cent, from
Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 4.18m, in the 12 months to December 28 1991.
At the same time, the group announced the acquisition of the Quickies and
All Fresh brands from SmithKline Beecham, the international pharmaceuticals
company.
Both are brands of moist wipes, one of Jeyes' core product categories.
The consideration is a minimum Pounds 1.5m cash, together with Pounds
100,000 for the manufacturing equipment and stock.
Of the purchase price, Pounds 250,000 is deferred until January 1993 and
further consideration of up to Pounds 200,000 will become payable dependent
on sales performance.
In 1991 Jeyes' UK consumer business achieved an 8 per cent growth rate in
sales 'despite difficult market conditions'.
There was, however, a 60 per cent increase in exports, with the launch into
Japan and the Middle East contributing to the growth in the division.
Group turnover and operating profits both improved 19 per cent - to Pounds
61.8m (Pounds 51.8m) and Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 4.14m) respectively.
Crowner Products, which makes cleaning and hygiene products for the
industrial market, was acquired in February 1991, and Sweden-based Rufus
Forpackings, which makes impregnated wipes, was bought in November.
Net interest took more at Pounds 745,000 (Pounds 579,000).
The directors recommended raising the final dividend to 3.8p (3.2p) for a
total of 6.4p (5.4p), payable from earnings of 19.6p (16.3p) per share.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Debt trading lifts Morgan Grenfell to
Pounds 56m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE into trading the debt of lesser-developed countries helped pre-tax
profits at Morgan Grenfell, the London-based merchant bank owned by Deutsche
Bank, advance by 21 per cent last year to Pounds 56.5m.
This reversed the bank's profits decline in 1990, leaving it with a return
on capital of about 15 per cent after transfers to general provisions.
The figure was struck before taking account of Morgan Grenfell's
compensation payment to Argyll, the supermarkets group, arising out of its
role in advising Guinness during the battle for control of Distillers in
1986.
The payment, believed to be Pounds 5m, was treated as an exceptional charge.
Morgan's improvement last year was due to a strong performance from its
banking division, with all three areas - treasury, asset trading and project
finance - performing well, said Mr Michael Dobson, group chief executive.
The bank moved into debt trading only at the tail end of 1990, and 1991
represented the first full year's contribution from this activity.
Last year it traded more than Dollars 22bn worth of debt, making it the
fourth most active in the world, the bank said.
The bank's treasury division is also believed to have performed strongly.
Morgan said it had make only small specific provisions to cover bad debts
during the year, although it refused to disclose the size.
It expanded the size of its loan book to take advantage of better lending
margins, said Mr Dobson.
By contrast, Morgan's traditional corporate finance business remained in the
doldrums, while fund management advanced on the back of stronger markets.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pittard Garnar progress continues with
Pounds 2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PITTARD GARNAR, the leather company, continued its progress in the second
half and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m for the year to December
31.
This compared with losses of Pounds 5.75m last time and with profits of
Pounds 1.04m at the interim stage.
Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said the advance had been achieved in a
worsening market, and against this background the outcome could be regarded
as reasonably creditable.
Turnover declined by 23 per cent, from Pounds 128.3m to Pounds 98m. The
reduction in sales volumes reflected poor retail demand in the US and UK,
coupled with the imposition by the company of tight credit controls.
Sales in the gloving division were maintained throughout the year, though
margins were somewhat lower, he said. The clothing and chamois division had
another extremely difficult year.
By contrast, the shoe and leather goods side showed a modest improvement.
After continuing losses at the Odell Wilson &amp; Tilt tannery, the company
decided to withdraw from this business, and Pounds 1.5m of this year's
extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.8m represented a provision for the costs of
this withdrawal.
However, Mr Macdonald added, borrowings had been reduced to Pounds 17.4m at
the year end, cutting gearing by 12 percentage points to 55 per cent. The
net interest charge fell from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 2.2m.
Earnings per share came out at 6.4p (25.3p losses) and the company is
returning to the dividend list with a proposed 1.5p final.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: US offshoot wipes out profits at Kalamazoo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALAMAZOO, the computer services and printed systems group, saw half yearly
pre-tax profits wiped out by losses at a US subsidiary, which has been sold.
But the company earned enough at the attributable level to pay shareholders
a slightly increased interim dividend.
The group incurred a loss of Pounds 212,000 in the six months to January 31,
against profits of Pounds 1.03m last time. But if discontinued activities
are stripped out of the overall figures, there was a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 860,000, slightly down on the Pounds 939,000 of the comparable
period.
In January, the group disposed of Great American Software which, in the
previous six months, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.07m. The disposal
resulted in an extraordinary gain of Pounds 720,000 which both covered the
net loss for the half year and led to attributable profits of Pounds
224,000. From this Pounds 200,000 is being taken to fund an interim dividend
of 0.525p (0.5p).
Mr Peter Harrop, chairman, noted that with the exception of a New Zealand
company, which is for sale, the disposal of Great American Software
signified the final unscrambling of an unsuccessful diversification
programme undertaken by previous management. Henceforth, Kalamazoo would
expand in Europe but only in its core business areas.
The group will next announce figures for the eight months to end-March 1992;
it is changing its year end from July 31 to March 31.

</HEADLINE>

The severity of the continued decline in construction activity was reflected
in the sharp drop in profits for the 1991 year at Sheffield Insulations
Group.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 1.5m although turnover rose
from Pounds 127m to Pounds 132m with price deflation also placing margins
under pressure.
The group supplies insulation products and services for energy conservation.
It has increased its market share through acquisition and new business
development but gross margins fell and costs rose mainly as a result of the
integration and development of the acquisitions.
Mr Norman Adsetts, chairman, said he did not believe that market demand
would change significantly in 1992.
Although not fully covered by earnings of 3.7p per share, compared with
15.6p, the dividend total is unchanged at 5.4p with a proposed final of
3.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lopex, the marketing and communications group, was forced into the red in
1991 after a Pounds 1.28m exceptional charge for redundancy costs.
Pre-tax losses came to Pounds 398,000, compared with profits of Pounds 4.93m
last time. Before the exceptional, profits would have been Pounds 883,000.
Lord Marsh, chairman, blamed the recession and the consequent decline in
trading activity for the downturn. He said the austere 1990s had left 'many
companies dressed in a very tight corset', adding that all of the group's
businesses had been adversely affected.
Turnover declined to Pounds 206.6m (Pounds 242.7m),leaving revenue down at
Pounds 58.7m (Pounds 73.6m). Trading profits were sharply reduced to Pounds
2.38m (Pounds 6.67m).
However, Lopex has largely eliminated its borrowings: in June 1990 they were
Pounds 24m.
Losses per share were 4.76p (earnings 9.17p) and shareholders will receive
no payment for the year (4p) with the passing of the final dividend (1.1p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOUSTEAD, the specialist manufacturing, technical services and distribution
company, fell into the red in the second half of 1991.
Full year pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 5.21m to Pounds 886,000 following
interim profits of Pounds 1.04m.
Sir Thomas Macpherson, chairman, blamed the difficult economic conditions,
particularly in the UK.
At the same time the company announced the sale by Bousteadco Singapore, its
64.5 per cent owned offshoot, of its shipping and hose coupling
manufacturing businesses to a Malaysian group. In aggregate the result was
an extraordinary gain to Boustead of about Pounds 600,000 and a reduction on
borrowings of Pounds 1.3m which would have cut year end gearing to about 60
per cent.
A breakdown of the pre-tax figure showed lower results in all sectors. The
worst outcomes were in manufacturing, which fell from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds
124,000, and in transmission products distribution with a loss of Pounds
716,000 against profits of Pounds 27,000.
With earnings of 0.6p (4.2p) a lower final dividend of 0.35p makes a total
of 0.7p (1.65p).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 2.63 credit) left the loss
for the year at Pounds 1.7m, (Pounds 4.33m profit).

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Margins squeezed as Wm Morrison rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM MORRISON Supermark-ets, the Bradford-based grocery chain, reported a 25
per cent increase in annual profits as it surged through the current
turbulence in the UK food retailing market.
The company recorded one of the strongest sales performances in the sector
as it raised sales from same-store space by 7.8 per cent, helping to lift
pre-tax profits for the year to February 1 from Pounds 50.3m to Pounds
62.6m.
However, trading margins suffered as a result of the company's insistence on
keeping prices competitive, slipping from 6.3 per cent to 6.1 per cent. Mr
Martin Ackroyd, finance director, said: 'In this marketplace something has
got to give.'
Turnover expanded 23 per cent to Pounds 1.12bn as the company benefited from
four store openings and a strong contribution from subsidiary companies.
Six new stores will open this year taking the total to 59. The company also
outlined an ambitious expansion programme for the following year with a
further seven stores planned. This will largely be funded by the proceeds of
its Pounds 98m rights issue last November.
Net interest payable was reduced from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds 3.78m. Fully
diluted earnings per share rose by 22 per cent to 18.49p.
Directors said that in the light of the results they would increase the
dividend by more than envisaged at the time of the rights issue.
A final of 1.6p brings the total to 2p (1.55p), an increase of 29 per cent.
The shares responded strongly to the profits increase and a proposed 2-for-1
scrip issue, climbing by 15p to 328p.
COMMENT
Morrison's gritty no-nonsense approach to food retailing certainly chimes
with the mood of the times and was rewarded with a strong gain in profits.
Although eye-catching, the slippage in margin resulted from a planned
squeeze on prices in order to remain fully competitive and is not in itself
a cause for alarm. Indeed, the strategy seems to have worked well as
turnover kicked ahead and the company gained impressive improvements in
volume sales against a near-static industry average. This year, analysts
suggest pre-tax profits may move ahead to Pounds 83m putting the shares on a
prospective multiple of a shade over 14. The market is saying there is a
sound future for the best-run regional grocer in spite of the ever-growing
power of the leading groups. The share price is likely to perform
resiliently but will be held in check by the adverse sentiment that still
prevails towards the sector.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Burmah Castrol static at Pounds 165m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURMAH CASTROL, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, yesterday
announced virtually unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 165.5m, compared
with Pounds 164.9m , for the year 1991. Turnover showed a rise from Pounds
1.72bn to Pounds 2.35bn
The result, achieved against a background of depressed world markets and
adverse currency translation, were above expectations and the shares
advanced 41p to 523p.
The dividend is raised by 4 per cent. The market was also relieved that the
company had finally disposed of surplus assets from Foseco, the speciality
chemicals company which it bought for Pounds 260m at the end of 1990.
Earlier this week Burmah sold Foseco's ceramics, abrasives and diamond
products businesses for Pounds 44m. The price was well below what Burmah had
hoped for at the time of the acquisition, but the group's shares had fallen
as low as 464p in December when fears grew that no disposal would be
possible in the current market conditions.
The group's core lubricants business made record trading profits and
expanded its market share despite depressed world markets.
Mr Lawrence Uquhart, chairman, said he was 'pleased, but not smug' about the
results. He also detected the 'first glimmerings' of a recovery in consumer
demand in the US.
Of group turnover the Foseco companies contributed Pounds 520m. Underlying
growth was 4 per cent.
The company said that the initial Foseco acquisition costs and increase in
overseas profits increased tax by Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 77.3m, lifting the
effective tax rate from 37 per cent to 47 per cent.
Earnings per share fell by 19 per cent to 42.6p (52.9p). A final dividend of
15.5p (14.5p) gives a total for the year of 24p (23p).
Mr Lawrence said he was still confident that Foseco had been bought at a
good price, but said his group had underestimated the effect of the
recession.
In the event, Foseco had diluted the enlarged group's earnings by about 6.5p
per share, about double the degree of dilution he had expected at the time
of the acquisition.
Burmah said it had decided to dispose of its 64 per cent interest in
Pakistan Petroleum and other downstream companies there after failing to get
a better gas price agreement with the Pakistan government, which owns 30 per
cent of the company.
Burmah had written down the book value of these assets to costs by an
extraordinary provision of Pounds 31.4m. The company said it hoped the
disposals would raise between Pounds 20m-Pounds 40m.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: APV shares slip 8p as profits fall to
Pounds 30.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in APV fell by 8p to 108p yesterday after the food manufacturing
equipment maker reported a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds
30.8m in the year to December 31.
Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said orders in the second half of 1991 did not
repeat the sharp decline experienced in the corresponding period of 1990, so
the full-year order intake last year was about 5 per cent higher than in
1990.
However, a bunching of orders towards the year-end meant the group was
unlikely to achieve the same level of profit in the first half of this year
as it did in 1991, when pre-tax profits were Pounds 14.5m.
Overall APV said it entered 1992 with an order book 15 per cent above the
level a year earlier, and indications so far were that the overall order
intake was broadly in line with that experienced at the same time last year.
Turnover last year grew by 5.8 per cent to Pounds 874.4m, while earnings per
share were 23 per cent down at 6.9p (9p). An unchanged final dividend of
3.4p is proposed maintaining the total at 5.4p. Gearing rose slightly from
40.4 per cent to 42.1 per cent.
APV makes more than 80 per cent of its sales overseas and said that
continuing recession in the UK, US and Australia, along with signs of a
slowdown in Germany, had not encouraged investment. While the food and
beverage sector was resilient, the prevailing economic environment meant
there was a tendency to defer capital expenditure.
Last year APV's return on sales margin fell from 5.8 per cent to 4.7 per
cent.
Over tha past two years, APV has shed about 1,800 jobs worldwide, and the
group said further action would be taken to reduce operating costs where
necessary. Restructuring costs of Pounds 8.9m were offset by the release of
a fair value provision of Pounds 5.9m, leading to a net extraordinary charge
of Pounds 3m.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Calor advances 16% to Pounds 45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLD winter of 1990 was good news for Calor Group, the bottled gas
company, which yesterday unveiled a near-16 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 45m for 1991.
The result, was struck after exceptional reorganisation costs of Pounds 7.2m
(Pounds 6.5m). Turnover was 10 per cent higher at Pounds 362.2m. The
increase in sales was partly due to higher gas prices during the year.
Mr Hamish Macpherson, group treasurer, warned that the milder conditions of
this winter did not bode well for the group. 'From the weather point of view
we are more pessimistic than last year.'
A proposed maintained final dividend of 6p makes an unchanged 12p total.
Calor had indicated at the interim stage that it planned to build up
retained earnings for investment purposes.
Earnings per share rose from 15.5p to 18.1p.
During the year, margins came under pressure as Calor cut prices to maintain
its market position. Mr Macpherson said that margins continued to decline,
especially given the milder winter this year.
The cold weather early last year had given a 'leg up' to bottled gas, which
has been in long-term decline for several years. Gas tonnage overall had
increased by 5 per cent.
Forays into central Europe, through the Pam Gas project in conjunction with
SHV, Calor's 44 per cent shareholder, had had a 'reasonable' start, Mr
Macpherson said.
The restructuring programme continued, with 200 jobs cut already in the
current year. The final stage was due for completion in 1992, and would
result in a 'considerable' exceptional cost.
Strong cash flow had helped to cut debt by Pounds 20m to Pounds 20.1m, with
gearing of 11 per cent.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Slough Estates hit by property market but
maintains dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS of the property market left 1991 pre-tax profits of Slough
Estates, which has a bias to industrial property, down from Pounds 86.4m to
Pounds 68.3m before exceptional costs of Pounds 36.7m against Pounds 63.8m.
However, the group proposes a maintained final dividend of 7.15p, giving a
slightly higher total of 11.55p (11.35p).
Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman and chief executive, said that though the dividend
was not covered by earnings per share of 8p (8.1p) it reflected 'our
continuing confidence in the future prospects of the group'. He expected
1992 earnings to be sufficient to cover a maintained dividend.
Net assets per share, diluted, fell from 375p to 331p. The shares, up 1p
yesterday at 177p, stand on a 46.5 per cent discount to the asset value.
Sir Nigel said that 1991 had proved even more difficult than 1990, which at
the time had been the worst property market he could remember.
He said that oversupply of property would 'restrict new speculative
development for some years ahead' and that banks were reluctant to lend on
new schemes. This would hasten the absorption of existing vacant space.
The group's industrial bias and low exposure to central London office
properties had helped the portfolio, he said.
Operating income fell from Pounds 118m to Pounds 109m because of an absence
of property trading profits which contributed Pounds 11.4m in 1990. Net
interest took Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 24.5m). The exceptional costs related to
write-downs of trading properties and other provisions.
Net debt fell from Pounds 825m to Pounds 739m, helped by last April's Pounds
138m rights issue, while shareholders funds rose to Pounds 1.1bn (Pounds
1.08bn).
COMMENT
After the horrors of the last two years it should be safe to assume that
Slough's asset value will stick at about the 330p level this year. A
discount of approaching 50 per cent makes the shares look cheap against the
sector. Further, the implied promise of a held dividend gives an
attractive-looking yield of 8.7 per cent. And the shares have been rotten
performers in recent months. So why did the shares give up all but a penny
of early gains yesterday? The debate is over capitalised interest - expected
to add about Pounds 40m to profits in 1992 which should reach Pounds 60m to
Pounds 65m - without which the dividend will not be covered. In such a
gloomy environment it would be brave to take the less conservative view.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Productivity gains help Spear rise 81%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved manufacturing productivity and lower interest, down from Pounds
Pounds 517,000 to Pounds 371,000, helped JW Spear &amp; Sons, the toys and games
maker, to achieve an 81 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds
1.4m to Pounds 2.53m, for 1991.
Mr Michael Bucher, managing director, said the 20 per cent rise in turnover
to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 22.8m) benefited from a considerable increase in
sales to continental Europe.
Earnings per share advanced to 32.3p (17.9p) and the proposed final dividend
of 8p brings the total to 10p (8p).

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Restructure behind 40% fall at Bunzl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REORGANISATION costs dealt a heavy blow to profits at Bunzl, the paper and
packaging group which has been struggling to repair the damage of an
acquisitive binge in the 1980s. The pre-tax return fell by 40 per cent to
Pounds 31.7m, after exceptional items.
The final dividend is cut from 3.3p to 2.2p, for a total of 4p (5.9p), just
covered. Earnings per shares were hit by a higher tax rate and fell from
7.4p to 4.1p.
Mr Tony Habgood, chief executive, said Bunzl had now unwrapped all of its
peripheral or loss-making activities and was ready to make progress with its
core businesses.
The cost of reorganising the core businesses resulted in a much higher than
expected exceptional charge of Pounds 12.9m. This was trimmed back, however,
by an exceptional gain of Pounds 4.2m on the sale of a laser instrumentation
business, involved in cigarette and filter making.
COMMENT
Bunzl has a steep hill to climb, although under Tony Habgood it has made
encouraging progress. Not least in the decision to make accounting practices
on disposals much clearer than in recent years, resulting in the sharp jump
in interest payments from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 9.3m. The jury is still out,
however, on the potential of the remaining businesses, which combine
distribution and manufacturing. Forecasts are for Pounds 45m, hopefully
without exceptionals, and a prospective p/e of about 12. The shares are
likely to advance in the short term, fuelled by those happy to see a
determined management. But in the medium to long term, the current premium
of 10 per cent looks unjustified.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Tootal helps Coats Viyella lift profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID integration by Coats Viyella, the textiles company, of Tootal, the
rival acquired last May after an acrimonious takeover battle, has helped
Coats improve 1991 pre-tax profits by 10 per cent to Pounds 111.4m.
However, net borrowings at the year end jumped to Pounds 264m from Pounds
91.4m, largely as a result of the acquisition.
The performance of Tootal enhanced earnings slightly. Market shares in
thread, Tootal's largest business, also improved.
'We waited a long time to get Tootal. It has been a good merger,' said Sir
David Alliance, chairman.
Coats has changed its accounting practices to conform to new and proposed
accounting rules. It restated its 1990 figures as if they had followed the
same rules as used in the 1991 figures. Extraordinary costs of Pounds 3.6m
in 1990 were restated as exceptional costs, depressing some 1990 figures.
Earnings per share in 1991 were 10.4p, compared with 8.9p on a restated
basis but 9.6p as published a year ago.
The dividend is maintained at 7p for the whole year. The shares rose 9p to
189p.
Thread, Coats' biggest operation, saw both turnover and margins improve. The
addition of Tootal doubled the industrial thread business and contributed to
sales for the whole thread operation of Pounds 840m, up from Pounds 729m,
with margins improving from 7.9 to 8.7 per cent.
Fashion retailing, including the Jaeger and Viyella brands, suffered badly.
'We went for sales at the expense of margin,' said Mr Neville Bain, the
chief executive. Margins fell from 7 per cent in 1990 to 2.9 per cent.
Branded menswear, including Van Heusen shirts, had a bad year. However,
improvements elsewhere, such as in uniforms during the Gulf war and hosiery,
pushed clothing turnover to Pounds 350.5m, from Pounds 300.5m, at a margin
of 4.8 per cent, up from 4.6 per cent.
Sales of homewares such as Youghal carpets and Dorma bedware were flat.
Sales in the Dynacast precision engineering operation fell to Pounds 104.7,
from Pounds 111.7m, because of a poor performance in Brazil and the weakness
of the North American car industry.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Buoyant sales leave Wellcome 35% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharma-ceuticals group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits
up 34.8 per cent from Pounds 181m to Pounds 244m for the six months to
February 29.
Mr John Robb, chief executive, said the past two years' results were as near
outstanding as any he had achieved with any company.
Turnover at the prescription and consumer healthcare businesses reached
Pounds 812m for the first six months, an increase of 27 per cent. Sales at
non-continuing and other businesses were Pounds 79m, bringing the group's
turnover to Pounds 891m compared with Pounds 731m.
Exchange rate movements increased sales by 6 per cent and pre-tax profits by
11 per cent, said Mr John Precious, finance director. He warned, however,
that exchange rate benefits were unlikely to be as significant during the
second six months. The tax charge was also likely to increase for the full
year by 1 percentage point to 37.5 per cent.
Sales of Zovirax, the herpes and chicken-pox drug, were up 34 per cent to
Pounds 278m. Those for Retrovir, the Aids treatment, rose 31 per cent to
Pounds 103m.
The strong dollar helped the figures, but underlying growth for the two
products was 26 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. Profits from other
patented products increased from Pounds 77m to Pounds 87m.
Price increases, mainly in the US, represented only 3 per cent of underlying
sales growth of 21 per cent at the pharmaceutical operations.
Sales of consumer health products rose 32 per cent from Pounds 94m to Pounds
125m. Mr Robb said he viewed long-term growth of this business as one of the
group's strategic aims.
Operating margins improved 2.4 points to 26.7 per cent. Mr Robb said a
margin of 30 per cent was a realistic objective but declined to say when it
might be achieved. The improvement so far had been achieved through the
disposal of low-margin businesses, a continued drive on costs and a change
in sales mix to higher margin products. Cost of sales fell from 24.8 per
cent of turnover to 22.6 per cent.
The sale of the environmental health and diagnostic businesses resulted in a
net loss of Pounds 42m, said Mr Precious.
Research and development spending increased 23 per cent from Pounds 103m to
Pounds 127m, or 18 per cent at constant exchange rates. Earnings per share
increased 33 per cent to 17.5p against 13.2p. The dividend was 4p, an
increase from 3p.

FT  27 MAR 92 / O&amp;Y debt shake-up may take two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reorganisation of Olympia and York's Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.5bn) debt
is likely to take two years because of the complex structure of the Canadian
property developer, according to an executive with close knowledge of O&amp;Y.
This emerged yesterday as bankers flew to Toronto for their first meeting
since O&amp;Y admitted last weekend that it was suffering from a 'liquidity
crisis'.
O&amp;Y has called a meeting of its 20 biggest bank lenders, which will take
place today. The purpose of the meeting is to agree a process for
reorganising the debt, totalling more than Dollars 20bn, and elect a
steering committee, to represent all of O&amp;Y's more than 100 banks.
The co-chairmen of the committee are expected to include Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, Citicorp, and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
CIBC is understood to have the biggest exposure, more than Dollars 1bn, to
O&amp;Y. Bankers said that the second biggest lender, with around Dollars 750m
of loans, is Royal Bank of Canada, followed by Citicorp, with Dollars 500m.
Hongkong Bank's exposure is thought to be comparable to Citicorp's.
Other big lenders are understood to include Credit Lyonnais, the French
bank, with Dollars 350m, Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal,
with Dollars 300m each, and Chemical Bank of the US with Dollars 200m.
In the UK, Barclays' exposure to O&amp;Y's UK properties, principally the Canary
Wharf development in east London, is thought to be around Dollars 100m.
However, its overall exposure to the group is believed to be much bigger.
O&amp;Y is moving fast to reassure lenders to the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf
project - Europe's biggest new property development has had its prospects
damaged by the UK property recession.
Mr Tom Johnson, who was appointed to oversee the financial restructuring
early this week as new president of Olympia and York Property Developments,
O&amp;Y's main operating subsidiary, is scheduled to arrive in London on Sunday
night to hold talks with lenders.
Canary Wharf has Pounds 700m of debt, consisting of a Pounds 490m facility
from 11 banks - led by Credit Suisse and Lloyds - Pounds 100m from the
European Investment Bank and a Pounds 52m emergency short-term loan provided
last week by a group of banks led by Barclays and Lloyds.

Mr Tiny Rowland has never been one to let public opinion influence his
friendships with maverick leaders of obscure African countries. But even by
his standards, the Pounds 177m issue of shares in Metropole Hotels to
Libya's official investment agency is peculiarly insensitive. Although the
deal suggests Metropole is in the books at a realistic value, it is
difficult to imagine that the remaining two-thirds of the business will ever
attract another buyer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thanks partly to higher circulation at the Sunday Express, United Newspapers
looks well placed for economic recovery. Pre-tax profit of Pounds 85m was at
the top end of expectations. The dividend is well covered. Interest cover is
over three times, including payments on the preference shares. Capital
spending will rise by Pounds 19m this year, but there would still be scope
to maintain the dividend without higher borrowing. Recovery should boost
advertising, though it might be 1993 before this feeds through to the
lucrative classified sector.
Were this the whole story, a yield of 7.5 per cent would leave the shares
attractive even after yesterday's rise of nearly 4 per cent. The trouble is
that prospects would look different if recovery were thwarted by higher
interest rates after the election. No surprise, then, that the Daily Express
is working so hard for the Tories.

FT  27 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 35 per cent increase in Wellcome's interim profits seems tailor-made to
impress ahead of the looming placement by the Wellcome Trust. Admittedly the
profits would have risen only 24 per cent at constant exchange rates, and
currency rates will be a drag on results for the balance of the year. But
the picture is still robust. The underlying growth of sales in continuing
businesses was 21 per cent, of which only 3 per cent came from price
increases.
That should not only stand Wellcome in good stead as health budgets come
under pressure in the industrial world. It also confirms the company's
growth credentials ahead of the placement. The risks attached to this
enterprise are still considerable, though they are pretty much outside the
company's control. US investors could become disenchanted with
pharmaceutical stocks as the recovery gathers pace. UK investors could go on
a buying strike if they are unhappy with post-election prospects for the
equity market.
A remaining preoccupation is Wellcome's rating relative to the rest of the
sector. To attract sufficient interest, Wellcome will need an edge over the
likes of Glaxo. That edge was non-existent when the placement was first
announced, because Wellcome's scarcity value put it on a much higher
earnings multiple. By yesterday the gap had narrowed. Indeed, looking ahead
to 1993, both companies are now on a similar multiple in the low 20s.
Arguably Wellcome has somewhat stronger growth potential, not least because
there is still room for higher margins. So the rating relationship is
probably about right. The rest depends on the popularity of the sector as a
whole.

FT  27 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Burmah Castrol
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 8.5 per cent jump in Burmah Castrol's shares tended to obscure
the fact that the market was rather vexed at the group's annual results. Six
months ago, Burmah was determinedly talking down expectations. Investors
were only too willing to listen, not least because the takeover of Foseco in
late 1990, while grudgingly accepted in strategic terms, was looking
ill-timed as its traditional markets were hit by recession.
In the event, Foseco had a resilient second half. The Pounds 44m sale this
week of its ceramics and abrasives business eased worries that Burmah would
be left warehousing a set of rapidly diminishing assets. Castrol managed a
record year despite lower worldwide demand for lubricants, confirming
Burmah's ability to make the most of the brand. And the company has
continued to sharpen its focus, notably by putting its numerous oil and gas
interests in Pakistan up for sale.
The question is whether the re-rating should go further. There are grounds
for caution in the short term. The group has an unenviable tax problem and,
treating its convertible as debt, gearing of 64 per cent. But even after
yesterday's adjustment, the shares are on an undemanding prospective
multiple of 11. If Burmah performs as well in recovery as it has in
recession, its shares will deserve a premium rating. Investors tempted to
buy will doubtless concede the sense of doing so sooner rather than later.

FT  27 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: New yarn from Coats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella has a well-deserved reputation for squeezing cash out of
textiles; it has not been everyone's first choice in the past for a
financial reporting award. Even recognising the need to explain how Tootal
has been integrated and the forthcoming requirements of the Accounting
Standards Board, however, the quality and sheer volume of information
backing up the 1991 results merit at least a commendation. The Coats charm
offensive still has some way to go to convince City sceptics; other
companies pondering the limits of disclosure might reflect on yesterday's 5
per cent jump in the shares.
Eyebrows will still be raised, of course, by the Pounds 88m of fair value
adjustments and integration provisions. The figure is high in relation to
expectations, but, to be fair to Coats, can probably be reconciled with the
dreadful performance of the fabrics division. In any case the way existing
provisions have been scrupulously reversed into an extraordinary 1991 gain
should inspire confidence that Coats would not resort to any acquisition
accounting sleights of hand.
The main message from yesterday's figures is that even in a prolonged
recession Tootal was a sound buy. The feared loss of thread market share,
for example, has not materialised and savings look to be coming through as
planned. The balance sheet is a bit stretched by Coats' historic standards,
but given the strong cash flow from continuing operations gearing should
fall fairly quickly. That said, the shares may be held back by short-term
political uncertainties and doubts about the profits momentum in 1993.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Hands off the sumo wrestler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL BLAMIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that the Samoan wrestler Konishiki is set to become yet
another cause celebre in the absurd skirmishing between Japan and the US
('US and Japan tussle over gentle giant from Hawaii', March 24). If the US
senate does intend using Konishiki as a battering ram (for what, one may
wonder), then it could usefully bear in mind one point that your
correspondent, too, has overlooked.
It is not disputed that some of those who govern sumo are nervous about a
foreigner becoming yokozuna - in much the same way that people didn't like
Kerry Packer's cricket. Whether these people are called purists or racists
is a separate argument. However, the factors for promotion in sumo, in
addition to the qualities of technique and character that your correspondent
mentions (and admits that Konishiki lacks to a degree), include a clear
guideline - that he win two consecutive tournaments, or achieve the same
score as the eventual winner (this isn't as daft as it sounds). Konishiki
has failed thus far to do either.
Sumo's governing body has to deal with a number of problems in the sport,
including the consequences of recently promoting several wrestlers to
yokozuna who then failed miserably. They are keen to avoid this mistake
again. Whatever the 'racist' views of the popular press in Japan, Konishiki
will or won't become yokozuna in much the same way that all his Japanese
predecessors have. US government, hands off.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Key election issue is interest rates, not fast tax
footwork
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP BLOWFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The only issue which matters to me in this election is whether interest
rates go up or down. All the fast footwork over marginal tax rates seems
irrelevant when the impact of a 1 or 2 per cent interest rate change is
considered. Yet this is the issue which dares not speak its name; no
politician mentions it, even the retiring Thatcherite gang to whom it once
seemed so important.
This joint political conspiracy to deny debate is a scandalous rigging of
the electoral agenda. Will debate really send the markets into a spin or,
even worse, direct the new bank to Frankfurt? Meanwhile, we Britons
sacrifice our prosperity on behalf of eastern Germany. There they aspire to
a better lifestyle while here we contrive to constrain our own.
Is there not one politician prepared to break a vow of silence over the ERM
orthodoxy. What price are we expected to pay for 'convergence'? With real
interest rates at 8 per cent or more the political consensus is for a
deflation far exceeding the Pounds 2.3bn palliatives all parties claim will
lift recession.
I suppose we can look forward to a time when, with our industry completely
destroyed, we may benefit from EC Regional Aid swollen with the
contributions from prosperous East Germany]
What are the gains from unnecessary high interest rates and artificial
exchange rates? The politicians have fled both from reality and the
consequences of explaining all to the electorate, guided, I suspect, by the
same Treasury bureaucrats who have shown such skill in managing the soft
landing of our own economy.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Faults in an Irish model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES HAZELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having farmed and run a small data-processing business in the Irish
Republic, and more recently attempted to sell abroad the services of an
indigenous manufacturing operation which was a model of efficiency, I have
to take issue with Anthony Harris's comments about the country ('An Irish
model for Britain', March 23).
The balance of trade does look good, but about 80 per cent of the non-food
exports come from international companies employing transfer pricing in the
European Community's most favoured tax haven. Of the food exports the
largest item is cola concentrate produced by another international company
and employing a few hundred people.
The remaining luckless indigenous Irish industry has to be super-efficient
to overcome the currency hurdle imposed by the European Monetary System.
This improbable task is not encouraged by the highest personnel tax regime
in Europe which in turn is compounded by the cost of the highest national
debt per capita in the world. Little wonder that unemployment is at 20 per
cent, and this after a continuous stream of some 20,000-30,000 young
educated people leave the country each year.
If this is 'a model of how ERM disciplines are supposed to work', then God
help us.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Land values and clean-up costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr D C HOCKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Hunt's article, 'Erasing the black marks' (March 25), referred to
the minister for the environment's recent announcement to defer compilation
of the public register of potentially contaminated land. He dwelt upon the
concern, expressed widely by land-owners and their professional advisers, of
planning blight.
In an active land-dealing market an owner of industrial land featuring in
the prospective register might have to offer a discount to a potential
purchaser, if, in the absence of any detailed site investigation, his
consultants are unable to assess the risk that the site may attract and
estimate the costs of clean up.
I would argue that these discounts apply to all industrial land today, in
advance of the opening of any register. The problem of discounting will
become more apparent when the land market is restored: contaminated sites
for which there are no survey data will be further devalued, and sites which
have either been treated (even though they may remain on a future register)
or simply surveyed allowing quantification of the problems and costs a
developer may face, are likely to attract a premium.
These issues need to be addressed urgently, regardless of the administrative
details of implementation of Section 143 of the Environmental Protection Act
of 1990.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Shrink-wrapped words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slowly, day by day, the Conservatives' confidence is slipping away. They
still speak of victory, but with faltering voice.
The second week of the election campaign has been no kinder to them than the
first. The reckoning is the same. The contest was timed to coincide with the
depths of a prolonged recession. The Budget misfired. The manifesto made
little impact. The prime minister's quiet charm is an asset, but his
apparent lack of forcefulness as a public speaker is not. Thus for the
Tories the balance sheet of the first fortnight makes grim reading. Their
strategy is flawed; their tactics inept; their leader disappointing. What
they need to lift their spirits is a convincing turnaround in this weekend's
crop of opinion polls.
It is a slim chance, but it could happen. That is why the Conservatives have
not yet cracked. They do not feel that they are certain to lose. The scores
registered in the polling that took place yesterday and continues today and
perhaps tomorrow will be important. The results, when we see them, just
might indicate that Tuesday night's celebrated Labour political broadcast on
the National Health Service, featuring a little girl in pain, has done the
opposition more harm than good.
That, at any rate, is the Tories' hope. On Wednesday, the row about the
degree to which the film accurately represented the true facts of an
individual case was belatedly recognised by Conservative central office as
an opportunity. Led by Mr John Major, the senior figures in the
administration drew adjectives out of a hat and pelted them across the
airwaves at Mr Neil Kinnock. The hunt was on.
The expectation was that the Conservative tabloids would come to the aid of
the party. They did. Their hounds were set the task of catching Mr Kinnock
and tearing him to pieces. Until this week Labour's rose pimpernel had led
them a merry dance. Now the Tories dreamed, he would be caught, exposed as
unfit to govern. Their initial strategy was based on the anticipation of a
big event, a grievous error by their opponents, an electrifying issue -
something that could enable them to impugn the character and judgment of Mr
Kinnock. Perhaps this was it.
Perhaps it was. Nobody can yet tell for sure. We are all slaves to Mori,
Gallup, NOP, ICM and the other witchdoctors of the modern electoral process.
This weekend they will test the conventional wisdom, which is that bickering
over details of who said what merely bemuses the average voter. What is more
to the point is that when prominence is given to allegations that the health
service is 'underfunded', or 'two-tier' or otherwise imperfect, Labour
benefits. It always has. I expect the same to happen this time.
Meanwhile, I see no reason to anticipate any significant change of voting
intention in either direction. For most of this year, the two larger parties
have been running neck-and-neck. That suggests a hung parliament. During the
past fortnight, Labour has edged ahead by one or two percentage points. That
suggests that it might be the largest party in such a parliament. There are
other possibilities. Individual polls stimulate widely different
conclusions. Some award an overall majority to the Conservatives one day
and, on the following day, a result near to that for Labour. But the moving
averages tell a duller, more credible tale. In sum, it is: Tories 39 per
cent, Labour 40-41 per cent; both holding.
If that pattern sticks for the next fortnight it should put Mr Kinnock into
Number 10 Downing Street. I say 'should' rather than 'will' because this is
a funny old election. A movement of a fraction of a percentage point in the
overall share of votes cast could result in the Conservatives being the
largest party. A differential swing in the regions, or the key marginals,
could achieve the same result.
The Tories, who only a couple of years ago were serenely confident of their
invincibility, are thus reduced to clawing for fractions, fighting for a
draw. They have to move fast to erode Labour's distinct lead, and a whole
lot further to recapture the extra three or four percentage points that
would give them an overall majority. They have been expecting signs that
some of the necessary succour will come from Liberal Democrats who would
rather vote Tory than endure a Labour government. Even that hope begins to
fade.
Meanwhile, there are plenty of real questions facing the electorate. Just
how is growth to be resumed? What chance is there for either public spending
or tax cuts while the public sector borrowing requirement heads for the
stratosphere? These are not being debated with any sense of rationality.
Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism is not an election
issue. The environment has been sidetracked.
Our politicians are offering us nothing but shrink-wrapped words. On today's
figures, no party is set for an overall majority. They all deserve to lose.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Have fare, will travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the passenger, one of the most disturbing aspects of bus deregulation is
the sense of disorder it brings to an industry which should have safety as
its top priority, writes Richard Tomkins. Talk to anyone about buses in
Merthyr Tydfil and, chances are, an initial outburst about chaos will be
followed by the words: 'One day, somebody's going to get killed.'
The large numbers of competing buses mix uncomfortably with pedestrians in
the town centre bus station, and in the narrow streets outside it, stop
wherever they see a would-be passenger. Many of the vehicles look decrepit;
others are painted in the liveries of companies from which they have been
borrowed or bought, so it is difficult to identify who is operating them.
Smoking on the buses is notionally banned, but no one seems to take much
notice.
On a positive note, competition has brought huge increases in bus frequency
to some areas. Trefechan, an outlying village of 400 homes, used to be
served by two buses an hour: now, it has 20. But on some routes, operators
simply duplicate each other's timings so overall frequency is the same. And
in Merthyr and surrounding areas buses are a rare sight after 6.30pm on
weekdays or any time on Sundays.
Some welcome the changes. For bus-spotters, Merthyr is paradise. 'I've never
taken so many pictures in half an hour,' gasped one camera-toting spotter
between snaps.
The FT's correspondent, too, was a beneficiary of deregulation. With a
little over an hour to go before his return train from Cardiff to London, he
sought advice at the tourist office on which would be the next bus from
Merthyr to Cardiff station. The hapless assistant pointed to a sea of
timetables from half a dozen operators, shuffled half-heartedly through a
few of them, and confessed she could not tell.
Help, however, was at hand in the bus station. An employee of one operator
said his company's next bus would not get to Cardiff until well after the
train had gone. Then, leaning forward and jabbing a finger towards a
single-decker a few paces away, he murmured: 'I shouldn't be telling you
this, but that's a Cardiff bus.'
The aged vehicle bore no visible clues as to its ownership or destination.
The only occupant was the driver, slumped disconsolately over the steering
wheel. He sat up, opened the doors and asked: 'Cardiff?'
'Yes. But I've got to be there for the 3.25pm train to London. What time are
you going?'
Peering out at the empty bus shelter and gazing back round the empty bus, he
shrugged his shoulders and replied: 'Now?'
The suggestion eagerly greeted, he exchanged Pounds 2 for a ticket, started
the engine, rammed the bus into gear, and roared off down the Taff Vale to
the accompaniment of a thousand rattles.
One ear-splitting, bone-shaking hour later, the bus groaned into the
terminal outside Cardiff station with minutes to spare before the train's
departure. The driver looked pleased with himself. 'I didn't think we'd make
it, to be honest,' he said. 'This thing's not supposed to do more than
45mph.'
During the whole of the 24-mile journey, the 52-seat bus had only picked up
one other fare-paying passenger - a woman with two infants. The fares paid
would not even have covered the cost of the fuel consumed. There was nobody
waiting for the journey back.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Trouble in Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Canadian property developer, made a fortune in the 1970s
by turning a derelict area at the base of Manhattan into the hugely
successful World Financial Centre. In trying to repeat the trick in London's
Docklands O &amp; Y has hit trouble.
Much of O &amp; Y's colossal office development at Canary Wharf is unlet and the
developers are discussing their difficulties with about 200 banks. The
question is what, if anything, should be done to influence the outcome in
the wider interests of the capital.
The problem is not simply one of hubris and bankerly excess. Docklands, the
largest urban redevelopment project in Europe, came into being because
London's political institutions had failed. It was the chronic inertia of
local Labour-run boroughs that led Mrs Thatcher's first government to set up
a special development zone in the abandoned docks.
As the project progressed, mistrust between central government and Labour
local authorities became all out war, culminating in the abolition of the
Greater London Council in 1986.
It is hardly surprising that in these circumstances, relations between the
development corporation and neighbouring Labour boroughs deteriorated or
that strategic planners were ignored. The consequence was a catastrophe of
infrastructure provision; Docklands lacks effective road and rail links to
the nearby city. Only belatedly were plans laid to build new roads and to
extend London Transport's Jubilee Line through Docklands. An immediate
difficulty is that O &amp; Y's promised commitment of Pounds 400m to the Jubilee
Line extension is in doubt.
Relaxed rules
Canary Wharf's prospects were also hurt by the City's relaxation of its
planning rules to allow a further 20m square feet of offices in the Square
Mile. As a result the City has an unprecedented office vacancy rate of 20
per cent and rents on empty office space have halved.
It is tempting to argue that O &amp; Y and the banks should be left to extract
themselves from the mess. Since much of the bank debt was advanced by
Canadian and other foreign banks, O &amp; Y's problems are unlikely to pose a
threat to the stability of the British banking system. Lower office rents
are also a good thing, from the point of view of London's competitiveness as
a financial centre.
That would have been no more than a marginal consideration in the 1980s. But
the City's competitive edge, which used to rest substantially on a light
regulatory touch in wholesale markets, is now under threat as other European
countries deregulate their financial markets. London's financial services
sector may continue to grow through the 1990s, but its share of
international finance will probably decline.
Narrow view
The government, however, cannot afford a narrow view. Docklands, for all its
faults, is crucial to the task of rebuilding east London's economy. This is
desirable in its own right and essential if planning pressures in
overcrowded west London are to be tolerable in the next economic upswing.
Also, if Docklands cannot be made to work, there is no hope at all for the
more ambitious east London corridor project. That project is in turn the key
to connecting London efficiently to the Channel Tunnel, a task which the
government has thus far addressed with dismal lethargy.
Whoever wins the general election will therefore look east from Westminster
and see towering problems. The parties have proposed radically different
blueprints for overhauling London's government: direct rule from Whitehall
by the Conservatives and a new Greater London Authority from Labour. Neither
has clear views on what should happen to the Docklands Development
Corporation when its remit expires in the course of the 1990s.
London desperately needs clear thinking and resolute action on these complex
strategic questions. Meanwhile, the government must ensure that the Jubilee
Line project is safeguarded. The banks will argue that it is not for them to
stump up the cash promised by O &amp; Y. Yet their overriding interest lies in
ensuring that the building finds tenants to fill the 40 per cent of space
that remains unlet. Without that, loans will not be serviced and repaid. On
this, at least, the government can afford to take a hard-nosed line.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Latin America, lost and found
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL IS once more flowing into Latin America. One estimate suggests more
than Dollars 40bn in private capital flooded into the region last year,
three times the 1990 inflow. Although undoubtedly encouraged by low US
interest rates, a main motivation for the returning funds is the
transformation of economic and trade policies in the region.
Latin America now boasts some of the most open trade regimes in the world.
Its governments are seeking, and often succeeding in, reductions in budget
deficits and are shedding the millstone of state-owned industries through
privatisation programmes.
Much of the inflow takes the form of returning flight capital, money sent
abroad in the 1970s and 1980s to shield it from government irresponsibility,
of which a country's own citizens are often the best judges. This pool of
capital, according to the head of the InterAmerican Development Bank,
represents 'the largest savings account in the developing world'.
The region's potential has been enhanced by the Brady plan, the 1989 debt
reduction initiative named after the US Treasury Secretary. The first and
third most indebted nations in the region - Brazil and Argentina - should
soon follow Mexico into a comprehensive Brady accord with commercial bank
lenders. They may reach agreements in principle next month, although the
deals probably will not be completed by the 10th anniversary of Mexico's
announcement on August 12 1982, which marked the start of the region's debt
crisis.
Past crisis
Provided economic reform continues, the accords should allow Argentina and
Brazil to put their debt problems behind them. This is not a foregone
conclusion - and smaller countries are still labouring under excessive debt
 -yet the debt crisis, in the sense of a problem blighting the whole region,
is past.
These improvements mean that the last decade has not been entirely 'lost' as
some have suggested. Gone are most of the morally and financially bankrupt
military regimes that featured in the region a decade ago. The inadequacy of
the old protectionist model of Latin American economic development has also
been laid bare.
Although economic reform still has a long way to go, there is optimism that
what has been done so far has established a basis for sustained gains in
living standards in a good part of the region. But these improvements will
not be sustained simply on the back of economic reform.
Popular support
Indeed, this is the message of the abortive February coup attempt in
Venezuela. President Carlos Andres Perez had moved ahead with certain
aspects of economic reform but had failed in a crucial respect: to secure
popular support for his programme.
Popular support has aided both the Mexican and the Argentine economic reform
programmes. It was lacking in Venezuela partly because the provision of
goods provided by the public sector - health care, education, public
housing, clean water - was deteriorating. At the same time, while most
sectors of the economy were being forced to forego traditional privileges,
politicians were jealously preserving their own.
The Perez government was unable to dispel the aura of corruption of
Venezuelan politics. Since the coup, the president has announced initiatives
to tackle corruption and alter the political and judicial system that foster
it. This is belated but essential.
Mr Perez will not solve his problems by rolling back his economic reform
programme. But in Venezuela, and elsewhere, the programme will only succeed
as part of a series of changes. These should seek to improve the
effectiveness of a social safety net for the poor and increase the
credibility of government institutions.
The aim should be to secure a proper role for government. Government should
not be seen as the source of wealth: rather, it should be trusted as an
arbiter, policeman and provider of public goods. Moving towards that ideal
will not be easy. In some countries, there will be reverses such as that
which almost overtook Venezuela. But rather like old age, difficult as that
is, the alternative is a lot less attractive.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Arts: Lou Reed and Tom Petty - Pop Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Giving concerts is a serious business for Lou Reed nowadays. Notices in the
foyer on Sunday gave warning that latecomers would only be allowed to their
seats between numbers and that Reed would be singing material from just his
last three albums. Any unseemly requests for old favourites, it was
suggested, would not be viewed at all favourably.
From such unpropitious beginnings, however, the evening could only get
better, and Reed came on to give one of the most absorbing and finely judged
of performances.
Since he re-established himself with the abrasive New York in 1989, Reed's
music has gone ever more inward and restrained.
Perhaps the unbuttoned rocker will emerge again one day, but in the meantime
the spare, ironic beauty of the Warhol tribute Songs for Drella, which he
made with John Cale in 1990, has been enhanced in the elegiac tone of his
latest album Magic and Loss, written in the wake of the deaths of two close
friends.
The first half was given over to the Magic and Loss songs. They are shaped
very consciously into a cycle, complete with instrumental prelude and a
reprise before the final number, titles hedged around with subtexts and
lyrics, which for all their moments of black humour portray a struggle to
come to terms with bereavement.
Set against the very best of his recent work - the most self-lacerating of
the Drella songs, the hard-driving 'Dirty Blvd' and 'Strawman' from New York
 -Magic and Loss can seem single-paced and musically underpowered.
Certainly Reed moved up a gear musically in the second half, pulling four
numbers out of Drella, including a spell-binding delivery of 'A Dream', the
deadly accurate parody of Warhol's diary style which turns suddenly from
camp to horror.
In the end, the fans did get something old. Noticeably relaxing through the
second half, Reed even ventured the occasional smile, and offered a set of
encores that included 'Sweet Jane', the mawkish Satellite of Love' and 'Walk
on the Wild Side'.
From any other rock star that would have been a predictable finale, but Reed
has worked so hard at his new beginnings and at remaking his songs that
reviving his best known number was really made to seem like a special
blessing for his faithful and exemplary audience.
* The pleasure in Tom Petty's concert with the ever faithful Heartbreakers
on Monday was much more sporadic. Like Lou Reed, they too are over here on
the back of an album, the pleasant, relaxed Into the Great Wide Open, which
appeared at the end of last year and shows Petty extending his concerns in
social issues and the green movement.
The concert, though, revealed very little more, apart from a deeply
embarrassing taste for whimsy, and a willingness to play up to the adoring
fans in ways that a musician of Petty's honest excellence really does not
need to contemplate.
The best of the new songs were liberally scattered through the running
order, along with recyclings of a good deal of tried and tested old
material.
The sound of the Heartbreakers grows ever more Byrd-like (Petty even
included one of Roger McGuinn's own songs) and the vocal delivery shifts
between the Dylan whine and a thin, effective lyricism. In the end it was
all too protracted and indulgent, fatally sabotaged by the absurd
play-acting in the middle.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Arts: The Dark River/The Dance and the Railroad -
Theatre/Andrew St George
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rodney Ackland (1908-1991) is one of England's forgotten playwrights. He
wrote The Dark River under the shadow of war; it was first performed in 1943
with Peggy Ashcroft in the lead. This production is the play's second
revival at the Orange Tree, Richmond: fine, acute and absorbing theatre,
wonderfully acted and intimately directed.
Ackland set the play in 1937. It tells the complicated story of Catherine, a
former dancer torn between a comfortable past peopled with familiarities and
an edgy new future. She is estranged from her husband, Christopher, and
summers at the Thameside house of her former teacher, Ella; she takes with
her a blousy friend, Gwen, and is followed there by her new lover, Alan, the
official representative of the new future who brings news of Nazism and
Guernica. Throughout the course of the summer, the relationships unfold as
the war looms.
The play stacks the past into unwieldy heaps of baggage that each character
carries around: Ella's son had died at Ypres, and when an itinerant stocking
salesman calls and turns out to be from the same regiment, she takes him
into service; Ella's father, frail and hallucinating, looks back to another
past. The river itself, under suburban pressure from bungalows and road
houses, flows back to an idyllic bygone age; Ella plays Chaminade, swamped
by the noise of overhead planes from a nearby squadron.
Ackland's techniques, finely balanced here between farce and tragedy,
deliver a straight play with a sense of humour. The play's greatest strength
is its emotional knowingness; Ackland made each part substantial by
interweaving its concerns with the others, but the plot turns on improbable
encounters, telling rather than showing. The dialogue has more 'darlings'
and "absolutelys' than a Channel 4 Board meeting, and so the feeling can
seem stilted: 'I think it's absolutely divine, but suppose we want somewhere
gayer?"
The play's central scene, where Catherine, a model of vacillation, tries to
break first with Alan and then Christopher, is a thoughtful metaphor for an
England quavering on the brink of a future but always ready to relax into
the past. Catherine yearns backwards: 'How disappointing summer is . . . I
suppose one is really longing for summers in the past.' Ackland has little
time for this indulgent nostalgia, while recognising the need in others.
Finally, a clock which was stopped at the start of the action is rewound:
time moves on. Alan says: 'Once you've stopped going forward, it becomes a
sort of death.'
Sam Walters' direction is marred by sloppy lighting; the play should be
moodier. The acting everywhere has subtlety and tact. With Stephanie Cole,
mistress of the downcast eye as Ella, Belinda Lang as the febrile Catherine
and Malcolm Sinclair as Alan, the issues of Ackland's sombre text emerge
clearly.
The Dark River reminds one uncannily of Fitzgerald's coda to Gatsby: 'and so
we beat on, boats against the current, ceaselessly born back into the past.'
But this remains a play about Englishness, the old world and not the new.
On May 10 1869, the tracks of the Central Pacific railroad east from
Sacramento connected with the Union Pacific railroad at Promontory Point,
Utah, to form the Transcontinental. It was six years in the making, built by
immigrant labour, first Irish, and then overwhelmingly Chinese recruited
from goldrush California and China. The extraordinary play, The Dance and
the Railroad tells the story of two Chinese railroad workers in 1867; it
puts spoken dialogue alongside Beijing Opera in a compelling juxtaposition.
The Dance comes to The Contact Theatre from Glasgow and Cardiff; it is
written by David Hwang (M. Butterfly) and performed by Singapore's Leling
Beijing Opera Troupe and the Glasgow based TAG Theatre Company. Alan
Lyddiard directs. The result is a strange and beguiling evening's theatre
which informs both the intellect and the senses.
Behind the two principal actors (Tom Yang and Unku), a drama of dance, mime
and colour plays itself out. The stage, divided by black gauzes, opens into
a space in which the 10 Beijing Opera players perform in sumptuous costumes.
The dialogue, not unlike some of Tom Stoppard's scripted exchanges, is
interspersed with interludes of Opera.
Beijing Opera itself is a theatre of simplicity governed by complex rules of
gesture and voice. These remarkable dancers educate one's attention for
detail: the stage is filled and yet one searches for the smallest gesture.
The action runs tangential to the railroad narrative, yet enacts parts of
it: the struggle between man and the unyielding environment, the need for
one's own cultural roots in a foreign land, or the value of stamina,
application and discipline in the face of an overwhelming task.
The Opera interludes include several stock figures of the genre: Guan Gung
the civilian who excels in the martial arts, Madame White Snake, a Goddess
made mortal who falls in love with a human.
These characters appear while one of the railroad workers reveals the
mysteries of the Opera training. ;the novice asks "How long before I can
play Guan Gung?' his teacher replies 'How long before a dog can play the
violin?'

FT  27 MAR 92 / Arts: Man's intuitions and urges laid bare - Manchester
Festival of Expressionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As part of Manchester's recent Festival of Expressionism, a trio of
exhibitions explores the classic period of Expressionism, starting in 1905.
In that year, four young Dresden artists formed Die Brucke, 'the bridge'.
The name came from Nietzsche's rhapsodic preface to Thus Spake Zarathustra:
'Man is a rope, tied between beast and Higher Man - a rope over an abyss. .
. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.'
Life would be perilous for these rebels whose naked swimming-parties and
'fifteen-minute nudes' jettisoned both bourgeois morality and artistic
convention. Indeed, only Ernst Ludwig Kirchner had any formal art training.
Yet why did that matter? In order to regenerate Germany's decadent culture,
art needed to be the pure expression of man's intuitions and physical urges.
At the City Art Gallery The Expressionist Face: 1905-25 is sponsored by
Lufthansa (until 4 May: 061-236-5244). It focuses attention on two key
aspects of Expressionism: print-making and figuration. Despise bourgeois
society though they did, the avant-garde artists needed to eat. Portraiture
found them enlightened patrons, especially among a wealthy Jewish
intelligentsia.
It has been said that whereas the Romantic artist wore his heart on his
sleeve, the Expressionist wore it painted on his chest. Dramatic distortion
of the human face, as in Kirchner's Portrait of Otto Mueller, drew the
viewer immediately into the psyche of the sitter/artist. The shattered
visage of The Wife of Professor Goldstein - married to Kirchner's
psychiatrist - was a map of the soul and also an image of the external
world.
Both the Brucke and the Blaue Reiter in Munich - the circle formed by
Kandinsky and Franz Marc in 1911 - considered print-making to be as
important as painting. Kathe Kollwitz did not paint at all. Her 1908
etching, Battlefield, is an image of human tenderness in the face of
objective tragedy. The print's technical skill (the mother's hand lit up by
the questing beams of the lamp) and its pathos come as a relief among a
surfeit of images of generalised angst.
The Expressionists saw print-making as harking back to the late Gothic
period, a time of Germany's unsurpassed artistic vitality. The crudely
gouged woodcuts of Schmidt-Rottluff, Pechstein and Heckel, also evoked the
much-admired primitivism of African and Pacific carving.
At a deeper level, print-making's Manichean nature was the visual
correlative of the Nietzschean antitheses which marked the Expressionist
outlook. It was a movement characterised by despair and exuberant hope, by a
desire to destroy and to create.
Like it or not, Expressionist prints speak out with a forcefulness that
needs no commentary. How mistaken, therefore, to give each print a banal
commentary. Of a Kollwitz print, for example, we told that it is 'one of the
artist's finest late self-portraits' and, in case we cannot see it, 'eyes
and mouth (are) communicating sadness, but also strength'.
A Schmidt-Rottluff lithograph 'relies for its dramatic strength on the stark
contrast of black and white.' How patronising to think the public need these
crutches. Even more objectionably, the one-room exhibition space resounds to
an hour-long television documentary. Rather than overheard cliches about
Auschwitz, give me piped music any day.
Thank goodness there is no such lunacy at the Whitworth Art Gallery. The
scene switches to Vienna and a perfect match between Arnold Schoenberg:
Paintings and Drawings (until 9 May: 061-273-4865) and, in the adjoining
room, Expressionist Prints by Kokoschka (until 25 April). Kokoschka's
print-making takes us from his delightful coloured images of children's
fairy-stories through the horror of his affair with Alma Mahler, his
war-time sufferings and, finally, to a sense of redemption achieved in his
family portraits.
The Whitworth is the only venue for the international touring exhibition of
Schoenberg. From about 1910-1912 Schoenberg was an amateur but obsessive
painter. Famously, Kandinsky admired Schoenberg's art and music hugely. His
Self Portrait from the Back was shown in the first Blaue Reiter show in
1912. It hangs in the exhibition, together with the long series of
self-portraits, portraits, landscapes, stage-settings, caricatures, and the
visionary series, the Hands and Gazes. The exhibition documents Schoenberg's
suffering with Alma Mahler, his friendships, and his second marriage. More
than this, however, as a group, these paintings possess genuine power. Few
will miss the similarity between Munch's The Scream and Red Gaze, the
best-known of Schoenberg's paintings. However one responds to the message of
an artistic creed which cavalierly dismissed knowledge and skill as mere
'acquired characteristica', Schoenberg's pursuit of an art of the
unconscious achieved something unique and memorable.

Given tonight's BBC1 schedule are you surprised that the BBC's audience

now in its seventh year. Harry And The Hendersons (7.35) is a middling
American import about a family living with a yeti; useful if you are out of
valium.
In Sickness And In Health (8.00) has the single strength of Warren Mitchell
as Alf Garnett, a character who came to our screens 26 years ago. Caught In
The Act (8.30) is a copycat clip show of home video boo-boos, the worst
anywhere. The Nine O'Clock News and politics take us to 10.00 and a couple
of dud American movies. If this is the best the BBC can do they can hardly
expect politicians to champion the licence fee.
The best unrepeated comedy is on C4 which has Cheers, (9.00), the
consistently funny American series about a singles bar, and Whose Line Is It
Anyway?, the improvisation game show (10.30).
The best comedy repeat is Victoria Wood on BBC2 (9.00); and the best drama
Fay Weldon's Growing Rich (9.00 ITV). It is not the greatest series ever,
but there is not much competition.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Technology: Exchanging recipes - How two food industry
suppliers have blended their skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the dust settles on one of last year's biggest takeover controversies,
managers and technologists at two very different suppliers to the food
industry are gingerly beginning to make an omelette without breaking eggs.
More than a year after Tetra Pak, the packaging equipment and materials
group best known for its Tetra Brik brick-shaped carton, announced the
SKr16.25bn (Pounds 1.6bn) takeover of Alfa-Laval, the manufacturer of food,
agricultural and industrial process equipment, the two Swedish companies are
investigating how to make the merger work. 'It is taking off, and it's going
to be very interesting for both companies,' says Jorgen Haglind, Tetra Pak's
communications director.
It is also an unprecedented, and at first glance rather curious situation.
Instead of combining fully, the two companies are remaining separate. Their
relationship is assuming a T-shape, with vertically integrated Tetra Pak
providing the downstroke, and horizontally-integrated Alfa-Laval the
cross-stroke.
In technology terms, the link stands where the two strokes meet, with liquid
food - its processing, packaging and distribution - providing the
connection.
Synergies in that product area are now being examined - Alfa-Laval, for
example, has developed a new process for heat treatment of liquid egg that
could link with Tetra Pak's continued efforts to find new applications for
its cartons.
But the two companies are also looking at possible long-term benefits from
closer links between Alfa-Laval's non-food activities, such as its process
control subsidiary SattControl, and Tetra Pak.
Either way, what is emerging is a technology-led business combination in
which knowledge and skills, rather than corporate entities, are being
merged. Synergies are being discovered at divisional and product development
level rather than imposed from above.
Contacts, inevitably, have been established at board level, and Alfa-Laval's
financial department has been closed down, but the two companies have
avoided the trouble that could easily have plagued a full integration of a
marketing and a manufacturing culture.
The structure, Haglind suggests, might be applicable in other situations
where companies have products that stand in-line in a client's manufacturing
process - Alfa-Laval's process equipment produces liquid food that is then
packaged in Tetra Pak's machines and cartons.
That may prove to be true, but meanwhile there is little doubt that the
unusual structure helped the two companies sidestep an assault from Brussels
that focused on such links. Soon after the takeover was announced in January
last year, the European Commission launched one of the first in-depth
inquiries under its recently introduced rules for large takeovers.
The EC's concern was that competitors either in the food processing or
packaging equipment sector would be disadvantaged if the merged company
offered a package deal including, for example, Alfa-Laval equipment at below
the commercial price. Similarly, competitors could have lost out if Tetra
Pak and Alfa designed equipment that could only be linked to each other's
products.
However, by May last year, the Commission had apparently decided that it had
no authority to make a ruling on the merger because it was neither a
horizontal nor a vertical combination. The two companies had, in any case,
promised not to act anti-competitively.
Even so, Tetra Pak and Alfa-Laval have to develop technology and process
synergies while mindful of the fact that 'we are being watched from
Brussels,' as Bo Wirsen, head of Alfa-Laval's food business, puts it. Both
companies are convinced that they can achieve this in the long-term, even if
the initial steps are tentative.
This month Alfa-Laval begins a series of informal discussions with its
senior managers and sales managers to acquaint them fully with how to
interpret the EC's concerns. 'I don't think it's going to pose a problem,
but equally it's very important that we all understand the implications,'
says Wirsen.
At the same time, two parallel series of discussions have begun between the
two companies. The first links Tetra Pak with different parts of
Alfa-Laval's food business via separate project groups in liquid foods,
convenience foods, ice cream and other areas. The intention says Wirsen, is
that in the medium-term the discussions could produce 'new technological
solutions that give customers a distinct competitive advantage'.
The second initiative involves project groups aiming to find synergies
between Tetra Pak and Alfa-Laval's non-food activities such as control
equipment and heat exchangers, many of which number food equipment among
their applications. Wirsen suggests that Alfa-Laval's strengths outside its
food division may have come as a surprise to Tetra Pak following the
takeover.
The aim of these links is to build on connections between the two companies
that have ebbed and flowed over the past 30 years. Both companies have built
global organisations from one idea - Gustaf de Laval's continuously working
separator invented in 1877 and Ruben Rausing's device to form, fill and seal
packages under the liquid level from a roll of packaging material.
Both companies are also strong in the dairy sector and in aseptic packaging,
and their paths have inevitably crossed on big projects.
For the future, though, the priority for the two companies is to exploit
opportunities arising from sharing knowledge and offer 'integrated
solutions' for a food industry that increasingly wants large processing
plants built for them on a turnkey basis.
Achieving that would seem difficult in two separate companies with their own
marketing departments. But Wirsen maintains it should be easier, now that
the companies have merged, to develop new liquid food technologies or new
approaches to total automation of food processing.
'At the end of the day the engineers and technical people on Alfa-Laval's
food side and Tetra Pak can really make a difference . . . we have a chance
to create something that was not achievable before.' And, if they are
careful, to keep Brussels happy.

Four European science organisations are joining forces to put on Cosmorama,
a touring exhibition which will visit 20 countries over four years from
1993.
'Our aim is to represent in one single exhibition man's present knowledge of
the universe,' says Brian Southworth of Cern, the European Particle Physics
Laboratory, who is chairman of the organising committee.
'We want to show all our delight at the things we already know and all the
mystery of the things we do not yet know.'
Cosmorama will contain large animated displays - Inside the Big Bang, Inside
the Milky Way, Inside the Solar System and Inside the Living Cell - to
represent the work of the four organisations: Cern, ESO (European Southern
Observatory), ESA (European Space Agency) and EMBL (European Molecular
Biology Laboratory).
There will also be operating scientific instruments, including spark
chambers to reveal the cosmic rays irradiating the earth. 'But we are making
the presentation of the laboratories themselves secondary to the overall
scientific aim of the exhibition,' Southworth says.
Nigel Calder, a well-known British science writer, has written the storyline
to knit everything together. Visitors will be directed around the exhibition
in their local language, with Calder's commentary transmitted by infra-red
to individual headsets.
The budget for the exhibition and its touring expenses will be about Pounds
2m, which the organisers hope to raise mainly from corporate sponsors. The
20 host cities will spend an extra Pounds 2.5m to meet local costs.
Cosmorama's tour is scheduled to start at the Heureka Science Centre near
Helsinki in March 1993 and finish in Moscow four years later. Its UK visit -
to Birmingham - will be in mid-1994. Three 13-metre vehicles, nicknamed the
Spacetrain, will move it from city to city.
The exhibition will spend six weeks at each venue and will be updated
continuously to feature new discoveries - for example a comet founded by ESO
astronomers or a genetic discovery at EMBL.
The organisers estimate that 1.5m people will visit the show.

Astronauts on Nasa's space shuttle need to exercise. But often they can't
work out as vigorously as they would like for fear of disturbing sensitive
scientific experiments, writes Ian Holdsworth.
Nasa and Lockheed think they have solved the problem with a new kind of
platform which supports exercise equipment such as a treadmill or rowing
machine yet cancels out any vibrations. The Isolated/Stabilised Exercise
Platform will have its debut in June on the shuttle Columbia.
Astronauts need hard aerobic exercise daily to prevent dizziness when they
return to earth, says Dr Damon Smith, project leader at Lockheed. 'In the
presence of microgravity research such as protein crystal growth, this
amount of activity interferes. It's important that the shuttle astronauts
get the exercise and the experiments be protected.' Lockheed: US, 408 742

and perhaps save the lives of aircraft or helicopter passengers.
Smiths Industries is developing a gas turbine electrostatic engine
monitoring system which will provide pilots or ground crews with up to 100
hours' warning of engine problems.
The system, initially developed by United Technologies' Sikorsky Aircraft
Division and then licensed to Smiths Industries' US aerospace subsidiary,
detects clouds of charged particles caused by abnormal engine conditions in
the exhaust gas stream.
A complementary warning system, particularly useful in helicopters, uses a
radio frequency coil to detect small metallic particles in fluids or in the

FT  27 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Bank funds are unfrozen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLLY PECK INTERNATIONAL LTD v NADIR &amp; OTHERS
Court of Appeal: (Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Stocker
and Lord Justice Scott): March 19 1992
THE FUNDS of a defendant bank against which the plaintiff has only a
speculatively arguable case should not be frozen by Mareva injunction
pending judgment if the effect would be to interfere with the normal course
of its banking business. But where there is a likelihood that the bank may
remove funds to avoid the effect of a possibly adverse judgment, the court
may order it to earmark traceable sums and refrain from dealing with them
than other than in the normal course of business when no other funds are
available.
The Court of Appeal so held when discharging a Mareva injunction granted by
Mr Justice Millett against the Central Bank of the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, as fourth defendant to an action by the administrators of
Polly Peck International plc (PPI) against Mr Asil Nadir, Kibris Endustri
Bankasi Ltd (IBK) and others.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said PPI was the holding company of more than 200
subsidiaries. Mr Nadir was its chief executive.
IBK was a Northern Cyprus bank. It was controlled by Mr Nadir and provided
services for the PPI group. It had few customers, if any, other than members
of the group and Mr Nadir's family.
Central Bank was incorporated in Northern Cyprus in 1983 and had supervisory
and regulatory powers.
Under Northern Cyprus law, every bank operating within the territory must be
authorised by, and hold 20 per cent of its foreign currency reserves with,
Central Bank. IBK maintained an account with Central Bank in Lefkosa.
Both Central Bank and IBK maintained accounts at Midland Bank
International's Cannon Street branch.
In the action, PPI claimed against Mr Nadir and IBK respectively for
misapplication of Pounds 378m and Pounds 142m of its funds. The claim
against Central Bank related to Pounds 44.987m of the Pounds 142m.
From September 1987 to October 1990, IBK transferred Pounds 44.987m from its
own account at Midland to Central Bank's account at Midland, in exchange for
a corresponding sum in Turkish lira or sterling credited to IBK's account
with Central Bank in Lefkosa.
It was common ground that Central Bank assisted in the scheme to the extent
that it received the funds transferred to it by IBK in London, and made the
funds available to IBK in Northern Cyprus.
The administrators contended that Central Bank either had actual knowledge
that the funds were being improperly diverted away from PPI, or that
circumstances put it on inquiry that that was so. The pleaded case against
it was one of constructive trust.
The writ was issued on October 22 1991. Mr Justice Millett
granted an ex parte Mareva injunction within the UK against Central Bank,
limited to Pounds 38.9m.
The order now under appeal was made inter partes. Mr Justice Millett
concluded that PPI had shown an arguable case against Central Bank as
constructive trustee in respect of the Pounds 44m; that there was a real
risk it might remove its funds from the jurisdiction; and that a Mareva
injunction ought to be granted.
A Mareva injunction could never be justified unless a fair arguable case for
liability could be shown. But the strength of the case sufficient to support
the grant of a Mareva injunction was dependant to some extent on the
consequences to the defendant if an injunction were granted, as well as the
consequences to the plaintiff if an injunction were not granted.
PPI's main case was one of constructive trust. It was said that if equitable
tracing rules were applied to the Pounds 44m transferred from the IBK
account to the Central Bank account with Midland, about Pounds 10.7m still
stood to the credit of Central Bank.
It was accepted for present purposes that (i) the transfers of the Pounds
44m were procured by Mr Nadir; (ii) they were not effected for PPI's proper
purposes and represented breaches of Mr Nadir's fiduciary duty to PPI; and
(iii) the breaches of fiduciary duty were dishonest.
For the purposes of the appeal, the court asked itself whether a fair
arguable case had been shown that Central Bank must have realised the funds
were PPI's funds, and must have been suspicious that they were being
misapplied.
Although Central Bank must have known the Pounds 44m was group money or
Nadir money there was no basis on which to infer that it knew or ought to
have known it was PPI money.
Mr Justice Millett thought the circumstances in which the transfers were
made should have made Central Bank suspicious,because of 'the sheer scale of
the payments'.
At the relevant time, Mr Nadir was a man of unblemished commercial
reputation and integrity. Why should Central Bank have suspected impropriety
because of the scale of the transfers?
The case shown by the evidence as it now stood was speculative and depended
for its success upon something emerging that cast suspicion on Central Bank
and its good faith.
As to whether PPI's case ought to be protected by injunction, it was a
general principle that a Mareva injunction ought not to interfere with the
ordinary course of the defendant's business.
That made the grant of a Mareva injunction against a bank very difficult.
A Mareva injunction ought never to prevent a defendant from paying his
creditors their due debts. A bank must repay depositors in accordance with
the terms on which the deposits were held.
Central Bank had no customers other than the authorised banks of Northern
Cyprus. The purpose of requiring them to keep 20 per cent of their foreign
currency holdings with Central Bank was to ensure their foreign currency
liquidity. Roughly 60 per cent of Central Bank's total foreign currency
deposits were held frozen in London.
The injunction had already seriously affected its foreign currency liquidity
and interfered with its normal manner of carrying on business.
To maintain the injunction would be likely to inflict irreparable harm.
The other side must also be taken into account.
If the action against Central Bank succeeded to the extent of the full
Pounds 44m claimed, it would be hopelessly insolvent. Well before judgment,
if there was any likelihood of judgment being adverse, it was likely to have
looked for a safer place for its foreign currency reserves.
It did not follow, however, that the absence of funds in England would
necessarily prevent PPI from enforcing judgment (if obtained). Funds kept in
any of the Brussels Convention countries would be vulnerable to enforcement
procedure.
For two reasons the balance came down against continuance of the Mareva
injunction.
First, PPI's case against Central Bank was no more than speculative.
Second, it was wrong in principle to grant a Mareva injunction so as to
interfere with the normal course of the defendant's business. To impose a
Mareva injunction that would have that effect in order to protect a cause of
action that was no more than speculative was not simply wrong in principle,
but positively unfair.
Central Bank should be required first, to earmark the Pounds 10.7m in a
separate account; and second, should be restrained from dealing with the
earmarked fund otherwise than in the normal course of business and unless
and to the extent that there were no other available funds in England.
The appeal was allowed. Lord Justice Stocker agreed.
LORD DONALDSON MR also agreeing, said the special problem in the case of a
bank was rooted in the fact that its stock in trade was money borrowed from
depositors. Any order which could produce a 'run on the bank' (withdrawals
not replaced by deposits) would be inimical to the purposes for which the
Mareva jurisdiction existed. It was not that a Mareva injunction could never
be granted against a bank, but the circumstances would have to be unusual.
For Central Bank: Philip Heslop QC and Richard Millett (Theodore Goddard).
For the administrators: Robin Potts QC, Leslie Kosmin and Sandra Bristoll
(Alsop Wilkinson).

FT  27 MAR 92 / Management: All change at Barclays, if they can manage IT -
The bank's plan to educate a generation of computer-literate managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joseph De Feo is blunt about what needs to be done at Barclays to forge a
successful partnership between its basic banking business and computer
technology. 'We are re-defining what it is to be a business manager,' says
the bank's American-born director of Information Technology (IT) and
Services Businesses.
The future of banking, he believes, is tied to the successful management of
the computer technology which has come to dominate the financial services
industry. So, he argues, Barclays 'must raise a generation of IT literate
managers who have the fundamental skills to manage this technology and who
are not afraid of it'.
But training is just one of a series of changes Barclays has been
implementing in an attempt to maximise the benefits of IT, and bridge the
chasm between the back-office technicians and the front-line business
managers. These problems are not unique to Barclays, or even the financial
services sector, although Barclays' IT operations are particularly large.
The bank has a worldwide computer staff of 6,000, with 3,200 in the UK
alone, and a total annual IT expenditure of Pounds 1bn.
But in many large organisations, the introduction of computers over the past
25 years has raised issues which are only now beginning to be tackled. As De
Feo himself acknowledges, in the early days IT was regarded as something of
a 'black art,' whose practitioners 'worship at the alter of technology'. In
many organisations the move to computerisation generated tensions and what
De Feo calls 'the tyranny loop'.
This began with a gulf between users and practitioners. The users had
insufficient understanding of IT and became frustrated with the poor quality
of the service, while the experts, who knew little of the business, became
frustrated because the users were unable to articulate their requirements.
Over time, experts became used to directing the way IT would be used and
found it difficult to be more responsive. As a result, the contribution
computers could make to the business was diluted, while the costs continued
to escalate.
Some companies have sought to overcome these problems by adopting a firm,
centralised grip over IT activities.
But De Feo argues that such an approach is 'extremely difficult' in complex
organisations like Barclays where line business managers have a high degree
of autonomy.
Instead, Barclays has adopted a new approach which includes devolving some
computer functions into the main business areas of the bank, and introducing
competition into other IT services.
To provide a 'unifying management philosophy' for the changes, Barclays
selected total quality management (TQM) because, says De Feo, 'people
understand what TQM means . . . it does not mean building a Rolls Royce when
the customer wants a Ford. It means delivering what the customer wants'.
To ensure that IT is kept at the forefront of management thinking, a new IT
board has been formed. It is chaired not by an IT executive, but by Andrew
Buxton, Barclays group managing director - a move designed not only to
underline senior management's commitment to the restructuring of IT
operations but also to emphasise its central role in improving Barclays'
competitiveness.
The IT board is made up of the heads of all the business units and is
responsible for IT policies across the group. Beneath the board sits the
Group IT Executive (Gite), comprising all Barclays' IT executives, and Group
Information Systems Technology (Gist) a core group whose 350 staff are in
charge of technical issues such as architecture and standards, tracking
important projects, and providing the central benchmarks against which all
IT issues are measured.
However, the most important change introduced after a review by Nolan
Norton, part of KPMG Management Consulting, has been to split up the old
Centralised Information Systems Department and 'devolve' the 1,500 systems
development and end-user staff. These staff now make up individual IT units
attached to each of the group's main business divisions.
There were, however, some IT functions which Barclays decided should remain
centralised, in order to obtain economies of scale, while at the same time
introducing a new element of competition. Two new units, Barclays Computer
Operations (BCO), responsible for managing the bank's UK computer systems,
and Barclays Network Services (BNS), responsible for its voice and data
telecommunications services, have been set up as quasi-commercial business
units. 'We have created two business units but put them under direct
commercial pressure,' says De Feo.
The aim is to make the two units bid on the basis of price, quality and
service in competition with outside service suppliers for internal Barclays
work. They will also be permitted to act as Facilities Management (FM)
companies, offering their services to external customers, although De Feo
emphasises Barclays has 'reasonably modest ambitions' in this area.
De Feo also plans to develop a measure for the value added by IT to the
business. 'It has to be real value in terms of meeting customer
requirements,' he says.
In some areas, De Feo says, a 'sharper' attitude is already apparent.
However, he accepts that it may take years before it is possible to assess
whether Barclays' bold attempt to change its IT culture has been a success.
In the meantime, the initiative is being closely watched by other companies
which have yet to tackle the issue.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Management: Why high technology leaves Stanley cold - Lucy
Kellaway meets the boss of Dixons in a converted church, where he is happily
shuffling papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS is the office of a tidy, disciplined person, someone who is well
organised and pretty savvy. He is a senior businessman with average tastes.'
An outsider might not altogether agree with Stanley Kalms' appraisal of his
own office.
The room, which is carved out of a converted church in the quiet back
streets of Mayfair, seems rather feminine, cosy and chintzy. With its
bordered carpets, fake coal fire, co-ordinated floral curtains and sets of
reproduction furniture, it strikes an odd contrast with the crowded
high-tech displays of his Dixons shops.
Kalms is happy with the general effect. 'Since I understood what style
meant,' says the self-made retailer, who joined the Dixons business at the
age of 16, 'I have always gone for a sense of warmth.
'I like browns and I don't like modern things.' While the room has the
feeling of a pretentious suite in a hotel, its occupier makes up for it with
a certain engaging directness. Kalms is one of the survivors in retailing;
for 44 years he has presided over Dixons, watching other high street chains
come and go.
He is a staunch conservative, both a big C and a little one. He has made
generous contributions from his substantial private fortune to the Tory
party, and in general seems opposed to change.
His office has been managed in the same way for 20 years by Olive, a kindly,
matronly sort of woman. 'I depend 100 per cent on Olive. She looks after me
every hour of the day.'
But while the chain has grown by selling increasingly sophisticated
products, Kalms himself has stuck to old-fashioned habits. In his office is
a photograph of the first Dixons store opened in Edgware, north London, in
1948.
One senses that his ideas about how to run the business may not have changed
much since then.
On his large, leather-topped desk (which is otherwise quite empty) is a
computer print-out a couple of inches thick. This is delivered first thing
on Monday mornings and contains the previous week's sales and margins for
every product at each of the group's 800-plus stores.
But is filling his head with thousands of profit margins really the best use
of the chairman's time? 'I'd be no use at strategies if I didn't understand
how the camcorder was selling,' he says.
Doesn't such attention to detail suggest a reluctance to delegate? On the
contrary, Kalms says, he is so good at letting the directors get on with
their jobs that he has even moved out of the drab, Ealing headquarters into
the more private Mayfair suite. 'I don't like living over the shop,' he
says.
Despite the large computer screen behind his desk, Kalms sticks to paper
whenever possible. 'I can't use the computer,' he says, quite unabashed.
'Technology has passed me by. I'm much more comfortable looking up the
tabs.'
Neither does he know how to work any of the old cameras that are displayed
in his glass cabinet. 'I'm one of the most untechnical people of all time,
which gives me a good eye for which products are going to sell.'
There are, however, two gadgets in the office that he has no problems
working. A pair of identical brass temperature gauges in different parts of
the room allow him to indulge his obsession with being too hot or too cold.
'At board meetings I'm up and down all the time to check on the air
conditioning,' a sign of the fussy meticulousness that his underlings have
sometimes found hard to bear.
He likens being in his office to 'being in the nest or in the womb'. For
Kalms, the effect is strengthened by a huge, grimy canvass by French artist
Bernard Buffet - 'one of the best investments Dixons ever made' - showing a
cold, bleak level crossing.
'I like the contrast with the warmth of the office,' he says. He has lots of
pictures by the same painter at home.
Kalms sees his office as a place in which to receive visitors - beyond two
arches in his room there is a plush area with sofas and comfortable chairs.
Serious work, he thinks, is better done at home in the evenings. He points
to a fat document about the health of retailing: 'It's best to read that
sort of thing in your slippers,' he says.

FT  27 MAR 92 / The Property Market: Little cause for cheer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Total returns for all properties in February fell to zero, according to the
Investment Property Databank, an independent research company.
'Yields were held at their January levels, but the downward pressure on
rents is percolating directly through to capital values,' it said. Rents
dropped by a full percentage point during the month and capital values fell
by 0.7 per cent.
The total return and capital growth rates for the year moved up, but at a
slowing rate, while rental values continued to fall. The year-on-year total
return is 0.9 per cent, while capital growth improved marginally from -6.9
per cent for the year to January to -6.6 per cent for the year to February.
In February, retail property outperformed the industrial sector with a total
return of 0.5 per cent compared to 0.1 per cent. However the year-on-year
results confirmed industrial property as the highest performing sector, with
a total return of 8.3 per cent for the year to February.
The office sector is experiencing short-term volatility. Last month's
optimistic signs gave way to a 2.1 per cent fall in rental values, the
greatest monthly drop for more than a year, and a 1.3 per cent fall in
capital growth. Capital growth for the year remained relatively stable at
 13.8 per cent, while total returns showed some improvement. and yields were
unchanged at 9.9 per cent.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Lloyd's chairman to hold first 'help tank' today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON is to hold the first of a series of 'market leaders'
forums' today in an effort to improve communication between Mr David
Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, and the underwriters, agents and brokers who
do business at the insurance market.
Mr Coleridge organised the forums - known widely in Lloyd's as 'help tanks'
 -after recent adverse publicity. He said this month in a letter to more
than 60 executives that a 'frank and open exchange of views' would be
helpful.
Lloyd's said yesterday that the forums, which will take place each month,
will not supplant the work of existing market committees. Initial
discussions are likely to focus on public relations.
'This has to be good,' said Mr Robert Hiscox, a leading agent. 'The twelfth
floor (the floor at the Lloyd's building in London on which Mr Coleridge and
Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, have their offices) tends to get detached
from the realities of the market.'
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association,
said the meetings were 'a step in the right direction'.
Lloyd's is expecting to post losses of more than Pounds 1.3bn when it
reports its 1989 results in June, with the losses falling disproportionately
on a minority of outside Names - the individuals whose assets back the
insurance market.
Loss-making Names alleged last month that working Names - those who have
jobs with brokers and agents at the market - were relatively
under-represented on syndicates reporting the heaviest losses. Their
complaints were echoed by MPs, which attracted a wave of damaging press
comment.
Some Names were especially critical of Mr Coleridge's rejection in January
of proposed reforms of the governance of Lloyd's proposed by the Rowland
task force. Mr Coleridge labelled the proposals to establish a new market
board - which would provide corporate leadership for the market - as
'codswallop', but was subsequently forced to back-track.
A group headed by Sir Jeremy Morse is working on the governance issues and
may present its conclusions as early as June.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown 'would give more to poor'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT Budget plans would 'give' far more to the poorest members
of society than the Labour or Conservative proposals, but at the expense of
middle-income earners, the Institute for Fiscal Studies reported yesterday.
The independent research body said virtually all families with incomes of
less than Pounds 50 a week would gain between Pounds 8 and Pounds 9 a week
if the Liberal Democrat plans became law.
This would compare with additional spending power of between Pounds 3 and
Pounds 4 a week for this income group under Labour, and gains averaging just
Pounds 1 under the Tories.
However, at income levels of more than Pounds 100 a week the majority of UK
families would start to lose under a Liberal Democrat chancellor, while most
families with incomes up to Pounds 500 a week would gain under Labour.
At the very top income levels - above Pounds 1,000 a week - the losses from
the Liberal Democrat plan would be smaller than under Labour's shadow
Budget.
The IFS said the bias in the Liberal Democrat package towards low incomes
reflects the party's generous plans for pensioners and single
under-25-year-olds on income support.
The Liberal Democrats plan to spend Pounds 4.4bn more on state pensions,
against Pounds 2.3bn under Labour, on average making married pensioners
Pounds 11 a week better off and giving single pensioners Pounds 6 more a
week.
Under Labour, the equivalent figures would be Pounds 7 and Pounds 5 a week,
while the government in its March 10 Budget announced increases of Pounds 3
and Pounds 2 for couples and single pensioners on income support.
Alternative Proposals on Tax and Social Security. IFS, 7 Ridgmount Street,

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Politicians score an own goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS VOTERS tried to assess the row over Jennifer Bennett's ear yesterday, the
main impression was that the reputation of politicians had been damaged and
that voters had not been swayed.
In the Tory marginals of Bury North and Bury South in the suburbs of
Manchester - and in Hartlepool, being defended by Mr Peter Mandelson,
Labour's former communications director - nobody suggested that the Labour
broadcast or the ensuing rumpus had helped to determine their voting
intentions.
In Hartlepool, Mrs Mildred Gray, a widow of 75, believed Labour had picked
on one case and had misrepresented it. The affair had strengthened her
intention to vote Conservative.
Mrs Margaret Ainsley, who looks after her disabled husband, felt the
broadcast portrayed the truth. Her five-year-old granddaughter has been
waiting three months to have her tonsils removed. 'The broadcast made its
mark,' said Mrs Ainsley, who will vote Labour as she did in 1987.
Mr John Bolton, 42, an electrical engineer who had already decided to vote
Conservative, said: 'There's 55m people. If you look hard enough you can
always find a case to support your argument.'
Mrs Emilia Pearce, a shop assistant, voiced distaste for the politicians'
dog-fight. 'We're all sick of hearing about it,' she said. 'It's all this
presidential style of politics.'
The view that the row was demeaning to those most closely involved in it
struck a chord in Bury. Women in particular argued that it was wrong to use
the suffering of children to score political points.
It was also a sentiment that crossed political affiliations. Committed
Tories were 'disgusted' or 'outraged' while many Labour supporters had
reservations about the content of the broadcast.
A surprisingly large number of people said they knew worse cases and would
gladly have told Labour about them. 'Everyone knows that the health service
needs improving,' said one Bury voter. 'So why, instead of bickering, don't
that lot work together to help us? I'm sick to death of the lot of them.'
Those sentiments were echoed many times.
Such feelings were often accompanied among older people by deep cynicism
about what they saw as posturing by politicians.
In Bury they claim to know all about the haves and have-nots. One retired
textile worker said the rich had always enjoyed a better service and always
would.
Politicians might find a little double-edged solace in another factor
encountered yesterday in Bury. That was the small number of people who saw
the Labour broadcast and the large number who had no intention of watching
Conservative ones.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: CBI speaks out against Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry abandoned any pretence of political
neutrality yesterday by claiming that a Labour government would damage
confidence, deepen recession and lead many big employers to postpone
investment plans.
In an open letter to its member companies, the organisation said that 'in
the clamour of the election campaign' there was a danger that the electorate
would overlook the huge improvement in the performance of British business
under the Conservative party.
The letter listed several policies - all of them Labour's - which the CBI
said would jeopardise further improvement for business. They included: the
national minimum wage, which the CBI says would cost 150,000 jobs;
increasing tax on middle managers; and the renationalising of companies now
in the private sector.
At a press conference, Sir John Banham, CBI director general, said:
'Confidence is the key for the economy and there are proposals on the table
(from Labour), including increasing tax on middle managers, that would have
an adverse effect on confidence and house values.'
CBI officials were also highly critical of the Labour party's election
brochure on manufacturing industry which, they said, did not mention exports
or productivity.
Professor Doug MacWilliams, a CBI economic adviser, said that many CBI
members had been reporting that a Labour victory would lead to the
postponement or abandonment of investment plans because of the uncertain
impact on demand of a sharp increase in taxation for upper income groups.
Sir Brian Corby, CBI president, admitted that Labour's policy on capital
allowances for industry was better than no policy on capital allowances -
which is the Conservative position.
The CBI is also closer to the Labour party on plans to strengthen the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The CBI expressed some criticism of the Conservative record, especially in
education, transport, and public borrowing. However, Sir John said that
Labour had no better solutions in transport because it was opposed to new
road building.

FT  27 MAR 92 / US presence at Earth summit vital - Collor: Brazil eager for
Bush to attend environment talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB

<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN president Fernando Collor warned yesterday that the presence of US
president George Bush at the World Environment Conference would be the
'decisive' factor for its success.
Mr Collor told foreign journalists he had called Mr Bush on Wednesday to
lobby for his presence at the conference in Rio de Janeiro in June. 'I asked
him to strongly consider attending,' said Mr Collor. 'His presence is
decisive because it would send a strong signal to the world of the
importance of a global approach to environmental problems.'
Mr Collor added that he had urged Mr Bush to help end the current impasse
over CO2 emissions. 'A decision by the US government to reduce emissions
would have extraordinary dimensions,' he said.
Mr Collor said he had dismissed his environment minister, Mr Jose
Lutzenberger, last weekend to ensure that Brazil's own position was
coherent. 'Unfortunately differences had developed between Lutzenberger's
declaration and the position elaborated by the government. If we'd had more
time we could have talked it out but I didn't think we could arrive at the
Earth Summit with different positions.'
Mr Collor said he was confident his economic reform programme was taking
hold. 'Today you can talk to anyone in Brazil and they will be more
optimistic, believing that we're on the right road. It is a very different
mood to that last October, when everyone was warning of hyper-inflation and
imminent collapse.'
He added that the image abroad of Latin America's largest economy was also
improving. 'This is reflected in the level of private investment, which last
year reached almost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7bn) and by our foreign exchange
reserves, which now stand at Dollars 13bn-Dollars 14bn  - levels not reached
for 20 years.'
He dismissed doubts that Brazil would fail to meet fiscal targets set down
in its accord with the International Monetary Fund in January. 'We are only
assuming promises that we can meet. . . that is the big change in our
international negotiations,' he said.
But he admitted that the IMF had expressed concern over last month's sharp
drop in tax revenues and 48 per cent real increase in domestic debt. 'You
cannot analyse Brazil's behaviour based on just one bad month,' he said,
adding that from April the government would have increased tax resources
after a reform recently passed by Congress.
Mr Collor was pleased with the progress of negotiations under way with
creditor banks over Brazil's Dollars 52bn commercial debt, though he refused
to predict a settlement date. 'Obviously it would be great if we could close
an accord today or before the Inter-American Development Bank meeting on
April 6, but what I'm most pre-occupied with is that the agreement meets the
interests of all those concerned.'

US patents

<TEXT>
JAPANESE electronics companies yesterday denied they had violated patents
related to charge coupled devices - a basic component of video cameras and
photocopy machines - held by Loral Fairchild, subsidiary of the US defence
electronics company Loral.
Loral has brought a suit in the US against a range of Japanese and Korean
companies, including market leaders such as Sony, Matsushita and Canon, over
alleged patent infringements. Loral is claiming billions of dollars in
damages.
Charge coupled devices (CCDs) are electronic eyes that sense visual images
and translate them into electronic signals.
The suit is reminiscent of a recent action by Honeywell of the US against
Minolta, the camera-maker, over auto-focus cameras which led to an
out-of-court settlement for Dollars 127.5m after the court ruled against
Minolta. Honeywell has also filed suits against other camera makers.
The Japanese companies appeared unclear yesterday precisely why Loral
Fairchild believed its patents had been infringed. They said the technology
for CCDs was based on licences from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, and said
they had no case to answer.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER reductions in US interest rates are needed to ensure recovery from
recession, the joint economic committee of Congress (JEC) said yesterday in
its annual economic report.
The Democrat-led committee said reductions in long-term interest rates were
important if investment spending was to be revived. Long bond yields are
currently just under 8 per cent, or about double the level of rates on
three-month deposits.
The report urges the Treasury to reduce the 'extraordinarily large gap'
between short- and long-term interest rates by selling fewer long-term bonds
in quarterly refinancing operations. This would 'reduce the supply of
long-term Treasury debt, and lead to a significant increase in bond prices
that would lower long-term interest rates'.
Small steps in this direction in February's refinancing had been
insufficient to convince financial markets that the Treasury was serious
about reducing the gap between short- and long-term rates, the report adds.
It predicts a sluggish economic recovery later this year, with fears about
job security continuing to restrain consumer spending.
The report also warns that the US economy is 'badly off track', and says
meagre increases in productivity and an overhang of problems from the 1980s
 -such as heavily indebted individuals and companies - point to weak growth
in the 1990s.
Government at all levels needed to invest in 'infrastructure, education and
training, and research and development, which have been neglected over the
past decade'. To achieve this, while also reducing the budget deficit, the
committee advocates the scrapping of budget rules that currently prevent a
sizeable shift in spending from military to domestic programmes.
The US economy grew at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter
of last year, half as fast as previously estimated, the Commerce Department
said yesterday. The weak growth followed increases in GDP of 1.4 per cent
and 1.8 per cent at an annual rate in the second and third quarters of last
year.
The decline in estimated growth in the fourth quarter mainly reflected
downward revisions to net exports and business inventories.
For 1991 as a whole, GDP fell 0.7 per cent, the first decline since 1982,
when the economy contracted by 2.2 per cent.

TURKEY yesterday signed a Dollars 2.8bn fighter aircraft deal with the US,
using finance from a special fund set up by the US and its Arab allies in
the wake of the Gulf war.
The deal under which Turkish Aerospace Industries and General Dynamics will
jointly manufacture 80 F-16 fighters is the first major defence contract
signed by the new Turkish government. Finance for the F-16 deal is to be
provided from a Dollars 4bn Turkish Defence Fund, part of which is lodged
with the Federal Reserve Bank in the US. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Gulf
Emirates have promised to contribute Dollars 3bn. The US is contributing
around Dollars 500m to the fund - the sum approved by the US congress for
foreign military sales to Turkey.
In a bid to improve its ground to air defence systems, Turkey is expected to
use the fund to buy Raytheon-made Patriot missile batteries,
Turkey is already producing 160 F-16s under an earlier production agreement.
In addition Turkey has secured US backing to manufacture 46 aircraft under a
deal agreed between the US and Egypt.

FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Singapore sets 'outstanding example' over
trade policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE is 'an outstanding example' of how liberal trade policies and
social stability combine to promote economic success, Gatt's secretariat
says in a report on the island's trade policies.
It sees Singapore as ranking among the world's most dynamic economies.
Average annual growth of GDP over the past two decades has exceeded 8 per
cent and per capita income is now about Dollars 10,600, (Pounds 6,127), one
of the highest in Asia.
This dynamism has been founded on outward-looking policies that have
encouraged speedy structural transformation, Gatt says. Singapore shifted
rapidly in the early 1960s from entrepot trade to labour-intensive
manufacturing. Later, it moved to skill- and technology-intensive industries
and to services,
Singapore has the highest trade-to-GDP ratio of any country in the world,
with trade valued at more than three times GDP. Merchandise exports,
including re-exports which account for a third of the total, have grown more
rapidly than world exports in recent years, the report notes (see chart).
With a population of just 3m, the island ranks among the world's top 20
exporters and importers. Some 96 per cent of imports enter duty-free, with
virtually no other trade barriers.
Singapore's open trade regime has been coupled with large government
involvement in the private sector through tax incentive schemes for new
investments and research and development, equity participation in industry
and sizeable public investments in infrastructure and training.
Singapore's trading partners did not find much to niggle about in their
discussion of the Gatt report yesterday. Some countries questioned the
island's status as a developing country in view of its high per capita GDP,
and there was criticism that Singapore had 'bound' (pledged not to raise)
very few of its tariffs in Gatt.
Singapore was urged to improve its offer on tariff bindings in the Uruguay
Round of global trade talks, to sign up to more of Gatt's voluntary codes of
trade conduct, to run a more open policy-making process and, by the US, to
go further in opening its financial services and telecommunications markets
in the Uruguay Round services negotiations.
The Gatt secretariat says economic prospects look promising despite slower
growth last year. Domestically, the main constraints are a shortage of
labour and land for expansion, which Singapore is trying to overcome by
co-operation with neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia.
Externally, Singapore's heavy reliance on international trade means its
economic performance 'remains crucially dependent on an open and predictable
international environment'.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Panel seeks backing for US high-tech development

<TEXT>
A PANEL representing academia, business and government yesterday said the US
government should pour billions of dollars into high-technology development
and into programmes which would speed the commercialisation of new
discoveries.
Foreign companies would be allowed to share in pre-commercial research
programmes if they make 'substantial contributions' to the projects and to
US gross domestic product.
Mr Harold Brown, panel chairman and former US defence secretary, called for
'a new alliance between government and industry in pre-commercial areas'.
The panel - appointed by the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering
and the Institute of Medicine - called for a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn)
Civilian Technology Corporation to hasten commercialisation of new products.
The time lag between product design and commercialisation in key US
industries 'significantly exceeds that of foreign competitors', according to
the report, which was ordered by Congress.
The panel did not call for an 'industrial policy', but if implemented, its
recommendations would lead to the use of vast government resources for the
advantage of US industry.
In its report, The Government Role in Civilian Technology*, the panel said
the new CTC would be financed by a one-time outlay to create joint R&amp;D
ventures with the private sector. Industry would initiate the projects, and
they would be 'insulated as much as possible' from political influence.
The report followed a day after Mrs Barbara Franklin, the new US commerce
secretary, presented her department's considerably less ambitious technology
policy. *The Government Role in Civilian Technology: Building a New
Alliance. National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave, NW, Washington, DC

FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: MacSharry dismisses Gatt ruling on
oilseeds subsidy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Ray MacSharry, European commissioner for agriculture, yesterday dismissed
as 'not acceptable' a ruling by a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt) panel against the EC's new oilseed subsidy regime.
This is the clearest sign yet of the Commission's attitude to the ruling,
made last week in response to a complaint by the US that its right to export
soyabeans to the EC duty free would be unfairly hampered.
It indicates a hardening in the dispute between the EC and Washington over
European subsidies, in the long-delayed Uruguay Round of Gatt talks. Mr
MacSharry said he made no progress yesterday in talks, to try to end the
deadlock, with Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, in the margins of a
two-day meeting of farm ministers from the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The European Commission was still studying the panel's conclusions, said Mr
MacSharry. 'On a limited reading, they're not acceptable to us, therefore
there are no conclusions,' he said.
He and Mr Madigan did not discuss the oilseed row. In theory, the EC must
accept the panel's findings, if there is to be formal settlement.
Mr Louis Mermaz, French farm minister, and one of the staunchest defenders
of the EC's agriculture policy, warned: 'An excessive polarisation of Gatt
talks is leading to a hardening of positions on both sides.'

<TEXT>
JAPANESE cotton spinners are threatening anti-dumping actions against
Pakistani and Indonesian yarn exporters, an unusual course for Japanese
industry, generally the target of dumping allegations itself. The Japan
Spinners' Association said it was preparing to file a formal action against
the exporters, alleging the dumping of cut-price cotton yarn is damaging its
industry.
Over the past three years, only two other dumping cases have surfaced in
Japan. South Korean woollen product exporters agreed to 'voluntary' limits
after a threatened action, and a case against China, Norway and South Africa
for alleged dumping of a ferro-alloy is being investigated by Japan's trade
and finance ministries.
The textile cases reflect the problems traditional Japanese manufacturers
face. Mr Takateru Tobitani, managing director of Shikibo, a leading spinner,
has said Japanese companies are 'in a similar situation to US car makers';
the local industry cannot compete with cheaper imports.
'Japan's textile market is basically a free market, and cheaper imports from
Pakistan and Indonesia have increased sharply,' he said. Japanese spinners
say they would like 'voluntary' accord with the two countries, but 'we don't
want Pakistan to think we will not take action'. Pakistan hopes for an
agreement soon.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS on reducing tariffs in the Uruguay Round of trade talks under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have ground to a halt
because of unresolved differences between the US and EC. The March 31
deadline for completion of the tariff negotiations, an integral part of the
Round, is now certain to be missed and with it the Easter deadline for
concluding the Round as a whole.
All four 'tracks' of negotiations intended to achieve a successful outcome
to the Round are in trouble. Apart from the detailed bargaining on tariffs
and market access for goods (track 1), the country-by-country talks on
services (track 2) are also way behind schedule.
Even the formal legal drafting exercise (track 3) is proving controversial,
as some countries try to re-open issues ostensibly already settled. Finally,
there has been no breakthrough in the all-important bilateral talks between
the US and EC on cutting farm subsidies, which would enable the EC to
subscribe to the draft Uruguay Round package of accords presented last
December (track 4).
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, has already conceded that the
Easter deadline could slip by a few weeks. But, by common consent, the
issues at stake require not time, but political will to make the necessary
compromises. Most negotiators believe that, if the farm subsidy deadlock can
be broken, other problems can be solved fairly quickly.
If the Round is not completed by late spring, the negotiations are likely to
go into limbo until after the US presidential election in November.
At yesterday's stocktaking meeting of the market access negotiations, many
countries expressed frustration at the lack of progress because of stalemate
in the US/EC bilateral talks. The outcome of these talks will largely
determine the pattern of tariff reductions for all 108 participants in the
Uruguay Round.

FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Mongolia's trade drops by half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONGOLIA, which did 97 per cent of its trade with Comecon countries before
the collapse of the Soviet Union, is struggling to find new markets and to
counter severe shortages of essential goods.
According to Mr S. Bayarbaatar, minister of trade and industry, the
country's trade contracted by half last year to about Dollars 750m. The
share of former Comecon countries has dropped to 70 per cent but remained as
high as that because of dependence on Russian oil. However, shipments of oil
have been suspended since December because of contractual problems.
Few countries have embarked on more sweeping economic reform in the face of
more obstacles.
The Mongolian government's structural adjustment programme, enacted with the
advice of the International Monetary Fund, includes price liberalisation,
banking reform, privatisation, control of inflation, laws to attract foreign
investment, and other steps towards a market economy.
But as a land-locked country sandwiched between communist China and chaotic
Russia, 'we have to create a more acceptable business environment than
either China or Russia,' Mr Bayarbaatar said during a visit to London.
The halt in oil supplies, which has caused Mongolia to use up strategic
reserves and severely limit domestic consumption, is symptomatic of the
country's problems.
According to Mr Bayarbaatar, shipments stopped because it was not clear
which Russian entity should sign the contract. A barter agreement has been
signed, but no oil was shipped because of a dispute within Russia on who was
liable for payment for shipment to the border.
Mr Bayarbaatar is travelling on to Moscow to make a new attempt to secure
resumption of supplies.
Mongolia needs to import Russian petroleum products because they would be
more expensive to buy elsewhere, especially if they had to be trans-shipped
through Russia.
The country also needs to export copper concentrate to Russian factories,
which are unable to pay for it - hence the barter agreement.
Meanwhile, shortages of essential goods in Russia are encouraging Mongolia's
increasingly market-oriented traders to sell them across the border for high
prices rather than at home. Flour, rice and sugar are all rationed.
Because of growing unreliability of trans-shipment through Russia, Mongolia
is seeking to develop trade links through China and has high hopes of a new
freeport zone planned in North Korea.
International donors last year pledged Dollars 150m to Mongolia to finance
emergency imports, and will meet again in May to consider soft loans to meet
the country's medium-term needs, including infrastructure, promotion of
exports and import substitution.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Play Ball] means several things in Seattle: The final
innings of a game affecting US-Japanese relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE southern edge of central Seattle, the pre-eminent city of the US
Northwest, stands an ugly, concrete-domed sports stadium, with all the
visual charm of a deflating souffle. The Kingdome, as unlikely as it may
seem, has become the microcosm of America's tussle between Japan-bashing
xenophobia and a cosmopolitan view of the world.
The stadium is home to the Seattle Mariners baseball team, and the ruling
authorities of the US national sport must decide whether to approve a
controversial plan by a Japanese-backed group of local businessmen to buy
the team.
The saga not only illustrates the remarkably strong ties that bind Seattle
with Japan, it also highlights the chauvinistic tendencies of the men who
own America's top baseball teams, and, since the game is a defining element
of US popular culture, says something about the isolationist tendencies of
the nation as a whole.
The Mariners, one of the least successful teams in the major leagues, were
put up for sale in December by their owner, Mr Jeff Smulyan, a businessman
in the broadcasting industry who needed to repay a large bank loan. He gave
the city until today to come up with a new local owner or see the franchise
move elsewhere.
A group calling itself the Baseball Club of Seattle duly bid Dollars 100m
(Pounds 57.8m) and said it would plough a further Dollars 25m into improving
the team. The group included a clutch of local worthies, such as Mr Frank
Shrontz, chairman of aircraft manufacturer Boeing, but 60 per cent of it was
owned by Japan's Yamauchi family, founders of the Nintendo video-game
company.
Nintendo - whose US headquarters in Seattle oversees 80 per cent of the
American video-games market - became involved after being approached by Mr
Slade Gorton, a US senator representing Washington state. The family's stake
in the team would be managed by Nintendo of America president Minoru
Arakawa, son-in-law of the company's founder. But the Yamauchis, to counter
US fears of Japanese domination, agreed to stringent policy controls by the
minority owners.
However, none of this cut much ice with Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent,
nor with other team-owners, who have to approve the sale. Mr Vincent noted
baseball's tradition of not approving investors from outside the US and
Canada; owners cited local ownership.
The bid also provided a fresh target for US resentment of Japan, since it
followed numerous Japanese acquisitions of such well-known US institutions
as New York's Rockefeller Center and California's Pebble Beach golf course.
Seattleites argued that their bid would put the Mariners under local
interests for the first time. Mr Arakawa might be Japanese but he had lived
in the city for 15 years. This was more than could be said of Mr Smulyan,
who hailed from Indiana, or the previous Californian owners.
US newspapers weighed in on Seattle's side. One accused the authorities of
acting like a 'snobbish country club' and argued that involvement by the
Japanese, who have their own popular baseball leagues, could enrich the game
and make it more appealing internationally. Club owners may well have felt
that deep-pocketed foreigners would simply push up the already steep cost of
hiring the best talent.
Negotiations dragged on and on, but there now are some indications that a
compromise can be struck. This could involve the authorities' accepting a
deal in return for cosmetic changes to reduce the Nintento stake to around
50 per cent. Such an outcome would represent a triumph for Seattle and its
long tradition of links with Asia, especially Japan. Sen Gorton said of the
bid: 'The Pacific Northwest looks outward. This is a partnership made in
heaven for the Pacific Northwest.'
The region's ties with Japan began to flourish a hundred years ago, with the
export of northwestern timber, agricultural products and minerals, and Japan
today remains Washington state's largest single trading partner, accounting
for some Dollars 5.5bn, or 22 per cent, of the state's exports in 1990. The
adjacent ports of Seattle and Tacoma, comprising one of the largest shipping
complexes on the west coast, are big importers of Japanese goods, while the
region's Sea-Tac airport is becoming an increasingly important hub for Asian
flights for flights to and from the Far East.
With trade came people. More than 11 per cent of Seattle's population is of
Asian origin, mostly from Japan, China and the Philippines. There are 34,000
people of Japanese origin in Washington state, mostly Japanese-Americans
whose parents or grandparents had been interned by the US during the Second
World War. The state's Japanese population ranks jointly with New York as
the third largest in the US, after California and Hawaii.
Cultural ties are strong: Seattle's new art gallery boasts one of the best
Japanese collections in the US, while Washington state has the highest
number of high schools offering Japanese language studies. You can buy a
plate of Japanese noodles from a stand at Sea-Tac airport or take part in a
cherry blossom festival in suburban Bellevue.
Morevoer, the Mariners row could prove yet another opportunity, whatever the
baseball authorities decide: recent developments could eventually translate
into greater Japanese interest in the area. Mr Bill Stafford, executive
director of the Trade Development Alliance of Greater Seattle, says
businessmen returning from Japan report many compliments on 'Seattle's
sensitive appreciation of the complexity of US-Japanese relations'.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Amsterdam may not act on car ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTERDAM'S citizens showed so little enthusiasm for Wednesday's non-binding
referendum on the future of car traffic in their city centre that the
authorities may not act on the slim majority of the ballot.
Just under 27 per cent of the 600,000 eligible voters turned out for the
referendum, the first in the city's history. Of these, 52.9 per cent
favoured halving inner-city parking spaces and other measures to cut car
traffic 60 per cent by the end of the 1990s.
The referendum gave residents the choice between existing policies, which
aim to achieve a more gradual decline in car traffic, and a more radical
plan virtually to ban most cars from the canal-lined city centre.
Amsterdam's city politicians say they will consider the views of those who
voted but the limited response has reduced pressure on them to ban cars
immediately. The council decided to hold the referendum as a way of
reversing the widespread apathy seen in the 1990 municipal elections.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Poll casts doubt on Cresson's future: The possible 'fall
guy' in France's imminent government reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION on an imminent change of government in France, already acute
after the humiliating defeat of the ruling Socialist Party in last Sunday's
regional elections, has assumed extra intensity after tantalising hints
dropped on Wednesday evening by Prime Minister Edith Cresson.
In an impromptu exchange with TV reporters, Mrs Cresson asserted that there
would be a government reshuffle, though she was unable to say how far it
would go or when it would take place.
Asked about her own future, Mrs Cresson gave an even more Delphic reply.
'There will be,' she said, 'some day, a change of prime minister. What day?
I cannot tell you that either.'
The plausible inference is that there is likely to be a government reshuffle
quite soon, probably next week after the second round of the cantonal
elections on Sunday. But Mrs Cresson's profession of ignorance as to the
details may have been quite genuine.
Ever since last Sunday's electoral disaster, President Mitterrand has been
engaged in intense consultations to assess the full significance of the
vote. It is clear that he will respond in some way to the massive vote of no
confidence.
But he may not yet have decided whether he can make do with a limited
government reshuffle, to include some of the ecologists whose break-through
was a notable feature of the protest vote in Sunday's elections; or whether
he needs a full-scale change of government, starting with a new prime
minister.
Four names are widely canvassed to replace Mrs Cresson, whose
record-breaking unpopularity must bear some of the blame for the scale of
last Sunday's defeat. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, is credited in the opinion polls as the strongest potential
socialist candidate in a future presidential election.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, can claim the credit for France's
successful anti-inflation policy - though some may blame him for the rise in
unemployment.
The considerable popularity of Mr Jack Lang, the minister of culture,
appears unaffected by the discredit of his prime minister and his party. And
the unusually seraphic smile with which, on Wednesday evening, he denied all
knowledge of a change of government, has only intensified speculation that
he might be Mrs Cresson's successor.
Finally, there is Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, the non-party social affairs
minister. In nine years as secretary-general to the presidency, he proved
his impressive administrative abilities; in the regional elections he
out-performed most of the card-carrying Socialists; and the unquestioned
credibility of his concern for grass-roots social issues must be an asset in
a new-look government.
Before making up his mind, President Mitterrand will wait to see what
happens in today's inaugural sessions of the 22 newly elected regional
councils when they elect the council presidents (equivalent to regional
chief executives).
The conservative opposition parties used to control 19 of the 22 regions,
and they did better than any other single party on Sunday. But their share
of the vote was eroded by the surge by minority parties, and they will only
be able to retain control through coalitions. A key test of Sunday's vote,
therefore, will be whether they succumb to the temptation to form alliances
with the extreme right-wing National Front, despite solemn undertakings not
to do so.
This dilemma may put considerable strain on the alliance between the two
component parties in the conservative Union pour la France (UPF), the
centre-right UDF umbrella grouping led by former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, and the RPR Gaullist party led by Mr Jacques Chirac.
President Mitterrand will want to refine his judgment of the regional
elections still further by waiting for the second round of voting on Sunday
in the cantonal elections. Here the Socialists are likely to do less badly
than in the regional elections, because the majority voting system favours
larger parties.

FT  27 MAR 92 / CSCE agrees principle of peace-keeping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN Ministers from the 51-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe wound up a three-day ministerial session yesterday with wide
agreement on the principle that the CSCE should be given a peace-keeping
capability.
But Mr Paavo Vayrynen, the Finnish foreign minister, said differences had to
be ironed out over the nature of the forces to be used in peace-keeping
operations
This is one of the main issues on the agenda of senior officials, who will
meet for the next three months to work out a blue-print for strengthening
the CSCE's capacity to deal with the many European crises and conflicts of
the post-cold war era. Their work will be crowned by a full-scale summit in
Helsinki at the beginning of July.
Delegates said that, while there was general agreement that the CSCE was the
best forum for taking the political decisions on whether peace-keeping
forces were needed to settle conflicts in Europe, there was still no
consensus on whether the organisation should have its own peace-keeping
forces, as Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, has
proposed.
The view of the US, Britain and several other delegations is that the CSCE
does not have a military function and that peace-keeping forces should be
provided, at the request of the CSCE, by other more specialised
organisations such as Nato, the nine-nation Western European Union or the
United Nations.
Mr Vayrynen indicated that such a solution had not been ruled out by anyone.
But his own government's position, shared by a number of other countries,
was that the CSCE members should each earmark national contingents for use
in CSCE peace-making operations when called upon to do so.
The problem of the transcaucasian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, a conflict
which might well require a CSCE decision to send peace-keeping forces in the
near future, was again the subject of a sharp exchange between the Armenian
and Azerbaijani representatives. Their statements demonstrated that the
contentious issue of Nagorno-Karabakh participation in the 10-nation CSCE
peace conference, due to be held in Minsk at a date yet to be decided, was
far from settled, in spite of Tuesday's agreement by the disputing parties
to attend.
Mr Raffi Hovanissian, the Armenian foreign minister, reiterated his demand
that Nagorno-Karabakh should be represented separately and independently at
the conference.
But Mr Albert Salamov, Azerbaijan's deputy foreign minister, insisted that
the enclave's delegates could not attend as the representatives of 'the
so-called parliament' of Nagorno-Karabakh, elected after a referendum last
December on independence, which Azerbaijan has declared null and void. They
could only represent Nagorno-Karabakh's two ethnic communities, he said.

economy. Japan's products have made heavy inroads into the automobile and
consumer electronics sectors, much to the chagrin of US manufacturers, who
are calling to politicians for help in this election year. Yet the Japanese
build-up in the US financial services industry has gone largely unnoticed.
In the state of New York, which accounts for by far the largest proportion
of foreign bank activity in the US, Japanese banks now have 55 branches and
agencies, according to the latest data, with total assets of Dollars
244.6bn. A further 21 state-chartered trust companies bring the asset total
to Dollars 272.1bn. This represents 55 per cent of all foreign bank assets
subject to regulation by New York state.
As regulators are quick to point out in the wake of the BCCI scandal, the US
assets of one of the big Japanese banks outstrip those of BCCI in its
entirety. Bank of Tokyo, which has had a North American presence for more
than a century and ranks as the largest foreign bank by any measure, boasts
assets of almost Dollars 50bn in the US. The size of its commercial and
industrial lending is about 40 per cent larger than the loan book of its
nearest competitor.
On Wall Street, the big four Japanese securities houses have earned the
respect of their domestic rivals, although it would be wrong to say that
they are held in awe. While Nomura and Daiwa hold dominant positions in the
underwriting of international bonds, they have remained in the second tier
of the US market. Last year, Nomura took 16th place in domestic lead
underwriting and Daiwa 19th, according to figures from Securities Data.
Both houses are primary dealers in the US government bond market, giving
them a pivotal role in the purchase of government paper by Japanese
institutional investors. Nomura, Daiwa and their smaller competitors - Nikko
and Yamaichi - have also acted as a major conduit for US investment flows
into the Tokyo stock market, even if these have now slowed to a trickle.
Japan's financial emissaries abroad have been unable to escape the economic
and political upheavals at home. Even before the recent slide in the Tokyo
market cut the value of their reserves, Japanese banks were being forced to
cut back international lending to comply with new capital adequacy
standards. In the US, where the Japanese share of total bank assets more
than doubled in the 1980s to around 12 per cent, new lending has ground to a
halt.
Quite apart from their own capital restraints, the Japanese banks have seen
the US recession hit hard at their lending activities. In the real estate
sector, where Japanese institutions invested heavily during the boom of the
late 1980s, the impact on the banks has been particularly severe. Provisions
against non-performing US real estate loans have increased substantially.
From June 1989 to June 1990, approximately the last year of the boom,
Japanese banks pushed up their US real estate assets by more than 70 per
cent, to just under Dollars 30bn. Among the top 20 foreign bank branches and
agencies with most real estate exposure, Japanese institutions located in
New York and Los Angeles accounted for all but one, according to figures
compiled by American Banker.
The Japanese securities houses are also suffering from the changing climate.
Faced with a declining equity market at home, Tokyo institutions are cutting
their investments abroad and the flow of funds into the US government bond
market is drying up. 'We are seeing a fall in volume and a shrinking in
margins, even though our business as primary dealers remains profitable',
says a spokesman for Daiwa Securities in New York.
With some success, the big four have built stand-alone businesses in the US,
reducing reliance on the Japanese market. New York has become a base for
cross-border activity in corporate finance, especially mergers and
acquisitions, and Nomura has acquired a significant stake in the independent
house, Wasserstein Perella.
But the securities houses are also using the US as a testing ground for new
financial products that may eventually find their way to Japan. Nomura, once
rumoured to be keen on buying the Wall Street firm of Kidder Peabody, then
hired the firm's president, Max Chapman to run its US operations. Chapman
has spearheaded a drive by Nomura into derivative products.
Daiwa's spokesman defines its US business as a 'periscope operation',
seeking out skills and techniques that could be transplanted to Japan.
Commercial paper is one activity already highly developed in the US but
still a fledgling business in Japan. Daiwa is also building expertise in
asset securitisation, especially in the mortgage area, with an eye on its
potential back home.
The Japanese have also made some inroads into the highly competitive
business of asset management on behalf of US pension funds. They have been
helped by the decision of several leading funds to boost their international
investments, although the securities scandals in Japan have prompted public
concern on the part of some pension owners, notably the Californian Public
Employees Retirement System, the country's largest.
As for the banks, their hectic growth over the past decade will probably
never be repeated. That does not mean their substantial presence in the US
will shrink dramatically; New York is too significant a financial centre to
allow much reduction in activity and the Japanese also value their local
presence.
But others take a more serious view. John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, told
executives in Chicago last September that, as a by-product of the fall in
the Tokyo stock market, the role of Japanese banks in the international
financial system had been virtually eliminated. 'They are no longer players
(in the system) and one would not expect them to be players again for the
next five to 10 years because of this adjustment in the value of their
equity portfolios', he added.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (10): Centre of
European operations - Japanese financial institutions in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the domestic earnings of Japanese financial institutions squeezed by
the worst financial recession for 40 years, international operations provide
an increasingly important source of income.
For most Japanese financial institutions London is the centre of European
operations. The long-term commitment of leading Japanese banks and
securities houses to London is clear from the ambitious, and expensive, new
headquarters developments either planned or only recently completed.
For example, Daiwa Securities has commissioned Richard Rogers, the modernist
architect of the Lloyd's insurance building in London and the Pompidou
centre in Paris, to design a new office building on a freehold site on
London Wall, in the heart of the City.
Industrial Bank of Japan, is moving to Bracken House, opposite St Paul's
Cathedral and the former home of the Financial Times, another prime City
site.
The terms under which IBJ is leasing the 200,000 square foot building from
Obayashi, the Japanese property developer which paid Pounds 130m for the
site, is unknown.
However, property analysts expect the rental to be at least Pounds 70 a
square foot on a 20-year or 25-year lease. This implies an investment of
Pounds 14m per year.
Nomura International recently moved into a new 400,000 sq ft building,
having bought the freehold to the listed former headquarters building of the
Post Office in 1986.
Again the scale of the investment in the original building or the cost of
subsequent refurbishment were never made public.
The leading Japanese securities houses are also making investments to break
into new areas of business. Yamaichi, the fourth largest securities house,
is expected to begin operations as a gilt-edged market maker before the year
end, thus becoming the third Japanese firm to make a market in UK government
bonds. It is pressing ahead with the investment in spite of warning that it
will turn in a pre-tax loss of Y34bn for the financial year ended March 31.
Nomura and Daiwa are already among the 18 market makers in UK government
bonds and have been able to find a niche in the primarily domestic market.
Both operated profitably last year. Daiwa Gilts turning in a Pounds 4m
profit on a capital base of just Pounds 15m.
Japanese firms last year received permission from the Bank of England to
take lead management positions in sterling bond issues, although only for
Japanese borrowers. The move was seen as matching recent efforts to open the
Japanese securities markets to UK firms.
However, the London operations of the big securities firms have seen at
least one important area of business shrink to only a fraction of its former
size. International issues of equity-linked bonds by Japanese companies,
mostly underwritten and syndicated in London by Japanese securities firms,
were one of the great money-spinners of the late 1980s.
In addition to taking a 2.5 per cent underwriting fee on the amount raised,
the bonds invariably traded above issue price as investors scrambled to buy
paper linked to the booming Tokyo stock market. This presented underwriting
firms with a handsome premium.
But the business is now far more sporadic. At the peak of the Tokyo equity
market in 1989, a staggering Dollars 63bn was raise from warrant bond
issues, mostly by Japanese corporations and mostly underwritten by Japanese
securities firms. However, last year new issues amounted to Dollars 26bn,
and Dollars 19bn in 1990. The deals are also more likely to trade down from
issue price, eating into the return made by underwriters rather than adding
to them.
However, the big securities firms have diversified into new areas of
business. In spite of a lacklustre year for the warrant bond market, Nomura
and Daiwa were the two biggest underwriters in the international bond market
last year, with Yamaichi 6th and Nikko 7th.
With traditional sources of income under pressure, this process of
diversification is likely to continue. Mr John Howland Jackson, chairman of
Nomura International, said that the company plans to expand its investment
banking business, including primary equity market, structured finance and
securitisation activity. The company also intends to build up European
equity research, distribution and trading business.
'We have no intention of cutting back on existing lines, but we are
prioritising the greatest revenue growth areas, which we see as investment
banking and the secondary securities business necessary to support that
investment banking ambition,' he said.
Nomura's appointment as global co-ordinator to the Pounds 500m-Pounds 1bn
share issue planned by GPA, the aircraft leasing company, underlines the
determination of Japanese firms to gain lead advisory roles for non-Japanese
companies.
However, there has been a definite withdrawal by Japanese banks from
participation in syndicated loans arranged in London. Officials at big UK
clearing banks, which still have a pivotal position in the London loans
market, report that the big Japanese banks are still active participants in
large, blue-chip financings, but on nothing like the scale of the late
1980s.
In spite of the pressures in the Japanese domestic market, there is no sign
yet of an exodus from London by second- and third-tier banks and securities
firms. A survey of overseas firms in London by Noel Alexander Associates
found three new Japanese securities firms setting up in London for the first
time last year. Seven Japanese banks also opened their first London
operation in 1991.
However, there are clearly pressures on the profitability of smaller banks
and securities firms caused by the weakness of the domestic stock market and
slowing domestic economy. In March, Takagi Securities closed its
London-based affiliate, the first departure recorded by Noel Alexander,
which has data going back to the early 1970s.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (9): Profits are still
flowing - Foreign stockbrokers and banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE most Japanese financial institutions are struggling to break even,
foreign banks and securities companies in Tokyo claim to be making a healthy
profit.
In some areas foreign institutions have benefited from the weakness of
domestic players. For example, foreign banks were able to increase lending
to blue-chip Japanese corporations as the domestic banks cut back on asset
growth. However, unlike their Japanese rivals, foreign banks and securities
firms have not pursued market share as a strategic objective. Many are now
reaping the benefits of strategies which emphasised high margins in favour
of high volume.
For example, foreign banks have never taken more than 3 per cent of the
corporate loans market in Japan. By the end of last year market share was
probably close to this historic high, but is now declining as foreign
bankers become more cautious about credit risk.
Bankers reject the suggestion that there is any problem gaining access to
the corporate loans market. 'There is business out there for any bank which
wants to lend,' commented Mr Gerard Jeannin, head of Tokyo operations for
Banque Indosuez, which has a corporate loans book of around Y250bn.
But foreign bankers agree that there is little money to be made directly
from lending to Japanese companies. Loans are made only where the borrower
is likely to buy other banking services: foreign exchange, treasury hedging
products and structured finance.
There is no syndicated loans market in Japan. The exact terms of loans
depend on the relationship between borrower and lender. However, bankers
said that good quality Japanese corporations were now paying 70-80 basis
points over interbank rates for medium-term loans - at least double the
levels of the late 1980s.
However, there are no commitment fees standard in the US and European
syndicated loans market. Return on capital remains relatively low.
Moreover, bankers said that lending margins had already peaked and were now
tightening slightly. As in the UK and US, demand for loan finance is subdued
as companies cut investment plans and liquidate financial assets.
In the securities markets, foreign firms have also avoided head-on
competition for high-volume business. Instead they have emphasised product
diversification, which in most cases is shorthand for building expertise in
futures, options and other derivative financial products. Over the past year
the strategy has been successful, particularly for firms which have made
aggressive use of their own balance sheets for index arbitrage.
In the six months to the end of September, the most profitable foreign
securities operations in Tokyo were Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley.
Both firms are active users of the futures market for index arbitrage
trading.
Their results were only bettered by Nomura and Daiwa, the two giants of the
Japanese securities industry. For the full year the contrast in fortunes
will probably be even greater. All the big Japanese securities firms except
Nomura have forecast a deficit.
However, the contrast of styles and trading strategies has created
conflicting interests which threaten to sour relations as the Japanese
authorities cast around for ways to stimulate the financial markets.
Daily trading volume on the Tokyo stock exchange averaged fewer than 200m
shares in February. At the peak of the bull market in June 1988 trading
volume reached 1,770m shares a day.
Combined with lower commission charges, the total commission income of
brokers in Japanese equities may only be 20 per cent of the level of 1989.
Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director of Nomura, estimated cash
trading volume of 500m-700m shares a day is required for domestic market
participants to break even.
Recent moves to stimulate cash trading volume are likely to squeeze the
profitability of many foreign securities firms. In March, the authorities
increased futures commission charges on the Osaka securities exchange, where
the Nikkei 225 stock index future trades.
Mr Hideaki Yamashita, director of international affairs at the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, said futures commissions had been raised to iron out volatility in
the cash market caused by futures-related trading.
Up to 15 per cent of cash market transactions are now related to index
futures trading, which is concentrated in the Nikkei 225 contract. Cash
stocks are bought to hedge short positions taken through index futures,
holdings which are unwound as the futures contract expires. Cash volume on
the last day of the futures contract is often double the average. In a thin
market, these block trades can cause wide movements in the cash index.
The authorities hope that a reduction index futures trading will reduce
volatility and help to attract small investors back into the equity market.
This is seen as essential by domestic securities firms for trading volume to
be restored.
However, foreign firms argue that low trading volume and volatility are
factors of influences other than index arbitrage trading.
'The loss of political credibility and the possibility of panic selling are
the root causes of low trading volume,' commented Mr Bill Thompson, chairman
of Salomon Brothers Asia.
Foreign analysts readily admit the differential between cash and futures
market commissions is too wide. However, they argue cash commissions should
be liberalised to stimulate trading volume.
But there is little prospect of a further reduction or deregulation of cash
commissions while the domestic securities firms are facing a severe squeeze
on operating income.
In the absence of price competition on commissions, foreign securities firms
are trying to maintain profitability by other means. Active use of the
derivatives markets is one aspect of this.
Most foreign firms operating in Tokyo also cite the quality and objectivity
of their research as an important competitive advantage.
A recent poll of Japanese institutional investors by Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
the financial newspaper, ranked Mr Peter Tasker of Kleinwort Benson the top
equity market strategist.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (8): Giants face up to
reality - The investment policies of institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S institutional investors, once seen as the formidable giants moving
international and domestic financial markets, are now being forced to change
due to the stock market slump and ongoing financial deregulation.
Fund managers operating institutional funds, for the first time in the
postwar period, have started to consider performance, responding to changes
in investor attitudes.
Mr Haruaki Deguchi, senior official of financial and investment planning at
Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, describes the changes in the life
assurance industry as 'a weird child finally growing into a normal adult'.
Inflow of new money at the life insurers has declined as individual
investors are offered more investment products giving returns in line with
market rates. The amount of new money, which grew at rates as high as 20 per
cent in the years of loose credit of the late eighties, because of the
diversification of investment products, has halved to about Y140,000bn for
the fiscal year ending March 1992.
The companies also face the decline in unrealised gains on stock holdings as
share prices have plunged. In addition, the industry, one of the most
heavily regulated financial industries, faces liberalisation, where
dividends offered to policyholders will be deregulated.
Along with dividend deregulation, a rule which forbids insurers to pay
annual dividends to policyholders from capital gains is also likely to be
abolished.
Japanese life insurers fund their dividend payouts with yields from bonds
and real estate, interest from loans and dividends from stocks. However, the
ministry of finance, to increase equity purchases, allowed the life
companies to include capital gains on tokkin - specified money trusts. The
insurers are also allowed to count the coupon on foreign securities as
returns, rather than the actual yield after the bond has been hedged for
currency movements.
Insurers reckon that while returns on investments total only 5.5 per cent at
the most, dividends on policies are around 6.5 per cent. Until now, the
insurers covered the 1 per cent loss by realising gains on long-term
shareholdings.
This system, however, has become an increasing burden on the insurers due to
the sharp falls in the stock market. Mr Deguchi claims that unrealised gains
have declined to 60.6 per cent of the 1986 figure.
From now on Mr Deguchi says insurers will evaluate investments by its net
total returns - which until now, the industry did not find necessary.
This year, Nippon Life plans to invest 40 to 50 per cent of new money into
corporate loans and 10 per cent into domestic bonds, and 30 per cent into
short-term money markets. High-risk investments will be kept at a minimum
level, with investments in equity, real estate and foreign securities each
totalling 5 per cent of new money at most.
Mr Deguchi says Nippon Life is aiming to reduce its 30 per cent exposure of
outstanding investments to real estate and stocks to zero per cent in the
next few years.
Meanwhile, the stock investment trusts' redemptions have recently slowed
down. Last year, the stock market slump prompted pre-maturity redemptions of
stock funds, pushing up redemptions 2.4 times.
The net asset value of equity and bond investment trust funds fell 9.8 per
cent last year with net assets of stock funds down from Y35,077.2bn at the
end of 1990 to Y28,562.4bn.
Individuals, who are unable to afford to trade directly in shares,
originally preferred to invest in trust funds. However, even at the height
of the bull market, returns have not exceeded the rise in the market, since
the objective of the funds has not been to outperform the stock market, but
to offer a better return than that of bank deposits.
The 16 investment trust companies, tied with securities houses, have been
ideal buyers for the unwanted shares brokers had underwritten.
However, the weakness of stock prices and deteriorating confidence towards
the securities industry has prompted a change in investors' attitudes.
Investors, both institutional and individual, are shunning the unit-type, or
closed-end type trust, which can be redeemed only after a designated period
of time, and are turning to the opened-end fund, which can be withdrawn on
demand without penalty.
According to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, open-end funds now comprise 35 per cent of
stock fund assets, compared to just 10 per cent in 1988. Since open-end
funds invest an average 70 per cent in equity compared to half that for
closed-end funds, the industry's exposure to equity investments is expected
to increase.
Japan's pension funds, jealously guarded by life insurers and trust banks,
are also facing slow but sure signs of change. Total assets of private
pension funds grossed Y38,500bn last year, and is expected to hit Y100,000bn
by 2000. Public pension and mutual aid programmes hold Y113,000bn in assets.
Although the life expectancy in Japan is the longest in the world, and the
population is ageing rapidly, the country's pension schemes lag in quality
of management.
The recent appointment by Nagasakiya, a leading retail chain, of Invesco
MIM, the UK asset management company, to manage a portion of its pension
funds, surprised the industry, as Japanese companies tend to choose fund
managers on shareholding and other business relationships.
Nagasakiya, however, said its decision was performance-oriented. Such
choices are likely to increase in the near future once the schemes start
maturing and payouts increase. 'Japan's pension funds will have to start to
make return oriented investment decisions,' says a life insurance company
official.
The entry of asset management companies into the industry in 1990, and
foreign asset managers last year, has also increased the availability of
performance-based competition. The Pension Fund Association recently set up
a committee to review returns on pension fund managing.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (6): Dinosaur syndrome
 -The troubled banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks, until recently the behemoths of international banking, today
look like dinosaurs, burdened by their huge size and very uncertain about
their future.
They are in a triple bind: capital is short, bad loans weigh heavily on
their balance sheets and a slowdown in the Japanese economy is reducing
opportunities to lend money at a profit. 'We are going to have a very hard
time for the coming five years or so,' says Mr Tokio Inoue, a managing
director of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Japan's largest bank.
Bankers say it could take five years to get over the difficulties. Borrowers
at home and abroad will find credit more difficult to secure than at any
time since the 1970s - and more expensive.
But the outlook is not wholly bad - the recession in Japan's financial
markets is forcing banks to weed out unprofitable business and concentrate
on profits. The stronger banks will remain formidable competitors in
domestic and international markets. The weaker ones are in danger of losing
their independence.
Also, even though deregulation has reduced the Japanese authorities' ability
to control the markets, both the Bank of Japan and the ministry of finance
retain considerable reserves of power. They will try to make sure even in
these difficult times Japan does not suffer the ignominy of its first
post-war bank bankruptcy.
Moreover, if Japanese banks are suffering, so are many international rivals,
as shown by the recent credit crisis at Olympia and York, the Canadian-based
world's largest property development company.
After the Nikkei index's fall below 20,000, the banks' main concern is the
effect of falling share prices on capital reserves. Under rules set by the
Bank for International Settlements, Japanese banks are allowed to count as
capital a portion of unrealised gains on their stock holdings. The lower the
market falls, the smaller the unrealised gains. At 20,000, leading
commercial banks are close to the 8 per cent ratio of capital to assets
which the BIS set as a minimum.
The BIS standard does not apply until next year. But banks cannot afford to
wait until then to put their balance sheets in order - they must act now to
cut asset growth and bolster capital. 'We are standing on the edge of a
cliff,' says one leading banker.
For the big city (commercial) banks asset growth has already fallen from
more than 10 per cent a year in the late 1980s to around 5 per cent in the
year to the end of March 1992, and could slip further next year.
With the economy slowing and corporate cash levels high by historic
standards, most of industry has yet to feel the squeeze. How soon the crunch
comes will depend on how quickly the economy recovers.
Meanwhile, unable to raise new equity because of the stock market's
weakness, banks are defending balance sheets by securing subordinated loans,
which count as capital under BIS rules. The city banks have raised around
Y1,700bn in this financial year and plan to raise a further Y300bn or so by
the month's end. This follows Y4,000bn raised in the 1990 year.
Banks are also urgently trying to raise profitability, principally by
widening lending margins. So basic business profits for the year to the end
of March should rise sharply - by around 30 per cent for city banks,
according to industry estimates. Pre-tax and net profits, which take account
of loan write-offs, stock investment losses and other charges, will decline
but not by as much as was once feared. The worst results among leading banks
are likely to come from scandal-hit Fuji Bank, which has suffered losses
associated with a fraudulent loan scheme, Fuji has forecast a 74.9 per cent
decline in net profits to Y30bn. A poor result, but one that still leaves
the bank in the black.
If the economy fails to recover as soon as the government expects, then the
threat of a squeeze on credit will recede. However, this will also bring
banks little relief since slower economic growth will erode customers'
profits and so push more borrowers into difficulties.
Moreover, banks are also suffering from an overhang of bad and doubtful
debts incurred during the speculative boom of the 1980s. Some, at least, of
these loans will have to be written off against reserves - further eroding
the banks' capital and reducing their ability to expand lending. As much as
possible, banks will try to avoid write-offs by taking possession of land
and stocks held as collateral and waiting for an opportunity to sell.
Banks keep silent about the true extent of their problems: under Japanese
regulations they are not required to publish figures for the size of bad and
doubtful debts. The ministry of finance may change the rules next year but
even then many problem debts are expected to stay hidden. Outside estimates
of the bad and doubtful loans of leading banks range up to Y20,000bn.
Some banks are much worse off than others. Long-term credit banks and trust
banks generally have stronger BIS ratios than commercial banks. But their
exposure to problem debtors is also bigger. For example, the Long-Term
Credit Bank is a major creditor of EIE International, a debt-laden land and
hotels group which recently revealed debt and asset restructuring plans.
In the past, Japanese banks have relied on economic growth to pull them out
of trouble by creating opportunities to sell debt-laden assets. This time,
bankers will have a long wait before they can be sure that they are free of
their problems.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (7): Scandals dash
recovery hopes - Brokers face the worst slump since the 1960s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a return in investor confidence toward the Tokyo stock market have
been dashed by the recent scandals involving manipulation by brokers of
clients' investment accounts.
The revelations of the tobashi disputes - brokers trying to window-dress
clients' accounts by shifting loss-making investments - could not have come
at a worse time. Japanese brokers, already battered by the sharp falls in
stock prices in 1990, and deteriorating investor confidence brought on by
last year's revelations of stock scandals, face the worst slump in prices
and turnover since the 1960s.
Daily activity in the stock market has remained below the 300m level, as
investors have continued to shun equity investments. In February, daily
average volume fell to 196m shares, the lowest level since June 1982, down
from more than 1bn at the height of the bull market. Analysts point out that
to break even, the large brokers need at least 300m shares, while for the
medium and smaller brokers, the figure rises to 500m to 700m.
The Big Four brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities
and Yamaichi Securities - recently revised down their profit forecasts for
the year to March. Only Nomura managed to maintain net profits. Yamaichi and
Nikko have been hurt by the market slump, and Daiwa, which expects to be in
the black at the pre-tax level, is forecasting a net loss of Y43bn due to
extraordinary losses of Y72bn from the tobashi scandals.
However, problems at the Big Four, which have corporate underwriting
business as one of their main pillars of business, are not as severe as
those at the medium-sized brokers, which rely heavily on brokerage
commissions.
Of Japan's 260-odd brokers, the medium-sized brokers, which invested heavily
in computer networks and increased overheads to maintain competitiveness,
have been hit the hardest. Nine out of 10 the ten second-tier brokers expect
earnings losses on both pre-tax and after-tax levels.
Since costs on capital investments are fixed and staff cuts are not normal
practice in Japan, the brokers have resorted cutting expenses such as
advertising and entertainment, closing branches, and selling off real estate
holdings.
Takagi Securities, a medium-sized broker listed on the second section,
recently announced the closure of its London-based affiliate. Larger
second-tier brokers, such as New Japan Securities and Sanyo Securities, have
started to close domestic branches.
Yet, cost-cutting schemes are not as drastic as one may expect. Analysts
point out that such moves will not be enough to compensate for the sharp
declines in revenue. 'Brokerages don't have much fat on them, thus there
isn't much room for cost-cutting,' says Mr Robert Zielinski, financial
analyst at Jardine Fleming.
With an increase in competition due to financial liberalisation slated for
next year, where barriers between the banking and securities industry are
being eased, restructuring of the securities industry seems unavoidable.
However, Mr Zielinski says as long as companies refuse to cut staff,
rationalisation of the industry brokers will occur when some securities
companies fail. 'There is no use in combining two small losers into one big
loser,' he says.
While small brokers in the UK and US operate in niche markets, Japanese
brokerages are not specialised, and for most brokers, the bulk of operations
are concentrated in Tokyo. In a desperate attempt to survive, brokers have
tried to attract individual investors back into the market by promoting
long-term stock investments, rather than increasing turnover by telling
investors to buy and sell stocks on a short-term basis.
Looking after the individual client's 'portfolio' has become the trend in
the industry. 'We're telling customers that stocks will surely rise in five
years' time,' says Mr Kikuo Noguchi, managing director of National
Securities.
Some analysts point out that such a strategy would not work considering the
nature of the industry and the untrained salespeople. Volume in the late 80s
was generated by the Big Four promoting issues they had underwritten using
'themes'. The brokers would think up a theme which would give a reason for a
stock to rise. The theme would be used to orchestrate buying among
institutional investors, and also to convince individuals to commit funds to
the market.
However, such techniques are now frowned upon by authorities, and investors
are becoming more concerned about the real 'value' of their stock
investments, such as price earnings ratios and dividend ratios.
'Using themes is the only way the Big Four brokers know how to sell stocks,
and following the Big Four is the only way the smaller brokers know how to
do business,' says Mr Kiyoshi Nikami, senior economist at Japan Securities
Research Institute. Mr Nikami says smaller brokers are even starting to
grumble that the present slump has been brought on by the lack of thematic
trading generated by the Big Four.
Futures and options trading has also been blamed as another culprit of the
market slump by smaller brokers. Initial resentment that heavy activity in
the futures markets was distorting the thin cash markets, was focused on
foreign brokers who have been generating profits by actively trading the
futures and options markets.
Tensions between foreign houses, which are leading players of the derivative
markets, and financial authorities are rising as authorities try to curb
derivatives trading through restrictive measures.
Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director at Nomura Securities, says
that the reactions of the Japanese brokers and authorities is unavoidable.
'If Japanese brokers were making huge profits in New York while US houses
were losing money, what would happen?' he asks.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (5): Ripples of the
'bubble boom' - There are signs the property market will soon touch bottom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN EBISU, on the fringe of central Tokyo, the Shinozaki real estate agency
is able to find tenants as soon as new apartments surface, and rents are
high and still rising. But, in Osaka, Japan's second largest city,
developers are struggling to find buyers for apartments whose prices have
fallen 40 per cent and are still falling.
The downturn in the Japanese property prices over the past two years has
been as erratic as the surge in prices during the 1980s, when speculative
fever gripped investors, and office buildings, resorts and apartment blocks
sprouted in ever more remote areas.
There are signs that the market will soon touch bottom, but property
companies are agreed that recovery will come gradually and unevenly.
Developers say that the rapid build-up of unsold apartments last year has
slowed, while estate agents have noted inquiries increasing in tandem with
the decrease in interest rates. Housing loan approvals in the October to
December quarter rose 29,000 from a year earlier to 131,000.
But there are also concerns that the property debt burden inherited by
Japanese banks will limit their ability to lend for new investment, and that
ill-conceived projects begun before the market downturn will continue to
appear on the market, keeping prices and confidence soft for the next year
or two.
Japanese property, like the stock market, had been regarded as a safe bet in
the 1980s, and even when Tokyo prices rose by 76.8 per cent in 1987, the
general presumption was that the limited supply of land in the capital would
ensure prices could only go higher.
Apartment prices in central Tokyo have been flat for virtually the past
three years, with a fall of just over 1 per cent last year, and the most
widely accepted estimate is that the price of land in Japan has fallen by an
average of about 30 per cent over the past two years.
Professor Shunsuke Ishihara, chairman of the Association for Real Estate
Sciences, reckons that apartment prices in greater Tokyo, including the
Yokohama area, have fallen by an average of 20 per cent, while prices in
Osaka have fallen by 40 per cent since the market turned sour. Meanwhile,
housing starts have fallen from a peak of 1.7m a year in 1990 to 1.37m last
year, and the industry expects demand will remain at around 1.3m units for
the next few years.
'We simply cannot expect the same sort of development growth as the 1980s,
but in the coming four to five years we will see moderate growth of perhaps
4 per cent,' Professor Ishihara said. That is a more modest expectation that
the 22.7 per cent growth in apartment starts in 1987.
Daikyo, the leading apartment builder, has seen its stock of unsold Tokyo
apartments surge from 3,000 in 1990 to 9,000 last year, but said that the
scaling down of new construction plans has already slowed the build-up.
Demand for the company's new Tokyo apartments had been at around 41,500 a
year in 1990, but Mr Katsuhiko Muramoto, Daikyo's deputy-president, said
26,000 apartments a year is a more sustainable level.
'There is still demand for apartments that are reasonably priced and in a
good location. One positive effect of the slowdown is that costs have also
fallen. Land prices are down about 30 per cent, and the construction cost is
now 10 per cent lower than a year ago,' Mr Muramoto said.
However, he said that the average price of a two-bedroom, family-style
apartment has remained steady at around Y59m, and Daikyo is now aiming at
the middle-class buyer with a budget of around Y50m rather than the
wealthier client willing to spend Y100m because the demand for luxury
apartments has been particularly weak in the past year.
The landscape for the office market varies by district, with the Tokyo
business district still showing 99 per cent occupancy, but Ikoma
Corporation, a commercial real estate broker, estimating that the rate has
fallen from 99.7 to 94.5 per cent in the six months to December in one
district on the fringe of the city.
Mr Ippei Itoh, Ikoma's general manager, said that the market has entered a
'very interesting transition period", and that landlords in softer areas
have been forced to be more flexible in negotiating deposits and rents.
'It is still a seller's market in central Tokyo, but prospective tenants are
now at least able to negotiate with landlords. In the past, there was a long
queue of people wanting space,' Mr Itoh said.
He expects that Japanese banks' wariness of the real estate market will
limit the number of new projects in the next year, and lead to a gradual
soaking up of the space excess: 'The banks are very conscious of their
capital adequacy ratios, and they are trying to cope with bad debts now in
real estate.'
The ministry of finance, concerned at the banks' property exposure, had
imposed curbs two years ago on lending for development in the hope of
starving speculators of funds. At the same time, banks have had to assist
clients by holding land off the market, and restructuring a few of their
larger property developer clients.
'We are still feeling the ripples of the bubble boom,' Mr Itoh said.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (4): Tide of funds has
turned - Overseas investment policies are being revised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE good old days of soaring Tokyo stock prices, the easy profits to be
made at home more than compensated for the risks, foreign exchange and
other, of chasing yields in foreign securities markets.
The tide of funds has definitely turned, and Japanese insurance companies
and banks, the leading purchasers of foreign securities, are revising their
longer-term strategies. And, in the short term, they are cashing in some
foreign holdings before the close of the financial year in March.
Spectacular increases in Japanese purchases during the 'bubble' era of the
late 1980s and the sharp fluctuations in capital flows during the past two
years of financial turmoil in Tokyo have complicated the charting of
Japanese investment intentions.
Each of the two eras has been characterised by leaps or plunges in
investment levels and, while calmer, clearer trends are yet to emerge,
Japanese institutions say that the experience has prompted a reappraisal of
their holdings of foreign securities.
Mr Haruaki Deguchi, the senior manager of investment planning at Nippon
Life, said his industry has been 'thinking about rebalancing our assets,
especially our foreign denominated assets'. The likely result, he said, is
that Japanese institutions will reduce the foreign securities share of their
assets, which in his company's case stands at around 19 per cent, to between
10 and 15 per cent.
'We want to change the philosophy of our investments, and we want to reduce
the currency risk. We will be responsible about this change, and keep the
volume of foreign investments at about the same level, but because of the
inflow of our new money, this level will fall as a percentage of total
assets,' Mr Deguchi said.
Instead, Mr Deguchi said, his industry will increase its lending to Japanese
businesses, an option which has become more lucrative with higher domestic
interest rates. This policy coincides with the willingness of Japanese
companies to pay market rates for money, having realised the stock market's
inability to digest equity issues will endure.
'We want middle level returns and low risk, and with the business loans we
can get good interest rate returns and not have to worry about the foreign
currency exposure. We were more interested in higher return, higher risk
investments in the 1980s, but now that our cushion of hidden share profits
is gone, we are more cautious,' Mr Deguchi said.
Net purchases of foreign bonds peaked at Dollars 94.1bn in 1989, fell
sharply to Dollars 29bn in 1990, and recovered to Dollars 68.2bn last year.
The change in direction has been more dramatic in purchases of foreign
stocks, which fell from Dollars 17.9bn in 1989, to Dollars 6.3bn in 1990 and
Dollars 3.6bn last year. For January, net sales of foreign stocks were
Dollars 2.4bn, a record, and the figure is expected to remain high in
February and March.
Meanwhile, direct investment also slowed last year, down from Dollars 48bn
in 1990 to Dollars 31.2bn last year, the ministry of finance reported. The
fall was caused partly by the difficult financial conditions at home, which
have increased the cost of capital and made companies more selective about
foreign exposure, particularly in property markets.
Leading property investors during the late 1980s, including EIE
International and Kumagai Gumi, the construction company, have become
sellers. Life insurance companies have reduced purchases, and medium-sized
industrial companies which dabbled unsuccessfully in foreign property are
unlikely to return to the market for a while.
Manufacturers are continuing to invest in foreign production facilities, as
the labour shortage at home and the promise of lower production costs in
other Asian countries, particularly southern China, remain good reasons to
invest. Some companies are delaying investment plans because of falling
profits at home, though, for others, the tougher conditions are an incentive
to establish facilities abroad.
Acquisitions of foreign companies also declined last year, with purchases of
US companies down from Dollars 11.9bn to Dollars 3.8bn, according to Ulmer
Brothers of the US. Japanese takeovers in Europe rose in number from 70 to
72, though the value of the acquisitions fell from Dollars 3.9bn to Dollars
1.9bn.
Foreign bonds will remain the prime target for institutional money, but Mr
Motoharu Fujikura, the director of the international capital division at the
ministry of finance, said the yen's weakness over the past month has
provided an incentive for companies to reduce US bond holdings.
Mr Fujikura explains the pool of life insurance funds has also been partly
drained by an increase in demand for subordinated loans from banks, which
are seeking to bolster capital adequacy ratios eroded by the effects of weak
Tokyo stock prices on their unrealised gains on shareholdings .
'When we look at future trends, we obviously have to take into consideration
the international economic situation. The insurance companies have been
increasing their loans to banks, and if domestic interest rates remain high,
they will increase their business loans. They are very concerned about the
exchange rate risk,' Mr Fujikura said.
While the level of funds invested abroad may be smaller, the sophistication
of the investments will increase, according to Mr Deguchi at Nippon Life. He
said that 'we will have to work harder as investors', and this will mean
becoming more familiar with emerging investment opportunities in Asia and
Europe, and less focused on the US.
'In Asia the level of growth attracts us, but the legal restrictions on
investment make it difficult. You have to worry about currency and tax
regulations. That is why loans to Japanese companies are very attractive,'
Mr Deguchi said.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (3): More call for
change - Stock Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLS for radical change in the structure of the Japanese stock market are
no longer the preserve of foreign analysts.
The persistent weakness of stock prices is leading even those close to the
heart of the system to question whether a rally can be sustained without a
change in the attitude of Japanese companies and investors towards equity
investment.
Last year, many market participants were anticipating a cyclical upturn in
equity prices as lower interest rates fed into an improved economic outlook
and increased buying of equities by domestic investors.
Foreign investors shared this view, pumping Dollars 46bn into the market
last year at a time when most domestic investors remained on the sidelines.
Yet even though short-term interest rates have been cut to 4.5 per cent,
from 6 per cent in 1990, equity prices remain in the doldrums. The Nikkei
index closed below 20,000 on March 16 for the first time since February
1987.
There is a perception that the equity market has never found a level at
which an equilibrium of buyers and sellers provides a foundation for
recovery. 'Tokyo stock prices were never allowed to hit bottom,' argued Mr
Gilles Piard, president of Societe Generale in Tokyo. 'We are now caught in
the silt.'
The main target for domestic criticism is the low level of dividends paid by
Japanese companies. Even after a near 50 per cent fall in share prices since
1989, the Tokyo stock market yields just 0.7 per cent.
The Japanese Securities Dealers Association recently issued guidelines which
would prevent companies which pay out less than 30 per cent of earnings in
dividends from issuing more shares raising equity-linked finance.
In the absence of dividend income, the only incentive to buy Japanese
equities is the prospect of a large capital gain. Since there is now deep
uncertainty about the prospect for share price appreciation, domestic buying
of equities has almost ceased.
Daily turnover on the Tokyo stock exchange now averages around 200m shares,
well below the peak of 1,700m shares a day in June 1988.
Yet the low level of dividends may only be a symptom of a deeper malaise.
Low dividends are partly the result of the system of equity cross-holdings
between Japanese companies. Analysts estimate out of a total market
capitalisation of Y340,000bn, only Y150,000bn is ever likely to be traded.
The rest comprises long-term strategic stakes which cement relationships
between corporations.
In addition, many companies diverted surplus cash into the equity market in
the 1980s as a way of boosting profitability. The money was mostly invested
through tokkin funds, which allow the companies to account separately for
financial assets and convert the capital gain from rising stock prices into
a cash dividend.
Until recently, pension funds and life assurance companies have also not
demanded dividend growth. Most face only limited competition and fixed
liabilities rather than pay-outs linked to inflation. Investment strategy
has been geared to security rather than real dividend growth.
However, even if Japanese companies paid out all of their forecast 1991
earnings in dividends the Tokyo stock market would still yield only 2 per
cent. Inflation is forecast to run at about 2 per cent this year.
Such figures have prompted calls for a change in industrial objectives away
from the pursuit of market share and towards higher margins.
'Japanese companies must start to concentrate on return on equity rather
than market share,' commented Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director
at Nomura. 'This should be reflected in accountability and the treatment of
shareholders.'
Until these kinds of structural changes are achieved, the only factor likely
to support stock prices is anticipation of economic recovery, a further
expansion of global market share by Japanese companies and a resulting rise
in share prices. A favourite analogy among analysts is that the Japanese
economy and stock market is like a bicycle: it can only remain in balance
when travelling fast. It remains to be seen whether the authorities can
generate sufficient economic momentum to restore confidence.
Monetary easing alone has yet to provide sufficient stimulus and many
economists see the need for a substantial fiscal boost. Yet there is little
prospect of an expansionary fiscal policy while government remains
preoccupied with the recent succession of financial scandals. The budget
before the upper house of the Japanese parliament will increase government
expenditure by a modest 2.7 per cent.
Meanwhile, analysts are forecasting a 15-18 per cent decline in corporate
earnings for the year to the end of March. A 6-8 per cent decline is
expected for the year ended March 1993.
The squeeze on corporate profits could multiply into further stock market
weakness. Liquidation corporate sector financial assets was a key factor in
the fall of the Nikkei average below 20,000 as tokkin funds were wound down
ahead of the year end.
Mr Peter Tasker, equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson, estimated that
Y6,000 to Y8,000bn equity investments held by tokkin funds could be
liquidated this year. This amounts to around 5 per cent of liquid market
capitalisation.
If it comes, the impact of such a liquidation will depend on whether other
buyers have returned. Anecdotal evidence suggests the consistent buying of
equities by overseas investors has now ceased. Against this, Japanese retail
investors bought a net Y50bn equities in February, the first month of net
buying since April 1991.
Many analysts do see long-term value in Japanese equities at present levels.
Mr Peter Norton, head of research at Baring Securities in Japan, predicts
profits growth of up to 25 per cent in the year to March 1994 as Japanese
companies benefit from a cyclical upturn in the world economy and greater
efficiency, particularly in the service sector.
Mr Norton's biggest concern is that the domestic focus has swung too far
towards gloomy introspection. 'The weakness of the equity market is in
itself distorting perceptions of the fundamental strengths of the Japanese
economy,' he said.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (2): Slower pace
pleases dealers - The bond market has enjoyed something of a surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the Japanese equity market has suffered declines in trading volume and
prices over the past year, the bond market has enjoyed something of a surge.
Falling interest rates and an improving inflation outlook have contributed
to a rally in Japanese government bond (JGB) prices. Bond yields at the
10-year maturity have fallen from a high of 8.72 per cent in September 1990
to around 5.4 per cent.
While the rally has been based squarely on domestic economic fundamentals,
overseas buying of JGBs has added an extra zest to the rise in prices. Last
year overseas investors bought a net Dollars 21bn equivalent Japanese bonds,
following a hefty Dollars 17bn injection of cash in 1990.
However, like the equity market, the Japanese government bond market has
seen a spectacular collapse in trading volume from the inflated levels of
the late 1980s. Last year average daily volume in the cash market ran at
around Y4,000bn - only around half the level of 1987.
But where equity market participants see the decline in trading volume as a
threat to market stability, bond market participants are generally pleased
to see a less frenetic pace of activity.
The decline in volume is almost wholly attributable to a decline in
proprietary trading by the big securities firms and banks. Investors have
stayed in the market and the commissions of brokers has been largely
protected.
The big Japanese banks and securities companies still take large positions
in the market. Daiwa, which accounted for around 15 per cent of all market
turnover last year, estimated that around 40 per cent of its cash market
activity is related to proprietary trading.
However, the number of active players has declined and with it the volume of
trading on intermediaries' own accounts. At the peak of the market there
were 25 banks with active JGB operations and 30 securities firms. Dealers
estimated only a dozen securities firms and perhaps four banks were now
active.
The decline in large position-taking has changed the behaviour of the
market. 'In the past dealers were only interested in whether Nomura was
buying or selling on any given day. Now the JGB market has become more
rational,' commented Mr Eric Miller, head of bond futures at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
The decline of market volatility has been accelerated by the development of
financial instruments which allow intermediaries and investors to hedge bond
market positions. Market participants can now choose from listed bond
futures, over-the-counter options and options on futures.
By far the most popular derivative financial product is the 10-year bond
futures contract listed on the Tokyo stock exchange, which trades an average
of 2m contracts a month. Open interest is at present Y15,000bn.
As with the cash market, futures trading volume has declined as speculative
money has left the market. Open interest in the 10-year bond future reached
Y18,000bn in 1989. Ten-year futures trading volume is down by around 30 per
cent on its 1989 peak.
The concentration of cash and futures trading activity at the 10-year
maturity is seen as a weakness by many market participants. The designated
'benchmark' 10-year government bond issue attracts 99 per cent of all cash
market volume.
Investors do not have access to a liquid financial instrument through which
they can manage exposure to medium-term interest rate risk. Intermediaries
can not easily undertake arbitrage trading by, for example, taking a short
position in a non-benchmark government bond issue.
The lack of arbitrage trading between different maturities can lead to
prolonged pricing anomalies which would soon be closed in other markets.
Some of the structural shortcomings of the Japanese bond market may be
apparent to investors at the present time.
The best of the bull market in 10-year Japanese government bonds may now be
over. While economists are anticipating at least another half point cut in
official interest rates, bond yields at the benchmark 10-year maturity are
probably close to bottoming out. Many investors are looking to switch into
shorter-dated bonds, but are struggling to find appropriate liquid
instruments.
Japan is also notable for lacking a developed corporate bond market -
something that bankers are keen to remedy.
In the past, most Japanese companies have raised debt finance either from
banks or in the international bond market, not least because the fees of
underwriting firms were lower.
But new practices have emerged and fees are being trimmed. Last autumn,
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone launched the first Japanese domestic bond
issue sold to investors under the fixed price re-offer mechanism favoured in
the international bond market.
Companies are also being allowed to issue shorter maturity bonds. In the
past, only corporate bond issues over five years maturity received
regulatory approval, a policy designed to keep the shorter maturity funding
market free for banks. In January last year, Chugoku Electric launched the
first four-year domestic bond issue by a Japanese corporation. Earlier this
year Tokyo Electric Power launched the a three-year issue.
The combination of new techniques, lower fees and more flexible maturities
is likely to attract more Japanese companies to the domestic bond market in
favour of the international market.
Formidable obstacles to the development of a liquid corporate bond market do
remain, however. For example, clearing and settlement of corporate bonds
remains cumbersome. Banks and securities firms have yet to agree on how a
new streamlined system would work.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (1): Toiling in the
rubble - The atmosphere is so gloomy in Japanese financial markets that bad
news has lost the capacity to surprise. There was hardly a ripple of
reaction when the Nikkei index hit its lowest point in five years. But there
are a few glimmers of hope amid the recession
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN'S financial companies are labouring among the ruins after the collapse
of the boom of the 1980s.
Some are being crushed by the weight of the debt and over-priced assets they
bear. Others are trying to forage in the rubble. Many more are keeping their
heads low, hiding in the cellars waiting for the day when it is once more
safe to venture out.
The atmosphere is so gloomy that bad news has lost the capacity to surprise.
Financial scandals barely raise eyebrows. There was hardly a ripple of
reaction when the Nikkei index this month fell through the 20,000 level and
hit its lowest point in five years. 'There are no buyers in the market right
now, only sellers. This year will be tough, just like last year. The next
few years will also be tough,' says Mr Koji Hoshi, a research director at
Daiichi Life, the life insurer.
The main hope is that the authorities will lower interest rates and increase
public spending to stimulate the sagging economy and bring back confidence
into the markets. But, while the real economy might well respond to such
treatment, it is not clear that the financial markets would also spring back
to life. Bankers and brokers are haunted by the shades of the 1960s when the
stock markets fell into a deep recession even though the economy grew at a
record rate.
The effects of the financial slump are not altogether bad - companies are
being forced to restructure to achieve greater profits from core businesses,
instead of relying on capital gains to bail them out. They need time to
restore their scandal-tainted public reputations. Also, businessmen must
come to terms with 10 years of financial deregulation. Moreover, Japanese
financial companies' international competitors also face severe problems,
particularly in the property market.
As Mr Yoh Kurosawa, the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, says:
'The situation in the Japanese property market is serious, but it is much
better than New York, or London, or Melbourne. '
But many executives are too preoccupied with the short-term to look far
ahead. The biggest problem is dealing with those investors who bought
high-priced assets - chiefly stocks and land - they can no longer afford to
keep.
Bankruptcies are mounting - companies which went bust last year left debts
totalling Y8,000bn, four times higher than in 1990, according to Teikoku
Databank, a credit research agency. It estimates 1992 could see a further
100 per cent increase.
Published bankruptcies are the tip of the iceberg. The largest among them -
Ms Nui Onoue, an Osaka restaurateur and stock investor, who was arrested for
forging deposit certificates - owes Y410bn. This is dwarfed by a contingent
of over-extended international property groups - including Shuwa, EIE
International which each owe over Y1,000bn.
Among lenders, the most exposed are financial companies, which were often
prepared to grant credit to borrowers rejected by banks. Teikoku estimates
that some Y30,000-Y40,000bn of finance company debt to property companies
may be hard to recover.
This does not put the banks in the clear, since many of the most aggressive
finance companies are bank affiliates, such as Kogin Lease, which is tied to
the Industrial Bank of Japan.
The burden is already pushing smaller banks into forced marriages with big
groups. The Bank of Japan is doing its utmost to arrange mergers to prevent
even a single bank failure. It denies categorically that the health of the
financial system is in doubt.
But even if the survival of large institutions is not in question their
ability to serve borrowers is. Dealing with bad debts is absorbing capital
and management time, leaving less aside for new opportunities. Also, since
Japanese banks count part of their stock holdings as capital, the decline in
equities is also eroding their capital.
They have successfully boosted their reserves by raising subordinated debt
but this is a temporary solution. The only long-term answer is to improve
the profitability of the basic business, for example, by increasing loans
spreads.
Stockbroking companies are in an even worse position. Banks at least have
some good new businesses to develop, such as consumer lending. But the
collapse in equity trading has robbed the securities industry of its main
revenues. The settlement of post-boom disputes with investment clients has
also brought brokers heavy losses.
For the year to the end of this month, 10 of the top 14 brokers have
forecast pre-tax losses, including a Y34bn loss at Yamaichi Securities, the
weakest of the Big Four companies. Smaller houses are already being taken
over in rescue deals. The longer the recession lasts, the more likely it is
that some larger companies will suffer the same fate.
Financial companies are cutting costs. Advertising and entertainment budgets
were the first to suffer. Next, came computer investment bills. Now, smaller
companies are closing offices, including high-cost foreign outposts.
Stockbrokers, the worst-hit businesses, are slashing recruitment - even
Nomura Securities, the strongest group, is reducing its graduate intake -
from 1,525 last year to 1,000 in 1992 and possibly as few as 500 in 1992.
For the moment, Japanese industry does not feel starved of funds. With the
economy slowing, inventories are being run down and investments postponed.
Companies are running down the cash reserves they accumulated in the 1980s
but the levels are still high by past standards - according to the Bank of
Japan, the ratio of corporate liquid reserves to monthly sales stood near
the end of last year at 1.7, down from a peak of 2.0 but well above the
average of the early 1980s of 1.2.
Where companies are cutting capital investment it is usually not because of
fund-raising problems, but because of their gloomy views of product markets.
It follows that further cuts in interest rates could have less impact on the
real economy than the Bank of Japan might hope. As Mr Masashi Kojima, the
president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest company, says:
'Interest rates coming down will not stimulate the economy because there is
an underlying lack of demand.'
Slow growth would prolong the recession in the financial markets. Financial
institutions have always in the past relied on growth to pull them out of
trouble by creating opportunities for even bad assets to be sold off. This
time, the stock and property markets seem so weak that the possibility of
large-scale asset sales seem remote.
Yet, there are are a few glimmers of hope. Even though the stock market has
fallen through the 20,000 level, it has not dropped far below its range of
the past 18 months. Even though few stockbrokers predict a strong recovery
from these levels, prices might, perhaps, fall no further.
Similarly, parts of the property market show signs of life. After falling 30
per cent or so, prices may have stabilised in areas where there is real
demand from users. Estate agents are reporting interest from potential
buyers of small flats.
The other positive sign, is that the authorities have, so far, done very
little to prop up the markets. At the ministry of finance, officials insist
that market forces must be allowed to rule. They remain committed to a
programme of further financial liberalisation - which includes lowering the
barriers between banking and stockbroking and more interest rate
deregulation. Meanwhile, at the Bank of Japan, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the
governor, refuses to accelerate his plans to cut interest rates.
There is an element of bluff in the authorities' position. To prevent others
from panicking, they must stay ultra-calm themselves. But, it is worth
remembering that these are officials brought up in a strong interventionist
tradition. The fact that they have so far resisted the temptation to act,
indicates they hope financial companies can cope with the problems
themselves.
This hope may prove to be misplaced. For example, the authorities are
finding it difficult to persuade big banks to bail out Toyo Shinkin, the
small Osaka bank which was involved with Ms Onoue. A rescue package will
almost certainly have to be topped up with public funds.
However, it is a long way from one or two rescues, or even 10, to a more
general crisis of confidence in Japan's financial markets. Whether the
current financial recession might turn into such a crisis is impossible to
say. But for the moment it seems unlikely.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Romanian ruling party faces test of unity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S RULING party, the National Salvation Front (NSF), faces a severe
test of unity as it gathers today in Bucharest at the start of its annual
convention.
Open factions have developed within the NSF in recent weeks, following the
party's poor showing in February's local elections.
The NSF, which was returned to power in May 1990 with two-thirds of the
vote, is now under pressure to resolve its problems ahead of general
elections due this summer.
At the heart of the party's troubles is a bitter rift between supporters of
Mr Ion Iliescu, the president, and those favouring Mr Petre Roman, the
former prime minister and NSF national leader.
Mr Roman's reformist government was dismissed in September 1991 by Mr
Iliescu following three days of miner-led strikes, but, until now, Mr Roman
has managed to retain titular party leadership.
But Mr Roman's position looks increasingly vulnerable and party sources say
his support is diminishing. Depending on the outcome of the convention, he
may even leave the NSF and form a new party.
Earlier this week a parliamentary commission accused Mr Roman's government
of misappropriating more than Dollars 120m from state funds in 1991. In a
highly politicised report, the commission also alleged that Mr Roman's two
cabinets had acted unprofessionally and had lacked accurate information
about the country's economic situation.
Mr Roman has strenuously denied the charges. He says the commission's
accusations are unsubstantiated and designed to undermine his position
before the NSF convention.
Furthermore, Mr Roman has accused Mr Iliescu of 'behaving
unconstitutionally' by involving himself in the NSF's internal affairs. The
president, who was a founding member of the NSF in December 1989 following
the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime, has held several meetings of party
leaders in the past month.
Under the Romanian constitution, the president is supposed to be above party
politics.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Investment fund of Dollars
50m planned for Caribbean
</HEADLINE>

   By CANUTE JAMES

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 50m INVESTMENT fund for the Caribbean is being planned by the
Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom).
The community's 13 member-governments have invited finance houses in Europe
and North America to make proposals for setting up the fund, which is to
invest in equities of companies in all Commonwealth Caribbean countries.
Government officials say there has already been a show of interest from some
companies, including the Crown Agents and John Govett of the UK, and some
financial services conglomerates in the Caribbean.
Institutions such as the International Finance Corporation of the World
Bank, the Inter-American Investment Corporation, an arm of the
Inter-American Development Bank, and the European Investment Bank are also
said to be interested.
The move to deregulated economies in the region has created many new
investment opportunities, said Mr Vivian Brown, executive director of the
policy review unit in the office of the Jamaican prime minister.
The sponsors of the fund, to contain both quoted and unquoted companies,
will be expected to raise capital through methods such as private placements
with institutional investors. The community will decide in July which
finance house has been approved.
Companies in the community have had only moderate success in attracting
capital, and depend on commercial and development banks. Some governments
are unhappy that the sale of state enterprises has given new foreign
investors control of companies in the region. Bankers say the fund would be
a more palatable method for financing divestment and business expansion.
Caricom is offering a range of incentives for the fund, including the
ability to remit dividends and capital gains free of withholding taxes.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Anti-climax for the venture adventure - The
sale of Hill Samuel's development capital arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENTURE CAPITAL is acknowledged to be a risky business. The small, unquoted
companies in which venture capitalists invest are more prone than their
larger, quoted counterparts to go bust.
But this week's decision by Hill Samuel, the hard-pressed merchant banking
arm of the TSB banking group, to put its development capital arm up for
sale, demonstrates that risk is not always in the most obvious place.
Hill Samuel's move will have caused managers in the UK's other large
bank-owned venture capital companies to ponder their parent company's
commitment to the sector. Most of the large clearing and merchant banking
groups have venture, or more usually, development capital arms. Many of the
banks, like Hill Samuel, are nursing large provisions made necessary by
losses in other areas.
Hill Samuel decided to pull out of venture capital not because it was making
losses  - the bank insists it was successful  - but because of a need to
concentrate on activities with a more rapid pay-off. It expects to contract
out the management of its portfolio.
'Business was going very well,' said Mr Andrew Joy, managing director of
Hill Samuel Development Capital (HSDC). 'The TSB Group has decided to
concentrate on businesses which don't require a medium-term view.'
Hill Samuel is the first of the major UK banking groups to withdraw from
venture capital. But this is the second time in just over a year that a
UK-based venture capital company has fallen victim to a change of strategy
at group headquarters.
In February 1991 Security Pacific Hoare Govett Equity Ventures was closed
down by Security Pacific as part of a restructuring of its worldwide
operations, in spite of making Pounds 14m profit in the year before it
closed.
These two venture capital closures have come at a time of growing pressures
on the industry. Ironically, most concern within the sector had been focused
on the independent firms which have to raise their funds from fickle
institutional investors.
A growing number of the independents have been unable to raise new funds for
investment and are now engaged in managing their existing portfolios until
they mature. Further discreet withdrawals among the independents are
expected. But Hill Samuel demonstrates that even venture capitalists within
a large financial group cannot count on continued access to funds.
HSDC's operations were very modest  - it had a fund of just Pounds 20m plus
a further Pounds 100m allocation from Hill Samuel Bank  - so its disposal
will not have a significant financial impact on the industry.
But the decision to withdraw emphasises the uncertainty facing the sector,
which has suffered a severe bruising over the past two years. In the early
1980s venture capital had a glamorous image and banks and other financial
groups were only too keen to move into this market.
But recently venture capital has been hit by a combination of self-inflicted
blows and adverse developments beyond its control. It has:
failed to deliver the annual returns of 30 to 40 per cent promised in the
early 1980s;
come under pressure from institutional investors to provide better value for
money from the management fees it charges;
suffered damage to its image as a backer of small business because of a
shift in emphasis to large management buy-outs, some of which have run into
difficulties;
seen the recession batter the small and medium-sized companies in which it
invests.
After a decade of rapid growth the venture capital industry is now having to
cope with the problems of retrenchment. The indications are that it will get
worse before it gets better. This is the second timein just over a year
thata UK-based venturecapital company hasfallen victim to achange of
strategy atgroup headquarters

FT  26 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE burst of activity enlivened a quiet session in the futures market
yesterday, writes Christopher Price.
The March contract opened at 2,448 and was squeezed up to 2,455 by
independent traders covering short positions. It then proceeded to trade in
a very narrow range in a quiet morning session.
A firm opening from Wall Street improved sentiment, but it was not until
political factors came into play late in the afternoon that buying started
in earnest, taking March to a premium, from a discount to cash where it had
traded most of the day. A surge in the Paris bourse, on rumours of the prime
minister's resignation and a possible cut in interest rates, was the first
factor to stimulate London trading.
Further interest was sparked by a rumour of a favourable opinion poll for
the British Conservative party in today's press.
March closed at 2,465, up 10 points from the previous session and at a
two-point premium to the cash market. Volume was a low 4,407 contracts.
Trading in the LTOM was also low at 14,000 contracts. Storehouse was the
busiest traded option on 1,525 lots, followed by Abbey National on 400 and
the Euro-FTSE on 391.

FT  26 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally breathes life into
equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS difficult to decide which caused the loudest groans of disappointment
around the City of London's dealing rooms yesterday; the results of the
latest batch of opinion polls or England's defeat at the hands of Pakistan
in the world cup cricket final in Australia.
But dealers quickly forgot the cricket, turning instead to financial
matters. By the end of the day they had become positively enthusiastic about
the chances of yet another turnround in the polls, with the market alive to
stories that Gallup, in this morning's Daily Telegraph, will reveal the
Tories catching up on Labour.
There was also a late charge of excitement as French bonds ran up amid
suggestions of a cut in French interest rates, along with stories that the
French prime minister could be facing her removal from office.
The flurry of late support prompted an abrupt about turn by the FT-SE
100-share Index, which rallied strongly after an uncertain start to close a
net 6.2 higher at 2,464.9.
There were also more than a few crumbs of comfort for the market from a
series of encouraging company news statements, notably from Reckitt &amp;
Colman, the health and household group, Hepworth, the building products
group, and particularly from Barratt Developments, one of the UK's leading
housebuilders.
The latest general election campaigning and opinion poll results set the
tone for the day's session in the market. The three most recent polls
overturned the Conservatives' five-point lead indicated on Tuesday by Harris
in the Daily Express, giving Labour a lead over the ruling Conservatives by
one, three and four points.
There was no real panic in the market at the outset, with marketmakers
chopping opening dealing levels to deter any potential big sellers. The
opening gambit proved moderately successful, with light selling sending the
Footsie down to the day's low of 2,448.0 within an hour of the opening.
Thereafter, the index clawed its way back, eventually moving into positive
territory towards the close of trading, responding to the opinion poll
optimism, the French rate cut story and a rally on Wall Street.
Although happy with the market's late improvement, senior traders pointed to
the pitiful level of turnover in the equity market. Yesterday saw turnover
of 425.3m shares recorded, well down on Tuesday's 493.2m. Activity is
expected to remain very thin until the election.
Equity strategists said the market had mostly factored in the increased
chances of either a straight Labour win or a Labour-dominated hung
parliament. This was the view adopted by Strauss Turnbull, the stockbroker,
whose strategist Mr Ian Harnett maintained that the market's potential
upside was still slightly more than its downside.
The best individual performances among the Footsie stocks included two of
the world's big drug companies, Glaxo and Wellcome, with the latter strongly
supported ahead of today's preliminary figures and the former boosted by US
support. Guinness responded to official confirmation that the Warren
Buffett-run Berkshire Hathaway had bought a near two per cent stake.

brief boost

<TEXT>
Wall Street
FURTHER signs of recovery in the housing market helped provide a boost to US
stock markets early yesterday, but a rush of late sellers left leading
indices slightly lower at the end of trading, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 1.57 off at 3,259.39 after
waves of selling in the final half-hour had wiped 14 points off the index.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, moving in similar fashion, lost 1.36 at 407.52,
while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks ended just 0.80 up at
619.48. New York SE turnover came to 192.6m shares.
Although prices opened weaker, the market judged the morning's economic data
as a positive influence on sentiment and by late morning the leading indices
had moved into the black. The clear good news was the 9.3 per cent rise in
February existing home sales.
The 0.1 per cent decline in February durable goods orders was disappointing,
although a closer examination showed that non-defence orders rose for the
third successive month, which some analysts said was evidence of a revival
in the industrial sector.
Airlines remained under pressure after Tuesday's heavy profit-taking. Delta
was hardest hit, with trading delayed due to an order imbalance on the sell
side as the second analyst in two days lowered his earnings estimate on
concern about falling passenger-mile yields. When business resumed, Delta
fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 3/4 .
Federated Department Stores, the retailing group which emerged from
bankruptcy last month, moved forward Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 15 3/8 after
County NatWest upgraded its rating from a 'hold' to an 'accumulate'. On
Tuesday, Federated said it would soon launch its computerised inventory
system to improve co-ordination between suppliers and vendors.
Commodore International jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 3/8 after the
company was cleared of any tax liability under a settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service on all major issues relating to Commodore's tax
litigation between 1981 and 1986.
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 128 1/2 in the wake of
its acquisition of Fox Software.
American Mobile Systems dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 4 5/8 after its
president was said to have been suspended and an investigation opened into
the unauthorised transfer of Dollars 4.1m out of company accounts.
Canada
BANK AND real estate issues rebounded as the Toronto market began shaking
off nervousness over Olympia &amp; York's financial difficulties, and gold
shares rallied from recent weakness.
The composite index picked up 14.5 to 3,452.3 and rises led falls by 318 to
244 after volume of 35.1m shares.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops on poor figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR dropped against key currencies yesterday after disappointing US
economic statistics offered little hope of prospects for recovery from the
recession, writes Andrew Jack.
Early on, its downside was tested, since the dollar has failed recently to
break through the DM1.68 topside. It fell to its considered sup-port level
of DM1.6550 at mid-session.
The US Commerce Department released durable goods figures for February
showing a decline of 0.1 per cent against a revised rise of 2.4 per cent for
January, driven by declining demand for industrial machinery, electrical
equipment and defence orders. That compared with expectations of between 1
and 2 per cent growth, and helped to push the dollar down half a pfennig to
DM1.65.
It later rallied on statistics from the US National Association of Realtors
showing existing home sales for February were up 16.1 per cent from a year
earlier. At the London close, the US unit was down from DM1.6665 to
DM1.6520.
Mr Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in London said: 'The market
was relatively soft all day. But it is difficult to take too seriously these
figures on changes in the economy.' He added that housing sales only
supported what was already known.
He said the market was waiting for a series of important indicators for
March which would be released next week and provide more solid evidence of
whether the US recession is ending.
Earlier in Asian trading, the dollar had closed little changed against the
yen at Y133.78 compared with Y133.50/60 at Tuesday's Tokyo close. It was
easier against the D-Mark at DM1.6608, down from Tuesday's DM1.6635/40
finish in Tokyo.
Dealers attributed the fall to stop-loss selling from early European traders
caught long in dollars. The D-Mark ended at Y80.55, against a previous close
of Y80.20.
In New York yesterday the dollar finished unchanged from London at DM1.6520
but mildly higher at Y133.50.
In Europe, the dollar also fell from SFr1.5140 to SFr1.5025 against the
Swiss franc, and from FFr5.6525 to FFr5.6140 against the French franc. There
were also declines against the Australian and Canadian dollars.
The US currency's poor performance allowed sterling to pick up in London
yesterday in spite of the uncertainty surrounding the latest batch of
opinion polls on the UK general election. The pound rose almost a cent to
end at Dollars 1.7287, and later in New York closed higher at Dollars
1.7320.
Sterling managed to gain 0.1 on its exchange rate index to 90.1, but
remained firmly placed at the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism
and declined 39 basis points against the D-Mark to finish at DM2.8596.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Cricket stops trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market was subdued during the day, with several dealers suggesting the
low levels of trade in the morning were driven by the distraction of the
world cricket cup being played in Australia, writes Andrew Jack.
One dealer said the match had driven many traders into pubs with televisions
where they could watch the proceedings in Melbourne.
The UK opinion polls continued to inject an element of uncertainty into the
market, with the latest suggesting a hung parliament. One dealer argued that
much of the effect of the election had already been discounted, with upward
shifts in the long end reflecting the uncertainties surrounding either a
Labour victory or coalition government.
The overnight rate held at around 10 1/4 -10 per cent in the morning before
rising slightly to 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent by the end of the day, at the
same level as Tuesday's close of trading.
Three-month money ended at 10 7/8 -10 3/4 , which represented a further
easing of  1/16 per cent on the previous close, while one year stood at
11-10 7/8 per cent.
The June sterling contract finished at 89.14 on a volume slightly above that
of recent days at 29,911. That compared with an opening price of 89.01, down
4 basis points from the close on Tuesday. It fluc-tuated between 88.98 and
89.15 in transactions during the day.
The Bank of England anticipated a shortage of Pounds 400m in the morning,
driven mainly by Pounds 420m in bills for repurchase by the market and
Pounds 269m in treasury bills and maturing assistance, offset by Pounds 395m
in exchequer transactions.
The Bank did not operate in the market during the morning, and revised its
shortage to Pounds 250m at midday. In the afternoon it purchased bills
totalling Pounds 79m in Band 1 at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late
assistance of around Pounds 30m.
German call money remained at the high levels already seen earlier this week
in spite of an injection of DM6bn at the securities repurchase tender. The
Bundesbank accepted bids for DM11.5bn of 28-day repo funds, allocated at
mostly 9.55 per cent. Call money was quoted at 9.65/70 per cent, unchanged
from Tuesday.
The US Federal Reserve refrained from any operations as expected since the
issue of three-day system repurchase agreements on March 23.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iranian smelter plan to go
ahead - A 220,000 tonnes-a-year aluminium project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL FIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT NOW seems that the Al-Mahdi aluminium smelter near Bandar Abbas in
southern Iran is definitely going to be built. Like most big projects, it
has spent a long time at the planning and early construction stages without
the backers feeling utterly certain that they will complete it.
But last week in Tehran the minister of mines and metals, Mr Hussein
Mahlouji, said that the project would be built 'unless something
extraordinary happens', and the managers on site now take it for granted
that 'we're building a smelter'.
The project is owned 60 per cent by the ministry of mines and metals and 40
per cent by the International Development Corporation of Dubai. The IDC, in
turn, is owned principally by the former United Arab Emirates' ambassador to
London, Mr Mahdi Al-Tajir, with the British contractor, George Wimpey, and
the Swiss metals trader, Marc Rich.
The intention is to build a smelter with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes, which
could be expanded to 330,000 tonnes. Actual construction costs are estimated
at Dollars 1.6bn, with financing costs and other spending, before full
production is reached, consuming a further Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m.
So far, camp buildings, apartment blocks, compacting and foundations have
been completed and work on the smelter buildings is expected to start in the
next few weeks. Wimpey is concerned mainly with design and project
management. The actual building to date has been done by Iranian
sub-contractors, an arrangement described by Mahdi Sajjad, who runs IDC, as
'very, very successful'.
Work on the pot rooms in the later stages of construction will be done by
Wimpey with technical help from the Dubai Aluminium Company, which runs the
successful smelter in Dubai. Dubal is selling its technology and generally
advising on the project.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department in London, which put Iran 'on cover'
in December last year, has given Wimpey an indication in principle that it
will back work on Al-Mahdi. But the ECGD has held back from giving actual
guarantees because it worries that the smelter is not in the Iranian
five-year plan and it wants to be sure that there will not be changes in the
project. Now that the smelter has been given the approval of the Iranian
Central Bank and Finance Ministry, as well as the Planning Ministry, the
ECGD is said to be sounding very positive.
The European credit insurance agencies are already issuing guarantees on
exports of equipment, which will be principally German.
The owners feel confident that their smelter will be profitable. Although it
will be far from its source of alumina (aluminium oxide), which will be
Australia, and from its market, which presumably will be mainly the
fast-developing economies of the Far East, the smelter will benefit from
very cheap power, which is the biggest cost in aluminium production.
Mr Sajjad said the Iranians had 'made a bold decision to use their gas
without being too sensitive on how they price it'. The government has been
much more interested in having the smelter as a focus for development and a
source of employment than in extracting every last cent it can from its gas
reserves, which are by far the biggest in the Gulf region.
The smelter project will have its own 450MW power station fed from the
Sarkhoun gas field, which will be a tied source. It is also guaranteed 200MW
from a large 1,200MW power station nearby. The gas and electricity supplies
are priced at levels that will give the smelter the same cost per megawatt
for both its power sources, and, although neither the Iranian government nor
IDC are saying what the prices are, they have made it known that they will
be the cheapest outside Canada. They say the price will be comparable with
hydro-electric power, which in Canada costs some 0.3 to 0.5 US cents per
kilowatt hour.
If aluminium prices have recovered to Dollars 1,500 to Dollars 1,600 a tonne
by the mid-1990s, the owners say they will be perfectly happy. Prices have
fallen from Dollars 1,400 to Dollars 1,500 a tonne two years ago to Dollars
1,300 a tonne, and at one point dipped below Dollars 1,000 a tonne. But the
project's backers believe general trend of world demand, now just over 14m
tonnes a year, is strongly upwards, and everybody concerned is confident
that there will be a place for the smelter's production in the market. A
recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit suggested prices of Dollars
1,750 to Dollars 1,850 a tonne by 1995.
In the past year some old production capacity has been closed and the owners
believe that, when the recession ends, there will be demand for extra output
equivalent to at least two new Al-Mahdi smelters a year. 'You can't build
smelters as fast as that,' said Mr Sajjad.
The backers of Al-Mahdi do not feel threatened by their friends at Dubal,
which has an output of 243,000 tonnes a year, or by the expansion programme
under way to raise capacity at the other Gulf smelter, Aluminium Bahrain
(Alba), from 210,000 tonnes to more than 400,000 tonnes. Nor are they
concerned about a project for a smelter at Yanbu, in Saudi Arabia, where the
backers are still negotiating with the government on loan terms and gas
prices.
In case the market does not evolve as predicted, the Al-Mahdi backers say
they are aiming to make a very high quality ingot, so that at least they
will always be able to sell what they produce. Achieving this requires good
management and the right working discipline, rather than extra investment.
It will be a challenge for a later stage of the project.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US ruling permits logging in
endangered owl forests

<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday gave victory to the US timber industry in yet
another round of its protracted battle with environmentalists concerning the
protection of the Northern Spotted Owl and the forests inhabited by the
endangered bird in the Pacific Northwest.
The court revived a 1989 federal law which barred environmental lawsuits
against logging in old-growth forests in Washington and Oregon states. The
1989 law, supported by the Bush administration in an effort to protect
timber industry jobs, had been struck down in 1990 as unconstitutional by
the ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco.
Yesterday's ruling may permit some 16 blocked timber sales, worth Dollars
30m (Pounds 17.3m). It will have limited impact on the issue of protecting
the owl, as the 1989 bill was due to expire.
Bush administration officials said yesterday they would issue a preservation
plan for the spotted owl in April. They were responding to criticism from
Democratic congressmen who told a House hearing that the White House had
blatantly ignored laws to preserve the owl. Meanwhile, Mr Cy Jamison,
director of the Bureau of Land Management, which controls large tracts of
forest in Oregon, said his agency would run out of marketable timber in the
west of the state by the end of the year.

CANADA EXPECTS to export a record 37m tonnes of wheat in this crop year,
ending July 31, via West and East Coast ports. This would be 1.5m tonnes
more than ever moved before, says the Grain Transportation Agency in
Winnipeg, and reflects a surge in shipments that began about a year ago.
Terminals, railways and ports are operating at full capacity in the west of
the country and at near-capacity in the east. Wheat prices have risen
sharply and the western farm economy is seeing relief for the first time
since the 1987-88 season.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries mixed after disappointing
auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SLIGHTLY disappointing afternoon auction of five-year notes left US
Treasury prices mixed across the maturity range yesterday after a
weaker-than-expected durable goods report had earlier provided market
sentiment with a modest boost.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  1/8 at 100
7/16 , yielding 7.952 per cent. The two-year note, however, hung on to its
gains, and was up  1/16 at 100 1/32 , to carry a yield of 5.716 per cent.
The market opened in a positive mood following Tuesday's poor car sales data
and the successful two-year auction, and sentiment improved on news of a 0.1
per cent decline in February durable goods. The market had been expecting
durable goods to show a rise of about 1.5 per cent, and the unexpectedly
weak figure lifted prices across the maturity range.
Further into the session, however, news of a 9.3 per cent rise in existing
home sales during February put a dent in the market's optimism. Long-dated
securities later took a tumble following the sale of Dollars 10.25bn in
five-year notes. Although the auction went relatively well, dealers were
disappointed by the total number of bids submitted.
FRENCH government bonds clawed back more of their lost ground of recent
days, helped in particular by a rumour late in the day that Mrs Edith
Cresson, the French prime minister, had offered her resignation. That was
enough to help the yield on 10-year French OATs fall another couple of basis
points against German government bonds, leaving the yield spread at around
66 basis points.
Analysts continued to remain generally optimistic that French bonds would
improve in the days ahead, as investors came to see that the sell-off ahead
of last weekend's local elections had been overdone.
Strong economic fundamentals should leave French bonds in at least as good a
position as Dutch government bonds, according to one analyst - yet the yield
gap between the two had opened up from zero in late January to 35 basis
points by the start of this week. That had fallen to 27 basis points by last
night.
GERMAN government bonds gained on the day as a relaxed stance from the
Bundesbank in its weekly securities repurchase tender - together with
indications that inflation figures for the year to mid-March may come in
below expectations - added to the feeling that further interest rises are
not in prospect.
An early guide to the latest inflation figures came from the state of
Baden-Wurttemberg, which reported a 4.6 per cent rise in the year to
mid-March, up 0.2 per cent from the previous month. That seemed to point to
an overall figure slightly below analysts' forecasts.
THE UK gilt market appeared to sink into pre-election torpor, no longer able
to raise much enthusiasm to trade on the latest political opinion poll
results: these continue to show the mood of the electorate swinging between
the two main parties, with a slight leaning towards the Labour party.
After the sell-off of the past 10 days, though, there was still room for
some improvement in prices, put down largely to efforts by traders who had
left themselves short of bonds to square their books. Investors continued to
stay out of the market.
The gilts future on Liffe traded between 94 19/32 and 94 29/32 , ending the
day towards the top end of this range. The benchmark 9 per cent gilts due
2011, which ended on Tuesday night at 95 3/8 , rose further yesterday to 95
1/2 .
IN Japan, the wait for a 0.5 percentage point cut in the Official Discount
Rate kept government bonds pinned down in their trading range of recent
days.
The benchmark bond 129 ended the day at a yield of 5.335 per cent.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Equity Issues: Sweden goes for variety in
sell-off programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government's privatisation programme, due to kick off this
summer with the sale of SSAB, the state-owned steel company, will adopt a
variety of methods, tailored to suit different categories of company.
The 34 state or partially-owned companies in the programme represent a broad
spectrum of businesses in terms of industry sector, size and structure,
according to Mr Jan Amethier, an adviser to the Swedish government on
privatisation.
Speaking at a presentation to investors in London yesterday, he said that
the companies can be divided into four main categories:
Four publicly-quoted companies in which the state owns less than 100 per
cent are likely to be privatised through a secondary share offering. In this
category fall SSAB, which has already been named as the first company to be
privatised, NCB, the forestry company, Nordbanken, in the financial sector,
and Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group.
Three large wholly-owned industrial companies, Assi, the pulp and paper
company, Celsius, the diversified industrial group, and LKAB, the mining
company, could be subject to a variety of approaches, including merger and
alliance.
The public utilities are expected to be subject to structural changes before
they can be privatised. The government does not aim to privatise monopolies.
The fourth category consists of small companies which would not merit a
share offering but are likely to be privatised by means such as management
buy-outs. Some of these companies operate as niche monopolies.
Relatively few of the companies will be suitable for large global share
offerings. However, the Swedish government is aware of the 'importance of
international investors who can play a major role in ensuring continued
demand in the after-market,' according to Mr Amethier.
Although the widening of domestic share ownership is a crucial goal, the
government will seek to create 'equal opportunities for domestic and
international investors,' he said.
The public offerings are likely to be spread over a number of years, as care
will be taken not to crowd the markets. The large companies may be sold off
in stages.
Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group formed in December from the merger
of Pavis and Remy &amp; Associates, will next week triple the number of
marketable shares in issue with a Dollars 100m international share offering,
writes Simon London.
Only 10 per cent of the company's shares are currently traded, with a
controlling 50.46 per cent interest held by the family of Mr Heriard
Dubreuil, who heads the merged group.
The offering comprises a 20.8 per cent equity stake held by the company
itself plus warrants for the purchase of additional shares. The issue,
lead-managed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, will be priced on Monday close to
the prevailing market price of FFr195 per share.
However, the thin market makes Remy Cointreau one of the more volatile
stocks quoted on the Paris bourse. The offering of warrants is designed to
reassure investors that the current market price represents fair value.
Wellcome Trust, the charitable foundation which funds medical research,
faces a similar problem - but on a much grander scale - in deciding on a
structure for its Pounds 4.5bn sale of shares in Wellcome, the
pharmaceuticals company.
The sale, expected to take place in the summer and lead managed by Robert
Fleming, may also triple the number of marketable shares.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: GE cuts investment in Hungary
operation

<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US is retrenching at its Tungsram light bulb
operation in Hungary, one of the earliest and largest joint ventures by a
western company in eastern Europe.
GE announced cuts in investment, employment and production at Tungsram after
preliminary results showed the subsidiary had lost Ft1.1bn (Dollars 13.6m)
last year.
Up to half of the planned investment of Dollars 40m for 1992 is to be held
back. Staffing levels are to be reduced 25 per cent, with administrators
most sharply hit. Production facilities will be idled for an average of two
weeks to allow a reduction of stocks.
Only last June,GE increased its stake in Tungsram to more than 75 per cent
and took total investment to more than Dollars 200m, declaring confidence in
the subsidiary's prospects.
GE-Tungsram blamed rising local costs for the reversal and called for
devaluation of the forint, the Hungarian currency, to keep pace with
inflation. The company said that a 40 per cent gap between inflation and
currency depreciation had put the survival of Hungarian exporters into
question.
At the same time, prices for lighting products in Tungsram's main west
European markets are falling.
Mr Gyorgy Varga, chief executive of GE-Tungsram, said that Suzuki, Ford and
General Motors, which are all embarking on large investments in Hungary,
would face similar problems.
GE has been frustrated in repeated efforts to force a change in
exchange-rate policy. The Hungarian government, bound by its agreement with
the International Monetary Fund, remains commited to a policy of firm
monetary policy and high exchange rates to maintain downward pressure on
inflation, even if that is painful for exporters.
Nevertheless, GE maintained that Tungsram's long-term promise remained
bright.

CANADIAN Pacific, the diversified rail, energy and resources group, said it
did not anticipate any recovery in the Canadian economy until well into the
second half of 1992, writes Robert Gibbens.
The company posted a loss of CDollars 914m (USDollars 768m), or CDollars
2.87 a share, for 1991, after special charges of CDollars 898m to cover
write-downs in its investment in Laidlaw, spending cuts at its rail
subsidiary, and a mill shutdown by its forest products unit.
Canadian Pacific, in its annual report, said trading conditions would remain
difficult in the current year, with low oil and gas, newsprint and pulp
prices.
However, the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, from a peak 89 US
cents last year to around 84 cents, is expected to help foreign exchange
profit earned by the resource units.

interests

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant, yesterday took a step away
from vertical industrial integration when it announced it was putting up for
sale its large interests in the pulp business.
The company has retained Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, to
find buyers for the business, which employs 3,200 people and is expected to
have sales in 1992 of around Dollars 800m.
About half of its output is sold to Procter &amp; Gamble itself for use in a
variety of products. However, Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman, said a review
of corporate goals into the next century had concluded that the commercial
pulp business was not 'a good fit with P&amp;G's long-term strategic interests'.
He said the group's aim was to be 'more globally focused on our core
consumer businesses in healthcare, beauty care, laundry and cleaning
products, paper products and food and beverages'.
He added that the decision did not mean that P&amp;G would eliminate all
internal vertical integration of raw materials. These decisions were to be
made on a case-by-case basis.
P&amp;G has been in the pulp business for 70 years and its operations include a
cotton linters pulp plant in Memphis, Tennessee, and wood pulp plants in
Oglethorpe, Georgia, Perry, Florida, and Grande Prairie, Alberta. It also
has timber assets in Georgia and Florida and sawmills in Georgia and
Alberta.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, affirmed the company's Double-A
senior debt rating in the wake of the announcement. It said the proceeds of
the sale were likely to be used to fund P&amp;G's international diversification,
so total debt was unlikely to be reduced significantly.
Mr Artzt said the company had analysed the benefits of vertical integration
and had concluded that it would be better off working with raw materials
suppliers than producing materials internally.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Anglo American-led group buys
stake in paper concern
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and some of
its main subsidiaries, including Mondi Paper, is to pay R550m (Dollars 190m)
to acquire a 44 per cent stake in Frantschach, a leading Austrian pulp and
paper group.
Mr Tony Trahar, executive chairman of Mondi, said the interests of the
consortium members, also including De Beers Centenary and Minorco, would be
held through a recently-formed holding company, Mondi Europe.
Anglo American is to own 46 per cent of the holding company, Mondi 5 per
cent, Centenary and associates 28 per cent, and Minorco 21 per cent. Mondi
will provide the managerial lead on behalf of the consortium; Anglo and its
affiliates will hold joint control.
Mr Trahar said a substantial portion of the purchase price would be invested
directly in the company to enhance its capital base for future growth. The
51 per cent portion of the purchase price to be paid by the South African
participants - Anglo American and Mondi - is to be financed from overseas
facilities.
The deal is the second significant step into Europe by Mondi - a
wholly-owned, unlisted subsidiary of Anglo American. In November 1990,
Frantschach sold a 49 per cent interest in Neusiedler of Austria, a producer
of photocopy and business forms paper, to Mondi, Anglo and their associates.
The purchase price was not disclosed, but estimates range from Dollars 85m
to 135m.
Mr Trahar said that after a long period of isolation the deal brought Mondi
back into the international arena, giving it access to new areas of
technology and to European markets, especially if Austria should become a
member of the European Community. The deal will also enhance Mondi's ability
to export pulp from South Africa to Neusiedler.
The Frantschach group has four main areas of activity: bleached pulp and
paper; unbleached pulp and packaging paper; packaging and converting; and
distribution. It has 6,000 employees and an annual turnover of about R3bn.
Mr Trahar said that Frantschach was well-positioned to benefit from
environmental concerns over the use of plastic packaging and a growing
preference for paper products.
He added that, with other international paper groups suffering from
ill-considered acquisitions and the industry going through a recessionary
phase, it was a good time to be making an acquisition.
Mondi recently announced an 18 per cent increase in earnings to R110m for
the 1992 financial year, after a 45 per cent drop in 1991 to R89m. Mr Trahar
said 1992 would be a difficult year, with recovery expected in the second
half.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Continued progress at Micro Focus with 23%
rise to Pounds 18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICRO FOCUS, the Newbury-based software company whose share price, currently
Pounds 22.23p, has become the wonder of the UK-owned electronics sector,
maintained its seemingly unstoppable progress last year.
Profits before tax rose 23 per cent in 1991 to reach Pounds 18.1m (Pounds
14.8m), while revenues were up 20 per cent to Pounds 55.9m (Pounds 46.5m).
Fully diluted earnings advanced 26 per cent to 83.1p (65.9p) per share.
The rise in cash reserves was 50 per cent to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 20.4m).
There was a gain of Pounds 478,000 from the sale of the company's 54 per
cent interest in Softwright Systems.
Micro Focus, in keeping with US rather than UK practice, is not paying a
dividend.
The remarkable growth of the share price - it languished around the
600p-800p mark for much of the 1990s - is the result of US investment
through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Some 39.4 per cent of the
company's stock is now held in this form.
US investors are reckoned to understand Micro Focus and its products much
better than their UK equivalents, who have frequently found it difficult to
value the company adequately.
Now Micro Focus is set for a listing on the US Nasdaq exchange.
In November last year, it started the process of registering as a 'foreign
private issuer' with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a necessary
prerequisite to a Nasdaq listing.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said 1991 had been a tough year and 1992 would be
no easier.
He expected, however, to maintain growth in both revenues and profits. Tight
control on cost expansion is being maintained until there are real signs of
an economic upturn.
COMMENT
Micro Focus' performance would be more than respectable in a healthy
economy, but to have grown by more than a fifth in the deepest recession the
computing services business has endured with a gross margin of more than 30
per cent is a tribute to the company's tight management and careful
housekeeping. It markets its products - software tools to make computer
programmers more productive - both to corporate customers and to computer
manufacturers like ICL, Siemens Nixdorf and Groupe Bull. It enjoys a close
relationship with IBM as a member of the large computer manufacturer's
international alliance. There would seem to be little, apart from a further
sharp deepening of the recession, that should prevent the company
maintaining its growth this year. Laing &amp; Cruickshank estimate pre-tax
profits of Pounds 22m for 1992, equivalent to earnings of 104.1p per share.
That would give a prospective p/e of 21 which would hardly be considered
extreme for a similar company in the US.

A QUARTER of the 2,525 companies quoted in the UK at the start of 1986 had
been taken over by the end of 1991, according to a survey of the mergers and
acquisitions industry.
The review's author is the LEK Partnership, a strategy consultancy group.
Over the six-year period, only 41 per cent of companies receiving a hostile
bid escaped. Targets of larger bids - worth more than Pounds 1bn - have a
greater chance of survival at 55 per cent. The main reason for failure is
price.
The study also concludes that agreed bids can often be made at similar
premiums to hostile bids, but have a much better chance of success. In
hostile bids the initial bidder has only a 45 per cent chance of winning.
During 1991 there were 70 successful bids for UK public companies, and 30
per cent of the top 1,000 UK companies were involved in bid activity,
although it was a relatively quiet year.
Three quarters of the bids, by value, involved UK targets.
It seems that survivors of failed bids gain a share price advantage, at
least in the short term.
Typically a survivor's shares fall to a level of between 10 and 15 per cent
above their price a month before the bid, allowing for market movements.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Dolphin slips 4% to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Both volumes and margins came under pressure at Dolphin Packaging in the
final four months of 1991, according to Mr Moger Woolley, chairman.
As a result, pre-tax profits at this plastic packaging manufacturer slipped
4 per cent, from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 3.03m.
The company, which moved up to the main market in August, had largely flat
sales of Pounds 27.8m (Pounds 28.1m).
Earnings were 10.59p (10.89p) per share and the final dividend is maintained
at 2.8p for an increased total of 4.5p (4.3p). The company has Pounds 1.3m
cash in the bank.
Mr Woolley said Dolphin was refuting the claim from DRG Plastics and
adequate provision against it had been made above the line.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Medeva quadruples to Pounds 16.7m and talks
of further purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A hectic year of acquisitions, Medeva, the UK pharmaceuticals group,
yesterday reported quadrupled pre-tax profits for 1991 and put shareholders
on notice that it was going shopping with new shares again soon.
The company, one of 1991's best-performing stocks, increased taxable profits
from Pounds 4.01m to Pounds 16.7m on sales up only 57 per cent at Pounds
82.4m (Pounds 52.6m).
Fully diluted earnings per share more than doubled to 8.3p (3.4p) and the
board is proposing a final dividend of 1p, giving a total for the year of
1.5p, double last year's pay-out.
The shares gained 18p to close at 296p.
Gross profit margin increased from 39 to 46 per cent, despite the depressing
effect of the highly competitive generics business, which only broke even
after prices plummeted but still accounted for 36 per cent of sales.
'We are increasing our sales with much more profitable products than we
started the business with (in 1990),' maintained Mr Bernard Taylor,
chairman.
Organic growth was probably about 10 per cent, although it was difficult to
break it out as the group's structure had changed so much during the year,
he said.
Mr Taylor, a former chief executive of Glaxo, warned shareholders that
although they had already supplied Pounds 196m in two years for Medeva's
acquisitions, the group planned to acquire more products and marketing
networks in countries like Germany, Italy and France.
The group paid tax for the first time, at 18 per cent, but expects that rate
to rise to 29 per cent this year.
COMMENT
Is there no stopping Medeva? Possibly not in the short term, although more
than doubled earnings growth is surely not repeatable this year. Much less
certain is the medium-term goal of forming a viable FT-SE 100
pharmaceuticals company - which depends on Medeva developing its own
products for the market. A canny purchaser of product portfolios Medeva
certainly seems to be, but it is too soon to judge the company as a
developer of new products. In the short term, though, it is going to be
quite a ride. Cost savings on the generics side will be swallowed up as
prices plumb new depths, but strong growth in Adams and MD mean Medeva is
forecast to achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 38m and earnings per share of
13.3p, giving a prospective multiple of 22. Expensive? Yes, if the
medium-term strategy fails. If it succeeds, however, investors who are
willing to dig repeatedly into their pockets may be richly rewarded.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reckitt &amp; Colman rises to Pounds 252.3m -
Shares marked down as outcome falls short of market expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECKITT &amp; COLMAN, the food and household products group, increased pre-tax
profits last year, helped by the Pounds 713m acquisition of Boyle-Midway in
1990.
Pre-tax profits, at Pounds 252.3m, were up 7.3 per cent from 1990's figure
of Pounds 235.2m. However, the results were slightly below market
expectations and the shares fell 6p to 640p.
Sir Michael Colman, chairman, said that Boyle-Midway, which makes household
and hair-removing products, paid for itself in 1991 even after an increase
in interest charges.
The net interest bill rose from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 40.3m, reflecting a
full year of Boyle-Midway. Fully diluted earnings per share, however, showed
minimal progress to 40.77p (40.22p).
Sir Michael said that the group had spent more heavily on marketing its
brands. He said that 80 per cent of the Pounds 101.9m increase in
distribution costs to Pounds 615.1m was attributable to increased marketing
costs.
A final dividend of 9.55p is recommended to give a total of 15.1p (13.6p).
Sir Michael said that the rise of 11 per cent compared to inflation of about
4 per cent and the group's aim was to maintain a realistic progression in
the dividend.
Sales increased by 12.7 per cent to Pounds 1.99bn while trading profits were
almost 16 per cent higher at Pounds 292.6m. Margins were helped by savings
made through the integration of Boyle-Midway and a reorganisation of
European manufacturing facilities.
Mr Vernon Sankey, who took over as chief executive in January, said that
both the household and toiletry and pharmaceutical divisions were core to
the business.
Household and toiletry trading profits rose by 28 per cent and margins were
up from 14.2 to 14.9 per cent. Pharmaceutical profits were hardly changed at
Pounds 40m and margins fell from 25.4 to 23.8 per cent as the division was
affected by recession in its main markets.
The food division increased trading profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 57.4m
while margins rose from 10.7 to 11.1 per cent, still well below the group
average. Trading profits from other activities fell from Pounds 13.2m to
Pounds 8.8m although this partly reflected the sale of the fine art and
graphics business in 1990.
After a slightly lower tax rate at 32.6 per cent, there was Pounds 12.9m
(Pounds 4.86m) of interest on the group's convertible bonds, which it
regards as equity rather than debt.
The balance sheet had net debt of Pounds 338.3m at the year-end, a fall of
Pounds 19.5m. Shareholders' funds were up from Pounds 636.1m to Pounds
719.6m.
Mr Iain Dobbie, finance director, said the group preferred to look at
interest cover on debt rather than gearing. Interest cover was 7.3 times, or
5.3 times if the interest on the convertible bonds is included, levels with
which the group was comfortable.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Hanson considered offer for Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the acquisitive conglomerate, has evaluated a possible bid for
Lonrho, the international trading group, a financier with close knowledge of
Hanson said yesterday. But the financier said market speculation of a bid in
the foreseeable future were unfounded.
News of Hanson's evaluation of Lonrho comes as Lonrho prepares to face
shareholders at today's annual meeting. There have been private complaints
about the composition of Lonrho's board from institutional shareholders, but
no public criticisms are likely at the meeting.
Hanson's acquisition team examined the possibility of a bid for Lonrho,
according to financiers involved. However Hanson, a specialist in the
intricate tactics of stalking companies, evaluates large numbers of
companies which may be vulnerable.
Hanson's advisers said yesterday that the company had ruled out owning or
merging with a company which derives more than 70 per cent of its pre-tax
profits from Africa. Although Hanson does have a small presence in South
Africa, through Ever Ready batteries, it has no experience of managing
businesses in the rest of Africa.
According to a financier who knows Hanson well, the company views Lonrho as
a one-man band and feels that Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland, the group's chief
executive, is 'irreplaceable' in dealing with a number of African
governments. Hanson executives did not relish the thought of having to
devote a significant proportion of their time to negotiations with
politicians in Africa.
Lonrho shares fell to a six-year low of 86p earlier in the month. They
recently bounced back above 100p following persistent rumours that Hanson,
after backing off from bidding for Imperial Chemical Industries, would
attempt a takeover of Lonrho.
Hanson might reconsider Lonrho as a possible acquisition if the
international trading group's shares continue to fall.
According to one Hanson adviser, however, it would be unlikely to consider
bidding for Lonrho even if the price of the company's shares were to halve.
The last outside evaluation of Lonrho to become public knowledge was by
Samuel Montagu for Mr Alan Bond, the Australian businessman, who bought a
21.6 per cent stake before Bond Corporation ran into difficulties.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Smith New Court wins Pounds 14m: Securities house awarded
High Court damages for loss on Ferranti shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH NEW COURT, the securities house, has won about Pounds 14m compensation
for losses incurred on Ferranti shares it bought for Pounds 23m in July 1989
 -two months before the discovery of a fraud on Ferranti nearly halved its
share price.
The High Court held yesterday that SNC's bid price for the 28m shares had
been induced by fraudulent misrepresentations by Mr Christopher Roberts,
then head of private banking at Citibank, part of the US Citicorp group.
Mr Roberts had falsely told SNC it was competing with two other bidders,
said Mr Justice Chadwick.
SNC was awarded Pounds 10,764,005 damages against Citibank, plus interest it
later calculated at about Pounds 4m, and a substantial part of its costs.
Citibank was given judgment with costs against Mr Roberts for the same
amounts.
SNC lost its claim against Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management), the
market-making arm of Citibank which acted as broker for the share sale. The
judge held that SVAM, where Mr Roberts was an executive director, had not
been responsible for his misrepresentations.
Mr Roberts was found not guilty last year of making false and misleading
statements to induce SNC to buy the Ferranti shares.
After yesterday's judgment, Mr Michael Marks, chief executive of SNC, said
he was delighted with the outcome. Citibank said it would consider an
appeal.
Mr Justice Chadwick said SNC bought the shares in Ferranti International
Signal on July 21 1989. SVAM was acting on the instructions of Citibank, to
which the shares were charged as security for a loan to Parent Industries, a
company owned by Mr James Guerin. Parent defaulted on the loan.
Soon after SNC bought the shares, their price fell when it was discovered
that Ferranti had been the victim of a serious fraud.
SNC made a loss of Pounds 11.5m when it sold the holding.
According to SNC, the judge said, Mr Roberts mentioned receiving two other
bids and said he would disclose the identities of the other contenders once
SNC had made its own bid.
After SNC offered 82p per share, he told the securities house that Citicorp
had bid 75p-77p and Aeritalia, a state-owned Italian defence company, 81p.
There had been no such bids, but Mr Roberts's representations had the
intended effect: SNC was induced to remain a willing buyer at 82p, and that
led to an 82.25p-a-share bargain being struck.
'It is inconceivable that SNC would have remained willing to acquire the
Ferranti shares at 82p per share if two competing bids had not been
disclosed,' the judge said.
'If Mr Roberts had not told the SNC directors that he had received firm bids
 -and had not told them the amounts which had been bid - the SNC bid would
have been withdrawn.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / Democrat race intensifies as Clinton attacks Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Clinton, stung by defeat in Tuesday's Democratic presidential
primary in Connecticut, yesterday gave up trying to ignore Mr Jerry Brown.
The front-runner for the party nomination described the policies of his
conqueror, a former governor of California, as typical of a 'charter member
of the flat earth society'.
He told a news conference in New York, scene of the next big primary two
weeks from now, that Mr Brown's proposed flat rate of income and value-added
taxes would be 'a disaster - a war-on-New York tax'. It would, he said,
'triple taxes on the poor, increase taxes on the middle class by an average
Dollars 1,900 a year, and lower taxes on rich Americans'.
But Mr Brown immediately flew in the afternoon to Albany, capital of New
York state, to meet the state's most powerful politician, Governor Mario
Cuomo, who is barely on speaking terms with Mr Clinton after the latter had
suggested he might have Mafia connections.
The Californian was only given ten minutes with the governor and received no
endorsement. Asked if he agreed with Mr Brown that Mr Clinton would be 'the
ruin of the Democratic party', Mr Cuomo merely replied he would only say
such a thing if he were running himself.
But, thickening the plot, a leader of the 'draft Cuomo' movement in New York
said that, if Democrats there really wanted their governor to run for
president, then a vote for Mr Brown would best serve that end.
The tendency of the Democratic party's national leaders yesterday was to
rally behind Mr Clinton, largely because Mr Brown is seen as unelectable in
November.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, an earlier candidate for the Democratic
nomination, was meeting Mr Clinton last night with a view to an endorsement
today. His union backing may help blunt Mr Brown's appeal to organised
labour.
Mr Ron Brown, party chairman, pointed out that Mr Clinton still had an
enormous lead in delegates won.
But defeat in New York and in Wisconsin, which also holds its primary on
April 7, would encourage the search for an alternative candidate, though it
would not necessarily produce one.
On Tuesday, Mr Brown narrowly beat Mr Clinton, governor of Arkansas, by
37-36 per cent, with Mr Paul Tsongas, who pulled out of the race last week
but remained on the ballot, scoring 20 per cent. Even so, the rules meant
that Mr Clinton won more delegates to the party nominating convention in
July, with 22 against Mr Brown's 21, and ten for Mr Tsongas.
On the Republican side, President George Bush again was embarrassed by a
one-third vote against his candidacy, even though he had little formal
opposition. Mr Pat Buchanan won 22 per cent, uncommitted delegates took 9
per cent and the Louisiana rightwinger Mr David Duke 2 per cent.

FT  26 MAR 92 / EC lifts bar on Mars in ice-cream market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARS, the US-owned confection-ery group, will no longer find itself frozen
out of the German ice-cream market this summer following a European
Commission ruling yesterday against its two main competitors.
The Commission cut the exclusive ties between ice-cream retailers and
individual manufacturers, allowing the US company to supply all German
stores with Mars, Milky Way, Snickers and Bounty ice-cream bars in time for
summer.
Mars complained to Brussels last September that its German operation would
suffer because of restrictive contracts linking German retailers and the
producers Langnese-Iglo, a subsidiary of Unilever, and Scholler
Lebensmittel.
The ruling said contracts obliging retailers to stock only products by those
companies were a prima facie infringement of European Community competition
rules and contracts would 'seriously and irreparably damage' Mars' business.
The Commission's temporary decree means Langnese and Scholler may no longer
insist that their tied retailers in Germany sell their ice-cream alone.
Mars entered the ice-cream business only three years ago with frozen
versions of its chocolate bars. Its success in pioneering this new area of
the market has prompted several other manufacturers, including Scholler, to
introduce rival products recently.
It is unusual for Brussels to act so quickly on a complaint, but officials
said Mars had convinced them that its seasonal challenge to the German
producers would be severely undermined unless immediate action were taken.
The Commission also plans to look into another complaint from Mars, which
alleges that German retailers with Langnese and Scholler freezers are
allowed to stock them only with those companies' products only.
The Commission will not publish details of market shares, but Langnese is
believed to control some 75 per cent of the market in west Germany and 50
per cent in eastern Germany. Scholler has 25 per cent and less than 20 per
cent in the respective regions.
According to the Commission, the German stores worst affected by the
restrictive contracts are those catering to impulse buyers.

FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Taylor Woodrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investor heartbeats are invariably missed when a company announces the
retirement of its executive chairman just three weeks before publication of
the annual results. In Taylor Woodrow's case, however, it would be
surprising if the shares reacted badly to last night's news that Mr Peter
Drew will soon be devoting more time to watercolouring. Confirmation that
the dividend will be held is reassuring. But the sad reality is that Mr Drew
failed to inspire City confidence during his two-year stint at the top,
which has coincided with Taylor Woodrow underperforming the market by 63 per
cent and the FTA Contracting Sector by 34 per cent. It is not all his fault,
but the 58-year-old chartered accountant who is to replace him sounds the
sort of chap who might steady the ship.

The warring parties in the Perrier struggle may have squared each other. But
they have not yet satisfied the European Commission. Notwithstanding
Nestle's efforts to belittle its significance, yesterday's decision that
Brussels is to proceed with a full investigation caught markets on the hop.
Given that the merged businesses will have French market shares exceeding 50
per cent - even after ceding Volvic to BSN - there certainly seems a prima
facie case for having a very close look. And with Sir Leon Brittan coming to
the end of his term in charge of competition policy, the case may be his
final opportunity to ruffle French feathers.

FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Reckitt &amp; Colman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With its 11 per cent dividend increase in a recession year, Reckitt &amp; Colman
has lived up to its reputation for growth. The underlying message behind
yesterday's figures, however, is that exploiting Boyle-Midway has required
considerable effort. The US acquisition may be earning enough to cover its
carrying cost. But a large part of the 20 per cent rise in group
distribution costs represents higher marketing expenditure, and the company
admits that some cost savings from the integration of Boyle-Midway have been
spent on brand development. That has left the group trading margin only
slightly higher, at 14.7 per cent compared with 14.3.
More work on brand development effort may be needed before the benefits of
Boyle-Midway really show through. Though Reckitt's household products are
reasonably immune from recession, demand also tends to be hit by retailer
destocking which is generally slow to reverse itself in a recovery. Together
these factors suggest an unexciting 1992, though the interest charge should
come down as more debt is repaid.
That said, yesterday's 9 per cent fall leaves the shares on a prospective
multiple just over 14. That is hardly demanding for a company that should
remain capable of real growth in the long run, even in the non-inflationary
1990s. The trouble is that, if the shares are not worth selling, they are
not particularly attractive as a short-term buy either.

FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year's 3 per cent advance in profits before tax and exceptional items
looks a characteristically resilient Kingfisher performance. There may be
room to quibble about the size and nature of the provisions at Comet, and to
query a little the defensiveness of Superdrug. But the cash management
success - a Pounds 100m reduction in group debt thanks to sound working
capital controls, sharply reduced capital expenditure, and net disinvestment
ge at this point in the cycle.
Kingfisher's shares have been overshadowed of late by fears of discounting
in the DIY sector - certainly evident in B&amp;Q's results - and by the
perennial rumours of a fresh takeover. An acquisition always remains a
possibility, but it has never proved a serious obstacle to the shares in the
past and next time is just as likely to be a joint venture with a
continental European partner. As for DIY, Kingfisher is surely right to
sacrifice short-term gross margins in the cause of keeping down prices and
expanding its market share. The company will be a winner in the low-growth
environment of 1990s, which sits oddly with its below average rating in the
sector. The worry is whether the high hopes invested in the whole retailing
sector are justified.

FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo comes clean
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors must be hoping that Lasmo's past is not a reliable guide to its
future. There is no doubting the enthusiasm with which it has reorganised
its accounts. But its thoroughness implied a calculation that there would be
no penalty for revealing past short-comings, provided investors' gaze could
be diverted towards the future of the combined Lasmo and Ultramar group. Its
shares recovered from a sharp fall yesterday, so the gamble has paid off for
now. All the same, the market ought to wonder whether it has been sold a
dummy. Without Ultramar, Lasmo would be looking very sick indeed.
A Pounds 280m balance sheet write-down aside, the notable effect of the
accounting changes was to reduce last year's stated earnings per share by 85
per cent, and 1990 earnings by nearly 60 per cent. Thus, over two years,
including the Gulf war period of high oil prices, Lasmo paid 17p of
dividends on earnings of 12.4p per share, instead of the previously stated
40.8p. Had investors known that, the group's paper would presumably not have
been valuable enough to pay for Ultramar.
Further, the new method of accounting for tax allowances gave the 1991
operating line a Pounds 32m boost, limiting the loss to Pounds 8.5m. As for
the decision to take a Pounds 22m extraordinary provision against losses on
US properties which have not yet been sold, this was doubtless done to
protect this year's vulnerable earnings by further lowering the point of
comparison.
But perhaps this is to be too sceptical. Investors are surely more
interested in the future, and, thanks to the Ultramar assets on its balance
sheet, Lasmo looks a much better long-term bet than it did before. That
said, if the oil price stays low the group could yet make another loss this
year, and the market's disaffection with the entire sector means its shares
are unlikely to forge ahead. There is no rush to buy.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Letter: Pensions should be insured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that the Maxwell companies and pension funds have filed a
claim for Pounds 50m under insurance policies intended to protect them
against fraud (UK Company News, March 19). The losses are said to be Pounds
900m.
To reassure the trustees that the assets of their pension funds are in safe
hands some fund managers have recently written to their clients to tell them
that their investments are covered by fidelity and professional indemnity
insurance.
On enquiry I have found that the level of cover provided is often totally
inadequate to give any comfort to trustees that their assets are properly
safeguarded from the ravages of a rogue predator.
In one case investigated by my firm the fund managers had a worldwide policy
giving cover for Pounds 50m. The assets under management totalled Pounds
27bn.
The trustees of pension funds should make it their duty to obtain a copy of
the professional indemnity and fidelity policies held by the fund managers
who act for them and evaluate their worth. Trustees need to assess whether
such policies, taking into account the level of cover and the exclusion
clauses, provide them with the pro-tection to which they are entitled.
Is there any reason why the Securities and Investments Board should not
require that all fund managers should have insurance cover to at least the
total level of funds they have under management?
If the internal control procedures in fund management institutions are sound
the cost of insurance will not be excessive. If the internal control
procedures are not adequate to safeguard pensioners' assets the sooner such
institutions are closed down the better.
Trustees must rid themselves of the notion that they have to live with
unsound custodial practices in order to make life administratively
convenient for fund managers. The primary concern of trustees must be to
ensure that pensioners are never again deprived of their hard-earned income
at the most vulnerable time in their lives.

One question it won't be is: What is the largest-known prime number? - which
has just been newly answered by scientists at the UK Atomic Energy
Authority's Harwell laboratory at the cost of 19 hours on a Cray 2
supercomputer.
The latest result of the ceaseless search for the biggest number that can't
be divided by anything except itself or one, is 2756839-1 (two multiplied by
itself 756,839 times, minus one). Written out con- ventionally it would have
227,832 digits, enough to fill seven pages of the FT.

'Oh dear,' sighed Observer as readers' replies came rolling in to Monday's
numeracy-style quiz. One of the first arrivals began by rasping: 'You should
have realised that a large number of actuaries read your column'.
Then (poetic justice be praised]) he proceeded to fluff one of his answers.
The response is nevertheless impressive. As some entries mailed overseas
before the Monday-night deadline may not yet have arrived, the solutions to
the seven questions won't be given until next Monday morning. But of the 151
received so far, no fewer than 62 are all-correct.
At the same time, therefore, a tie-breaker will be printed to find the
winner of the bottle of malt whisky. Since you're all so clever, it'll be a
stinker.

Yet another landmark in the UK recession. In the coming two days, 108
bankers accompanied by 54 lawyers will line up at the offices of Theodore
Goddard, the solicitors, to append their signatures to documents finalising
the long-awaited refinancing of Brent Walker.
It will be the biggest corporate refinancing in UK history, involving Pounds
1.6bn of borrowings. It also could well be the longest and most turbulent
attempt to rescue a company ever known.
Attempts to reconstruct its balance sheet began in November 1990 and the
more memorable events since then have included a night of the long knives in
the boardroom, a dawn raid by the Serious Fraud Office, a takeover attempt
by Lonrho and endless bitter rows between the current board and the
company's flamboyant founder, George Walker.
Even the process of getting the deal signed is a logistical nightmare. Brent
Walker's long-suffering finance director, John Leach, will have to
countersign every one of the bankers' documents on behalf of the company's
50 subsidiaries.
As a nimble finance director, he calculates quick-as-a-flash that he will be
signing 2,500 times. If, once he has done it, he is suffering from nothing
worse than an aching hand, he will be relieved. Since joining Brent Walker,
he has acquired a neurotic fear of unexpected disasters.
Who can blame him?

The New York Commodity Exchange, with a reputation more for slumped volumes
than for innovation, has elected a woman as its new chairman, the first to
head a US futures market.
Donna Redel, no back-office type, apparently more than holds her own in the
rough and tumble of the pits - earning a rebuke from the exchange some years
ago for duffing up a man trader who shoved her the wrong way.
She also has connections. Executive vice-president of family firm Redel
Trading, she is the daughter of Comex ex-chairman Irving Redel.
Her affinities are more akin to the large brokerage houses, and she won
yesterday against Sidney Rothberg who reflects the interests of the
independent traders.
She will be hard put to win new business for the fading exchange. Its volume
as the main US metals-trading market has been falling. Nor has Comex been
able to develop new attractive products.
Plenty of politicking is assured with yet another attempt at rapprochement
between rival exchanges. Four out of five New York futures markets plan a
costly move to a new trading floor and pos-sible merger. For her efforts,
she will be Comex's first paid chairman at Dollars 125,000 a year.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Observer: Spare wheel for Morley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There's a hint of the dual-personality about psychologist Kevin Morley,
Rover's new marketing supremo.
On the one hand, he is managing director of the motor group's marketing
division with a non-executive seat on the main board. On the other, he has
just launched his own marketing company, Kevin Morley Group, which so far
has only one client: Rover.
But he dismisses the idea of conflicts of interest. Not at all, says the man
who claims never to have failed in anything he has done. After all, Rover is
only the first of the new company's clients.
Besides signing up Jack Rubins, McCann Erickson's former UK head, as its
chairman, Morley has recruited some bright ad-sparks to run the Rover
account, won from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's BSB Dorland agency.
Paul Jackson and Stuart Kendall who worked on the account at BSB, have
crossed over to become executive director (client services) and director
(head of art) respectively. Steven Smith has left the Birkdale group to be
finance director, and Richard Smith is leaving J Walter Thompson in Detroit
to be creative director.
Whatever Morley is paying them, he has found a bargain in his Marble Arch
headquarters. Each of its 8,250 square feet is costing him only Pounds 9 or
so, whereas until the recession a Pounds 50 rate would have been modest.
As for his new role at Rover, the buzz is that it has been handed to him as
solace for not being given one of the motor group's really top-flight jobs.
But he didn't seem crestfallen at yesterday's launch of his own company.
Clasping a bumper of celebratory wine and spreading his arms wide, he asked
Observer: 'Call all this second best?'

FT  26 MAR 92 / Letter: Kenya will proceed to elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON B ARAP BULLUT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to Michael Holman ('An angry church confronts a troubled
state in Kenya', March 24) 'most western diplomats' believe that President
Moi should 'bite the bullet' and call an election. He writes that last
year's expectations of an early election have proved wishful thinking.
Mr Holman cannot have it both ways. As he knows, the opposition parties
complained loudly when they thought that President Moi would call an
election in the first half of this year. They would not, they claimed, be
prepared for an election campaign in such a short time.
In fact, there are important constitutional and administrative procedures to
be undertaken before an election is held. Nearly 2m new voters, out of a
total of 11m voters, have to be listed on a new, computerised voters'
register. Six thousand registration units/centres are being established as
part of this exercise - which will then be open to prospective voters to
inspect, to ensure accuracy. This is a time-consuming and costly exercise
without which a free and fair election could not be held. Constitutionally,
the election does not need to take place until early next year, at the end
of the present parliamentary term.
Mr. Holman's assertion of a self-fulfilling prophesy, 'designed to delay -
perhaps indefinitely - an election', also requires refutation. President Moi
is committed to a multi-party democratic process. He has taken urgent
measures to quell the disturbances in western Kenya - and his recent visit
to the affected areas was greeted with enthusiasm by the local people.
President Moi has always worked for a united peaceful Kenya. We are
confident that he will guide Kenya successfully through this period of
fundamental political change.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN PUSHING health to the centre of the election campaign, Labour has played
its ace; the ace of bleeding hearts.
An emotive party political broadcast, suggesting that the Conservatives want
a two-tier health service, with the consequence that some sweet little girls
will suffer months of earache while others will pay and get immediate
attention, will have its intended effect.
There is controversy over whether this work of 'faction' is an act of
deceit. Labour says the film was based on a real case, but yesterday brought
a whirl of claim and counterclaim as politicians, the hospital consultant
and the girl's family were caught up in the fray.
The faction of the film, however, is nothing compared with the fiction of
Labour's central claims about the National Health Service.
Labour has two proposals for the NHS: that it will provide more money and
that the managerial reforms initiated by the government will be reversed.
On the first count, it has to be doubted whether in the next parliament any
government will be able to afford significant extra spending on health. With
the 1992-93 public sector borrowing already at Pounds 28bn (Pounds 36bn
without privatisation receipts) and growth prospects murky, the first
post-election budget may well be about raising taxes or cutting spending or
both. Labour cannot simultaneously argue that the Conservatives will have no
room to achieve their desired tax cuts - they will not - and that it will
add large sums to public spending; or at least it cannot do so without
saying where its additional taxes - beyond those already announced by Mr
Smith - will fall.
The Pounds 1bn which Labour yesterday promised for the NHS (budget, Pounds
36bn a year) is not enough to make a serious difference to the problems
Labour accuses the government of creating.
Worse, by turning its back on the reforms, Labour would allow the NHS to
lapse into its chronic malaise of counting the cost of nothing, because
there would be a lack of individual and institutional incentive to be more
efficient. This may be aggravated by the costs of the proposed minimum wage
and Labour's uncertain mettle on public sector pay.
The National Health Service is, by and large, a success story. It has
contained the cost of health care in the British economy at a lower relative
level than in most other industrialised countries and has done so without
losing popular support.
Mrs Thatcher made the dreadful error of flirting with privatisation of the
NHS, for which Mr Major is now paying the political price. It is because of
Mrs Thatcher that Mr Major has no adequate answer to Labour's propaganda.
But by cranking up public expectations on the one hand and re-assuring the
health professionals that under Labour it will be unchecked bureaucracy as
usual, the party is selling short the service it created.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Turkey's civil war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE 1984, Turkey has been struggling with a guerrilla war in its
south-eastern provinces, launched by the separatist Workers' Party of
Kurdistan (PKK). Last year, there seemed real hope of a political solution.
President Turgut Ozal won popularity among Turkey's Kurds by backing their
kinsmen in Iraq, and by legalising the Kurdish language.
His opponent, Mr Suleyman Demirel, who became prime minister in November,
went further, releasing many political prisoners and acknowledging the
existence of a Kurdish 'identity'. The PKK responded with a ceasefire.
Alas, by late December the ceasefire had broken down. The Turkish armed
forces, apparently paying little attention to Mr Demirel's statements,
continued to fight the PKK with their familiar methods, terrorising the
civilian population and carrying out raids across the border into Iraq. In
recent weeks, things have got worse, with terrorism spreading to the cities
of western Turkey, all of which have large Kurdish communities. Last week,
the Kurdish new year was marked by mass violence, with more than 60 deaths.
Mr Demirel has now promised to seal the Iraqi border with a wall. He must
know that this is both impossible and largely irrelevant. The heart of the
problem is not the PKK bases in Iraq or Lebanon, but the support it enjoys
inside Turkey. If the authorities continue trying to suppress it by force
they are condemning the country to a long civil war, in which ethnic clashes
in the western cities - hitherto virtually unknown - will soon play a part.
The effect will be to abort Mr Demirel's liberal policies and paralyse the
country's foreign policy, by alienating European and American public opinion
at the very time when Turkey's strategic importance, both in the Middle East
and in relation to the Turkic-speaking ex-Soviet republics, is opening new
diplomatic opportunities.
None of that is what Mr Demirel wants. Nor should it be what Mr Ozal wants,
since it would undo all the work he did as prime minister and president to
turn Turkey into a modern and outward-looking economic power. He should
resist the temptation to turn the tables on Mr Demirel by an appeal to
Turkish nationalism, or to the military. Nor, indeed, should it be the aim
of the military themselves, who are the guardians of Turkey's secularist and
western-oriented tradition. They should recognise that the policy pursued up
to now has not suppressed Kurdish opposition but has inflamed it and
provoked a brutal guerrilla war, and that the only hope of preserving
Turkish unity now lies in recognising the Kurds' identity and granting them
real autonomy.
The Kurds on their side must realise how long, bloody and uncertain would be
the road to independence via civil war, given that not only Turkey but Iran
and Iraq also oppose it. They should still be ready to compromise, if
compromise is offered.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Mr Kinnock's left luggage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party has gone a long way towards transforming itself into a
modern social democratic party; but not far enough. Nationalisation and
indicative planning are out, competitive market forces are in. Yet Labour
remains encumbered by intellectual baggage from the past. Already its
statutory minimum wage is withering in the heat of the election campaign; it
does not belong in Labour's new market garden. A little more pruning is
still required.
The minimum wage is a notoriously blunt method of achieving the goals Labour
has set for itself. The UK does have more poverty than a wealthy society
should tolerate; it has more low skill-low wage employment than a developed
economy should have; and it pays some public sector workers too little.
Yet the minimum wage will leave most poverty untouched. Child benefit,
however inefficient, does at least ensure that the poor families benefit as
much as do the more wealthy. Not so the minimum wage. Most low paid workers
are second or third income earners in higher income families. The Institute
for Fiscal Studies estimates that the gains to the richest 50 cent of the
population will outweigh the gains to the lowest 50 per cent. True, the
proportionate gains are larger for low income families where someone works,
as a recent National Institute report points out. But the core poor - the
unemployed, old and infirm - will not benefit. Only 13 per cent of the
beneficiaries are in the poorest 20 per cent of households.
Moreover, unemployment and therefore poverty will increase as a direct
result of the minimum wage, as Mr Neil Kinnock implicitly acknowledged
yesterday. He endorsed an earlier National Institute study which suggested
that the gains in higher tax revenue will outweigh the higher public
spending on wages. But it also estimated that upwards of 100,000 jobs would
be lost. The market for chief executives may not be competitive; but the
market for unskilled workers is fiercely so.
There is still time for Labour to inject some sanity into its proposals
without making a complete U-turn. The decision to delay its introduction
until 1993 makes sense. By then unemployment may be levelling off while the
proposed Pounds 3.40 per hour will be substantially less than half of male
median earnings. But Labour should go further. If it must follow a European
example, it should follow Germany and set separate minimums for different
regions and industries. Moreover, an automatic link with male median
earnings should be dropped, at least until the policy's employment effects
have been assessed, while a sub-minimum should be added for people aged
under 25.
France has eschewed the sub-minimum option. Instead, it requires employers
to pay the minimum wage to young people, and then subsidises their
employment in a vain attempt to reduce very high youth unemployment. That is
one continental practice Labour should try to avoid.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Arts: The Camden Jazz Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Chick Corea is Scientology's answer to Cliff Richard, then the Church of
England had better watch out. His Elektric band came and conquered the Royal
Festival Hall again, as part of the Camden Jazz Festival, with its devotion
to slick fusion and the micro-chip.
A large part of the excitable crowd had clearly been indoctrinated by Corea
long ago, in his early electric days with Return to Forever. Others were
there to worship also at the pedals of super-guitarist Frank Gambale or
submit to Dave Weckl's hypnotic power drumming. Either way, they left
fulfilled, full of fusion and, thanks to the Pounds 3 concert programme,
totally au fait with the master's midi processors and the kind of stick
Weckl favours.
With a repertoire that verges on the hard rock, Corea's material is fast and
furious in a friendly way, and written to give full exposure to his
disciples' mind-boggling dexterity with their chip-driven instruments.
Ballads counted for nothing as each member of the Elektric Band sought to
confuse the muddy acoustics of the Festival Hall with impossibly complex
solo excursions.
As usual, Corea himself often wore a state of the art keyboard on a shoulder
strap, caressing it at one point to produce a cello solo. During the
obligatory five minute drum solo Weckl's sticks produced bass guitar lines
from the pads sitting beside the cymbals. Gambale, looking for an
alternative to the familiar guitar sound was able to employ the same
instrument for whispering synth chords. Only Eric Marienthal, a feisty
saxophonist, was left with the reedy declamation that God intended for the
alto.
Moving quickly through older material to tunes from the latest offering,
Beneath the Mask (GRP), Corea closed with an extended homage to Miles, his
pre-audit employer. The thumping stop/start fusion suite was played with
such verve and vigour by the leader, a muso close by me was moved to
comment, 'It makes you want to cut your fingers off'.
The night before, saxophone virtuoso John Harle wound up his Shadow of the
Duke tour at the Bloomsbury Theatre, which is where most of the Camden
festival is taking place. Clumsily billed as the BT John Harle Band, the
project is intended as a tribute to Duke Ellington and features some
surprising Ellington/Strayhorn compositions as well as standards such as
'The Mooche' and 'In a Mellotone'. (Incidentally, didn't EMI do well to
arrange for BT to chip in for Harle's tour and album? The company, which
also owns the Blue Note label, has persuaded hi-fi manufacturer Technics to
co-sponsor its showcase of new British jazz talent as part of the festival
and the recording to follow in the Summer.)
Harle's Shadow of the Duke is not on Blue Note but on EMI Classics which
gives a clue to his musical orientation. Classically trained as a soloist,
he regularly has concertos written for him. He is a composer and a
conductor, and one of his many major film soundtracks has won a Cannes gong.
He tours with the Michael Nyman Band, is Professor of Saxophone at the
Guildhall and plays children's concerts. He is Mr Perfect.
But can he play? Yes, and some, in this concert of two parts beginning with
a series of dramatic, thematic suites co-written with score composer Stanley
Myers and executed by the eleven pieces. Marred only by arrangements which
called for drums in clumps, the two sawing synths and bright brass, led by
Henry Lowther's trumpet, were an ideal backdrop to Harle's sweet-toned
soprano.
The mixture of Ellington compositions for the second half was thoughtfully
chosen, from the dreamy vibes with voice on 'Caravan' to the luxurious
soprano confection of 'Sucrier Velours'. 'Sonnet for Caesar' and 'Star
Crossed Lovers', were eerily tape looped and filled with gravity, eventually
bursting triumphantly into 'In a Mellotone'. Harle's own tribute, 'The
Shadow of the Duke', closed with him pitching in perfectly to match Sarah
Leonard's soaring soprano top line.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Technology: Outsiders move in - Private sector IT suppliers
are knocking on the doors of government ministries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of pink forms are rolling off printers at the Northern Ireland
civil service this month as the province prepares to quiz its farmers for
the annual pig census.
This year, for the first time, the job is being done by an outside
contractor following the privatisation of the civil service's IT division
last September. In a test case for the government policy of 'market
testing', the civil service handed over its four ICL mainframes based at
Stormont just outside Belfast to CFM, ICL's facilities management subsidiary
and the UK's second-largest IT contractor to the public sector. CFM's Pounds
20m fixed-price contract will last for five years.
The civil service's main aim was to cut costs and move to a more commercial
footing. But there were other factors as well. In particular, FM has
extricated the government from a tricky problem - how to respond to the
migration of work from the central IT service to the micros and
minicomputers installed by individual ministries.
'Because individual departments were doing more of their own computing, the
central bureau was showing a declining trend in its service over time.
Looking ahead two or three years, one would wonder what it would be like,'
says Derek Alexander, under secretary for IT at the Department of Finance
and Personnel (DFP), which used to run the province's in-house IT service.
In 1989 the IT centre started charging the departments for its service, and
this compounded the problem. 'Systems would drop off but we were stuck with
the same overheads,' says Alexander. 'In government you're expected to
recover your costs, and so we had to raise the charges to customers whose
requirements hadn't changed.'
During that same year the DFP started to think seriously about privatising
IT. After conducting a feasibility study which showed that substantial
savings could be made, it put the contract out to tender in December 1990.
Six bids were received including a proposal for a mangement buyout from the
in-house team.
'We pointed to value-for-money and cost as being major criteria,' says
Alexander. 'But we also emphasised the quality of the technical solution,
the ease of implementation, the plans each firm had to grow the business,
the credibility of the company and its previous FM experience, their
approach to personnel issues and their commitment to the province.'
Strong union opposition to the deal brought the personnel issue to the fore.
None of the bidders would have had the resources to carry out the FM
contract without persuading most of the staff to move. So it was in their
interests to offer an attractive package to DFP staff.
Alexander is pleased with the way things have gone so far. Since CFM took
over, the computer centre has cut its costs by about 15 per cent. Measuring
the saving is not easy because the department had been getting smaller and
would have cut costs on its own if a bid from the in-house team had been
successful. However, the centre is now saving Pounds 1.8m annually.
Some 110 of the 190 IT staff working for DFP were re-employed by CFM while
the rest were offered other civil service jobs. CFM took on 34 staff from
outside but there were no compulsory redundancies.
Perhaps the most visible discipline to be introduced since CFM's arrival is
that of service level agreements between the contractor and its clients
inside the civil service.
CFM has responsibility for providing Northern Ireland's six government
departments with more than 50 computer applications. Apart from the pig
census, there are systems for planning applications, benefit payments, road
maintenance, and the production of poll cards for the general election.
The company has drawn up detailed agreements with each government department
quantifying exactly what they are paying for. The help desk which serves all
departments, for example, is committed to resolving 75 per cent of all
users' problems within 10 minutes.
Service level agreements are a constant reminder of the commercial basis of
DFP's seemingly cosy partnership with CFM. At the moment both companies
share the same building. A harder edge to the relationship may develop after
next summer when CFM moves to its own multi-million pound computer site
currently under construction on a Belfast industrial park.
The move will be good for both parties, freeing 35,000 square feet of office
space for the civil service, and boosting CFM's identity in Northern Ireland
where the civil service contract is only a bridgehead.
CFM will chase further FM work from the civil service - perhaps winning back
some of the minicomputer-based systems that have migrated to individual
departments. However, its plans in the province extend far beyond FM.
Revenue from the civil service deal will help it break into other markets,
says general manager Robert Bailes. In particular, it wants to set up an
electronic data interchange network to facilitate trade between Northern
Ireland and the rest of Europe.
CFM may also undertake work for its parent, ICL. This is likely to be data
centre work and software development which will help reduce overheads for
the civil service.
The company already has 40 software developers dedicated to civil service
systems. Existing government software is always changing - after a Budget
for example - and new systems are usually in train. One current project is
the development of a grant system for small businesses trying to start up in
Northern Ireland.
Should an outside company be entrusted with systems that handle confidential
information? It's not a problem, says Alexander. 'The Ministry of Defence
runs plenty of non-IT operations on an FM basis that are just as sensitive
as anything we handle here.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / Accountancy Column: Accountants are challenged to vote
wisely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE FEW accountants in the UK can be unaware of the upcoming general
election, none of the politicians drafting their parties' manifestos seems
to be much aware of accountancy. Statements behind the policies, however,
show that the issues have not been entirely neglected.
Nothing in the Liberal Democrats' 'Changing Britain for good' document nor
Labour's 'It's time to get Britain working again' even hint at proposals
related to the profession or wider issues of corporate governance.
The Conservative manifesto, 'The best future for Britain', gets just
slightly nearer with a single sweeping statement: 'We will back the
regulators of the financial services industry in their efforts to achieve
high standards while keeping the rule books down to manageable size'.
A different story has emerged from interviews during the past few days with
Mr John Redwood, the most recent Conservative minister for corporate
affairs, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour City spokeswoman, and Mr Alex Carlile,
trade and industry spokesman for the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Redwood is cautiously optimistic about many of the changes that have been
taking place in accounting - some as a result of legislation driven by his
department, some generated by EC requirements.
'I've done what I can do, with the 1989 Companies Act and the development of
the generous canopy of self-regulatory bodies created under that,' he says.
'We don't think the next phase of development is primarily a legislative
one. It is the evolution of good practice. Government's role is to provide
leadership.'
He sees his job as encouraging better corporate governance, through
practices such as the creation of audit and remuneration committees and the
presence of non-executive directors. He says that legislation would be
impractical: 'You can't stop non-executive directors being the chairman's
friends.'
He also rules out preventing accountants from offering other services to
their audit clients. He says simply that he has chosen disclosure as an
alternative, referring to the existing requirement for audit fees to be
published in company accounts, and the new demand from this year to show the
fees from non-audit work conducted by the auditor.
Redwood resists the suggestion that he is satisfied with the mechanisms for
regulation that are now in place. 'We don't want to upheave all the
structures again,' he says. 'We're happy to give self-regulation a run. I
don't think we've seen the structures working long enough yet to judge. In a
year's time we'll have a better idea of how it's working.'
He does not rule out a rejection of self-regulation if it is judged to be
not working, and says he has his eye on tightening discipline and review
arrangements. 'There need to be improvements in timeliness and
incisiveness,' he says. 'In my own mind, there is no reason to suppose it
will fail. There is always the threat of parliamentary intervention if it
does.'
He stresses that there is 'work still to be done', of which the most
important issue is the detection of fraud. He argues that the prime
responsibility for corporate failure rests with directors. He also says that
he would consider 'tip-off' legislation to protect auditors and to encourage
them to notify regulators if they detect fraud.
Ms Mowlam, for Labour, has a cautious agenda, which clearly separates the
party's official line from that of her honourable friend on the backbenches,
Mr Austin Mitchell, who has been outspoken in his recent calls for the
reform of the profession.
'Changes in accounting and auditing are central and very important,' Ms
Mowlem says. 'There are serious problems that do need looking at. But you
can't walk in and change everything in two weeks.' She says that her views
have been formed through discussions she has held 'given the limited time
and resources you have in opposition'.
She questions Mitchell's calls for the rotation of auditors, the separation
of audit and consulting work, and government regulation of the profession.
She wants to wait for the outcome of several reviews, including the first
year of self-regulation of auditing, and the report of the Cadbury committee
on corporate governance.
On improvements to the quality of financial reporting, she says she is happy
with the work of the Accounting Standards Board and 'quite keen to give a
chance' to Mr David Tweedie, its chairman.
'The ASB as it stands is independent and beginning to work,' she says. 'I
have no doubt of David Tweedie's independence and determination to improve
the profession. I have doubts whether the profession is sensible enough to
let him do it.'
She argues that the independence of accountancy firms is important, but
questions the effectiveness of rotating firms of auditors. She says there is
little evidence that it reduces fraud and is considering instead periodic
rotation of partners within a firm working on any audit client.
She is also unconvinced of the value of 'quarantining' audit firms to
prevent them conducting non-audit work for clients. She argues that it would
narrow the focus of the profession, which could harm its ability to attract
recruits and affect its competitiveness in the market for advisory services.
She adds: 'I am not going to be cornered into saying I am satisfied with the
present system. If things don't change some of (Austin Mitchell's)
suggestions will have to be implemented.'
What she wants is a review of the definition of fraud, of auditors'
liability for its detection and their responsibilities to notify the
regulators when it is discovered. She is also considering a requirement for
a public statement on a company's internal control systems. She also calls
for compulsory audit committees, greater openness among the professional
bodies and the presentation of accounts in a way that is compatible with
government statistical requirements.
Mowlam stresses that many issues of corporate governance essentially require
a cultural shift, which presents no easy solution and cannot be dealt with
through legislation.
The Liberal Democrats' Mr Carlile is keen to spell out his party's concerns.
'We are determined to have a business sector in which people do not have to
look for hidden, sinister aspects all the time. We need to clean up
accounting. Fraud is not good for business.' He sees a need to improve
accountancy standards, and is particularly critical of historical cost
accounting. 'The methods can be very misleading,' he says. 'They are full of
fiction. Accounts tend to be short on explanatory notes.'
He questions the wisdom of rotating auditors, and says his party would
prefer self-regulation work of the profession. 'But we are not convinced it
is working terribly well,' he says.
The law on auditors' liability needs clarifying, he suggests. 'It should be
clarified to impose statutory duty to take reasonable care in the
preparation of the audit,' he says. 'Failure to detect detectable fraud
should lead to compensation for shareholders and creditors.'
Perhaps most significantly, he says: 'I would favour an (Office of Fair
Trading) examination of the way accountancy is developing.' He questions
whether the mergers between the accountancy firms have been in the public
interest, and whether pending law suits threaten their viability.
'Accountancy is now concentrated in far too few hands,' he says.
The three major party manifestos may ignore accountancy, but the politicians
do not. Accountants clearly fail to vote at their peril.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Productivity static in engineering sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE engineering industry has yet to reap any productivity gains from the
recession in spite of the severity of the downturn, which is expected to dog
the industry for most of the rest of this year, according to a report
published yesterday by the Engineering Employers' Federation.
The report declares that, in spite of the loss of 165,000 jobs from the
industry during the past year, productivity growth in the engineering
industry will remain at its 1989 level until next year. In the recession of
1980 to 1981 engineering productivity grew during the recession and surged
as the economy emerged from it.
The federation's index of productivity in the industry is forecast to rise
by about 2.5 per cent between 1989 and 1992. That contrasts with a rise of
about 11 per cent between 1979 and 1982. The implication of the report is
that this downturn is far less likely to bring the industry long-term gains.
The federation's spring economic trends report suggests that the industry
may struggle to exploit the opportunities of renewed growth as it fights off
intensifying international competition.
The report sees a rising engineering trade deficit as growth next year sucks
in more imports. It sees lower growth of exports and manufacturing
investment stuck at its mid-1990 level until at least 1994.
The report, prepared by the federation's economic policy committee, the says
renewed growth in UK manufacturing will depend on growth elsewhere in
Europe.
The report forecasts that engineering employment will fall by a further
60,000 in the next 12 months, after falling to about 1.85m in the first
quarter of this year from 2.1m two years ago.
Engineering sales are likely to rise by about 4 per cent between the second
half of last year and the first half of next year, led by a projected 12 per
cent growth in motor industry output.
Imports are forecast to rise by 11 per cent, with export growth at only 3
per cent.
Engineering companies need an improved tax climate to help them to compete
with manufacturers in Europe, Japan and the US, according to Mr Nigel Chubb,
chief executive of the Engineering Employers' East Midlands Association.
He suggested signs of an upturn had been slow to come but would increase
this year.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEW BRITISH qualifications have led to young people being taught how to lay
bricks but not how to estimate the materials required, according to a study
published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research.
The study, by Ms Hilary Steedman, compares young people on construction
industry courses in France and Germany, and says the British teenager on a
Youth Training (YT) programme is 'uniquely disadvantaged in northern
Europe'.
It finds that the new British competence-based National Vocational
Qualification (NVQ) for the industry has less mathematics training than the
City and Guilds qualification. Numbers of people attaining a recognised NVQ
would rise, but the quality of those trained might be lower than before.
The vocational qualification is based on standards of competence elaborated
by the industry as appropriate for an employee at this level.
The report said: 'It is difficult to understand, therefore, that so little
emphasis should be placed in the industry on building calculations.'
It said shifting the financial burden for training away from government and
towards employers was a reason for the reduction in education and training
in YT.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Hotel industry at 10-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROOM occupancy at English hotels last year fell to its lowest level since
1982, according to a survey carried out for the English Tourist Board.
Horwath Consulting, which carried out the survey, said that although early
returns this year suggest some improvement, it would be some time before the
industry returned to the high levels of occupancy that were achieved in the
late 1980s.
Mr Geoff Parkinson, a director of Horwath, said: 'Unfortunately, with the
hotel industry's high level of fixed costs, continuing occupancy at these
low levels will inevitably lead to further bankrupt-cies.'
The survey showed that average room occupancy in England fell by 6
percentage points to 51 per cent last year. Bed occupancy fell by 5 points
to 41 per cent.
London suffered particularly badly, with room occupancy in luxury hotels
falling by 17 points. Occupancy in the next most expensive group of London
hotels - classed at Pounds 56 to Pounds 85.50 a night - dropped by nearly 20
points.
Although the Gulf war and the recession were the principal reasons for the
country-wide fall, English hotel occupancy has been in decline since 1988,
when the average number of rooms filled reached 60 per cent.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Lloyd's Names find recovery of stop-loss claims difficult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MORE THAN a hundred Lloyd's Names
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
people whose assets back underwriting at the insurance market - are running
into difficulties in obtaining recoveries from stop-loss policies, which
provide them with reinsurance against excessive losses.
Their problems have further highlighted the difficulties of a particularly
troubled area of the Lloyd's insurance market.
Syndicates underwriting stop-loss insurance are expected to post some of
their worst losses in Lloyd's recent history when Lloyd's reports its 1989
results in June this year.
Last week brokers warned that the reluctance of many insurers to offer
stop-loss insurance for the 1992 underwriting year was undermining the
confidence of Names in the market.
The latest troubles concern policies sold by the specialist broker Carritt &amp;
Partners, which cover losses from the 1990 underwriting year.
The Names affected, who it is understood are members of catastrophe
reinsurance syndicates, have made claims to cover the cost of cash calls but
some underwriters are understood to have quibbled about payments.
A leading members' agent said yesterday: 'There is certainly a dispute which
is leading to non-payment of claims.'
Mr Michael Wade, of broker Holman Wade, which has since taken over the
Carritt company, said yesterday: 'Of course I'm concerned but due to the
circumstances I'm unable to comment at the moment.'
Separately, a change in Lloyd's procedure in dealing with stop-loss
recoveries has also led to difficulties.
Earlier this month Lloyd's instructed brokers and agents to pay all
recoveries under stop-loss policies directly to the premium trust fund - a
reserve containing the proceeds from insurance premiums earned by
syndicates.
In cases where Names have cash calls outstanding, the recoveries would be
offset against money owed by the Name. However, advisers acting for one
Name, a member of loss-making Poland syndicate 105 who has paid about Pounds
15,000 in cash calls stemming from losses made in 1985, say Lloyd's is
preventing recoveries due to him under the policies.
London Wall Holdings, the Lloyd's agency group, has offered to take over the
management of two syndicates ordered by Lloyd's last week to stop accepting
new business.
Syndicates 65 and 640 were formerly managed by the HG Chester agency.
A third agency, Hayter Brockbank, which has supported the management of the
Chester syndicates since October, said on Friday it was seeking a new agency
to take over.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Print employers warn over hung parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINT EMPLOYERS warned yesterday of the dangers to business confidence of a
hung parliament as it emerged that more than a third of them expect to cut
jobs in the next three months.
The British Printing Industries Federation said that, with an election out
of the way business confidence would revive, but it added that that assumed
that the outcome was not a hung parliament.
Its comments reflect concern among the business community that an election
with no clear winner would lead to uncertainty among customers and a longer
recession.
The federation said its quarterly survey of companies with sales of Pounds
1.2bn had produced mixed results.
Members reported that the first quarter of this year, which they had assumed
would be tough, was far worse than expected. Some 94 per cent of companies
were working below capacity. Eight out of 10 had reduced employment, whereas
only four out of 10 had expected to do so.
Employment prospects remain bleak, with 36 per cent planning further job
losses in the next quarter.
Smaller companies often shed staff by non-replacement but job shedding at
larger companies is more likely to involve redundancies. The federation
added that encouragement could be taken from the fact that two thirds of
companies believed the next three months would see an improvement in the
industry's fortunes.
Not since April 1987 has such a large proportion looked forward to better
times. Even so, the federation said most members believed it would be the
autumn before a real, as opposed to a seasonal, upturn was evident.
Hopes for stable prices have faded. Almost three in five companies have cut
prices recently, compared with the forecast one in 10. Some 20 per cent plan
further reductions.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Smart price for nave painting: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL landscape by the French nave artist Dominique-Paul Peyronnet sold
for Pounds 89,100 at Sotheby's auction of Impressionist and Modern art
yesterday. It had carried an estimate of Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,500.
Two bidders competed for 'La Source', an imaginative view of a stream, and
it was eventually sold to Dina Vierny, who is opening a gallery devoted to
nave art in Paris later this year. Works by Peyronnet, who died in 1943,
rarely appear on the market, which accounts for Sotheby's cautious estimate.
The auction totalled Pounds 2m, with just over 25 per cent unsold. A view of
Venice by Albert Marquet did well at Pounds 82,500 and two works by Utrillo
found buyers at Pounds 68,200 and Pounds 59,400. There was good demand for
ceramics by Picasso, and 'Les Chats' by Leonora Carrington almost doubled
its estimate at Pounds 41,800.
In an attempt to stimulate the weakest sector of the art market Sotheby's
reduced estimates and reserves and was selective in what it accepted for
sale. Dealers are still thin on the ground and most of the buyers were
private collectors, mainly American and British.
The main disappointment was the failure of 'Monument aux Oiseaux' by Max
Ernst to find a buyer. In 1989 a similar work by Ernst made Pounds 220,000,
but this time there were few bids even though Sotheby's was looking for only
Pounds 60,000.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Falling trend shown in home repossessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE repossession orders issued by courts last month were down by nearly
a quarter on their peak monthly levels last year.
The figures, published by the Lord Chancellor's Department, were welcomed by
the Council of Mortgage Lenders which said they showed a clearly declining
trend in the number of people losing their homes because they were unable to
keep up mortgage payments.
The figures from the Lord Chancellor's Department show that in February
lenders made 12,889 applications for repossession orders and 4,752 orders
were issued. That compares with 13,453 applications and 5,408 orders in
January.
The January and February totals were well below those recorded between April
and October last year. Repossessions peaked in July when there were almost
17,000 applications for eviction and 6,951 orders. About 75,500 people were
evicted last year for failing to keep up mortgage payments. At the end of
last year, 275,000 borrowers were six months or more in arrears and in
danger of eviction.
Last December the government and main mortgage lenders prepared measures
intended to prevent a possible flood of repossessions.
Mr Mark Boleat, CML director-general, yesterday warned that the Lord
Chancellor's figures were a very inexact indicator of repossessions but said
they suggested that, along with lower interest rates, the rescue measures
were assisting the situation.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Agency set up to run Rover marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP announced plans yesterday for a marketing strategy that might
spearhead a radical overhaul of the way UK companies use advertising
agencies.
Almost all Rover's marketing services will be handled by an agency set up to
promote the motor manufacturer.
The company said its decision to jettison about 30 different marketing and
advertising agencies in favour of one agency was driven by the need for an
integrated service. It would result in savings of perhaps 10 per cent of
Rover's marketing budget, which is about Pounds 100m a year.
The move to put Rover's marketing services in the hands of one agency has
caused ripples throughout advertising. The BSB agency, part of the Saatchi
group, was Rover's main agency and will lose revenue of Pounds 20m a year,
keeping only Land Rover UK's advertising for the time being.
Mr Kevin Morley, managing director of Rover Marketing and a long-standing
group executive, was named yesterday as chairman of the agency - the Kevin
Morley Group (KMG). He will retain his non-executive membership of the Rover
board.
Rover's decision to contract out its marketing and advertising to a former
employee follows a move in January this year, when Mr Royden Axe, a leading
designer, retired from Rover to start his own design company - Design
Research Associates (DRA). Rover is one of DRA's main clients.
The first advertisements of a campaign for the Metro range were launched
yesterday.
KMG - which has a five-year contract with Rover - will soon announce new
business apart from Rover.
The advertising industry is anxious that, should KMG prove successful with
Rover, other large advertisers might follow suit and demand cheaper
marketing services.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Main parties all seek changes in accountancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THREE main parties would consider changes to the structure and operation
of accountancy after the election, it emerged yesterday.
Mr John Redwood, the minister for corporate affairs, said he would
contemplate 'tip-off' legislation to encourage auditors to inform regulators
of any fraud if the existing voluntary arrangements were judged to be
failing.
He said it was too early to assess whether the self-regulatory mechanisms
for auditors set up late last year would work. He said he had no reason to
believe they would fail, but did not rule out more direct parliamentary
intervention if they were not effective.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's official voice on the City, said she wanted to
review the legal definition of fraud.
She is also considering requiring auditors to comment publicly on the
quality of a company's internal controls, and for compulsory audit
committees filled with non-executive directors.
She ruled out any requirements for auditors to a company to be 'rotated'
periodically, or to prevent them carrying out other work for their audit
clients. She said that would reduce the profession's ability to attract
high-quality recruits and might harm its competitive advantage in Europe.
However, she said she would consider a requirement for partners working on
any one audit client to be changed periodically to bring a fresh perspective
to the job.
Mr Alex Carlisle, trade and industry spokesman for the Liberal Democrats,
said he would support an Office of Fair Trading investigation of the
profession.
He said the recent mergers between firms had reduced the number too far, and
suggested that liability cases threatened the survival of those which
remained. 'Accountancy is now concentrated in far too few hands,' he said.
He also said the law governing auditors' liability in detecting fraud should
be reviewed.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Minimum wage effects 'limited'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a minority of Britain's personnel managers oppose the Labour party's
plan to introduce a national minimum wage at Pounds 3.40 an hour and more
than 90 per cent say the rise in the pay bill will be minimal, according to
a survey by Industrial Relations Services.
The survey of 527 private and public-sector companies also found that nearly
two thirds of respondents predicted that the minimum wage would have no
effect on pay differentials, while a further fifth expected a limited
effect.
A recent survey by the British Hospitality Association, which represents
employers in hotels, restaurants and catering, calculated that a minimum
wage would increase the wage bill by only 5.9 per cent, although that figure
rose dramatically to 65.5 per cent if all differentials were maintained.
On job losses, 85 per cent of managers did not foresee their organisation

The Low Pay Unit says the abolition of wages councils, likely if the
Conservatives win, would cost 25,000 jobs because of the drop in demand
created by lower wages.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Reading between party battle-lines from left
to right - The likely social breakdown of the MPs in the next parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BYRON CRIDDLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE candidates that the parties are fielding in the constituencies they
think they will win reveals much about each party, its values and the
interests it represents.
Mr Neil Kinnock, troubled in the early 1980s by leftwing activists choosing
candidates in their own image, was strong enough by 1987 to change Labour's
selection rules. He introduced one member, one vote, mobilising the local
membership to neutralise activists.
The effect has been to reduce significantly the number of leftwingers
getting through the net; no rightwing MPs have been deselected, whereas of
14 MPs dropped between 1981 and 1985 most were from the party's moderate
wing.
The new process has, however, greatly localised candidate selection,
favouring aspirants known to the widened local electorate. Hence the
selection of prominent local-government leaders: in the 28 seats where
Labour MPs announced their retirement between 1987 and 1992, at least 10
selected local worthies of this sort.
Retention in the selection process of 40 per cent of the votes for unions
has added to this localising trend, with the unions securing seats for their
own, often local, officials.
Long gone are the days when Labour could parachute into its safe seats
London-based dons, barristers and journalists. The party's heartland is
increasingly occupied by non-metropolitan party and union apparatchiks.
The pattern in Conservative seats is similar in one respect and different in
another. A number of potential Tory MPs are also likely to be drawn from the
ranks of full-time politicians and party insiders, but the vast majority of
the 60 candidates chosen to replace retiring MPs are London-based
professionals. If local Conservative associations have a reputation for
autonomy, they still show signs of favouring metropolitan professionals over
locals.
There are also contrasts between the political characteristics of the new
candidates, with Labour moving away from the left but the Conservatives
remaining on the right.
The great majority of new Labour MPs will be soft-left Kinnockites. In a
likely new intake of about 100 MPs (assuming a Commons in which both parties
have about 300 seats), fewer than a dozen will have hard-left histories,
from which most of them appear to have mellowed.
A Kinnockite parliamentary Labour party (PLP) will, however, face a
Conservative party reduced in size but not in fervour. In place of MPs
defeated in marginal seats - many of whom are staunch Thatcherites - the
party will have a significant infusion of new Thatcherite blood in safe
seats where MPs have retired.
In occupational terms, superficially the parties have long been on
convergent paths, to the extent of Labour becoming more 'white-collar'.
Conservative MPs have traditionally been drawn from business and
professional backgrounds in equal proportions. Labour, on the other hand,
had a large minority of manual workers, comprising in 1951 almost two-fifths
of the PLP. After the election the proportion is likely to be reduced to
about 20 per cent.
The proportion of Labour MPs with business backgrounds has always been very
low and is set to fall below 5 per cent. In place of these categories is
Labour's expanded 'middle-class' base but it is drawn almost exclusively
from the public sector, notably teaching and local administration. In
contrast the Conservative middle-class MP is a private-sector professional -
most typically a lawyer. Additionally, a significantly expanding proportion
of Labour's white-collar MPs are party and union officials.
In educational terms, while Labour has an increased number of graduate MPs
and candidates, the Conservatives have fewer MPs with a
public-school-and-Oxbridge pedigree.
In 1974 50 per cent of all Conservative MPs were of such an educational  -
and, by implication, social - background. After the election, in a
Conservative party reduced to 300 seats, the proportion will have fallen to
nearer one third.
It was said that as Mrs Thatcher rose, so the social status of the party
declined. The total of Conservative Etonians is set to fall to an all-time
low of 30 MPs (10 per cent of the total compared with 25 per cent in 1951).
Some advance has been made in the representation of women. The Conservatives
have - surprisingly, given the party's reputation for female activists who
will not choose women as candidates - picked women for six safe seats. But
with defeats expected for MPs of the last parliament such as Mrs Lynda
Chalker, the overseas development minister, the party is unlikely to end up
with many more women MPs.
Labour has, with the help of mandatory shortlisting of women, put women into
a quarter of the 100 key marginals and is likely see its number of women MPs
rise from 24 to 40 in a 300-strong PLP.
Neither party has done much for aspirants who are black or of Asian origin,
even if the Conservatives have selected two for the Tory-held seats of
Cheltenham and Brentford and Isleworth. Given the level of prejudice about
black candidates, the difficulty for the Conservatives is the lack of
Tory-held seats with a significant proportion of black and Asian voters.
Labour has far more seats with ethnic-minority electorates, and four of them
elected black candidates in 1987. The problem for aspiring black Labour
candidates is that most of the remaining seats with high proportions of
ethnic-minority voters are already occupied by high-profile white incumbents
such as Mr Roy Hattersley, Ms Clare Short and Ms Joan Ruddock.
In a party where the women's lobby is well-organised, deselection of one of
the few women MPs is unthinkable. Thus one minority serves to hold back
another.
Labour's teachers and lecturers, local administrators and union officials
confirm it as the party of public-sector defence. The growing number of
party and union organisers, however, also implies a party of power-seeking
professionals and arguably one of pragmatists.
The Tories, while retaining a mix of business and the professions, will also
include more power-focused party functionaries. Ideologically, with an
influx of rightwingers, they would be well-prepared for a populist assault
on a weak Labour government facing considerable political and economic
challenges.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown denies policy rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES within the top ranks of the Liberal Democrats over nuclear
defence and post-election strategy emerged yesterday to plague Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the party leader.
Plans for another session of 'photo-opportunities' on the Isle of Wight were
hastily recast to enable him to mount a damage-limitation exercise over
statements by Mr Simon Hughes, party environment spokesman, on the BBC's
Election Call radio programme.
Mr Hughes revived the controversy that bedevilled the Liberal-SDP Alliance
during the 1987 general election by suggesting that abandonment of nuclear
weapons would be considered by the Liberal Democrats in their promised
review of defence policy. He also expressed a clear preference for Liberal
Democratic participation in a Labour rather than a Tory government in the
event of a hung parliament.
Mr Ashdown met a barrage of questions with repeated assertions that the
statements by Mr Hughes, who has declared his support in the past for
unilateral nuclear disarmament, were consistent with the party's manifesto.
This promises a comprehensive review of defence policy and expresses the
belief that, given the improved international situation, further arms cuts
'will be able to be made without in any way endangering security'.
Mr Hughes argued that his discussions with Mr Menzies Campbell, the party's
defence spokesman, indicated that the need to retain a nuclear deterrent
could be considered.
Mr Ashdown was adamant that the party's defence policy was based on Britain
having a 'credible and deliverable' deterrent for the foreseeable future. He
acknowledged that this could involve a 'fewer number' of nuclear warheads
than currently planned for the Trident submarine fleet.
Mr Ashdown attributed Mr Hughes's preference for participation in a Labour
government to the fact that he represented Southwark Bermondsey, an
inner-London constituency, which he won in a by-election from Labour.
Liberal Democrats in other constituencies, he said, might prefer to link
with the Tories.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories condemn pension proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday sought to underpin their attack on Labour's tax
policies with a claim that Mr John Smith's plan to end incentives for
personal pensions would hit those on average incomes.
Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, said the shadow chancellor's
proposal to abolish next year the 2 per cent incentive paid to those who opt
out of the State Earnings-Related Pensions scheme would cut the incomes of
4.5m people. As the Conservatives continued to focus their offensive on the
impact of the Opposition's policies on the skilled working classes, or C2s,
Mr Newton stressed that most of those affected by the pensions issue were on
average or below-average incomes.
His calculations suggested that the cost next year to someone on average
earnings would be Pounds 5.50 per week.
The Labour plan to drop the 1 per cent incentive which the Conservatives
would pay in the following three years would add to that loss.
The overall effect for about half of those with personal pensions would be a
cash loss of Pounds 700 from their pensions. That in turn would hit the
level of retirement incomes, with losses of up to Pounds 3,000 in the
capital accumulated.

NOMINATIONS for election candidates closed yesterday with the Conservative
and Labour parties fielding candidates in all 634 seats in Great Britain.
The Liberal Democrats are fighting all of the seats apart from two where
Social Democrats are standing: Greenwich and Woolwich.
In Scotland, the Scottish National party is fighting all 72 seats and in
Wales Plaid Cymru is putting up candidates in 35 out of 38 seats, with joint
campaigns being run with the Green party in the remaining seats. The
Conservatives are also fighting some Ulster constituencies.
The Greens will not be contesting every seat as they had initially hoped.
Other groups standing include the Liberals, the National Front and the
Anti-Federalist League.
In the UK as a whole, there are 651 constituencies, one more than in the
last parliament - an extra seat has been awarded to Milton Keynes.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Smith leads the way in Midlands - Peter
Norman compares Norman Lamont with his Labour shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST OVER two weeks ago Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, unveiled a Budget
that cabinet colleagues thought would be a 'Budget for victory'.
With only a fortnight of electioneering left, all the signs are that the
issues of taxation and economic management are failing to benefit the
Tories.
Two days spent following Mr Lamont and Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
in the electorally important West Midlands showed that Labour was able to
deploy its senior economic spokesman more effectively than was the local
Conservative machine. Moreover, Mr Smith proved more adept at getting his
message across than did the chancellor.
Mr Lamont's visit to Birmingham on Monday to launch his party's campaign in
the West Midlands was blighted by poor organisation and bungled
photo-opportunities. But even if all had gone smoothly, the chancellor would
have faced problems selling the government's economic record in a region
with many marginal constituencies that have large numbers of skilled manual
voters - the so-called C2s.
The chancellor's tour of Birmingham gave the impression that local party
organisers were primarily interested in keeping him away from the public.
Two hurried photo-opportunities attracted only a handful of journalists and,
more importantly, failed to illuminate party policies. A midday speech to
businessmen was not televised.
Mr Smith's trip took him to two training centres where the redundant are
taught new skills - and he was in his element and was able in a rapid
succession of interviews to relate what was going on around him to Labour's
policies.
Every paragraph had its sound bite, testifying to Mr Smith's skill as a
communicator. But it was also apparent that, away from the high-earning
south-east of England, his message was easier to sell than that of Mr
Lamont.
Mr Smith was able to capitalise on the anxieties unleashed by the second
recession under a Tory government in Britain's manufacturing heartland. He
linked Labour's plans for training to hopes for a better future. He wanted
Britain to have 'the best-educated and trained workforce in Europe' and
therefore 'the best economy'.
According to the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, 51 per cent of
West Midlands families should be better off with Labour's Budget plans while
13 per cent would lose. Mr Smith could therefore claim that his Budget would
establish 'a fair tax and National Insurance system'.
The state of the economy forced Mr Lamont on to the defensive. He had no
encouraging economic statistics up his sleeve. The sole glimmer of hope was
a forecast from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders that an extra
70,000 cars would be sold this year after his Budget package to help the car
industry.
These measures were somewhat grudgingly received. After his lunch with local
businessmen he was asked why the government had not abolished the car tax
instead of halving it, and why the charge had not been cut one or two years
ago.
But appearances are not everything. Suspicions of Labour run deep. Mr
Smith's trip included a visit to Delcam Systems, a software manufacturer,
which had put the message 'Welcome to John Smith' with Labour's red rose on
the computer screens. But Mr Nigel Whalley, Delcam sales manager, who
welcomed a beaming Mr Smith, was unhappy at the thought of a Labour election
victory which 'would be bad for business'.

ON A DAY when the overall market rose slightly, the gap between the two
sectors of the FT Election Share Index widened a little. Shares that might
benefit from a Labour victory rose by less than the main FT-SE index, while
shares that might benefit from a Conservative win closed virtually
unchanged. Overall, however, turnover was very low.
Both portions of the index are calculated on a base of 100 as at closing

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: US-style minimum tax rule considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is still considering introducing a US-style 'minimum tax' rule for
those on the highest incomes, Mr Neil Kinnock indicates today.
Such a rule - designed to prevent the highest-paid cutting tax bills by
extensive use of allowances and tax avoidance - was suggested in last year's
policy document 'Opportunity Britain'.
The document said that a Labour government would ensure that the 'richest'
could not reduce their tax bills to below the level paid by ordinary people
'either by setting a cash limit to the total reliefs which can be paid or
adopting the US policy of a 'minimum tax' for those on top incomes'.
There is no mention of this idea in the party's manifesto but in an
interview in The Times published today Mr Kinnock revives the possibility.
He said that if people on 'exotically' high incomes were 'paying less of a
fair share than people on more generally normal incomes, it would be a case
for introducing the American system of guaranteed basic liability'.
He added, however, that the suggestion was not a 'policy promise'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Owen's old seat of Plymouth Devonport is widely expected to revert to
Labour after Owen's stewardship for the Social Democratic party. Even if
they are conceding defeat in advance, however, the Tories could hardly have
put up a more unlikely challenger.
Keith Simpson's CV includes 'married (wife's name Pepita), considerable
experience in public speaking and working with the media: recently appeared
on Channel 4's After Dark with Oliver Reed'.
He lists his hobbies as 'patronising restaurants, walking dogs, growing
cacti and carnivorous plants, and collecting and consuming malt whiskies'.
But at least he is honest: the release highlights Simpson's role as special
adviser to the defence secretary from 1988 to 1990 - surely a bold move in a
constituency where defence cuts have caused thousands of job losses.
'It reads like a suicide note,' says a local reporter.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Dewar's day - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
People in Scotland never saw Labour's contentious party political broadcast
on the National Health Service on Tuesday.
Instead they had what party officials refer irreverently to as 'Donald. The
Movie', in which Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary, portrayed how
Labour would heal the economic and social ills of Scotland.
Curiously, the Labour party did not get much of a mention. Dewar talked
mainly about the Scottish parliament, which Labour is committed to setting
up within two years.
Thus it assumed that Labour, which should win a little over 40 per cent of
the Scottish vote on April 9, would control the parliament.
This could suggest that Labour does not expect its ratio of seats to the
share of the vote (presently highly favourable to it) to suffer much from
the form of proportional representation it is proposing as the parliament's
electoral system. Viewers might also have thought that Labour was offering
Scotland independence. There was nothing about Westminster in it, and a lot
of talk of better links with Europe - just like the Scottish National party.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chutzpah may not be the Welsh word for it. But there was a certain style in
Neil and Glenys Kinnock's guest list for their twenty-fifth wedding
anniversary party in London's Inner Temple last night.
It was not just that they had successfully mixed the cultured pink
glitterati - John Mortimer, Stephen Fry and Cleo Laine - with the Parrys and
Howells of their Welsh youth. The couple also authorised invitations for the
Labour leader's whole campaign media entourage - not just the Mirror and The
Guardian, but Tory tabloids the Express, The Sun, the Mail et al were wined
and dined.
That shows confidence. But Mr Kinnock was braver still. Within sight of the
television cameras he allowed Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe,
the public services union, to give the toast.
Mr Sawyer, Labour's understated chairman, conceded that his role was
low-key. 'I am the ghost of elections past,' he said in a confession that
showed Labour is a broad church open to all minority groups. 'I . . . am a
trade union official.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: One million missing voters - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Here are the figures that everyone has been waiting for - not yet the
general election result, but at least the definitive number of those
eligible to vote. Proportionately, the figure is going down, in spite of an
increase in the population.
According to the Office of Population, Censuses and Statistics, the numbers
on the electoral register fell by about 2 1/2 per cent - or just under 1m -
between 1984 and last year, compared with the numbers that would have been
expected if people had gone on registering in their old conscientious way.
The decline became more marked after 1987.
The OPCS is much too shy - and perhaps it cannot be proved - to attribute
the post-1987 fall to the community charge, as the poll tax was officially
called. However, it must have been a factor.
Between 1990 and last year alone, the percentage of the estimated population
on the register decreased from 96 per cent to 95.5 per cent. In Scotland,
where the poll tax started earlier, the decline was even sharper.
It was mainly the young who opted out. Registrations by 'attainers' - people
about to be old enough to vote in the coming year - fell by 11 per cent in
1990.
Nevertheless, there may have been a sudden rush to register ahead of the
election. The OPCS's latest data puts eligible voters on April 9 at
43,725,003 - up from 43,556,783 last year.

Donkin visits crucial marginals around Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NUNEATON Town Hall might have been purpose-built for one of those late 1950s
British comedy films where the local worthy pulls out his pocket watch as
Norman Wisdom, playing the downtrodden Mr Pitkin, rides by on his milk cart.
This is provincial middle England where, but for the pedestrian precinct and
the Jobcentre, the pocket watch might have stopped in 1959. Nuneaton has the
sort of imposing Co-op that 30 years ago no one would have dared walk past
without knowing their 'divi' number. People still work a long time for the
Co-op. Its last assistant manager, who retired a few weeks ago, had been
there since the age of 14 with a brief break for fire-watching duty during
the Coventry blitz.
Continuity of employment, however, has become the exception rather than the
rule. In a part of Nuneaton called Bermuda - due to an affectation of a
former landowner who had been a governor of the colony - is a futuristic
development housing Federal Express, perfectly positioned near the heart of
the motorway network.
Last week the courier company, one of Nuneaton's largest private employers,
announced that the depot would close in May as part of a large-scale
retrenchment programme across Europe. About 500 jobs are expected to go.
This was no tired, declining industry defying progress, but one of the most
vibrant of the 1980s service sectors.
The failure has increased uncertainties among many service-sector employees
who dominate the jobs market in spite of the West Midlands' reputation as
the anvil of British manufacturing production. West Midlands Employment
Information Unit says that in September last year the region had 1.25m
people in the service sector, against 613,000 in manufacturing.
Nuneaton job centre has 219 vacancies and 5,821 people chasing jobs. The
rate of unemployment in the region has risen to just over 10 per cent from
the 6 per cent of early 1990. More than 40 people hunt every job in the
urban centres.
Nuneaton is a blue-collar area, mostly residential - many of its people work
in the Coventry car industries. It might be expected to be a Labour seat but
Mr Lewis Stevens, the Conservative MP, is sitting on a 5,655 majority which
Labour needs a swing of 5.5 per cent to overturn.
The seat is one of an arc of Conservative marginals to the south and east of
Birmingham that Labour believes it will win.
A 2.5 per cent swing to Labour would cost Mr Francis Maude, the financial
secretary to the Treasury, his Warwickshire North seat.
The constituency is the home of Federal Express's biggest competitor, TNT.
Its chief executive Mr Alan Jones, is a vocal opponent of Labour policy.
Before TNT arrived in Atherstone, the town was coming to terms with the loss
of most of its mining industry. TNT, with 600 staff, is Atherstone's biggest
employer. It has expanded its customer base by 15 per cent in the last 12
months. Mr Jones is worried about Labour's taxation plans and their effect
on his company.
After working out his finances based on Mr Smith's Budget, he says, he
cancelled an order for a three-piece suite and put his house up for sale.'
If Labour get in there will be a meltdown in the property market,' he says.
'If people are not going to buy things there will be no market for people to
make things.'
The knock-on effect in the movement of goods, he says, would almost
certainly lead to redundancies in his own company.
Henry Tudor is said to have stayed in Atherstone before the nearby battle of
Bosworth in 1485. If Mr Martin O'Brien, the Labour candidate, is to unseat
Mr Maude as effectively as Henry dealt with Richard III, the issue of
employment may prove to be a significant battleground.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock crew strives for a smug-free zone -
The flying start to the Labour party's bid for power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a total ban on complacency, smugness or presumption on the Kinnock
tour. At least, that is what they say.
Dare so much as hint that Labour might actually win and a posse of earnest
faces will fall on the offender with assurances that there is everything to
play for, that the campaign has merely had a good start and that it is not
over yet.
At a break for a replacement aircraft on Monday, the leader himself was
indirectly tackled on the cockiness question. 'What was the difference in
mood between 1992 and 1987?' Mr Neil Kinnock was asked. Struggling to stifle
a satisfied smile, he dodged the tackle. 'We aren't starting from 10 points
behind,' came the diplomatic reply.
But beneath the air of quiet professionalism cultivated by the Kinnock team,
it is hard to disguise a spring in Labour's steps. Almost to its own
astonishment, the machine is beginning to believe its own propaganda: that
it can, indeed that it will, win outright.
In part this confidence arises from genuine incredulity that all has so far
gone - more or less - according to plan. 'We had feared that they had
planned a 1992 campaign,' said one Labour insider. 'In fact, by using the
QEII Centre for the manifesto launch and doing 'Major. The Movie' they are
copying our tricks from 1987.'
Labour's campaign script had dictated that it should begin with the shadow
Budget, absorb the punches on tax and spending then, after a decent
interval, get on to the safe home territory of public services. In defiance
of Murphy's Law, that has broadly happened. Not only did the Smith Budget
fail to spring a significant leak, but the Conservatives were in disarray
over how to respond.
'It was the return of Mrs Thatcher that convinced us we had scored a hit,'
said one media minder. 'That really showed they were rattled.'
Senior campaigners are less openly euphoric, preferring to weigh the
political value of the upbeat mood rather than question whether it is
justified.
The decline of the damaging gaffe, a crucial component in the 1987 election,
is one consequence. There have, of course, been minor gaffes aplenty.
Yet repeated Tory allegations of blunders has devalued the charge. 'Because
they are behind, people tend to see the gaffe accusation as a desperation
measure,' one Labour strategist claimed.
Old hands argue that Labour started quite poorly in organisational terms.
Initial forays from London were unfocused and not newsworthy.
Party organisers will concede some ground to these charges. But they also
say the criticisms are small beer.
With an average two-point poll lead, Labour's until-now-smooth cruise hit
its first choppy waters yesterday when the impact of its National Health
Service election broadcast 'went nuclear'.
This turned Mr Kinnock from dignified leader on a regal progress to
something similar to a red-haired fox pursued by a pack of ravenous
journalists from the Tory tabloids. But, so far, the worst fear of his
minders - an outburst of Celtic temper - has not happened. Everyone is
working to keep it that way.
Party strategists believe they must now keep the campaign on a steady
course, confronting rather than dodging the tax and spending charges with
the 'positive programme' of its recovery package and continuing to press the
NHS and education buttons.
The aim is to build a slow, but steady opinion poll lead - 'two points a
week will do us' - and hope that the Conservative camp will follow ancient
tradition and self-destruct amid internal recriminations.
'Defence is a dead issue, they can't make the union card work so they have
only got tax and Kinnock left,' one party official argued. 'But if they play
those too hard there will be a hostile response from the public to the
stress on negative campaigning.'
All this fails to address the question of whether Labour is being too
optimistic in assuming that the drift will turn to a rout. There is, dare
one say it, just a touch of complacency about it. The truth is Labour has
not yet broken through the barrier that turns those who say the Tories do
not deserve to win into voters who argue that Mr Kinnock merits the keys of
Downing street.
But they have made a start.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major mounts attack on SNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE attack on the Scottish National party marked the start of Mr John
Major's day of campaigning in Scotland. The prime minister angrily denied
that he was acting on the basis of party interest in the debate about
Scotland's future.
At a press conference in Edinburgh he rejected the suggestion that the
Tories had been talking up support for the nationalists to split the
anti-Tory vote.
The SNP, he said, 'adheres to the sort of socialism that the whole of
eastern Europe has thrown out'. He added: 'They are an immense danger to the
potential future well-being of people who live in Scotland.'
He used the fact that the Conservatives are weak in Scotland - the party
holds just nine of the country's 72 seats - to reinforce his claims that the
government's opposition to devolution or separation was based on the future
prosperity of every region of Britain.
'If I was concerned solely about party self-advantage, I would say 'Go and
have separation, have separation, come out of the Westminster parliament'
and the effect of that would be that the Conservative party would be
undefeatable in the rest of the United Kingdom.'
He underlined his call for a full constitutional debate on Scotland, saying
that the prize, but not the price, of devolution had been set out.
The Tories' tactics have been to polarise the debate by discussing
devolution purely in terms of its leading inevitably to separation.
The prime minister accused Labour of risking long-term damage to the UK for
short-term advantage. 'They portray as a panacea what is in reality a
Pandora's box,' he said. 'Open that box - and the demon of separation would
be let loose. We should not see it caged again so easily.'
Mr Major acknowledged that some Scots felt a sense of grievance, but said
the consequences of separation included not just the direct impact on
Scotland's economy, but its position in the European Community. An
independent Scotland would not have the same influence as the UK in EC
negotiations and would not be able to deliver as good a deal.
'If after all the arguments have been carefully weighed, the people of
Scotland want to break that bonds that bind us, then it can be done. No
nation can be held within a union against its will,' Mr Major said.
'But it would be an unimaginable disaster were we to do so. Whether we
intend to or not, if we take the wrong decision, we will break up the United
Kingdom.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Playing heart-strings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's ex-ploitation on TV of images of a young schoolgirl in pain has
become the focus of the most virulent exchange of insults and accusations of
the campaign. That is hardly surprising. If the Conservative counter-attack
strikes a chord with voters, the government might yet avoid defeat. If
Labour's TV heartbreaker prevails, the Tories are finished.
The broadcast was described as 'shameless' by Mr Michael Howard, the
employment secretary, yesterday. Considering the source, that is praise
indeed. Mr Howard's habitual use of hyperbole casts 'shameless' in a new
light. Uttered by him it must mean 'brilliant', as when the young deploy
'wicked' to much the same purpose.
Mr Michael Heseltine chose a different adjective - 'despicable'. It brought
to mind the use by President George Bush of Willie Horton, a murderer, in
his campaign against Mr Michael Dukakis, then governor of Massachusetts.
Horton had been given a weekend pass under state legal procedures. He
escaped, raped a woman and stabbed her companion. The Bush commercial was a
ruthless appeal to racial fears. It was despicable.
Labour's broadcast showed one little girl getting instant treatment on the
strength of her mother's cheque book while another suffered as she waited
for surgery on the National Health Service. Let's regard the film as an
allegory. As such, it appealed to class antipathies, the muddled British
sense of fair play, and our subconscious terror of being bereft of medical
care when we need it. It also spoke to the personal experiences of many
voters, their friends, or their near relatives. It rested on a mountain of
anecdotal evidence. It was shameless.
It was also humbug. Labour has no claim to moral superiority. The architect
of the NHS, Aneurin Bevan, consciously laid the foundations of a two-tier
system of health care, one for the rich and one for the rest of the
population. Private patients could be treated in state-owned hospitals from
the start. He may not have liked it, but he acknowledged that it was
unavoidable. It still is.
Bevan also knew that some patients would be made to wait. 'We never will
have all we need,' he said on the eve of the establishment of the service.
'Expectation will always exceed capacity.' Since then, the tier of money has
been overlaid by a tier of connections between favoured doctors and chummy
consultants.
The extra Pounds 1bn Labour proposes to spend on the NHS if it is elected
will not change that. The service cannot hope to satisfy every demand, since
it is free at the point of use and supply is rationed by the Treasury.
They began to sow the seeds of their own destruction might enable doctors to
ensure that more patients make the best of what will always be an unfair
system. That is what the government's reforms are intended to achieve.
Labour is obscuring what should be a rational debate by the use on TV of
soap-opera techniques.
Yet whatever you think of such methods, it is the Tories who have allowed
the NHS to become the foremost non-economic issue in this election campaign.
They brought it on themselves.
The story starts shortly after the 1987 election, which the Conservatives
won with a majority of 102. That third smashing triumph in a row went to
their heads. They began to sow the seeds of their own destruction. Mr John
Moore, then secretary for social services, failed to secure an adequate cash
allocation for health during the public spending round. The Treasury
minister with whom Mr Moore had to deal was Mr John Major. Mr Moore was at
that time tipped as a successor to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. He was broken by
Mr Major's tough bargaining. As winter drew on, he had to come back for an
emergency Pounds 100m injection into the NHS.
Mrs Thatcher blew up. Ad-libbing in a TV interview, she announced a thorough
review of the service. That was at a time, remember, when the Conservatives
seemed to be invincible. The far-out rightwing think tanks put up plans to
privatise it or to change to a wholly insurance-based system. Mrs Thatcher
never quite fell for those, but she flirted with them. In consequence, the
review was foredoomed by its use of the language of markets, prices,
purchasers and even customers.
When Mr Kenneth Clarke succeeded Mr Moore - and Mr Major became dauphin - he
found an inchoate plan to divide purchasers of care from providers. With the
exception of tax relief for private health insurance for the elderly, the
wilder ideas had already been discarded. Mr Clarke built a new structure
around the internal market theory of management. Thus did 'GP fundholders'
and 'trust hospitals' come on to the scene. 'Opt-out' was invented by a
newspaper. Still infused with the post-1987 Conservative hubris, Mr Clarke
declined to contemplate a pilot scheme before the launch of the new system.
Shortly before she was deposed in November 1990, Mrs Thatcher had the
collywobbles. Should the reforms be put off until after the election? Her
successor, Mr Major, lacked the depth of experience that might have led him
to shelve the project. Instead, he persuaded Mr William Waldegrave, the new
health secretary, to tackle Labour's wily Mr Robin Cook head-on. That was
madness. Every time health hit the headlines, Labour rose in the polls. Only
a wave of revulsion against shamelessness would make it different this time.
Mr Major's attack on the opposition last night - 'such men are not fit to
govern' - was therefore well worth a try, but if it is true to past form
Labour will get the better of the political argument.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: TUC withholds formal endorsement for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time in recent memory the general council of the Trades Union
Congress has withheld its formal endorsement for the Labour party in the
coming election.
This is not because the unions have lost faith in the party they established
at the beginning of the century. The unions have said nothing, and are
taking virtually no part in Labour's national campaign, because they
desperately want Labour to win.
In past election years, the last TUC general council meeting before an
election has put out a ringing statement urging members of TUC-affiliated
unions to vote Labour. That is so unremarkable that it normally goes
unreported.
Yesterday's general council meeting made no statement on the election.
Labour and the unions alike have concluded that their close political and
financial ties are a presentational handicap to a party seeking to become a
future government.
It appears that one of the formal or informal gatherings that bring together
senior union officials and Labour officials decided to ask for no formal
endorsement.
Even though the unions are paying for about 90 per cent of the Labour
campaign and still hold 90 per cent of the votes at the Labour party
conference, the Conservatives have so far failed to exploit the union-Labour
link in the election campaign.
That is partly because the relationship has genuinely changed. Labour has
accepted most of Mrs Thatcher's union reforms, initially to the irritation
of the unions. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, has a more
arm's-length relationship with union leaders than many of his predecessors.
The union block vote is already being phased down and, whichever party wins
the election, Labour's link with the unions is bound to become looser still.
Nearly half of Labour's annual running costs are, significantly, now covered
by non-union sources.
In some ways it is an odd time for both sides of the union-Labour link to be
acting so shyly about it. Trade unions in the UK are much less unpopular now
that they have lost so much power. The Labour party has also won back a lot
of the trade unionist support it lost in 1983 and 1987.
Only 33 per cent of union members in 1983 and 42 per cent in 1987 followed
the TUC appeal to vote Labour. This time about 55 per cent of union members
are expected to vote Labour, and without even being asked to.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Parties steer clear of a traffic jam - The
Issues, Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS such a blindingly simple idea that it is a wonder no one has latched
on to it. Why is none of the main parties promising to end road traffic
congestion and make the trains run on time?
A sure-fire vote winner it may be, but it is some tribute to the
intractability of Britain's transport troubles that no one can give such an
undertaking without testing the credibility of their policies to
destruction.
Panaceas, then, are thin on the ground in this campaign.
Take the Conservatives. It is less than a year since Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
transport secretary, declared himself 'enthusiastically and unequivocally'
in favour of getting more freight and passenger traffic on to the railways.
Just how that was to be achieved was never altogether clear, but one
departure from previous policies was Mr Rifkind's initiation of a study into
road pricing - charging motorists for use of roads on a pay-as-you-go basis.
This last idea was a nod towards the unpalatable fact that the proportion of
passenger and freight journeys undertaken by the railways today is so small
that even to double it would produce only a small hiccup in the rate of road
traffic growth. With further road building heavily constrained by
environmental considerations, the implication is that traffic congestion
will eventually have to be tackled by pricing people off the roads.
To say that that notion went down badly with Mr Rifkind's ministerial
colleagues would be an understatement. Road pricing was struck off the
political agenda as suddenly as it had appeared. Not surprisingly, the
Conservative manifesto makes no mention of it, instead emphasising
government plans to spend Pounds 6.3bn on road building.
It is a similar story with railways. Mr Rifkind's ambitious plans to break
up and privatise British Rail raised too many fears of higher fares and cuts
in services to risk putting before a fickle electorate. Thus the
Conservative manifesto retains the promise to sell off BR's freight trains
because they do not carry voters, but privatisation of the passenger
services has given way to more modest plans for allowing private-sector
operators to run trains on BR's tracks.
Even so, one significant change has survived the emasculation. In the next
parliament, we are promised, the Tories would start franchising out the
operation of existing BR services to the private sector. The attractive
notion underlying the plan is that the private sector will turn out to be
much better at running trains than state-owned BR. The bad news is that the
record of the private railway companies in the pre-nationalisation era does
not convincingly support that view.
Would a Labour government do better? Like the Tories, Labour ducks the
crucial issue of how to ration available road space among rapidly rising
numbers of users. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, construes
road pricing as an attack on the poor, and has taken to embarrassing Mr
Rifkind by reminding him of his erstwhile enthusiasm for the idea.
Unlike the Conservatives, Labour does not attempt to suggest that road
building offers an alternative. Indeed, it says it will put a moratorium on
road building until it has compiled a list of transport priorities. That
will mean levelling the playing field between road and rail schemes by
requiring both to be assessed on environmental, social and economic impact.
Further investment, Labour's manifesto suggests, will be ploughed into the
railways by freeing BR from the straitjacket of the public-sector borrowing
requirement and allowing it to borrow from the private sector. How that is
to be achieved without drastic changes to national accounting rules is not
explained.
Superficially, it is an attractive picture. Experience, however, has shown
that improvements in public transport have little or no effect on traffic
growth: so without pricing to discourage it or building to accommodate it,
congestion could turn into paralysis.
That is one bullet that the Liberal Democrats are prepared to bite. Like
Labour, they are against the privatisation of BR and advocate similar means
of shifting the balance of investment from road to public transport. But
they promise to accompany the policy shift with road pricing in urban areas
and phased increases in petrol prices.
The Liberal Democrats, too, show a keen awareness of political realities
with a whole raft of exemptions and concessions for motorists in rural areas
 -the communities from which they draw their greatest support. Probably a
hung parliament would find little to divide them from Labour: and, whatever
the outcome of the election, the transport revolution may be a long time
coming.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A market by any other name / A look at Robin
Cook's plans for the health service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR William Waldegrave, health secretary, often points out that versions of
the government's health reforms are being introduced worldwide.
His point is correct but it brings him little political comfort. Since many
British voters have only the flimsiest understanding of the detail of the
year-old reforms, the fact that politicians and health care professionals
are pondering similar solutions to common problems in Sweden, the
Netherlands, Israel or New Zealand is not going to win the health debate.
It would, however, impose some difficult decisions on an incoming Labour
government. Labour is fighting the election pledged to scrap the reforms.
Given the zeal with which the party has opposed them, any other position
might have bewildered its candidates and voters alike. However, the main
question in the minds of National Health Service professionals is whether
abolition of the reforms would necessarily lead to the market-like structure
on which they are founded being dismantled.
The big health care issue is much the same throughout the developed world.
Essentially it involves finding ways of controlling rapid cost increases in
the face of even more rapidly growing demand driven by higher public
expectations, technological advance and the expensive treatment required by
an ageing population.
Governments of all political persuasions are trying to force more efficiency
out of their health delivery systems. The separation of the purchase of
health care from its provision - the centrepiece of the government's reforms
 -is a fashionable notion at the heart of many attempts to do this.
Labour will certainly speedily abolish the more controversial specific
aspects of the government's changes, notably self-governing trust hospitals
and GP fund-holders.
On the purchaser-provider split, Labour's manifesto says it would create a
'modern, efficient NHS with incentives to improve performance - but without
the queue-jumping and waste created by a market in health care'. It would
hope to do this through performance agreements between health authorities
and hospitals, with additional incentive funds for institutions which
performed above target.
Call it a market or not, there is still a glimpse of competition - there
would be winners and losers in the bid for extra funds.
Some health care specialists do not think this model would create
sufficiently robust separation between purchaser and provider to create
efficiency improvements. Professor Chris Ham, of Birmingham University's
health service management centre and the King's Fund college, believes that
retention of trust hospitals is needed to stimulate true bargaining between
managers.
This view is not universally shared. There is a trend in bureaucracies -
among which the NHS is world-class - towards devolved decision-making. Many
local authorities and other public bodies are introducing versions of
internal markets, with individual departments having to sell services to
each other.
If this managerial atmosphere survived a Tory defeat, it is possible Labour
could retain the principle of the reforms while claiming it had eradicated
the government's 'commercial market'.
On spending, an incoming Labour health secretary would do well to keep pace
with the relatively generous settlements that Conservative predecessors have
won from the Treasury in the last three years. The Labour pledge to spend an
extra Pounds 1bn over the next 22 months has to be viewed in the context of
the service's Pounds 36bn budget for 1992-93: Pounds 1bn is a handy sum of
money, it is not a passport to transformation.
The long political process leading to the government's health reforms and
this year's general election clash over the future of the health service
began in 1988 with claims that the service was structurally underfunded -
Britain spends less of its GDP on health care than most developed nations.
Labour acknowledges that it may take at least the lifetime of a parliament
to tackle what it regards as a decade of Conservative party underfunding.
But all political parties know that, regardless of economic constraints, any
attempt to reach a 'correct' level of health care funding is a
struggle-unto-death with a moving target as demands keep rising. Arguments
over waiting lists make for good political exchanges, but waiting lists are
the way in which the NHS rations finite resources.
One of the most interesting aspects of Labour's plans is its enthusiasm for
promoting healthier lifestyles. Health promotion used to be regarded, even
among many health care professionals, as a fringe issue compared with the
real business of giving people expensive treatment in hospital. Now health
care systems throughout the world, in the the face of cost pressures, are
showing growing interest in prevention being better than cure.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pledge given on cash for operations and
waiting lists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday allocated Pounds 582m of the extra Pounds 1bn it intends to
spend over the next two years on the National Health Service, and gave an
uncosted pledge to raise by 50 per cent the amounts earmarked for reducing
waiting lists and cutting cancelled operations.
It said it considered it prudent to leave a margin for 'contingency
expenditure'.
Yesterday's measures would be in addition to channelling Pounds 60m
generated by ending tax relief on private health care into National Health
cancer services.
The largest single sum - Pounds 136m - will be spent on recruiting an
additional 7,000 nurses.
Another Pounds 35m would be used to help fund extra staff to reduce the
pressure of work on junior doctors.
A total of Pounds 100m would be spent on upgrading hospital buildings,
Pounds 35m would go towards lifting standards of cleanliness and Pounds 50m
would be used to kick-start more than 50 projects to provide accommodation
for patients from mental health hospitals.
Everybody over 40 would be entitled to free eye tests in an initiative for
which Pounds 95m has been set aside.
A further Pounds 50m would go to ensure that all intensive care beds could
remain open at all times.
A family doctor fund would provide Pounds 56m to improve the service
provided by general practitioners; bids from GPs for funding innovative
schemes would be invited.
Labour would spend:

FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Child's surgeon complains of underfunding -
Consultant's letter tells father that the wait was unacceptable - Cash
problems in the district outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From AP ARDOUIN, FRCS, DLO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This letter was written on February 17 by Mr Alan Ardouin, consultant at
Kent and Canterbury Hospital, to Mr John Bennett, father of the child
portrayed in Labour's election broadcast as having to wait months for
surgery.
Dear Mr Bennett,
Thank you for your letter. I hope by the time that you receive this letter
that Jennifer will at least have had a date for an admission if not already
been in. I have been discussing the problem with your general practitioner,
Dr Cwynarski, and I have also had copies of correspondence between Mr John
Bragg our district chairman and Roger Moate your MP, to whom I am sending
copies of this reply.
I agree with you that it is unacceptable for children, especially if they
have had deafness, to wait as long as Jennifer has had to wait for her
surgery. One of the problems in this particular unit is that we only have
seven children's beds suitable for accommodation of overnight stay patients.
In addition there is insufficient funding to allow us to have nursing cover
on Sunday nights when we would normally admit four patients and on Friday
nights, which prevents us doing anything on a Friday which requires an
overnight stay. As a result the waiting list for overnight stay patients has
climbed enormously in spite of our protestations that we needed nursing
cover on Sunday nights and Friday nights.
Recently the district have allocated further funds on a temporary basis for
us to have the extra nursing cover that we require. Also we have had the
opportunity of having one extra operating list and this is enabling us to
clear 50 or so cases off our waiting list. I only hope that it will be
possible to maintain the staffing levels after this exercise so that we can
continue at a steady rate to clear the waiting lists and not go through the
stop/start procedure that we are having at the moment.
Some of our problems are in relation to the funding of the district as a
whole which has been poor, related to other districts in Kent. This is being
redressed but the effect will not be immediate. We suffer from the fact that
this district has two district hospitals and not just one and therefore the
funding and development monies have to be shared between the two and at the
present time the lion's share is going to Thanet which is rather
underdeveloped in comparison with Canterbury. It is a matter of priority as
to which hospital gets the lion's share of the money available. These are
political matters outside our influence.
Finally the last point you made in your letter, why in 1992 do children have
to wait for over a year for treatment which was available to you in two
weeks 40 years ago, I think it was fortunate that you could have treatment
in that time 40 years ago but when I came here the waiting list was only six
weeks and now it is over a year principally because there are no more
consultants here now in ear, nose and throat surgery than there were 40
years ago yet some specialities have increased by as much as six times.
There is the possibility of an additional consultant being appointed next
year but this is to replace an existing associate specialist so I doubt
whether this will improve the productivity.
Our greatest need is for continuing nursing cover on our children's ward and
sufficient beds in the hospital to prevent medical emergencies constantly
invading our beds necessitating frequent cancellations of operations.
Yours sincerely,
AP Ardouin, FRCS, DLO,
Consultant Otolaryngologist.

<TEXT>
The voters in the Martin family - Lyn, Tony and Russell, their son - entered
the election campaign undecided about which party to support. Paul
Cheeseright hears their reaction to the latest Labour election broadcast
LYN MARTIN found it 'heart-rending' to see a child in pain with earache.
Labour had clearly touched just the nerve it intended.
Tony, her husband, agreed that 'it got the point over', although he was
cautious: 'I don't know whether it's accurate.' He had reservations about
the tastefulness of the broadcast. 'They shouldn't use children like that.
It was pitiful, wasn't it?' Labour, Tony said, was playing for 'the sympathy
vote'.
Russell Martin, the 18-year-old first-time voter, is tending to the
Conservative position on trust hospitals. 'I don't side with Labour on
this,' he said as he came home from work as a police cadet yesterday
evening. He thought the trust hospital would be 'user-friendly - the job
will get done for the patient'.
His mother is more ambivalent. She works in the Yardley Green part of East
Birmingham Hospital - an arm which takes trust status next year. 'When they
said they wanted a trust, we all signed petitions; we didn't want it, but it
happened anyway.'
So far she is not much affected but 'we can see things happening' in
preparation for next year, she noted. 'They're closing wards, but then
they're building new ones as well.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / BNL-BCCI papers subpoenaed in NY
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Morgenthau, the federal district attorney for Manhattan who last
year was the first US prosecutor to indict the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (BCCI) on fraud charges, has issued a subpoena to Italy's
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), demanding documents related to fund
transfers between BNL and BCCI.
The move is believed to be the first concrete step by a US prosecutor to
probe the series of unexplained financial links between the two banks.
Former officials of BNL's Atlanta branch were indicted last year in the US,
with Iraqi government officials, in connection with the extension of more
than Dollars 4bn of loans to Iraq, part of which helped President Saddam
Hussein to finance the development of missiles, chemical weapons and a
'Super Gun.'
But the Atlanta-based prosecutors have been criticised in Congress for what
has been seen as their 'go-slow' approach to the BNL affair. Congressmen
such as Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, have
alleged recently that the State Department acted in 1989 and 1990 to delay
the BNL indictments, and to prevent key Iraqi and Jordanian suspects from
being charged.
Mr Morgenthau's investigators, in the course of their work on BCCI, came
across indications of financial links between BCCI and the BNL Atlanta
branch. These are believed to include a BNL account that transferred funds
to BCCI in the Bahamas, and the discovery of nearly Dollars 2.5bn of
overnight money market transactions between BCCI's London, Abu Dhabi and
Hong Kong branches, and BNL Atlanta.
BNL executives have denied any wrongdoing and are not considered the target
of Mr Morgenthau's subpoena, issued in the last few days. Mr Pietro
Lombardi, the head of BNL's New York branch, declined to take calls
yesterday.
Members of the Italian parliamentary commission examining the BNL-Atlanta
case have confirmed that Mr Morgenthau has subpoenaed documents in the BNL
New York office which might relate to dealings with BCCI.
In Rome yesterday, this was seen as a significant move since Mr Morgenthau
is acting independently of the main enquiry into the affair being conducted
by Justice Department officials based in Atlanta. The parliamentary
commission has taken the view that it has not received the full co-operation
of the US authorities and that the Atlanta prosecution could be influenced
by Washington to avoid embarrassing revelations.
The subpoena of the BNL New York office documents follows discovery of
potential links between accounts held under the name of Oscar Newman and
transfer to banks including BCCI. 'The Manhattan attorney (Morgenthau) has
recognised links between the account of Oscar Newman and the BCCI, and thus
has at least competence for a small part of the BNL-Atlanta investigation,'
Mr Massimo Riva, vice-chairman of the commission, was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that Italian security services have been called to
investigate a mysterious break-in on March 10-11 at offices in Rome where
the commission held sensitive documents on the BNL Atlanta affair.

FT  26 MAR 92 / EC attack over Bush's line on environment

<TEXT>
THE DIVIDE between the US and other industrialised countries over a
commitment to reduce greenhouse gases widened yesterday after the European
Community had charged that Washington was jeopardising the outcome of the UN
Earth Summit, to be held in June.
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, said President George
Bush's refusal to commit the US to greenhouse gas reduction targets was an
'attack on the very heart of the conference', implying that the president
was using the issue to garner domestic political support among car-users and
industry.
In Washington, Mr Bush, who is expected to announce soon his decision to
attend the summit, in Rio de Janeiro, reiterated his opposition to the
imposition of targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions - a goal of most
other countries to attend the conference.
In a message to the US Congress, Mr Bush said he hoped to reach agreement in
Rio on 'a global framework convention that will commit as many nations as
possible to the timely development of comprehensive national climate action
plans.'
He said, however, that these plans should fit each country's particular
circumstances. 'This approach is preferable on environmental and economic
grounds to the carbon-dioxide-only proposals that others have espoused,' he
said.
The EC has set a goal to stabilise CO emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, this
to be achieved in part through a controversial plan for a mixed carbon and
energy tax which would levy the equivalent of Dollars 10 per barrel of oil
on all forms of non-renewable energy by 2000. The bulk of the charge would
fall on fossil fuels.
But the EC Commission fears its 12 member states, wary of European industry
incurring a competitive disadvantage, will not endorse such a tax unless the
US and Japan adopt similar measures.
Mr Bush's name is the most conspicuous omission from the list of heads of
government who have agreed so far to go to the summit. His absence would
mark a serious, perhaps fatal, setback for the event.
A senior US administration official said he believed an announcement about
Mr Bush's plans would be made after the preparatory meeting for the summit,
now taking place in New York and due to finish on April 3.
Officials have hinted that Mr Bush is withholding acceptance as a bargaining
counter in the preparatory talks, where the US has been thrown on the
defensive over a number of counts, including its resistance to demands for
sharply increased environment-targeted aid to the Third World.
Mr Bush said this week that he would not subscribe to any Earth Summit
measures which might affect US jobs, though he appears to have softened his
position on aid. The feeling among delegates at the preparatory meeting is
that Mr Bush will have no choice but to go.
THE MEXICAN government has announced an ambitious scheme to force the
capital city's industries to clean up their impact on ther environment,
requiring them to cut emissions of some dangerous pollutants by 90 per cent
in 18 months, reports Damian Fraser from Mexico City.
The government will offer all of Mexico's industry 4,000bn pesos (Dollars
1.3bn) this year in subsidised loans to meet new environmental requirements.

CHINA'S embassy in London said yesterday that one of its diplomats had
disappeared but insisted his flight was caused by an extra-marital affair
and was not a defection, Reuter reports. The Home Office said a Chinese man
had asked for political asylum but did not name him.
An embassy official said a first secretary and his wife left the embassy
suddenly on March 18 and were still in Britain. The man's departure 'had
nothing whatsoever to do with politics,' the official said. 'Therefore
political asylum is out of the question.'
The official said the man's wife had asked several times that she and her
husband be allowed to cut short their posting and return to China.

<TEXT>
AN ISRAELI opinion poll has shown a sharp swing against the government of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir among the country's new immigrants from the
former Soviet Union, whose votes could have an important bearing on the
outcome of the general election in June.
Support for right-wing parties, including Mr Shamir's governing Likud Party
and its erstwhile smaller right-wing coalition allies, has fallen to 27 per
cent, against 35 per cent in January, according to the latest survey of
political preferences among immigrants by the Jerusalem-based Tazpit
Research Institute.
Support for the left, the opposition Labour Party and its traditional
allies, rose to 43 per cent from 30 per cent.
The results contrast with the position in April 1991, when the same survey
gave the right 46 per cent support, against just 21 per cent for the left.
Some 29 per cent of newcomers polled expressed no preference. The survey did
not take into account support for immigrant parties which intend to contest
the election.
Under Israel's proportional representation, system, the immigrant vote is
likely to account for up to eight of the 120 seats in the finely-balanced
Knesset.
At the last election, Labour won 39 seats to Likud's 40. Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
newly-elected Labour leader, is looking to the Russian vote to help him tip
the balance against the government.
The apparent swing to the opposition among immigrants is largely attributed
to the fact that 40 per cent are jobless.
Prime Minister Shamir said yesterday Israel's relations with the US were
firm despite problems and misunderstandings, Reuter reports.
US-Israeli relations have been buffeted by Washington's refusal to grant the
Jewish state Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees unless it halts settlement of
occupied Arab lands.
In addition, a 15-member US team is in Israel this week investigating the
possible unauthorised transfer of US arms by Israel to third parties.

Mr Cayetano Paderanga, economic planning secretary, yesterday briefed the
policy-making National Economic and Development Authority, which is headed
by President Corazon Aquino, on 'signs that the country is on its way to
recovery'.
He said growth in the domestic economy in the last quarter of 1991 'turned
slightly positive', compared to a 3.1 per cent fall in the third quarter.
Higher growth had come from increased public building, higher export
receipts, and heavy industrial re-stocking.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A POWERFUL businessman and politician from northern Thailand who was refused
entry to the US last year because of alleged links to heroin trafficking was
proposed yesterday as the country's new prime minister.
Mr Narong Wongwan, a taciturn 66-year-old entrepreneur with interests in
tobacco, logging and other agricultural industries, was chosen by a group of
five pro-military parties which announced yesterday that they had formed a
coalition following the general election on Sunday.
The choice of Mr Narong dismayed western embassies and the business
community in Bangkok, although Mr Narong said he was proud to be entrusted
with the premiership. 'I'll do my best for the country,' he told a news
conference. 'I will be decisive and fair in my job.'
He brushed aside questions about drugs, and his associates said suggestions
that Mr Narong was involved in the trade were unfounded and unfair.
Ms Margaret Tutwiler, of the US State Department, confirmed yesterday that
Mr Narong had in July last year been denied a visa to the US under section
212 of the US Immigration Act. This section allows the US to deny visas to
anyone known or believed to be involved in the illicit trafficking of
controlled substances.
Mr Narong, a former agriculture minister and leader of two other political
parties in the past, now heads the Samakki Tham (Justice Unity) Party, which
was created last year with the approval of the armed forces after they
overthrew the previous elected government in a coup d'etat.
Samakki Tham was established to strengthen the influence of the military in
parliamentary politics, and the party won the largest number of seats - 79 -
in the election on Sunday. In order to achieve a majority in the 360-seat
lower house of parliament, however, Samakki Tham decided to form an alliance
with four other parties sympathetic to the military. The coalition is likely
to be fragile.
Mr Narong, an elected MP, was apparently chosen by the pro-military parties
as a compromise candidate in response to opposition among liberals and
students to the idea of a non-elected, senior military officer being
appointed by the outgoing junta.
The choice of Mr Narong puts the supporters of democracy in a quandary. 'The
Thai electorate has spoken,' said one western diplomat yesterday. 'If the
leader of the largest party becomes prime minister, who are we to object?'
Mr Narong has yet to be confirmed by parliament or by King Bhumibol
Adulyadej. Mr Samak Sundravej, leader of the Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizens)
Party, another coalition member, said a further two weeks would be needed
before the first parliamentary session could be convened.
Haggling over cabinet posts may yet upset the coalition and the proposal to
install Mr Narong.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Roh Tae Woo can probably say good-bye to his dreams of
transforming his Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) into a Korean version of
Japan's liberal democrats - one, strong party that would dominate the
political landscape and guarantee stable democratic rule.
Four months after President Roh was elected in 1988, the opposition won a
majority in the national assembly. In 1990, Mr Roh persuaded a fragmented
opposition to join his Democratic Justice Party to form the DLP. Two of the
three opposition parties joined Mr Roh, giving him control with a two-thirds
majority. Now the DLP is in danger of disintegrating. He is virtually back
to square one.
Mr Roh might have tried, had he retained his majority in parliament, to push
through constitutional amendments that would change the political system
into a parliamentary one with the legislature appointing the cabinet. This
way, Mr Roh would have secured control over both the cabinet and parliament.
South Korea now operates under a constitutional structure similar to the US,
with a separation of the executive and legislative branches.
'The Korean people voted for a balance of power,' said one Korean journalist
yesterday in assessing the results.
Parliamentary control has slipped out of Mr Roh's hands for the second time
in four years following the narrow defeat of the DLP in Tuesday's elections.
President Roh may still be able to salvage the situation. The DLP fell only
one seat short of obtaining a majority in the 299-member unicameral
parliament. That obstacle could be overcome if the president persuades some
of the 21 independent representatives, most of them former DLP members who
lost their party nominations, to support the government. Tuesday's outcome,
nevertheless, remains an unexpected and humiliating defeat for President
Roh.
Even if he is able to obtain a majority, Mr Roh's party may still break up.
Opposition leader Kim Young Sam took his party into the DLP in 1990. He had
hoped that in return, he would receive the party's nomination in the
presidential election scheduled to take place in December. But the party's
election defeat may cost Mr Kim, who ran the DLP campaign, the nomination
and it could lead to the departure of his faction from the DLP.
Meanwhile, Mr Kim Jong Pil, the other opposition leader who joined the DLP
in 1990, offered his resignation as one of the party's co-chairmen after his
faction scored poorly.
The election vote reflected dissatisfaction over the economy, with the
inflation rate predicted to reach 14 per cent this year. Allegations of a
state smear campaign against an opposition candidate in Seoul and charges of
vote rigging by the military may have reminded voters of the DLP's
connections with the country's former military dictatorship.
While the DLP'S fortunes are waning, those for Kim Dae Jung, leader of the
Democratic Party, the main opposition group, are on the rise. The impressive
performance of the Democrats, who increased their parliamentary
representation from one fifth to one-third with 97 seats, is likely to
dampen talk that Mr Kim was becoming too radical for Korean voters.
The Democrats not only scored well in their stronghold of Cholla, the poor
agrarian south-western region, but outpolled the DLP in Seoul, the most
important electoral area in the country with a quarter of the national
population. This should make Mr Kim a formidable presidential candidate in
the December elections.
Perhaps the most surprising result of Tuesday's elections was the strong
emergence of the Unification National Party (UNP). The party, established
recently by Mr Chung Ju Yung, founder of the Korean conglomerate Hyundai,
won 31 seats and an influential role in the assembly. The UNP obtained 17.3
per cent of the vote against 38.5 per cent for the DLP and 29.2 per cent for
the Democrats, with the rest distributed among independent candidates.
The other big Korean conglomerates - Samsung, Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar -
are cautiously assessing the new political clout of Mr Chung and, by
extension, Hyundai, the second largest business group, or chaebol, in Korea.
Mr Chung is campaigning for less government interference in business at a
time when the state is trying to reduce the power of the chaebol by forcing
them to shed some of their subsidiaries and to reduce the strong hold the
founding families have in particular industrial sectors. Although the
chaebol formerly benefited from government largesse, including cheap credit,
officials now argue that the chaebol dominate the Korean economy too much,
preventing competitive economic forces from operating efficiently. The
government may now be forced to drop or scale down its chaebol reform
programme.
Mr Chung might even be wooed by the Democrats to form a broad opposition
front against the government. The two might be prepared to set aside their
difference to form such an alliance. Democrats are strong supporters of
trade union rights, while Mr Chung's Hyundai has had a reputation for
acrimonious labour relations.
Mr Chung, who may also run for the presidency in December, said he was
willing to co-operate with both the DLP and Democrats on individual issues.

<TEXT>
THE Turkish military yesterday mounted air raids on neighbouring Iraq,
switching attention to rebel camps of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
after five days of civil unrest in Turkish towns near the border.
Turkish military sources, quoted by the official Anatolian news agency,
confirmed that bombing sorties were made early in the day against two
alleged PKK targets up to 18 miles inside Iraq near the Iranian border.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, warned this week that
Turkey would seal the 170-mile border with Iraq to prevent incursions by the
PKK, which is fighting for a separate Kurdish state in southern Turkey.
The raids yesterday mark a heightening in the conflict and coincide with the
worst civil unrest in the eight-year Kurdish troubles. In further clashes in
Turkey, six people were killed including two pro-government village militia
near Diyarbakir, the provincial capital in the south-eastern region. Two
policemen were shot in separate incidents in Adana, southern Turkey, and
Ankara, the Turkish capital. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers were
still deployed in a string of towns near the Syrian and Iraqi borders after
clashes between security forces and demonstrators at the weekend left up to
60 people dead.
The Turkish government is to send a four-man delegation to the border area
today to investigate the unrest. However Mr Demirel's coalition is under
pressure from both the army and conservatives in his True Path party to
continue to take a hard line against the PKK.
Politicians of the Turkish Labour Party (HEP) were said to be ready to
withdraw from the coalition because of the government's failure to fulfil
promises of human rights reform. Support from the 22 Kurdish HEP members was
central to Mr Demirel's earlier promise of reforms aimed at winning over the
Kurds.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Japanese wage rises at lowest for four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading industrial companies were yesterday near agreement on the
lowest wage rises in four years in face of a severe decline in corporate
profits.
In contrast to German companies' inability to resist wage demands, Japanese
companies were able to keep the average rate of wage rises below 5 per cent,
even though the labour market continues extremely tight.
The rate of increase in the steel, electric, car and shipbuilding industries
should average about 4.8 per cent, against last year's 5.65 per cent. These
agreements will set the pace for the rest of Japanese industry.
The accords bring near a close the annual shunto, or 'spring offensive', as
the wage talks are euphemistically known. It is a ritualistic struggle
between management and labour that generally ends on a compromising note,
despite much talk of strikes and demonstrations.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations (Nikkeiren), praised labour's understanding of the tough
business climate.
The Bank of Japan declined to make any comment on the settlements. The wage
rises are unlikely to upset the bank's efforts to bring inflation under
control, although it remains concerned about the long-term inflationary
impact of Japan's structural shortage of labour.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, said the settlements
were likely to lead to a rise in unit wage costs in the first half of the
fiscal year when industrial output is expected to be sluggish. This trend
should reverse in the second half, when recovery is expected to begin.
Mr Sogo Yoshimiya, an official at Rengo, Japan's federation of trade unions,
said the unions were disappointed at the level of the wage settlement, but
satisfied on the progress towards cutting working hours. Average annual
working time last year, at 2,016 hours, was the highest in the
industrialised world.
Electrical companies had agreed a target of 1,800 total working hours by
next year, and holiday entitlements would increase immediately from 15 to 20
days after the first year of work.
As an extra measure to discourage excessive working hours, pay premium for
overtime work would be increased from 40 to 45 per cent of the basic wage
rate.
Settlements in the electric machinery industry will come to an average
increase of 4.7 per cent, while workers in shipbuilding and heavy industries
will enjoy a 5.05 per cent rise, reflecting brisk business in that sector.
Wage gains in the steel industry, hit by a drop in output, will be limited
to 3.63 per cent.
Toyota Motor, Japan's biggest vehicle maker, has agreed a wage increase of
4.83 per cent, against 5.5 per cent last year.
Toyota's annual bonus will also be cut to an equivalent of 6 months' wages,
compared to 6.2 months last year. Taking into account a special anniversary
bonus, workers will receive a net bonus decreased by Y10,000 (Pounds 43.66).
In Toyota's case, a demand that the overtime premium be raised from 30 to 35
per cent more than the basic wage rate was rejected.
Working hours at Toyota last year came to 2,170 hours; the company said it
would keep to plans to reduce this by 100 hours a year until it reached
1,900 hours.
Japanese trade unions generally emerge from the shunto looking fairly
toothless. But historically, the Japanese workforce has benefited from
consistent real wage rises and high job security.
Flexibility on wages has also helped their employers to endure difficult
business conditions.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Libya faces imminent UN sanctions vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LIBYA last night faced the near certainty of UN Security Council-mandated
sanctions after Col Muammer Gadaffi's repudiation of an apparent deal to
surrender the alleged Lockerbie bombers.
British officials said they were confident that a resolution to impose
sanctions, including a ban on air links and arms sales, would pass by a
comfortable majority in the 15-member council.
Mr Diego Arria, of Venezuela, president of the Council, said he proposed
that there would be a formal debate on the issue tomorrow morning with
private consultations taking place today.
However, diplomats said the vote may await the initial stage of proceedings
brought by Libya against the US and Britain at the International Court of
Justice which open today at the Hague. Libya is where the two Lockerbie
suspects should stand trial, and an injunction barring the US and Britain
from pressing it to surrender the pair. The court's decision could take
weeks, but the US, Britain and France have said they would not await its
verdict before putting the sanctions resolution before the Security Council.
The three had deferred pressing for such a vote after an Arab League mission
visited Tripoli on Tuesday. There were suggestions Libya was prepared to
hand the two suspects to the League, which would in turn make them available
for trial in the US or Scotland. But the delegation reported on its return
to Cairo that Libya was prepared to turn them over only under conditions
unacceptable to Britain and the US.
Arab diplomats said that Col Gadaffi and Mr Abdel Salam Jalloud, his number
two, told the delegation that statements by Libya's ambassador to the UN
suggesting an unconditional handover of the Lockerbie suspects were
'inaccurate'.
Security Council members reacted with disappointment and even anger to the
repudiation of the deal, with UK officials branding it 'obfuscation and
prevarication'. Libya would be given 'a few days' to hand over the two men.
The US last night accused Libya of 'perfidy' in reneging on its offer to
surrender the alleged bombers. Mr Thomas Pickering, the US delegate at the
UN, said it was clear the Libyans were not about to hand over the accused
men to Britain or the US.
ABC news of the US, a television news service, and journalist Mr Pierre
Salinger were ordered yesterday by the High Court in London to hand over to
British police video footage and sound recordings of interviews with the two
Libyans charged in connection with the Lockerbie bombing, PA reports.
Two judges dismissed their challenge to a production order made at Middlesex
Crown Court under anti-terrorist laws earlier this month and gave them until
noon today to hand over the tapes.
ABC and Mr Salinger, its London-based chief foreign correspondent, had asked
the judges to quash the 'unlawful and unreasonable' order made by Judge
Clarkson on the grounds that it was too wide-ranging and they had not been
told the reasons relied on by Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch for
obtaining it.
Mr Salinger visited the two Lockerbie suspects, Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, in Libya shortly after they were indicted in the
US last November for an alleged conspiracy to blow up Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie.
Mr Salinger warned the ruling could change ABC's policy on keeping material.

<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIAN federal police have launched an investigation into the
activities of the most popular Slovakian politician, Mr Vladimir Meciar,
following accusations that he collaborated with the hated secret police
under the communist regime.
If the allegations were to be proved, they could ruin his political career.
Mr Meciar leads the strongest opposition party in Slovakia and, in the
run-up to the June general election, is advocating greater Slovakian
autonomy from the federal government.
The police move follows a report written by the Slovakian parliament's
defence and security committee. It is based on witnesses' testimonies and
accuses Mr Meciar of having once been a secret agent, of having removed
incriminating evidence and having promoted loyal former agents in the
Slovakian interior ministry after the November 1989 revolution.
Mr Meciar, a lawyer under the communists, joined the Slovakian dissidents
spearheading the revolution and became Slovakian interior minister until
June 1990.

FT  26 MAR 92 / King Kohl comes off his throne to kiss a princess: The
chancellor has been called in to shore up his party's electoral chances in
Baden-Wurttemberg
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS St Matthew's Market festival in Schriesheim, the fun fair is packed,
and the Big Man is coming. There is an air of expectancy in the marquee,
stoked-up by the thumping rhythm of a police brass band and copious
quantities of local white wine.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, himself a south-westerner, is on the campaign trail.
With time running short ahead of the April 5 election in the state of
Baden-Wurttemberg, the German leader is throwing his own bulk and personal
reputation on the party line.
Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is fighting to defend its
absolute majority in the last 'old' West German state where it still
governs. The party should be cruising home to a crushing victory. This is
the wealthiest state in the west, which makes it just about the wealthiest
region of western Europe. It is the high-tech capital of Germany and its
leading exporter. Throw in the Unity Chancellor, the man who brought the
nation back together, and the CDU should be home and dry.
But it is losing ground. The polls suggest that, for the first time in 20
years, it will be forced to share power with a rival. That would be a
damaging loss of face for the ruling party, and a sad loss of influence.
Which is why Mr Kohl has come to kiss the Wine Princess and rally the
faithful.
It was a classic performance, nicely geared to the mood of his audience, the
League of Self-Employed, bedrock of Germany's economic might.
First, he appealed to their sense of nation: unification was an historic
achievement, and they should not despair at the cost, for recovery was just
around the corner. Then he appealed to their internationalism: a united
Germany must be locked into a united Europe, but the D-Mark would never be
abandoned for a weaker currency. And, finally, he appealed to their
prejudice: the CDU was the only party with a solution to the flood of asylum
seekers pouring into Germany at more than 30,000 a month.
The last was the theme that really mattered, no matter how obliquely it was
put. 'I am quite against doing away with the right to political asylum,' he
declared. 'But these people are coming here on economic grounds. We cannot
be expected to solve their problems here in our country.' There was a storm
of applause.
The Chancellor's rivals - the Social Democrats (SPD), the Free Democrats
(FDP), with whom the CDU has to share power back in Bonn, and the Greens -
all insist he is playing with fire. 'Asylum was not a spontaneous theme,'
says Mr Roland Kohn, state chairman of the FDP. 'It has very deliberately
been made into one by the CDU.'
The theme might well represent the chicken-and-egg syndrome, but there is
little doubt that it is now campaign theme Number One. Mr Erwin Teufel,
premier of Baden-Wurttemberg and master of the local CDU machine, says that,
between June and October last year, the issue soared from being a concern
for 30 per cent of voters to no less than 70 per cent. He is playing it for
all he is worth.
The reason is not hard to find. The election in Baden-Wurttemberg in general
and the ruling party in particular are haunted by two ghosts which Mr
Teufel, for all his name (it means 'devil'), is struggling to exorcise.
One is that of his predecessor, the hugely popular and successful Mr Lothar
Spath, hounded out of office last year on suspicion of corrupt dealings with
a local businessman. The worry remains that it was not corruption, but Mr
Kohl, who really forced out Mr Spath. The ordinary electors certainly appear
to mourn his passing. 'He's accused of travelling the world at other
people's expense,' according to a rival politician. 'People here say good
luck to him: at least he didn't travel at the taxpayers' expense.'
The other ghost is that of the extreme right-wing, which will either be
exorcised, or invigorated, by the theme of asylum. 'Other parties,' as the
extremist right is euphemistically called in the polls, enjoy the support of
about 8 per cent of voters. Split into three groups, the strongest, the
so-called Republicans, could even gain the magic 5 per cent needed to win
seats in the state parliament.
Mr Dieter Spori, leader of the SPD, is in no doubt about the danger, or the
cause. 'If Mr Teufel gets his way, and the asylum debate is whipped to fever
pitch, the one certain result is that the right-wing extremists will get
seats in the parliament,' he says.
The SPD wants to fight the election on the economy and the cost of
unification, but these themes are being forced into the background. The
trouble for the SPD is that, in spite of the economic warning signs, the
streets of Stuttgart are still literally bulging with accumulated
prosperity.
In theory, the far-right also ought not to be too serious a threat to the
CDU. The movement is leaderless and fractious, immigration is its only real
issue, and, even here, it possesses little content or coherence. 'The time
is right,' posters proclaim. 'The boat is full.'
Mr Teufel sees the extreme-right as no more than the result of a periodic
protest vote, not a trend, but somehow cannot quite exorcise it on his own.
So he has called in Mr Kohl to back him up. That is why the election will be
seen as a vote of confidence in the Big Man himself.
German prices continued to rise this month, with the state of
Baden-Wurrtemberg yesterday reporting an annual inflation rate of 4.6 per
cent for the month of March after recording 4.3 per cent in February, writes
Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
Economists expect west German inflation to peak this month at around this
level - other states will report shortly - and then ease towards 3 per cent
by the year-end.
The Bundesbank, which this week reported that money supply was still
expanding well beyond its target, has said it wants to bring inflation down
to 2 per cent.
However, the central bank does accept that this will not occur in 1992.

FT  26 MAR 92 / IMF cuts growth forecast for industrial countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is forecasting a relatively weak recovery in
the world economy this year, but hopes that growth in 1993 will prove more
robust, writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, said yesterday his
organisation now projects growth in the industrial countries of about 2 per
cent this year - substantially less than the 2.8 per cent it was forecasting
at its annual meeting in Bangkok last October.
For the world economy as a whole growth could be even more sluggish, Mr
Camdessus told a conference in Monte Carlo. The IMF is now projecting
overall growth of only 1.5 per cent this year, as a result of lost output in
the Middle East and in eastern Europe.
Mr Camdessus said, however, that there was reason to expect a stronger
recovery in 1993, averaging perhaps 3 to 3.5 per cent. He urged the leading
economies to concentrate on policies that would produce medium-term growth.
'This does not mean the kind of short-term growth that can result from
excessive demand stimulation,' he warned. 'The policies to achieve such
growth are well known - fiscal policies aimed at reducing deficits to
sustainable levels, firm anti-inflationary monetary policies and structural
policies to eliminate distortions and improve the efficiency of the
economy.'

SEVEN people were killed yesterday in fighting around Bosanski Brod, a

plea to halt the con-flict.
Radio Sarajevo said more than 1,000 grenades hit Bosanski Brod, a mixed town
of mostly Serbs and Croats.
The town's crisis centre yesterday appealed for the despatch of UN
peacekeepers 'to prevent the town from total destruction.'
At the same time, Bosnia's Moslem leaders yesterday appeared to go back on
an agreement brokered last week by the European Community among the leaders
of Bosnia's national parties to divide the central republic into three
separate areas which would give Moslems, Serbs and Croats local autonomy.
Kerin Hope in Athens adds: Mr Constantine Karamanlis, the Greek president,
yesterday reiterated the government's unwillingness to recognise the
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.

The Irish government has sent its European Community partners suggested
amendments to a special Irish abortion protocol built into the Maastricht
treaty on European union, Reuter reports from Dublin. The protocol, due to
be included in an Irish referendum in June, has to be changed following the
case of a 14-year-old rape victim who was initially banned from having an
abortion in Britain. The Supreme Court, fearing the girl would kill herself
unless she had an abortion, overruled the lower court ban. It also said
abortion should be allowed in Ireland in certain limited circumstances when
the woman's life was threatened.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Opposition warns on cost of Jubilee Line plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR PARTY warned yesterday that the taxpayer may have to fund a much
larger share of the Pounds 1.3bn Jubilee Line Underground extension to
London's Docklands if Olympia &amp; York, the project's main private backer,
cannot come up with its share of the money.
Labour's warning came as the Department of Transport acknowledged that
ministers would have to reconsider the financial future of the Underground
extension if the financially troubled property developer was unable to meet
its Pounds 400m commitment.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, said the project was 'going
to be thrown into the hands of the public sector because the private sector
has failed to live up to its agreement'.
The Jubilee Line extension, once regarded as a pioneering transport project
by the government involving private and public investment, would create five
Underground stations in south and east London and would service Docklands.
The Department of Transport said its decision to give the Jubilee Line the
go ahead in November 1989 hinged on the agreement of Canary Wharf's
developers to contribute Pounds 400m towards the cost of the project.
'If for any reason that (contribution) is not possible, any such radical
change to funding arrangements will require ministers to consider all the
issues before arriving at any decision,' an official said.
O&amp;Y was due to make its first contribution of Pounds 40m to the project at
the end of this month, with a further Pounds 60m due at the end of March
next year. The balance of Pounds 300m was expected by 1996, when the
extention was due to be completed.
O&amp;Y has begun a restructuring of its worldwide debt, estimated at more than
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.5bn). It denied that its finance plans for the
Jubilee Line were being discussed by banks as part of its debt
reorganisation.
Both London Regional Transport (LRT) and O&amp;Y said last night that
negotiations on the extension were continuing.
Sources close to the project say the party that wins the election could face
a difficult choice: increase its share of the project, or go for a less
costly plan.
A Docklands Light Railway official said it would be 'unable to cope' with
the projected increased passenger levels for 1996 and beyond without the
extension.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Health row sparks bitter attacks by party leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTION campaign exploded into a bitter row over the health service
yesterday after the Conservatives responded to a controversial Labour
broadcast with a series of scathing personal attacks on Mr Neil Kinnock.
But as the angry exchanges signalled the start of a new, much rougher phase
in the campaign, Labour dismissed a move by Mr John Major to discredit the
factual basis for the charges in the broadcast of NHS 'underfunding'.
A day of insults was followed by two opinion polls last night indicating
that Labour has held on to its lead over the Conservatives. An NOP survey
for The Independent and BBC Newsnight put Labour three points ahead with its
support at 42 per cent, the Tories at 39 per cent and the Liberal Democrats
at 14 per cent.
Gallup for The Daily Telegraph put Labour at 40.5 per cent, the Tories at 40
per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 16.5 per cent.
The statistically unimportant Labour lead of 0.5 points in the Gallup poll
compared with a two-point Conservative advantage in a similar survey last
week. NOP, however, suggested that Labour's lead had fallen from four points
to three points.
Some senior ministers believe that if the polls do not begin to move in the
Conservatives' direction by the beginning of next week it may be impossible
for the party to recover enough ground to win the April 9 election.
Their hope, however, is that the fierce attacks on Labour's tax and economic
policies, emphasised again in the Conservative election broadcast last
night, will begin to percolate through to the voters. The broadcast charged
that Labour policies would stifle the prospect of recovery by forcing up
inflation, interest rates and taxes.
At the heart of the latest bruising exchanges was an emotive Labour film
broadcast earlier this week which dramatised the plight of a young girl who
had to wait nearly a year for a National Health Service operation. Alongside
her it presented another child who was treated immediately in the private
sector.
As details emerged of the actual case behind the broadcast, the
Conservatives launched a fierce attack on Mr Kinnock's honesty and fitness
to govern. Remarks by the hospital consultant involved alleging an
administrative error and misrepresentation of the facts prompted Mr Major to
lead an all-out attack on Mr Kinnock's participation.
Speaking at a rally in Edinburgh, the prime minister accused the opposition
of having 'no regard for the truth' in its campaigning on the health
service. He went on to attack bitterly the Labour leadership: 'I tell you
this. Their attitude tells you more about the people who lead the Labour
party than it does about the health service. Such men are unfit to govern,
such men must never govern.'
Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, went further, accusing Mr Kinnock of
producing 'sleaze' to trade 'in the misery of families and the pain of
little girls to make a political point'.
Mr Waldegrave, the health secretary, likened the images to the propaganda in
Nazi Germany during the 1930s.
But Mr Kinnock fiercely defended the broadcast, arguing that it provided an
example of the widespread 'privatisation' caused by the Conservatives
underfunding of the health service. Labour then released a letter sent to
the parents of the child last month, in which the consultant listed
shortages of beds, doctors and nurses as the reason behind the delay in the
child's operation.
Accusing Mr Patten of 'negative and dishonest' attacks, Mr Jack Cunningham,
the Labour party campaign director, said that the broadcast had achieved
Labour's objective of putting health at the centre of the election battle.
He said that Labour had received 'hundreds' of examples of parents being
told they would have to pay for rapid treatment of children.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL pressure is mounting in Moscow to remove Mr Boris Yeltsin as prime
minister and install an administration less committed to radical economic
reform.
Mr Yeltsin, who is both president and prime minister, remains Russia's most
popular politician, but has been identified with his government's severe
economic reforms and made vulnerable to parliamentary attack.
The first strong signs of the political offensive against him emerged this
week. Tuesday's meeting of the Constitutional Commission cut the
parliamentary votes needed to remove a prime minister from two-thirds to a
bare majority and deleted Mr Yeltsin's right to appoint regional governors.
Mr Yeltsin may be able to restore the lost clauses but the anti-government
victory shows the rising tide of discontent.
The opposition is centred among disaffected deputies who are unhappy with Mr
Yeltsin's concentration of powers. Earlier this month, Mr Yeltsin added the
post of defence minister to his portfolios. Under his presidency, Russia has
assumed most of the powers of the former Soviet Union. Last October he also
won the right to legislate by decree - a right deputies now regret.
Mr Yeltsin admitted yesterday that the government would fall if he were
replaced as prime minister, because it depends on his popularity. No one
will challenge him as president, but many deputies feel he should go as
premier.
Some observers believe he will have to sacrifice Mr Genady Burbulis, the
unpopular first deputy prime minister, although he may be able to defend Mr
Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform.
A western diplomat said yesterday: 'Gaidar is very important for the IMF
right now, and Yeltsin knows how important the IMF is to him.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / Call for pension control changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS would be prevented from using pension fund surpluses for their own
purposes under pensions law proposals being urged by the Institute for
Policy Research, the left-of-centre think tank. It also proposes giving
control over funds to beneficiaries.
The report addresses the most sensitive question being considered by
legislators considering pensions law: whether a pension fund surplus is the
property of the employer or of the scheme's members.
The institute rejects employers' arguments that liability to make good any
deficit entitles them to recoup surpluses. Although employers are correct in
theory, the report notes that most scheme rules give employers the right to
cease their contributions at any time, regardless of the financial state of
the pension fund.
Provisions in the 1990 Social Security Act which will require employers to
make good deficiencies when a pension fund is wound up may be ineffective
because a financially troubled employer may simply stop contributing and not
wind the fund up until the options run out - upon bankruptcy. The report
suggests that in return for surrendering their right to use surpluses,
employers' contributions should be defined and limited.
Employer and employee contributions should be a contractually binding matter
to be renegotiated periodically. Contributions levels in the event of a
surplus or deficit would be spelled out. Making up shortfalls would be a
matter to be negotiated between employers and beneficiaries.

FT  26 MAR 92 / How Labour's broadcast lit the fuse for campaign clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNFOLDING of what may be judged as a key day in the 1992 election
campaign began early, only hours after Labour's election broadcast about the
delay in surgical treatment for a five-year-old girl, write Ivo Dawnay and
Diane Summers.
Early morning: The Daily Express claimed the broadcast had been exposed as a
'fraud', with Mr Alan Ardouin, the child's consultant at Kent and Canterbury
Hospital, quoted as saying the facts had been distorted and the operation
delay was because of a switch from manual to computer records.
Breakfast time: Mr Ardouin claimed on Radio 4's Today programme that the
delay was due to an administrative blunder, not an illustration of a
'two-tier' National Health Service. When this was spotted 'we admitted her
within three weeks'.
Immediate reaction: Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, accused Labour
of 'techniques that would not have been out of place in pre-war Germany'. He
said Labour's use of the case was 'absolutely disgraceful'.
Labour's news conference: Reaction to the charges that Labour had distorted
the facts was combative but defensive. Mr Neil Kinnock, the leader, said:
'We are not telling the 'Big Lie' we are telling the 'Big Truth'.'
Mid afternoon: Labour shifted to the offensive as it disclosed a letter from
Mr Ardouin to the child's father appearing to blame shortages of nursing
staff, consultants and hospital funds.
Late afternoon: The hospital said the girl had been placed on a 'routine',
not a 'soon' waiting list. The reason was 'not clear'.
Early evening: Mr Roger Moate, the girl's parents' Conservative MP, said the
consultant's letter 'made no sense'.
Last night: With the girl's parents giving differing views about the
broadcast, Mr Chris Patten, Conservative chairman, claimed the consultant's
letter had been written before the hospital realised the girl should have
been on the priority list.

FT  26 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Volatile trade in Reckitt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER products and healthcare group Reckitt &amp; Colman was down after a
volatile trading session as analysts cut current-year earnings forecasts.
The shares opened lower after Reckitt announced 1991 profits of Pounds
252.3m against Pounds 235.17m previously, but at the bottom end of
predictions. They then appeared oversold and climbed as high as 660p as
buyers moved in.
However, at the post-results meeting the company signalled growth of about
10 per cent in 1992 compared with the expectations of between 12 and 13 per
cent. Analysts left the meeting to adjust their 1992 forecasts and the share
price dropped to end the session a net 6 off at 640p after 2.7m shares
traded, a heavy turnover for the stock.
Smith New Court trimmed its estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 275m and Nomura
Research came back by Pounds 20m to the same figure. Smith New Court expects
less acquisition-led growth for Reckitt, and Mr Didier Cowling of Nomura is
basing his forecast reduction on the slow economic recovery. However, he
added that the company's strategy was sound and he expected to become a
buyer of the stock.
Kingfisher rises
Better than expected profits and an upgrading of 1993 forecasts by analysts
boosted Kingfisher, the holding company of several leading high street
chains. The shares rose 7 to 487p on profits before exceptional items of
Pounds 221.8m, against Pounds 215.3m previously.
The market was looking for a figure of around Pounds 210m, and Goldman Sachs
has now revised its estimate for next year to Pounds 246m from Pounds 232m,
while Nomura has upgraded to Pounds 240m from Pounds 235m.
Mr Ian Macdougall at Nomura said B &amp; Q remains the key to the group's
immediate future and that the effect of price cutting in the DIY sector
remains an open issue. Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman and chief
executive, admitted that there was fierce competition in the DIY market, and
speaking of recent price promotions said 'we did not make money out of
them'.
Wellcome strong
Buying continued in Wellcome ahead of the interim results, due today.
Analysts believe that the figures will be encouraging, particularly prior to
the planned release of shares by majority owner Wellcome Trust. Financial
observers are also advising clients to buy in case shareholders are given
preferential rights to the placing.
Nomura Research is preparing a hefty research document, which is expected to
raise estimates for long-term growth prospects. The shares ended 21 stronger
at 799p.
Initial disappointment with Lasmo's end-of-year results was dispelled after
post-figures meetings with analysts and institutions and the shares
recovered from a fall of 15 to close only a penny easier on the day at 203p.
The results were expected to be poor and were not helped by accounting
changes. Mr Peter Hitchens of Lehman Brothers summed up the feeling of many
when he said: 'There is plenty of upside potential in the shares.' Mr Keith
Morris at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said the bits of Ultramar that Lasmo was
going to retain are 'first class'.
Cable and Wireless recovered 11 to 543p as Hoare Govett put the case that
they had been oversold. The shares fell sharply late last week after C and W
announced a provision of Pounds 50m for restructuring. C and W is to discuss
the fall in the share price with financial observers tomorrow.
Ahead of today's announcement on bid acceptances, Redland rose 10 to 445p,
while Steetley, its takeover target, gained 6 to 372p in volume of 1.7m.
Dealers said they expected Redland to emerge triumphant from the bid battle,
but the result would be closer than many had been predicting.
Leading property shares bounced after a recent bout of weakness. British
Land improved 7 to 194p, Great Portland Estates 8 to 151p, Hammerson
ordinary 15 to 464p and MEPC 12 to 329p.
Barratt Development's return to profitability pushed the stock 8 higher to
65p.
Tarmac and Lonrho eased as the takeover speculation that lifted them sharply
last week began to fade. Tarmac, which rose sharply on talk that
Luxembourg-based Minorco would make a bid, slipped 6 to 131p. Lonrho, up
recently on talk that Hanson was interested in a friendly deal, fell 4 to
103p.
Following its recent results and Volvo franchise loss, Lex Service has been
touted as a possible bid candidate, and further speculation yesterday saw
the shares climb 8 to 194p.
British Aerospace advanced 7 to 298p on talk that Saudi Arabia may buy
Tornado aircraft in preference to American F-15s. Poor US car figures
depressed TI Group, down 9 at 645p. Weir Group put on 5 to 509p ahead of
today's figures. The fall in Harland Simon continued, the shares losing 15
to 83p as investors again deserted the troubled group.
Best performers among the brewing giants were Guinness, up 17 at 580p on 4m
shares traded, and Allied-Lyons, 12 ahead at 620p on turnover of 1.1m. The
former was boosted by confirmation that Mr Warren Buffett, of Salomon
Brothers and also chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has taken a stake in the
company.
In a letter to shareholders Mr Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway had bought
Dollars 264.8m worth of Guinness shares in 1991, representing our 'first
significant investment in a company outside the US'. Analysts said Allied
was marked up in sympathy with Guinness.
Medeva jumped 18 to 288p after the pharmaceuticals group announced 1991
profits at the top end of expectations and doubled the dividend to 1.5p. The
shares were also helped by enthusiastic buying from the US.
An old rumour that Eurotunnel would join Euro Disney as the latest recruit
to the CAC 40 index in Paris lifted the former 8 to 430p. Following
Tuesday's downgrade by Goldman Sachs, Euro Disney slipped a further 50 to
1540p.
Shipping and property group P &amp; O's shares continued to respond strongly to
Tuesday's preliminary statement, adding 25 at 441p for a two-day jump of 57.
A positive note from County NatWest helped Midland Bank, which recently
announced that it is merging with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, to buck
early weakness in the market and close 3 higher at 346p. Mr John Aitken,
County's banks specialist, argued that Midland shareholders 'should get a
full price for their shares; we feel that would be in excess of 400p'.

FT  26 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: No black clouds mar Chilean skies - How
the revaluation of the peso has revitalised the bolsa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Santiago Stock Exchange moves from strength to strength, spurred by
falling inflation, a strong peso and a booming economy that is expected to
grow by 15 per cent in dollar terms this year.
Mr Mario Lobo, a manager at Celsius, the stockbroker, says: 'There is not
one negative economic indicator on the horizon. Few countries in the world
could match Chile's economic performance over the past year.'
The bolsa, or stock exchange, has been the main beneficiary of the central
bank's decision to revalue the Chilean peso in January and to introduce
looser exchange controls. The peso has appreciated by about 8 per cent
against the dollar since early January. As a result, inflation is coming
down and so are money market interest rates.
This has led individual and institutional investors to move their cash into
the stock market and, as a result, trading has been exceptionally heavy.
Some Dollars 20m changes hands each day - double the average daily trading
volume last year.
The IPSA index of the 40 most traded shares has risen by 21.5 per cent since
the beginning of the year. The gains in dollar terms have been even higher
because of the peso's appreciation. By last Friday's close, share prices had
climbed by 28.6 per cent in dollar terms.
Traders do not expect the bolsa to repeat last year's phenomenal growth,
when the IPSA index advanced by 124 per cent in real terms. The consensus
forecast is that share prices will rise by a further 50 per cent this year.
While Chilean equity is becoming more expensive, shares are still expected
to outperform all other investment instruments this year. Some listed
companies riding the economic boom are expected to show a 30 per cent real
increase in profits during 1992. The gains, however, will not be uniform.
Exporters are complaining loudly that the central bank has abandoned them.
Unless world commodity prices recover this year, the strong peso will dent
the profits of large exporting conglomerates such as Copec (cellulose and
fishmeal), CMPC (paper and pulp), CAP (forestry and steel) and Iansa (sugar
and agro-industrial exports).
The banking sector is also expected to perform poorly as it is suffering
from excess liquidity and the loss of corporate business. An increasing
number of companies are swapping their bank debt for bond issues carrying
lower coupons.
Bank profits were down 78 per cent in January compared with the same month
last year, but much of this was due to the fall in the peso value of their
dollar assets following the revaluation of the peso.
The hot favourites this year are construction companies, utilities,
vineyards and generally any company which can be expected to cash in on
Chile's consumer spending spree.
Companies with dollar debts have received an unexpected windfall with the
revaluation. Likewise CTC, the telephone utility which imports much of its
telecommunications equipment. Its shares have risen by 43 per cent so far
this year, making it one of the best performers in the market.
So much economic success, however, tends to breed complacency. Foreign
investors have begun to lobby the central bank to lift the remaining
restrictions on capital repatriation. At present, foreign investment funds
are tied in Chile for three to five years.
Investors point out that Argentina and Mexico now have no restrictions on
capital repatriation, making these markets more attractive to regional
funds.
Chile's economic stability, however, makes Santiago's bolsa the safest bet
within the emerging markets in Latin America. A total of 13 foreign
investment funds are now active in Chile. They have brought in some Dollars
400m over the past 2 1/2 years. The total value of their Chilean assets is
now worth Dollars 1.12bn.

FT  26 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan falls to 1992 low as
rumour enlivens Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN fell to its lowest level this year while wishful thinking boosted
Paris, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was enlivened in the afternoon by a rumour, swiftly denied, that Prime
Minister Edith Cresson had resigned. The CAC-40 index closed up 32.02 or 1.7
per cent to 1,928.28, just off the day's high of 1,929.34, while turnover,
which was quietly below FFr1bn by lunch, rose to FFr2.21bn.
Most blue-chips participated in the afternoon rise, with BSN up FFr23 to
FFr1,098 following its pleasing 1991 results on Tuesday. Euro Disney was the
notable exception, dropping another FFr3.50 or 2.3 per cent to FFr150
following Goldman Sach's sell note.
Sanofi was volatile following its 1991 results. The stock fell to FFr1,141
before closing up FFr25 to FFr1,200 in moderate volume of 24,000 shares.
Some analysts said net profit of FFr956m, up 12 per cent, was not as good as
it appeared, since it reflected the inclusion for the first time of profit
from its 40 per cent stake in the Hungarian pharmaceuticals company,
Chinoin, and a rise in profit at its associated perfume companies, rather
than growth in operating profit.
MILAN fell to its lowest level this year on reports in the domestic press,
confirmed in yesterday's release of the Treasury report on state finances,
that a fall in fiscal revenues was undermining the government's efforts to
cut its budget deficit. The market was also depressed by Banca Commerciale
Italiana's 1991 results, and fears of a lira devaluation. The Comit index
fell 6.21 to 499.29 in turnover estimated at L85bn after L83.8bn.
Heavy selling pushed Banca Commerciale down by L192 or 5.2 per cent to
L3,558, accounting for more than half of the total L34bn turned over on the
screen-based trading system.
Fiat fell L121 or 2.5 per cent to L4,747, Generali lost L335 to L28,655 and
Montedison dropped L36 to L1,349.
FRANKFURT was pulled off an early high by news that inflation in
Baden-Wurttemberg stood at a higher-than-expected 4.6 per cent in mid-March.
The market was also depressed by disappointing results from Schering, while
Veba's surprise dividend increase came too late to revive sentiment. The DAX
index reached 1,712.39 in the first 45 minutes before closing at 1,716.26,
up 3.15, in turnover of DM5.5bn after DM5.7bn. The FAZ index, calculated at
midsession, rose 3.53 to 698.47.
Schering fell 20 pfg to DM835.80 after the company said it expected no
improvement in profit this year, which analysts attributed to the delays in
launching a new contraceptive pill in the US and Japan, and disposing of
non-core activities.
Reports of big buy orders from the UK pulled Bayer up by DM4.60 to DM300.30
and BMW by DM4.50 to DM575.50. Asko put on another DM15 to DM900 while
Continental added DM2 to DM248.50 on bargain-hunting. Veba ended 50 pfg
better at DM377.80 before announcing a DM1 rise in the 1991 payout to DM12
but it rose DM2 after hours.
AMSTERDAM was active in Nedlloyd and Daf, the latter slipping ahead of
today's results which are expected to disappoint. The CBS Tendency Index
rose 0.1 to 125.0.
Daf closed down Fl 1.20 or 4.9 per cent at Fl 24.20. Nedlloyd reached an
intraday high of Fl 61.20 but was dragged lower to close 90 cents ahead at
Fl 60.00 after the works council lodged an official objection to the
appointment of Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian shareholder, to the
supervisory board. Bols gained Fl 1 to Fl 47.80 and announced a 17 per cent
rise in net profit after the close.
STOCKHOLM again concentrated on Volvo as it B shares advanced 3.5 per cent
to SKr15 to SKr430. At an analysts meeting in London on Tuesday the car
maker said that 1992 earnings would benefit from a cost-cutting package,
enabling its car and bus divisions to return to profit. James Capel has
subsequently revised its EPS 1991 forecast to SKr33 from SKr26. The
Affarsvarlden General Index added 7.9 to 1,009.3 in turnover of SKr845m
after SKr597m.
ZURICH lost some early gains on profit-taking. The SMI advanced 6.0 to
1,830.1. Nestle remained in focus following its successful bid for Perrier.
The group said reports that the European Commission planned to investigate
the deal would not affect the takeover. Nestle bearers and registered shares
rose SFr10 and SFr50 to SFr9,490 and SFr9,460 respectively.
Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz were active ahead of today's results: Ciba-Geigy
bearers rose SFr40 to SFr3,450 and registered shares put on SFr30 to
SFr3,450. Sandoz bearers shed SFr10 to SFr2,610.
BRUSSELS closed higher after five days of falls, helped by stronger bond
prices. The Bel-20 index firmed 3.56 to 1,193.37 in turnover of BFr860m.

FT  26 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Year-end buying lifts
Nikkei above 20,000

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WINDOW dressing ahead of the March fiscal year-end book closing pushed share
prices higher, helping the Nikkei average to recover the 20,000 support
level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 335.21 to 20,226.78. Selling by companies and
investment trusts was noted, as yesterday was the last trading day for
contracts to be settled this fiscal year ending March 31. The index fell in
the morning to the day's low of 19,813.81. Arbitrage-related buying and
bargain hunting by foreign investors subsequently lifted it to the session's
high of 20,230.18.
Volume grew to 350m shares from 300m, as activity rose on cross-trades by
companies wishing to realise profits on shareholdings. Advances outscored
declines by 622 to 394, with 140 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks rallied 9.23 to 1,448.78, although in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended only 0.85 up at 1,135.62.
Traders said steady buying by foreigners and employee share ownership
associations offset selling by investment trusts. Market participants also
found comfort in buying by arbitrageurs, as concern that futures and
arbitrage trading would fall due to the rise in futures commissions,
implemented on Monday, had previously prevailed in the market.
Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the recent
arbitrage buying was prompted by the widening price spread between the
futures and cash markets. 'Fears that doubling commissions would depress
activity were false,' he added.
In spite of the rise in the index, however, brokers said that sentiment
remained bearish. Rumours that a leading Japanese broker could announce
losses due to tobashi, or window dressing clients' accounts by shifting
loss-making investments, circulated in the market. A total of 107 issues set
new lows.
Financials fell on selling by companies liquidating holdings. Industrial
Bank of Japan slipped Y40 to Y2,320 and Mitsubishi Bank Y90 to Y2,090.
Large-capital issues and high-technology blue chips were higher on bargain
hunting by foreign investors. Nippon Steel gained Y10 to Y322 and Hitachi
added Y14 at Y786.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, however, lost Y20 to Y1,300. Investors were
discouraged by reports that the company will post extraordinary losses due
to financial problems at its leasing subsidiary.
Potential beneficiaries of public works spending were popular. Penta Ocean
Construction forged ahead Y39 to Y989 and Nippon Road advanced Y50 to
Y1,420.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 111.48 to 21,541.10 in volume of 26.3m
shares.
Roundup
FEATURING weakly in another rather mixed day for Pacific Rim markets were
New Zealand, which closed at its lowest level since last December, and
Seoul.
NEW ZEALAND fell sharply and the NZSE-40 index closed 27.18, or 1.9 per
cent, down at 1,411.00 in turnover of NZDollars 16.2m, up from NZDollars
11.5m. Analysts said investors were taking money out of the market to fund
new issues which are due in the coming week.
Telecom shed 2 cents to NZDollars 2.24, its lowest since being floated last
July. Carter Holt Harvey, which went ex-rights, lost 17 cents at NZDollars
2.23.
SEOUL dropped following the defeat of the ruling party of President Roh
Tae-woo in the general election. The composite index closed 16.30 off at
607.83 in Won361.9bn turnover.
HONG KONG was mixed in the absence of corporate news. The Hang Seng index
eased just 0.09 to 5,052.23 in turnover of HKDollars 2.28bn (HKDollars
2.47bn). Jardine Matheson's results were released after the close, while
Cheung Kong, Hutchison Whampoa and Swire Pacific are all expected to
announce results today.
HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, dipped 50 cents more
to HKDollars 40.75 after last week's announcement that it plans to merge
with Midland Bank.
TAIWAN saw profit-taking. The weighted index fell 68.85, or 1.4 per cent, to
4,721.25 in turnover of TDollars 17bn (TDollars 20.6bn).
SINGAPORE was lifted by selective buying of blue chips. The Straits Times
Industrial index put on 9.88 to 1,449.66 in volume of 37m shares. KUALA
LUMPUR's composite index eased 2.50 to 607.40 on profit-taking in turnover
of MDollars 116m. Pacific Chemical climbed MDollars 1.10 to MDollars 20.50
on rumours that a major shareholder was negotiating to sell its stake.
BOMBAY rose for the second consecutive day, leaving the BSE index 132.59, or
3.6 per cent, ahead at 3,802.17.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index declined 1.4 to 1,582.0 amid light turnover
of ADollars 188m.

GOLD moved above Dollars 340 a troy ounce on the London bullion market
yesterday after Comex gold futures moved ahead in early trading in a
correction to recent losses. New York analysts attributed short covering and
light speculative buying on Comex to a weaker dollar in foreign exchange
trading. A couple of computer-managed funds made modest purchases. A London
dealer said gold needed to break above Dollars 342. 'If it does we might see
it back around Dollars 348.' PLATINUM behaved similarly to gold, rising in
London on the back of gains on Nymex, where the market was lifted by fears
of tight nearby supplies. On the LME COPPER was underpinned by Far East
interest, which helped to offset unconstructive US economic data, notably
the 0.1 per cent fall in February durable goods orders. Three-month metal
held above Dollars 2,230 a tonne, but still shows no sign of breaking out of
the Dollars 2,220-Dollars 2,240 range. Three-month ALUMINIUM held above
Dollars 1,300, supported by Tuesday's news that Dutch producer Hoogoven's is
shelving expansion plans, and corrected IPAI data indicating production is
static. In Chicago WHEAT prices were lower at midday on aggressive selling.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Owl plan 'would halve Pacific
timber harvest'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RECOVERY plan for the northern spotted owl would result in the timber
harvest on federal land in the Pacific north-west being halved, lowering it
to about 2bn board feet, according to a US Interior Department official,
Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Manuel Lujan, Interior Secretary, said the plan would be released in mid
to late April. The draft was sent to the printers this week.
The recovery plan would mean the loss of about 31,000 jobs in the Northwest,
Mr Lujan said. The spotted owl, which has been listed as a threatened
species, nests in old-growth forests in the region.
Logging has been restricted sharply due to lawsuits filed by environmental
groups.
Mr Lujan said the Endangered Species Act, which requires steps to protect
species in danger of extinction, needs change. He intends in April to give
Congress options for saving the owl but with a smaller job loss.
More than 40,000 plant species could vanish in the next 60 years because of
swift population growth and environmental devastation, threatening world
food supplies, according to a United Nations study.
Unless countries redouble efforts to preserve plants and the genetic
material they contain, it may be impossible to adapt many crops to rapidly
changing weather and soil conditions - leaving them vulnerable to pests or
disease.

THE BRAZILIAN government is expected to make an official statement today to
reveal a position favourable to the establishment of quotas by exporting
countries in the negotiations on the International Coffee Agreement, which
begin in London on April 6.
Mr Oswaldo Aranha Neto, president of the Brazilian Federation of Coffee
Exporters (Febec) confirmed that 'a clear consensus exists' to back economic
clauses based on quotas. Febec had originally favoured a buffer stock scheme
instead of quotas. The National Coffee Council, a producers group, had been
lobbying hard for a return to a quota system.
Officials in both the economy ministry and the foreign ministry continue to
refuse to comment about the likely Brazilian position. Mr Francisco Rezek,
the foreign minister, is reported to have discussed the Brazilian position
in the negotiations with President Fernando Collor de Mello at a meeting
yesterday.
London traders said coffee prices reached the day's highs on news that the
Brazilian government was set to announce its official position on the coffee
pact, reports Reuter.
But prices soon drifted lower again, with May closing Dollars 1 down at
Dollars 873 a tonne. In the morning it touched a low of Dollars 866 a tone.
'The market is not taking seriously anymore these comments that are coming
out of producing countries,' said one trader.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil price to rise by
550 per cent in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of oil in Russia is to rise in June from Rbs350 a tonne to between
Rbs2,000 and Rbs2,600 a tonne in June, or between Dollars 22 and Dollars 29
on the official exchange rate (Rbs100 to the dollar).
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian deputy prime minister, said in a newspaper
interview yesterday that the rises would put the Russian prices at about 25
per cent of world prices.
The freeing of oil prices has been postponed from the target date of April
1, under pressure from other republics fearful of the effects on their
ravaged economies of further rises dictated by Russia. However, Mr Gaidar
said that oil and other energy price rises were essential to avoid economic
collapse.
His comments confirm indications given earlier this month by Mr Vladimir
Lopukhin, the republic's energy minister, that the government was seeking a
rouble exchange rate in the range of 25 to 30 to the US dollar, based on the
oil price. Mr Lopukin said that Russian oil would reach world price levels
of Dollars 130 a tonne when the rouble was pegged at a new exchange rate.
The June rises, if delivered, would raise the cost of petrol to drivers from
Rbs1.2 to between Rbs5 and Rbs7 a litre. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, said yesterday that it was a 'serious step, we must think seven
times before we take it'. He said, however, that the International Monetary
Fund was insisting on the move.
However, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the government's sternest critic and
chairman of the Russian parliament, said that any presidential decree to
raise oil prices would be vetoed by the parliament. He said that '40 per
cent of the oil is sold at free prices and that is enough'.
Mr Gaidar confirmed in his interview that 40 per cent of oil had been sold
through oil exchanges at free prices - but used this to point to the shock
of all prices being liberated not being as great as feared.
Mr Frans Andriessen, vice president of the European Community, said in
Moscow yesterday that the EC was seriously concerned over the 6-fold
increase in the export of aluminium from the former Soviet Union to
community countries over the past two years. In talks with Mr Genady
Burbulis, the Russian first deputy prime minister, he warned that Russia
must scale down the level of its imports or face curbs. He said that a team
of officials and experts would come to Moscow next month for talks on the
exports.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian field upgraded by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, said yesterday that it had
upgraded its assessment recoverable crude oil reserves in the North Sea
Veslefrikk field by 20 per cent to 275m barrels from 230m, writes Karen
Fossli in Oslo.
After a thorough evaluation of the field's reserves and two year's
production experience, Statoil said that the upgrade of oil reserves in
place, meant that the field's oil recovery factor was also increased. 'The
oil zone in the southern extension of the field appears thicker than
previously assumed. In addition, the production performance of the reservoir
outstripped expectations,' Statoil explained.
The value of the upgrade, measured at an oil price of Dollars 17.70 a
barrel, is estimated at about NKr5bn (Pounds 450m).
Statoil said that it was also considering a major gas injection programme to
help maintain pressure in the field's reservoir to keep production at the
highest possible level over the longest possible time. At the same time gas
injection, combined with water injection which is currently under way, could
further boost recovery from Veslefrikk.
Veslefrikk currently produces at a daily rate of 70,000, barrels and is
considered to be at its peak output level. In the last five years of the
field's life production could fall to 15,000 barrels a day.
The field came on stream in 1989 and is currently producing from seven wells
out of a planned total of 19. Three wells will be drilled this year. Statoil
added that, based on reservoir information, placement of future wells has
also been adjusted.

FT  26 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although prices paid for wool in Australia have declined again this week,
there is a view that the pace of decline has slowed down and some finer
merinos became dearer on March 25. The Wool Realisation Commission has not
lowered its prices with the market decline, and much of the wool offered at
auction is drought-affected. Buyers expect a setback after February's strong
rise and have held back, but growers have also withdrawn their wool at their
own reserves rather than see it go at prices they believe may be only
temporarily lower. The market indicator on March 25 was 574 cents a kilogram
from 619 a week before.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium forecast to lead
metals out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM WOULD lead traded metals out of recession in the second half of
this year, said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac
banking group, at a mining seminar in London yesterday.
The aluminium price already had risen by 14 per cent on the London Metal
Exchange since the begining of this year and it was about to benefit from
the time when demand was seasonally at its strongest: in April-June.
Uncertainty about supply was also being felt because 50 per cent of US
capacity was affected by negotiations about labour contracts which expired
on May 31.
While exports from Russia to the west, which caused much havoc in the
aluminium market last year, might reach 600,000 to 800,000 tonnes in 1992,
this was below the 1m tonnes projected at the beginning of 1992.
Mr Moore suggested that the record level of LME aluminium stocks - now at
1.16m tonnes - would not hold back the recovery in aluminium prices. Once
consumers saw stocks going down they would know prices must go up and would
buy as much as possible to beat the price increases. 'We will be surprised
at the pace at which LME stocks will come down,' he predicted.
The industry had already cut 952,000 tonnes of annual capacity or 6.3 per
cent of western world output. But there was no room for complacency because
planned new annual capacity to come on stream in 1992 totalled 645,000
tonnes.
Ord Minnett forecast that aluminium's price would average 65 cents a lb this
year, still well below the 75 cents which many producers said was needed to
make new capacity worthwhile.
Mr Moore predicted that copper would be the only traded metal with a lower
average price this year than in 1992. Sumitomo of Japan had taken action
that kept LME copper prices up last year and supply disruptions in Chile and
Zaire had provided the metal with 'a bridge across the recession'.
His colleague, Mr Geoff Campbell, said the gold industry was in crisis after
10 years of falling prices and rising costs. The industry was not able to
sustain itself at today's gold prices and was cutting exploration
expenditure and capital spending. 'In this climate people will not be going
out looking for gold - or digging it out either.'
However, he suggested the longer-term outlook for gold was positive because
the industry had little alternative but to cut high-cost production and thus
reduce supply. Present low prices should ensure demand would rise.
Mr Campbell said it was likely that during the recovery there would be less
forward selling by producers than in the recent past to put a 'cap' on the
price.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Portugal sheds some light on a gloomy
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL continues to be a bright spot amid the otherwise gloomy scenery of
European bond markets, a fact underlined by the warm reception given to
yesterday's Es10bn issue by the European Coal and Steel Community.
The five-year deal saw strong demand from continental European investors,
including Italian retail buyers who pay no withholding tax on bonds issued
by supranational organisations of which Italy is a member, and institutions
in Germany and Switzerland.
The 11 1/8 per cent bonds were issued at 100.90 and traded down to par
during the day, well inside full fees of 1 3/8 per cent. At this level the
yield is 11.25 per cent.
Syndicate officials said that demand for Escudo bonds remained buoyant, with
investors attracted by high yields and the strength of the Portuguese
currency, which been informally linked to the Ecu since last year.
Primary market issuance remains limited to supranational institutions.
Yesterday's deal was only the second this year. This has contributed to a
steady decline in yields while other European markets have retreated over
the past two weeks.
The other deal this year, a Es16.9bn five-year issue by the World Bank in
early February, was priced to yield 11.65 per cent.
Even borrowing by approved supranational agencies is restricted by a
government ruling that currency swaps can only be undertaken with Portuguese
counter-parties, such as companies with matching foreign currency exposures.
This limits the number of currency swap opportunities available.
Yesterday's deal was swapped into floating-rate dollars for the issuer by
Banco Portugues De Investimento, which also lead managed the transaction.
The only approved borrower with a natural requirement for Escudo funds is
the European Investment Bank, which makes loans denominated in the
Portuguese currency. The EIB is likely to be the next borrower to tap the
market and is expected to launch a Es15bn issue next month.
Elsewhere in the international bond market, new issue activity remained
light. Late in the day, the Council of Europe launched a CDollars 125m
two-year issue, lead-managed by Morgan Stanley, aiming to attract investors
switching funds out of money-market instruments.
The 8 3/8 per cent bonds were reoffered to investors at a fixed price of
99.76. At this level the yield is around 1 per cent more than that available
from Canadian dollar cash deposits, and 35 basis points more than two-year
Canadian government bonds.

Motors shares disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US automotive group, is reconsidering a planned sale of shares
in Mitsubishi Motors following a heavy fall in the Japanese company's share
price caused by arbitrage selling.
Bankers expected the international sale of 7m shares to be formally
announced on Tuesday and priced at a fixed 2 per cent discount to the
secondary market. The sale would raise around Dollars 37m for the US company
at the share price of around Y700 (Dollars 5.2) which prevailed for most of
this month.
On Monday, however, Mitsubishi Motors' stock fell Y92 to Y612 against the
background of a rising stock market. The Nikkei 225 stock market index rose
54.51 on the day.
Morgan Stanley, which is favourite to win the mandate if the deal goes
ahead, declined to comment on the reason for the sharp fall in Mitsubishi's
share price.
However, equity syndicate officials at other banks said the fixed discount
pricing structure adopted for the deal was an invitation to arbitrageurs. By
selling the outstanding stock and taking short positions, arbitrage traders
can drive down the outstanding shares in the hope of picking up new stock at
a cheaper price.
The results of this type of arbitrage trading are particularly pronounced
where routine secondary market activity is light. Daily trading volume on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where Mitsubishi Motors shares are listed, fell
below 200m shares during February, the lowest level since the 1950s relative
to the size of the market. Yesterday, Mitsubishi Motors shares recovered
slightly and closed at Y635.

SCHRODER Munchmeyer Hengst &amp; Co, the German investment bank which is about
75 per cent-owned by Lloyds Bank of the UK, is holding its first
capital-raising exercise in eight years.
The bank announced yesterday it was planning to increase its equity capital
from DM140m (Dollars 87.5m) to DM180m in the middle of 1992, in a move which
will not lead to any change in the shareholding structure.
It will be subscribed to by Lloyds, by the five personally liable partners,
and by senior management.
SMH also announced that profits for the 1991 financial year were
'satisfactory', business in the first 12 weeks of the year had progressed
well, and profits were considerably higher than for the same period last
year.
The bank did not disclose any figures, saying only that operating profits
for 1991 almost reached the record level of 1990, while net profits fell
slightly below the previous year's results.
Although net interest earnings rose by almost one-fifth, commission profits
were down by 12.5 per cent, reflecting reduced level of turnover on
Germany's stock exchanges last year.

THE subscription for shares in Mundial Confianca, one of Portugal's leading
insurance companies which is being privatised, will start on Monday. The
government expects to raise around Es33bn (Dollars 230m) from the sale,
which will last until the end of next week.
The results will be made public on April 14 during a special session of the
Lisbon Stock Exchange.
Shares are being sold in four tranches, including a single indivisible bloc
of 4m shares representing 40 per cent of the company's share capital.
Bidding for this bloc will be in two rounds. The starting price for shares
in this tranche is Es3,500. Another tranche of 3.5m shares will be sold to
general investors at a starting price of Es3,250.
Employees are reserved up to 2.5m shares at the fixed price of Es2,925, and
small investors and emigrants up to 2.5m shares at a fixed price of Es3,100.
Unsold shares will be offered to general investors.
Foreign investors can only buy up to 25 per cent of the shares with voting
rights, but they can bid in alliance with Portuguese groups for the single
bloc as well as for shares offered to general investors.
Mundial has grown rapidly in recent years, almost doubling its assets from
Es46.9bn in 1988 to Es88.7bn in 1991.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Jump-starting the Brazilian
car industry / A look at moves to make production more efficient and
competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES from the Brazilian private sector, government and labour
have been meeting in Brasilia during the past few days to outline a strategy
for boosting the competitiveness of the country's automotive industry.
If, as hoped, there is consensus on specific measures, the government is
prepared to implement a package aimed at providing short-term relief. This
could include lower sales taxes on new cars in exchange for a private-sector
agreement to moderate price increases.
'I think we've already got a clear consensus,' said Ms Dorotea Werneck,
national secretary of the Economy Ministry, the top-ranking public official
in the talks. 'There are hopes that a set of measures can be announced.'
Even if short-term measures are approved this week, talks will continue
through June to develop a long-term strategy aimed at bringing the
industry's competitiveness up to world levels.
The question which will remain unanswered, even after June, is how big the
automotive industry in Brazil can grow and still be competitive in world
markets.
The industry plays a significant role in the Brazilian economy, accounting
for 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and directly
employs 125,000 workers. The jobs of an estimated 4.1m Brazilians are
generated by the industry.
Troubles in Brazil partly reflect global difficulties in the sector,
particularly for the companies that dominate local car production: Ford and
Volkswagen, which operate a joint venture called Autolatina; General Motors;
and Fiat.
However, the problems also reflect the Brazilian automotive industry's
inefficiency, a crucial issue as it prepares to compete with imports for the
first time since the 1950s.
The government recently said it would bring forward, to October this year
from 1993, a reduction in import duties for cars from 50 to 40 per cent.
Duties will fall further to 35 per cent in July 1993.
Imports, notably low-cost models made by Russia's Lada, which began as a
trickle last year, are forcing domestic manufacturers to peek over their
shoulders.
'For a quarter of a century Brazil closed its doors to the world,' says Mr
Jacy de Souza Mendonca, president of the National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers (ANFAVEA). 'Now there are radical changes.'
Two years ago, a study by American economist James P. Womack, of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, showed 48 man-hours were needed to
produce a standard vehicle in Brazil, compared with 40 in Mexico, 37 in
western Europe, 34 in east Asia, 25 in the US, and 17 in Japan.
Although production rose slowly through the mid-1980s - topping 1m before
dropping back in 19901 and 1991 - it has lagged behind projections in the
heady days of the early 1980s, when the Brazilians expected to become
world-class exporters.
With vehicle sales weak, Autolatina and General Motors both cut production
by extending the traditional Carnival holidays during the first week in
March. Last week, GM announced another two-week forced vacation for 800
workers. This year, Ford closed an engine plant near Sao Paulo, with the
loss of 900 jobs.
Until recently, everyone blamed everyone else's inefficiency. Manufacturers
hit out at high taxes, price controls, the informatics reserve law, and
poorly-trained workers organised in militant unions.
The unions decried declining real wages, poor management, lack of investment
and state macroeconomic policies. And the government lashed its tongue at
the 'oligarchy' it said ran the sector.
Such charges are still aired, but all parties now seem convinced of the need
to try to reach an understanding to reinvigorate the industry. 'There is now
a consensus that the industry is not competitive,' notes Mr Jose Roberto
Ferro, an economist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, and an industry
consultant for the sectoral talks.
Manufacturers and labour both argue that the tax rates on Brazilian
producers - 43 per cent of the retail price - must be reduced.
Technological advances are also high on everyone's list. 'We think
technological innovation is important. We aren't stupid,' says Mr Vincente
Paulo da Silva, president of the Metalworkers Union of Sao Bernarndo de
Campo and Diadema, an affiliate of the Unified Workers Central (CUT),
Brazil's most militant labour federation.
Employers, however, may not agree to the union's plan for introducing the
changes. 'We want employment guarantees and we want to participate in
changes made on the shop floor,' says the union chief.
Mr Silva admits that union attitudes have been transformed in recent years.
'Before, we were only worried about wages. We wouldn't have been sitting
around a table with economists and engineers discussing industrial policy,'
he says.
After years of battling for a share of a closed market, manufacturers are
more concerned than ever with increasing sales.
They have, however, taken advantage of their third period of price freedom
in three decades, with mark-ups last year that out-distanced the annual
inflation rate of 458 per cent by more than 100 percentage points. But the
manufacturers are now joining the chorus of labour voices in favour of
macroeconomic policies to boost the spending power of average Brazilians.
'One half of 1 per cent of the population participates in the new car
market,' calculates Mr Mendonca, 'because per capita income has fallen.'
In a possible signal of goodwill ahead of the latest talks on industry
strategy, the big auto-makers had begun moderating price increases.
Fiat, for instance, announced on March 16 that it would not raise prices
again this month. 'For the first time,' notes economist Mr Ferro, 'all three
parties recognise that there is a problem. It is a new step.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Autolatina incurs losses of
USDollars 143.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOLATINA Brasil, the joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen, suffered
losses of USDollars 143.5m for 1991, writes Bill Hinchberger.
Its domestic vehicle sales closed the year at 401,450, representing 51 per
cent of the Brazilian market.
The company blamed the poor performance on a drop in profitability, stemming
from the February-May price freeze, and strict price controls that followed
between May and August.
Despite the controls, it admitted to raising vehicle prices by 580 per cent
during the year, mostly during the fourth quarter, after regulations were
relaxed.
Although this topped Brazil's inflation rate of 480 per cent, the company
claims its costs increased by 610 per cent during the year.
Gross receipts grew by 618 per cent to USDollars 5bn. Volkswagen's Golf
model was the country's best-selling car, capturing 18.1 per cent of the
market with 107,776 units sold.
General Motors has a policy of not releasing figures for its Brazilian
subsidiary. However, Mr Richard Wagoner, president of GM do Brasil, said his
company also registered losses in 1991. 'We were definitely in the red,' he
said. 'And we definitely did worse than in 1990.'
Wagoner also blamed price controls in early 1991 for the losses. 'The first
half of the year was a financial disaster, with the disruption of the
economic plan and the price controls.'

announced
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Second Association of Regional Banks announced a rescue package for
Sogo Jukin, one of the eight housing loan companies, which faces a sharp
increase in bad loans due to the plunge in domestic land prices.
Japanese housing loan companies hold deteriorating property-related loan
portfolios, which include funds extended to resort and golf course
developments. Last year, Chigin-Seiho Housing Loan and Juso were forced to
turn to creditors and shareholders for financial aid.
Housing loan companies were set up in the 1960s by financial institutions,
such as life insurance companies and banks, to fund individuals' housing and
property purchases. Sogo Jukin was set up by the 72 second-tier regional
banks, while Chigin-Seiho is backed by life assurers and Juso by trust
banks.
The companies increased their exposure to high-risk developments in the
loose credit of the late 1980s. Increasing financial problems at the housing
loan companies will burden the financial institutions which back the
companies.
According to Teikoku Data Bank, a Japanese credit agency, loans extended by
the eight companies to companies which failed last year totalled Y90.7bn
(Dollars 678.3m).
The sharp rise in bad loans prompted the Ministry of Finance to conduct
inspections of the housing loan companies last month.
Sogo Jukin, which holds outstanding debts of Y1,400bn and loans of Y1,300bn,
is expected to post pre-tax losses for the next fiscal year to March 1993.
The second-tier regional banks will cut interest rates on new loans from 6.5
per cent to the long-term prime rate, currently at 6.0 per cent.
The banks will also maintain the balance of outstanding loans to Sogo Jukin
at the current level until the end of March 1997.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Matsushita reforms atone for
past dealings
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics
company, will overhaul its senior management and establish a new subsidiary
today as part of reforms intended to atone for past dealings with Japanese
stock and property speculators.
The moves also highlight the tension among Matsushita executives, who are
widely reported to be arguing over the company's direction now traditional
strengths in consumer and industrial electronics are under challenge in
sluggish markets at home and abroad.
Mr Shoji Sakuma, 59, an executive vice-president tipped to be the company's
next chief executive, will resign and become a 'corporate adviser' to take
responsibility for the group's exposure to Ms Nui Onoue, the bankrupt Osaka
restaurateur who used seances for advice in investing huge sums in Japanese
stocks.
Another executive vice-president, Mr Masahiko Hirata, 60, is also to be
demoted, though Matsushita did not suggest that either of the two officials
was directly linked to Ms Onoue, who is now awaiting trial for alleged fraud
over Y269bn (Dollars 2.01bn) raised from financial institutions.
Mr Sakuma had been a board member at National Leasing, a small finance
company established in 1979 to assist corporate clients' purchases of
Matsushita equipment, but which lent a reported Y52bn to Ms Onoue and
unknown amounts to property speculators in a total of Y380bn in outstanding
loans.
A new company, NL Finance, is to be formed today with Y4bn in capital
comprised of Matsushita stock holdings in other Japanese companies, in
particular, banks. Matsushita reckons that while the stocks' book value is
Y4bn, a market value of between Y30bn and Y35bn will be a cushion against
bad debts for the new subsidiary, which will oversee National Leasing's
loans.
'We can't say how much of these loans will be bad. The loans went to various
types of companies and we don't know how they used the money,' Mr Akira
Nagano, a Matsushita spokesman, said yesterday. It will be NL Finance's
responsibility to reduce the loan exposure, while the parent company is
expected to write-off about Y20bn in bad debts this year.
The series of embarrassments for Matsushita, which is expecting a 43 per
cent fall in profits this year, also prompted the company's chairman, Mr
Masaharu Matsushita, and president, Mr Akio Tanii, to accept a 50 per cent
reduction in pay for three months from the beginning of the new financial
year next month.
Matsushita hopes the changes will mark the end of its own excesses during
the 'bubble' era of the late 1980s, when many leading industrial companies,
or their subsidiaries, were entangled in questionable stock and property
deals. Late last year, Matsushita said central control would be tightened
over subsidiaries, and the company has already reviewed its financial
operations.
But Matsushita is yet to resolve an internal debate over how far the company
should stray from its traditional philosophy of providing 'good quality at a
low price'. The question has become more pressing recently, with continued
weakness in the consumer audio-visual equipment market and a slowdown in
Japanese industrial demand.
The departure of Mr Sakuma, who had publicly called for a change in outlook,
and the demotion of Mr Hirata, who had handled Matsushita's Dollars 6.59bn
purchase of MCA, the US entertainment company, could shift company policy
towards a re-emphasis of core businesses.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Jardine surprises as profits

<TEXT>
JARDINE Matheson, the diversified Hong Kong trading company controlled by
the Keswick family, yesterday posted a higher-than-expected 18 per cent
increase in net earnings for 1991.
At the same time, the company said it expected to call a shareholders'
meeting in April to seek approval to change its primary listing from Hong
Kong to London. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange was due shortly to announce the
rules under which companies could change their prime listing, company
executives said.
Jardine's profits rose to Dollars 270.8m from Dollars 229.8m in 1990 on
turnover 20 per cent higher at Dollars 7,190.2m from Dollars 5,992.1m in the
previous period.
Directors recommended a final dividend of 13 cents a share. Taken with the
interim of 3.4 cents it makes 16.4 cents - up 15 per cent on 1990's pay-out.
Earnings per share on a fully-diluted basis rose 14 per cent.
Mr Henry Keswick, the company's chairman, said that in 1991 Jardine achieved
record earnings, excellent cash-flow and a strong balance sheet. The group's
main markets - the Asia-Pacific region - had shown good growth. He said that
although it was too early to make an earnings forecast for this year,
trading in the early months of 1992 had been quite encouraging.
At a news conference, the company's managing director, or taipan, Mr Nigel
Rich, appeared to indicate 1992 would be a year of consolidation on the
takeover front. It had no plans to make a significant acquisition, although
he did not rule out subsidiaries responding to opportunities when they
arose.
Mr Rich did, however, confirm Jardine's interest in building and operating
Terminal 9 - a container terminal planned by the Hong Kong government for
operation later this decade. He said the company was keen to form a
consortium to bid for the terminal.
Many of Jardine Matheson's interests are separately listed and have already
reported their results. The interest in yesterday's statement was the
performance of Jardine Pacific, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company,
which collects together Jardine's traditional trading business and many of
its new ones.
Mr Keswick said it achieved another year of excellent growth, with net
earnings up 31 per cent to Dollars 122.1m from Dollars 93m. Its share of
Jardine Matheson's total profits rose to 45 per cent from 40 per cent.
He said Jardine Pacific's security, restaurants and aviation and shipping
divisions did particularly well. In its engineering and construction
division, Gammon had a good year and prospects were enhanced by the
government's decision to go ahead with building a new airport in the colony.
The company had extraordinary gains of Dollars 90.5m on the float of 32.3
per cent of Jardine Insurance Brokers on the London stock market and an
extraordinary gain of Dollars 37.7m on the sale of investment properties by
its indirectly-held subsidiary, Hongkong Land.

<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINE government yesterday formally turned over control of
Philippine Airlines (PAL) to a private-sector consortium in the country's
biggest privatisation.
PR Holdings, a consortium of leading local business groups, became the owner
of 67 per cent of PAL after paying Mr Jesus Estanislao, the country's
finance secretary, 7.5bn pesos (Dollars 308m), the first of two payments for
the acquisition.
The group had made the winning bid of 9.7bn pesos at the auction for PAL
held in January. The second payment of 2.2bn pesos is due in June.
PR Holdings was set up recently by Bank of Commerce, headed by Mr Antonio
Cojuangco, president of Philippine Long Distance Telephone and a nephew of
President Corazon Aquino, and by AB Capital and Investment Corporation,
which is identified with the Soriano family that controls San Miguel
Corporation, the country's largest industrial enterprise.
Four other large commercial banks, a retirement fund for military personnel,
two venture-capital firms and a cargo-handling company, are among the
investors in the PR Holdings consortium.
Mr Cojuangco, chairman and president of PR Holdings, yesterday said his
group aimed to make PAL 'truly a world-class airline.' Among PAL's assets
are un-utilised options to rich trans-Pacific routes.
The sale reduced government holdings in PAL to 13 per cent, although two
other state institutions, Government Service Insurance System and National
Development Company, still own 15 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. PAL
employees will acquire 5 per cent of the remaining government holdings
within the year under the privatisation.
Last weekend, PAL marked its 51st anniversary by predicting net profits of
1.3bn pesos in the year to March 31, reversing losses of 2.3bn pesos in the
previous year.

CANADA'S public telecommunications companies are buying the federal
government's 53 per cent interest in Telesat, the communications satellite
operator, for CDollars 155m (USDollars 130.2m).
The companies have formed a consortium, known as Alouette, to carry out the
deal. The group is to be led by Bell Canada.
The government earlier rejected a bid by Mr Charles Sirois, a Montreal
entrepreneur, and his National Telesystem. Mr Sirois recently bought a
sizeable equity interest in Teleglobe, Canada's sole overseas
telecommunications company, whose mandate was extended for another five
years.
The telephone companies already owned 41 per cent of Telesat, which had been
set up in 1969 as Canada's first commercial satellite communications
company.
The Alouette group said it would expand Telesat's services and begin a
CDollars 200m research programme. Telesat will continue operating as a
separate entity based in Ottawa.

CAROLCO, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, has secured Dollars
73.8m of financing from its foreign investors and has gained access to an
additional Dollars 23m in new bank loans. The fresh funding should be
sufficient to allow the studio to continue operating.
Carolco's foreign minority shareholders include Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of
Italy and Canal Plus of France.
Carolco, along with other independent film companies such as Orion Pictures,
has been caught in a financial squeeze. In December, Carolco cut its staff
of 200 by 25 per cent and said it was considering reducing the number of
deals with film-makers.
Problems at the company, which started mounting last summer, forced it to
cut off talks aimed at acquiring a 46 per cent stake in Live Entertainment,
the home video supplier, in November. Carolco still holds a 53 per cent
stake in Live.
The studio, which is best known for its Terminator and Rambo films, was in
technical default on Dollars 172m of bank loans for much of last year.
The details of the new financing and restructuring are not significantly
different from a package arranged two months ago, although the amount of
funding has increased.
In January, Carolco said it had secured Dollars 45m of financing and a
deferral on Dollars 10m of debts from its US and foreign lenders.
The principal differences include the Dollars 23m in new loans that
Carolco's banks have made available to the company. Carolco's bankers
include Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank and Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland.
In addition, Carolco's investors have agreed to fund up to Dollars 13.8m of
potential bank collateral shortfalls.
While the arrangement should help Carolco keep operating in the short-term,
the company said it anticipated that its operations could require
'additional sources of funds'.

<TEXT>
SKOPBANK, the Finnish bank rescued from the brink of collapse last autumn,
is receiving an injection of FM1.5bn (Dollars 333.3m) in capital from the
Bank of Finland, the central bank which is Skopbank's majority shareholder.
The capital injection is intended to ensure Skopbank meets demands set out
by the Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy, where-by banks
must achieve a minimum capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent by the end of
1992.
The announcement comes after the Bank of Finland unveiled a package of
measures intended to strengthen the Finnish banking system. These include a
plan for the government to make up to FM8bn available to invest in banks'
core capital to improve the banks' lending capacity.
The FM1.5bn earmarked for Skopbank is structured as core - or tier one  -
capital, consisting of perpetual preference capital which can be converted
into equity at a later stage.
Mr Kaarlo Jannari, chief executive officer at Skopbank, said the injection
of capital was necessary as Skopbank's capital adequacy ratio was in danger
of falling below 8 per cent based on credit loss forecasts for 1992.
He said Skopbank's capital-to-assets ratio had been 8.2 per cent at the end
of 1991, while its tier one capital had been about 4.1 per cent. This would
not be adequate to sustain the losses forecast for 1992, he said.
Last year, Skopbank's credit losses were FM2.55bn, with additional losses of
FM3.8bn. Credit losses for 1992 are expected to be about FM2.5bn.

ruling on investments

CANADA is to facilitate the sale of assets by Olympia &amp; York Developments,
the cash-strapped property developer, by relaxing curbs on foreign
investment in the Canadian oil and gas industry.
Although the new rules are not specifically aimed at O&amp;Y, the company has
been pressing the federal government for an early decision to enable it to
finalise negotiations for the sale of its controlling interest in Home Oil,
a Calgary-based energy producer.
A buyer is also being sought for Gulf Canada Resources, another energy
producer, in which O&amp;Y owns 75 per cent of the common shares.
Based on present market values, disposal of the two companies could raise
about CDollars 1bn (USDollars 840.3m), which would help ease O&amp;Y's cash
squeeze. O&amp;Y is estimated to have debts of over CDollars 20bn, and is
expected to sell a number of assets under the restructuring programme set in
train this week.
Mr Jake Epp, energy minister, said yesterday that the government was
dropping its requirement that Canadians own at least 50 per cent of upstream
oil and gas companies. At present, only financially distressed companies are
exempt from the threshold.
Mr Epp said that reviews of oil and gas deals involving foreign investors
would henceforth be conducted on the same basis as those in almost every
other business sector. The threshold for review by Investment Canada, the
government's foreign investment watchdog, will be CDollars 150m for US
purchasers and CDollars 5m for buyers from other countries.
The changes are widely welcomed by Canadian oil and gas producers, who see
infusions of foreign capital as necessary to help them ease their current
financial difficulties and fund future exploration and production.
The curbs were introduced in the early 1980s as part of Ottawa's National
Energy Programme, which was designed to increase domestic control over the
oil and gas industry. However, by encouraging acquisitions of foreign-owned
companies, they left many domestic producers with unmanageable debt burdens.
Two companies controlled by O&amp;Y, GW Utilities and Gulf Canada Resources, own
a total of 63.5 per cent of Home Oil. GWU said earlier this month that
relaxation of the foreign-investment rules 'could facilitate' the disposal
of Home.

FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Ford optimistic on 1992 results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FORD MOTOR, the US vehicle manufacturer, said yesterday it expected a
substantial improvement in 1992 operating results if the US economy
recovers.
The company's statement, made in its annual report, follows a growing belief
among Wall Street analysts that the company might return to profit as early
as the first quarter of 1992.
Ford suffered a record Dollars 2.3bn loss last year, which it blamed on weak
sales and intense competition from both Japanese and rival US car-makers.
However, the company said that its 'cost-reduction programme, coupled with
an assumed gradual economic recovery, gives Ford reason to believe that 1992
operating results will show substantial improvement'.
In December, Mr Philip Benton, president, said: 'We will surprise you, when
the market comes back, how quickly we will make a profit.'
Ford, which rationalised its plants heavily during the 1980s, has long been
regarded as having the factories with the highest productivity in North
America among the big three US manufacturers.
US car sales figures for mid-March, released on Tuesday, showed a 6.9 per
cent drop compared with the same period of 1991, underlining that the
improving trend in vehicle sales seen in recent months is likely to prove
slow and spotty.
However, manufacturers seem to have been able to reduce the huge rebates
offered last year to lure customers into buying cars. Ford has also been
helped by keeping inventories lean last year and by a gain in market share
through the revamping of its model range last autumn.
The company noted that higher marketing and new product development costs
had been offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies and other
cost-cutting programmes.
Its cash and marketable securities at the end of 1991 rose to Dollars 9.8bn
from Dollars 6.1bn at the end of 1990 as a result of Dollars 1.7bn in
additional automotive debt and Dollars 2.3bn from a preferred stock
offering.

niche sectors

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHERING, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, is negotiating
with 'selected potential partners' for its chemicals, electroplating and
natural substances operations which last year amounted to DM1.2bn (Dollars
419m) - 19 per cent of sales.
Mr Giuseppi Vita, chairman of Schering's board, said the Berlin-based
company was considering everything from retaining a majority stake to an
outright sale of all three activities, where production is sluggish.
It is negotiating with more than 30 companies and expects a deal to be
concluded by the end of this year.
Mr Vita, the first Italian chairman of a large German company, said that
although Schering operated in profitable niche markets in the three sectors,
they could not provide adequate risk compensation for pharmaceuticals and
plant protection which would absorb all of Schering's resources in the
future.
While pharmaceutical and plant protection sales expanded 15 per cent and 8
per cent respectively last year to DM3.6bn and DM1.5bn, industrial chemicals
turnover fell 1 per cent to DM454m and electroplating rose only 2 per cent
to DM329m.
Schering is to pay an unchanged 26 per cent dividend on group sales last
year of DM6.3bn and record earnings of DM274m. Group sales are expected to
rise 5 per cent this year, while earnings are likely to remain at last
year's level, the company forecast.
Mr Vita said that in line with its new research strategy in the US, Schering
recently bought a large research site in Richmond, California, from Chevron.
Total spending on research and development last year amounted to nearly
DM1bn, one reason that co-development and co-marketing with other
pharmaceutical companies was gaining in importance for Schering, Mr Vita
explained.

<TEXT>
NESTLE'S FFr15.46bn (Dollars 2.74bn) bid for Perrier was suspended for a
further four months yesterday when the European Commission announced it
would launch an investigation into the deal's impact on the French mineral
water market.
The Swiss food group only overcame the opposition of the Agnelli family to
its offer two days ago. But the Commission said yesterday that, following
its one-month automatic inquiry into the bid, it had decided there were
serious doubts about the takeover's compatibility with the European market.
Competition officials said the decision to move to a full investigation took
into account Nestle's pledge to sell Volvic, one of the Perrier waters, to
BSN, the food group. If the Commission decides the bid is anti-competitive
it could ask Nestle to unwind the merger or amend it, for example, by
selling some Perrier brands.
Nestle and its allies had already anticipated the EC inquiry. Earlier this
week, Mr Reto Domeniconi, Nestle's director-general, told a press conference
in Paris he thought it probable that the commission would opt for an
in-depth investigation given the 'complexity' of the affair.
The inquiry will hinge on the comparative shares of the French mineral water
market held by Nestle/Perrier after the bid. Nestle, which would be adding
the eponymous Perrier and several smaller brands to Vittel, which it owns,
estimates its eventual share at 41 per cent in volume.
The Commission says that in the overall French market for bottled water, and
separate segments - such as still or sparkling water - the merged company
will have a share of more than 50 per cent.
Meanwhile, BSN is expected to increase its share of the same market to 32
per cent. Apart from Volvic - promised to BSN as the price for alliance with
Nestle in the Perrier battle - the group's other waters include Evian and
Badoit.

<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publishing group, posted a 20 per cent decline in 1991 net
profit to Fl 117m (Dollars 62.5m), in line with the company's earlier
forecasts. Despite the downturn, the dividend is to be maintained at Fl 3.60
per share.
The company blamed the profit fall on a sharp decline in advertising volume
in the UK and the Netherlands, which hit its business press sector and its
Dutch daily newspaper businesses.
Cost-cutting and reorganisations were able to offset only part of this
decline, VNU noted.
Operating profit declined by 12 per cent to Fl 202m. Sales were only
fractionally higher at Fl 2.74bn, compared with Fl 2.72bn in 1990.
VNU's profit decline stands in contrast to profit increases recently
reported by the Netherlands' two other major publishers, Elsevier and
Wolters Kluwer, which are relatively more protected from recession by their
activities in scientific, legal and medical publishing.

THE CZECH government yesterday approved the forging of a joint venture
between Mercedes-Benz, the subsidiary of the German vehicle-maker
Daimler-Benz, and two local trucks manufacturers, Avia and Liaz.
Mercedes had been chosen over Renault of France by the two Czech companies
last January, but the deal was pending government approval. Renault,
however, recently signed a letter of intent with Karosa, the local
bus-maker.
The new joint venture, valued at Dollars 250m, will be 31 per cent owned by
Mercedes, 49 per cent by Avia and 20 per cent by Liaz. Mercedes has pledged
to invest DM350m (Dollars 210m)into the joint venture over the next three
years.
A further DM100m investment is planned for the three years thereafter.
Mercedes plans to increase its ownership stake in the future, according to
Mr Vlastmil Devera, Avia's chairman.
Avia is Czechoslovakia's third largest truck manufacturer, with 1991 sales
reaching Kcs4.1bn (Dollars 136m) Domestic annual sales have averaged 9,000
trucks manufactured under a 1967 Saviem-Renault licence. Mercedes intends to
manufacture two versions of its own light and medium trucks in six months'
time.
Heavy trucks will continue to be manufactured independently by Liaz and by
Tatra, Czechoslovakia's third truck-maker, which recently signed a letter of
intent with Iveco.

reshuffle
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CMB PACKAGING, Europe's largest packaging group which reshuffled its top
management last autumn, yesterday reported a 16 per cent rise in net profits
before extraordinary items in 1991.
However, the FFr852m (Dollars 152m) profits represented a 17 per cent fall
in attributable earnings due to the fact that 1990 profits were inflated by
a large extraordinary gain on the sale of the group's steel business.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, the American chief executive who took over at the helm of
the Franco-British group from the flamboyant Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries
last autumn, said the results showed the management reorganisation and
cost-cutting measures taken last year were starting to pay off.
CMB, formed three years ago from the merger of Carnaud of France and
Metalbox Packaging of Britain, had been dogged by friction between its UK
and French senior managers, which culminated in Mr Descarpentries'
departure. Relations between managers and between the two main French and
British shareholders were now cordial, said Mr Hintz.
Turnover last year rose by 4.5 per cent to FFr25.5bn, on which operating
earnings climbed by 8 per cent to FFr2.4bn.
Within this, sales in the UK fell 2 per cent, the US was down 4 per cent,
and Germany was up 23 per cent. Operating profits in metal packaging were
stable, while plastic packaging recovered strongly.
Since the turn of the year, growth in Germany had ground to a halt, while
there was no sign of a UK recovery, said Mr Hintz.
Productivity, in sales per head, rose by 12 per cent last year, partly
reflecting the loss of 2,500 jobs, bringing the workforce down to 31,450.
This brought a steep rise in restructuring charges, from FFr198m to FFr389m.
CMB's increased cash-flow and reduced working capital enabled it to reduce
its high debts, a legacy of its earlier hectic acquisitions, to FFr3.91bn by
the end of December, from FFr4.78bn.
Gearing fell from 42 per cent of shareholders' funds to 33 per cent over the
same period, as interest charges fell by 9 per cent to FFr67m.
Sales in the first quarter of the current year were flat, after an unusually
strong first quarter last year, said Mr Hintz.

<TEXT>
THE NOMINATION of Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian investor, to the Dutch
transport group Nedlloyd ran into fresh difficulties yesterday when the
company's works council lodged an official objection against the proposed
appointment.
The move means the Nedlloyd supervisory board must either retract Mr Hagen's
nomination or defend its decision before a Dutch court, whose ruling in the
case would be binding.
The board said yesterday it would announce its decision 'within a few days.'
The works council's opposition to Mr Hagen, who controls 25 per cent of
Nedlloyd's share capital, threatens to re-open a long-running debate about
his suitability as a board member which seemed to be settled in January when
the supervisory board decided to nominate him for one of two vacancies.
Previously, Mr Hagen and Nedlloyd had clashed publicly about the best
methods of returning the loss-making group to financial health.
'The proposal of the supervisory board to appoint Mr Hagen amounts to an
attempt to buy off - hopefully - the opposition of Mr Hagen as a
shareholder,' the works council said in a statement.
It added: 'The proposed appointment of Mr Hagen can only with difficulty be
called anything else than a greenmail deal.'

<TEXT>
SVENSKA Cellulosa (SCA), Sweden's second biggest pulp and paper group,
suffered a 42 per cent drop in profits after financial items to SKr1.23bn
(Dollars 204m) last year, compared with SKr2.13bn in 1990.
Group sales rose by 5.2 per cent to SKr32.76bn. Earnings per share fell by
27 per cent to SKr5.27, and the group proposed keeping the dividend
unchanged at SKr3.2.
SCA blamed the sharp drop in profits on its high financial charges and the
decline in prices for most of its paper products during the latter part of
1991.
The group has pursued an aggressive expansion programme which included the
acquisition of Reedpack, the UK paper, packaging and office supplies group,
for Pounds 1.05bn in 1990. However, high interest rates have pushed up the
cost of acquisitions, and SCA's net financial expenses jumped 52 per cent to
SKr1.42bn in 1991, mainly due to the Reedpack takeover's cost.
Operating profits fell in three of SCA's divisions - packaging, graphic
paper, and forest and timber. However, the group's largest business area -
the hygiene products division which makes babies' nappies - showed a 20.7
per cent increase in operating profit to SKr727m, on slightly lower sales of
SKr11.628bn.
While profits in this area increased due to the implementation of a
rationalisation programme, SCA said tougher price competition had limited
the improvement.

<TEXT>
CREDITANSTALT Bankverein, the Austrian bank, yesterday unveiled a 45 per
cent jump in 1991 operating profit, but said it suffered large loan losses
on its foreign business.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, the chairman, said the bank took charges of more
than Sch3bn (Dollars 149m) against its 1991 earnings.
This includes Sch1.2bn in write-downs on loans to Third World and former
communist countries, and Sch600m from the activities of its London branch.
Operating profit jumped to Sch3.02bn in 1991 from Sch2.08bn as a surge in
currency trading income offset lower earnings from regular banking
activities.
Partial operating profit, which does not include the bank's own-account
trading, fell 15 per cent to Sch2.1bn from 2.46bn a year earlier, mostly
because of higher operating expenses.
Mr Schmidt-Chiari said he expected generally better results for 1992.
Creditanstalt is not the only Austrian bank to have suffered large loan
losses abroad. Bank Austria, which took Creditanstalt's place as the
country's largest bank when it was formed through the merger of Landerbank
and Zentralsparkasse last year, earlier reported it will take a charge of
nearly Sch5bn because of losses in the US and Britain.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cookson declines 65% to Pounds 34m -
Rationalisation and restructuring point way to future growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOKSON, the materials group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down 65 per
cent from Pounds 97m to Pounds 34m for the year to December 31. The figures
included an Pounds 11m provision for rationalisation.
The severe recession and the restructuring undertaken to restore
profitability showed through in the results, said Mr Robert Malpas,
chairman.
However, the group had clearly turned the corner, he said. The balance sheet
had been strengthened, profitability had been restored in the second half
and the company was poised for growth.
Mr Malpas pointed out that operating profits on continuing activities had
increased during the second half to Pounds 28m, about Pounds 2m higher than
in the corresponding period of 1990.
The successful restructuring meant Cookson would increase its profits this
year even without an economic recovery. However, the US was beginning to
pick up and he hoped this trend would continue. Businesses in the
Asia/Pacific area continued to perform well.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.9bn to Pounds 1.3bn following a series of
disposals. Sales of continuing businesses fell from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds
1.19bn.
The results benefited from a reduction in the tax charge from Pounds 40m in
1990 to Pounds 18m. Mr Fergus Munro, finance director, said this had been
achieved by moving cash back to the UK.
As long as profits improved, he expected tax paid by the company to fall
still further this year.
A reduction in net interest from Pounds 73m to Pounds 25m had also been
achieved, said Mr Malpas. Gearing, counting convertible preference shares as
equity, had fallen from 143 per cent in June 1990 to 51 per cent by the end
of last year. Mr Malpas said he was aiming for about 40 per cent.
About 2,000 jobs had been shed since the beginning of 1990 and annualised
savings of Pounds 25m had been realised. There would be further job losses
this year, he said, though not as many as last year.
Extraordinary items, incurred through closing a number of businesses,
resulted in a charge of Pounds 19m (Pounds 31m).
Earnings per share were 1.8p (12.5p). The final dividend is maintained at
3p, making a total of 6p.
COMMENT
Those looking for a cyclical recovery stock need look no further than
Cookson. A strengthened management team has whittled down the business to
core activities. Profits should increase without a recovery, but if the
world economy improves the company would also be able to increase volumes
without much additional cost. About 50 per cent of sales are in the Americas
and the first glimmers of a potential recovery are becoming apparent.
Heavily dependent upon the US automotive and building industry, which seem
to have bottomed out, Cookson has little downside. Analysts are forecasting
profits of between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m, giving a multiple of between
10 and 15 on yesterday's close of 125p, up 9p. The stock appears good value.

level, there was a small profit of Pounds 26,000 (Pounds 336,000 loss).
Losses per share came out at 0.7p (1p) and a single dividend of 0.25p is
proposed for the year. Last year an interim dividend of 1.25p was paid but
the final was passed.

In 1991 Richardsons Westgarth, the steel stockholding and processing group,
saw pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 1.76m, but described

Indeed, in the light of the above, the 11 per cent increase in turnover

raising the final dividend to 1.7p (1.55p) for a total of 2.9p (2.75p).
Group turnover amounted to Pounds 45.4m (Pounds 40.8m). Tax took an
abnormally low Pounds 234,000 (Pounds 602,000) after a Pounds 340,000 credit
in respect of advance corporation tax already written off. Consequently
earnings only slipped to 5.88p (6.19p) per share.

emerged at 3.75p (4.71p), but the final dividend is 1.2p for a maintained

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gibbs and Dandy, the Luton-based building, engineering and electrical
distributor, remained in the red during 1991 as difficult trading conditions
in the construction industry continued to take their toll.
Operating profits dived from a restated Pounds 225,000 to Pounds 103,000,
and although interest charges were reduced, exceptional costs of Pounds
346,000 (Pounds 335,000) for redundancy and losses and provisions on
properties resulted in a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 754,000 (Pounds 757,000).
Turnover declined 10 per cent to Pounds 23.5m. Losses per share were 6.9p

Bridport-Gundry, the Dorset-based netting and woven products manufacturer,
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 172,000 for the six months to January 31.
This marked a modest improvement on the Pounds 163,000 achieved last time,
but was struck after a further reduction in interest charges - from Pounds
376,000 to Pounds 255,000 - and an exceptional gain of Pounds 140,000

After a reduced tax charge, earnings per share emerged at 1.66p (1.12p); the

ORIEL GROUP, the insurance broker, lifted pre-tax profits by 33 per cent,
from Pounds 2.11m to Pounds 2.81m, over the 1991 year. Commission income,
net of discounts, and investments income improved from Pounds 8.76m to
Pounds 12m.
Mr Nigel Cayzer, chairman, said the group's strategy of concentrating on
niche broking businesses 'proved more than resilient in the current weak
economic climate'.
Borrowings at the year-end amounted to Pounds 1.26m, reflecting a series of
acquisitions and working capital requirements.
Mr Cayzer stressed, however, that day-to-day operations were cash-generative
and the group does not intend to maintain long-term borrowings.
Earnings per share were 13.11p (11.15p); a proposed final dividend of 3.2p
brings the total to 5p (4.5p).

profits to Pounds 20.3m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODDINGTON, the pubs and drinks wholesaling group, reported a marginal
increase, from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 20.3m, in annual pre-tax profits as
sharply higher interest charges offset a strong trading performance.
The cost of carrying its 20.4 per cent stake in JA Devenish, after last
year's unsuccessful bid, accounted for Pounds 1.3m of the Pounds 3.55m
increase in interest. Dividend payments from Devenish amounted to Pounds
140,000.
A further Pounds 3.27m of bid costs were taken below the line.
Mr Hubert Reid, managing director, said that the net cost of the Devenish
stake this year was expected to be about Pounds 1.8m. 'We regard this as a
strategic investment,' he added, 'and we are keeping all our options open.'
Trading profit for the year to December 28 1991, rose by 17 per cent to
Pounds 25.7m (Pounds 22m) as turnover from continuing activities jumped 34
per cent to Pounds 185m (Pounds 138.5m).
The group's 478 pubs, most of them now refurbished in an investment
programme which last year cost Pounds 6.2m, raised trading profits from
Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 18.4m on turnover ahead 8.8 per cent. Further pub
acquisitions are being sought.
Drinks wholesaling, expanded by two acquisitions last autumn, more than
doubled trading profit from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 4.29m and turnover is
expected to rise from Pounds 75m to more than Pounds 100m this year.
Profits of the health care division advanced 61 per cent to Pounds 2.26m
(Pounds 1.4m) as occupancy levels rose to an average 80 per cent in the 16
nursing homes.
Hotels and restaurants increased profits by 7.3 per cent, from Pounds 2.44m
to Pounds 2.62m. Henrys Table restaurants, with sales 19 per cent ahead in
the last quarter, led strong end-of-year performances which had continued
through the first quarter of 1992, Mr Reid said.
Borrowings totalled Pounds 98.7m, including Pounds 22.3m for the Devenish
stake, with gearing at 45 per cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 13.4p to 13.6p. and a final
dividend of 4.25p makes a total for the year of 6.6p.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lambert Howarth ahead 14% as margins
improve
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED MARGINS helped Lambert Howarth, the footwear manufacturer and
importer, lift pre-tax profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 3.3m in the year to
December 31. Turnover increased by 6 per cent from Pounds 45.7m to Pounds
48.6m.
Mr Roger Rowland, chairman, said a higher percentage of leather footwear was
manufactured in response to increased demand for higher grade shoes. This
was partly linked to orders from Marks and Spencer and partly to a switch in
customer preference away from synthetic shoes.
Lambert Howarth Global was the only area of the business to increase its
sales but John Graham, the men's shoes business purchased in 1990, had a
profitable second half following its move to Burnley last May, Mr Rowland
said.
He pointed out that there had been delays in obtaining planning permission
for the freehold building purchased in London, but renovation started in the
new year and occupation was expected by September.
The company had also bought a building next to its Greenbridge factory,
which would be refurbished. The production of the general trade division
would be consolidated on one site this year. Savings would flow through
fully in 1993. Related reorganisation costs of Pounds 320,000 were taken as
an exceptional item.
The proposed final dividend rises to 8.5p making a total of 12.5p (11.25p).
Earnings per share were 39.3p (31.1p) following lower tax of Pounds 1.02m
(Pounds 1.11m).

BURN STEWART Distillers, the Scotch whisky company which was floated on the
Stock Exchange four months ago, reported relatively static interim pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4m but said it was on target to achieve its full year
forecast of Pounds 10.3m.
Operating profits for the half year to December 31 were unchanged at Pounds
5.4m on turnover increased from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 19.4m.
Earnings per share declined from 6.7p to 6.1p.
As previously announced, no interim dividend is being paid. A final
distribution of 3.33p will be declared at the June year-end.
Since its listing, the company has formed a joint venture with a Russian
drinks business and is developing trading relationships both in the UK and
overseas.
Mr William Thornton, chairman and managing director, said that trading in
the second half was expected to benefit from improved margins due to the use
of lower cost whisky stocks, and from a reduction of borrowings and interest
charges.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROGMORE ESTATES, the property company which last June defeated a hostile
bid from Southend Property, doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.15m to
Pounds 4.35m in the six months to December 31. Turnover rose 13 per cent to
Pounds 17m.
Mr Dennis Cope, chairman, said the profit was derived solely from trading
activities, with a small loss of Pounds 149,000 (Pounds 4.02m profit) from
the sale of investment properties. The decision to slim down, which the
company took at the beginning of the recession, had a favourable impact on
the result, he said.
The result was struck after sharply reduced provisions of Pounds 727,000
(Pounds 6.74m) for property write-downs.
The interim dividend is lifted to 3.4p (3.2p), payable from earnings per
share on trading activities of 7.5p (2.9p losses).
Frogmore's contracted rent roll at December 31 was Pounds 13.5m (Pounds
16.6m) and several rent reviews are outstanding. There were no significant
bad debts, Mr Cope said.
Sales of 111 housing units were made in the joint-venture low-cost housing
developments, while reservations and completions continued 'at a
satisfactory rate'.
In the current half the company had already committed more than Pounds 11m
for property acquisitions.
At December 31 borrowings totalled Pounds 7m.

COMMERCIAL Union, the insurance group, yesterday announced that it was
raising Pounds 16.9m via a placement of shares to launch a new investment
trust.
Most of the shares have been taken by institutions, as had always been CU's
intention but a small proportion has gone to large intermediaries.
The CU Environmental Trust will aim for long-term capital growth from
investments in companies which benefit from new environmental protection
expenditure.
There will be no geographical limitations.
Listing particulars were published yesterday for the issue of 17.5m ordinary
shares at 100p each, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis providing the
right to buy shares at 100p at annual intervals over the next 10 years.
Dealings are expected to start next Friday, April 3.
The trust will be managed by CU Investment Management, which will receive an
annual management fee of 0.75 per cent, plus an initial fee of Pounds 40,000
(exclusive of VAT).
James Capel will act as sponsor and stockbroker.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hepworth contains fall to Pounds 70.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEPWORTH, the building materials and home products company, managed to
contain last year's expected fall in UK profits due to higher than
anticipated growth in Europe.
Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 70.4m (Pounds 90.1m) in the year to December
31. Turnover slipped to Pounds 661.3m (Pounds 686.2m) as UK operations were
affected by the depressed construction industry and recession.
Mr John Carter, who took over as chief executive last month after Mr
Sinclair Thomson was forced to resign through ill health, said the company
did not expect a quick economic recovery but remained confident in the
medium term.
Operating profits in the building products division, which includes drainage
pipes and plastic plumbing, fell 39 per cent to Pounds 20.6m. Despite a
severe downturn in the UK, clayware products increased sales in Europe.
Saunier Duval, the French boiler maker acquired in 1990, lifted operating
profits to Pounds 22.9m and reported continuing strong growth in Spain and
Italy.
Home products, which includes garage doors and heating products, managed to
increase profits 10 per cent to Pounds 16.8m, despite declining markets.
Most of the growth came in the second half from Glow-worm boilers, which
improved sales and profits.
Refractories and minerals saw profits decline 21 per cent and 27 per cent
respectively, mainly due to recession.
Earnings fell to 24.3p (30.9p) but the final dividend is held at 9.35p for
an unchanged total of 14.85p.
Cash flow remained strong and net borrowings fell to Pounds 57.5m following
a Pounds 6.5m debt reduction. This, combined with an increase in
shareholders's funds, reduced gearing from 44 per cent to 33 per cent.
COMMENT
Hepworth's results were in line with expectations so the 14p rise in the
share price to 379p was slightly surprising. Perhaps the shares are merely
making up for losses since the appointment of Mr Carter. Certainly the City
seemed pleased with his performance yesterday, and is reassured that
Hepworth's strategy will remain essentially the same. The company has long
been touted as an early beneficiary of recovery, and Glow-worm's performance
again demonstrated the potential of the group's brand names. The only dark
spots are refractories and minerals which are likely to do no better than
maintain profits and could fare worse if further rationalisation costs are
incurred. Forecast profits for the year range from Pounds 71m to Pounds 77m,
putting the shares on a multiple of about 15, suggesting most of the good
news is in the price.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Coats plans to sell another Tootal division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS VIYELLA, Britain's biggest textile company, is in talks to sell
another division of Tootal, the rival it acquired last May after an
acrimonious takeover battle.
Coats wants to sell Lantor Group, the non-woven materials business, to the
privately-owned Freudenberg Group of Germany, one of the world's biggest
suppliers of high performance textiles. It would be Coats' second disposal
of part of Tootal.
The announcement comes ahead of its final results today. 'We had to release
the news to satisfy Dutch laws,' Coats said. The Netherlands subsidiary of
Lantor has to inform its staff that the company could be sold.
Coats said that non-woven textile materials were peripheral to its
activities. Freudenberg, the world's biggest producer of non-woven
materials, said Lantor would fit well with its existing operations.
There was no indication of the price Lantor might fetch. However, analysts
suggested it was likely to be less than Pounds 25m. That compares with the
near-Pounds 40m valuation in 1988 when Tootal bought the 49.9 per cent of
Lantor it did not own.
Lantor's products are sold for medical and marine defence applications and
it has operations in the UK, the Netherlands, the US, Australia and the Far
East.
In September Coats sold Slimma, a womenswear maker, to Dewhirst for Pounds
14.1m.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British Alcan's losses plunge to nearly
Pounds 46m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER 1,200 jobs were lost at British Alcan Aluminium last year as the
worst aluminium industry conditions in living memory plunged the group into
a Pounds 45.6m pre-tax loss.
This was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 29.6m for reorganisation and
plant closures and compared with a deficit of Pounds 12.3m for 1990,
including a Pounds 10m exceptional charge.
Mr Douglas Ritchie, chairman, said: 'There are some signs that the UK
recession may have bottomed out but none of these amounts to a return to the
growth conditions experienced in earlier years.'
He pointed out that British Alcan had generated a positive cash flow for
three quarters of 1992 and that it ended last year with debt only 36 per
cent of equity, which was 'acceptable for this stage of the business cycle.'
British Alcan is wholly owned by Alcan of Canada and there were clear
indications that the UK company both benefited and suffered at the hands of
Alcan's international strategy last year.
As aluminium prices fell to their lowest-ever level in real terms, partly
because of the recession and partly because of a sudden flood of imports
from the former Soviet Union, Alcan cut its world-wide primary aluminium
production by 8.5 per cent. The brunt was borne in the UK where one of two
66,000 tonnes a year potlines was shut down at British Alcan's Lynemouth
smelter and output at the Lochaber smelter in Scotland was cut by 10 per
cent.
However, Alcan also brought into operation Europe's first dedicated
aluminium can recycling plant at a total cost of Pounds 28m at Warrington.
Mr Ritchie said this was performing above budget.
He said the recession quickened the pace of change made in line with the
group's long-term investment and development strategy and led to
redundancies elsewhere in the group.
British Alcan withdrew from production of aircraft sheet at Falkirk which it
said was 'labour intensive and environmentally unsatisfactory,' and closed
Pentagon Radiator because it showed no sign of returning to profitability.
The group also consolidated its mainstream aerospace operations and put all
its commercial extrusion and tube operations into one business.
Sales last year were down 11 per cent at Pounds 730.8m, with falling volumes
in the UK partly offset by rising export tonnage, particularly to the rest
of the European Community. There was a tax credit of Pounds 3.5m against a
Pounds 2.4m charge, giving a net loss of Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 14.7m).

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bunzl sells papermaking business for Pounds
10.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUNZL, the packaging and cigarette filter group, is pulling out of its
original papermaking business with the Pounds 10.2m sale of its hospital and
medical papers operations to Arjo Wiggins Appleton.
The group, which is due today to announce 1991 profits, is selling the
assets of its Wycombe Marsh Paper Mills, Buckinghamshire, and Bunzl
Speciality Materials in Atltanta, Georgia, for Pounds 7m in cash with a
further payment of Pounds 3m to be phased over five years.
Bunzl will retain the factory site and Arjo will move the equipment to its
Palalda mill in south-west France over a period of two years.
The disposal is the final significant asset sale indicated by chief
executive Mr Tony Habgood at the interim stage in September.
The group closed its US food services division, after just four years of
ownership, and sold the assets for Dollars 4m to Albert Fisher of the UK.
The papermaking activities were 'peripheral to our activities,' said Mr
Habgood, who was appointed to his post last summer to refocus the group
following its acquisitive binge in the 1980s. Mr Habgood said Bunzl retained
an important distribution business in the US, while the cigarette filter
operations were 'strong and competitive'.
Altogether, disposals over the past six months represent just over Pounds
250m in sales, said Mr Habgood, although the effect would be less on the
group's profit and loss account. Bunzl reported a 32 per cent decline in
profits to Pounds 20.6m at the interim stage.
Bunzl has been in papermaking since before the company's founding
Czechoslovakian family came to Britain in the 1930s.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cut in housing stock buoys Barratt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRATT Developments said yesterday that a big reduction in its stock of
unsold houses together with cuts in the number of houses held under part
exchange deals had helped the group to a Pounds 2.5m pre-tax profit during
the six months to the end of December.
This compared with a Pounds 14.5m pre-tax loss during the corresponding
period a year earlier when the group made a provision of Pounds 16m to cover
falling property prices.
Sir Lawrie Barratt, chairman, said the improvement had been achieved as a
result of better housekeeping and savings flowing from the closure of some
subsidiaries. Reductions in group borrowings had cut interest payments from
Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 9.9m.
The number of unsold houses on its books was cut from 1,000 at the end of
June to 500 by the end of December generating a saving of Pounds 45m. A
further Pounds 15m had been saved by speeding the sale of 'second hand'
homes acquired under part exchange. About 60 per cent of group sales are
assisted by part-exchange deals.
Cuts in administration costs had reaped a further Pounds 6m, said Sir
Lawrie. He said that more savings would occur during the second half of the
year.
Property sales amounted to Pounds 5.9m in the first half. A further Pounds
4.2m of sales had been completed since December.
UK housing turned round from an Pounds 8m pre-tax loss to a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 6.3m despite incurring a further loss in southern England.
US housing incurred a reduced loss of Pounds 3.8m compared with a deficit of
Pounds 6.5m last time.
COMMENT
Sir Lawrie Barratt cheered the market with his announcement of a return to
profits, an improving balance sheet and optimistic remarks about prospects
for a steady recovery in the UK housing market. It is still too early to
talk of a revival in the market but sales have picked up. Election
uncertainty, however, could still disrupt what has been only a modest
improvement. For Barratt it is a case of so far so good. Gearing remains
high and more needs to be done. Pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 7m would
put the group on a prospective p/e of more than 16. Sir Lawrie, however,
still has his fans and a return to even a tiny dividend by the year end
would help the rating.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Clifford pins hopes on Japanese crumbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLIFFORD FOODS, the dairy products and fruit juice company, yesterday
reported a 20 per cent fall in profits but said it had high hopes for
Japanese crumbs.
The company has spent Pounds 2.5m, including ovens imported from Japan, to
make breadcrumbs to sell to makers of breaded poultry and fish.
Mr Brian Lambe, finance director, said Japanese crumbs were better quality
and generated higher margins. 'They tend to be splintery type crumbs rather
than ball crumbs,' he added.
Clifford announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 6.65m to Pounds 5.3m in
the year to December 31. This was due to price cutting among companies
supplying milk to supermarkets, an activity which generates about 27 per
cent of Clifford's turnover.
Price cutting by competitors lost Clifford margin and business, although
some custom has since been recovered. The company is also talking to
customers about a price rise in a bid to restore margins to levels of a year
ago.
Turnover fell 5 per cent to Pounds 140.6m. Interest charges were lower at
Pounds 655,000 (Pounds 1.38m), reflecting lower interest rates and capital
expenditure. Gearing fell from 26 per cent to 20 per cent on net borrowings
of Pounds 7m.
Earnings dropped to 21.99p (26.26p). Directors are recommending an improved
final dividend of 7.1p to make a total of 11.5p (11p).
Clifford is converting its Kidlington dairy into an automated carton milk
unit and concentrating all milk bottling at another site.
The changes at Kidlington will involve write-offs and redundancy payments,
the company said. About 30 staff are likely to be laid off.

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rising costs behind 59% jump in Microvitec
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES jumped by 59 per cent at Microvitec, the USM-quoted computer terminal
manufacturer which took over the Logitek computer services group in May
1991.
Mr James Bailey, chairman, said the group had survived the 'worst conditions
ever experienced by our industry'. However, Logitek had been successfully
integrated and losses had been reduced substantially.
The acquisition of Logitek - funded by a Pounds 2.6m rights issue last May -
was behind the more than doubled surge in administration and distribution
costs, from Pounds 5.95m to Pounds 12.3m.
Those costs and higher interest charges of Pounds 747,000 (Pounds 196,000)
led to deeper pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.4m).
Turnover rose by 58 per cent to Pounds 36.9m, again the result of the
inclusion for seven months of Logitek.
Microvitec ended the year with gearing of 84 per cent. Mr Bailey said the
group was commited to cutting gearing through working capital management and
a Pounds 2m repayment of UK corporation and overseas tax.
He also said Microvitec had been awarded Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 434,000) in
its claim against Worldwide Technology, but the payment was subject to
appeal and had not been included in the 1991 accounts.
Mr Bailey said that the computer display division, which suffered heavier
losses in 1991, had improved sales. Microvitec had also entered a 10 year
joint marketing venture with Electrohome to provide monitors for the North
American market.
Losses per share eased from 6p to 5.3p. There is no dividend (0.3p).

FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: JLI calls for Pounds 13m to finance
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JLI Group, the prepared vegetables, dried fruit, nut and popcorn group, is
raising Pounds 13m net of expenses through a 1-for-2 rights issue at 98p a
share. The money raised is to finance acquisitions.
The shares fell 8p to 115p on the news.
The group's previous rights issue, launched last July, was also a 1-for-2
but at 87p and raised Pounds 7.7m.
JLI forecast a pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 3.1m for the year to
March 31, compared with Pounds 2.3m in 1990-91. It promised a final dividend
of 3p, to which the new shares will be entitled, to give a total of 4.5p
(4.3p).
Analysts expect earnings per share to be about 9.3p against 8.5p reported
last time.
The group is buying Golden Twin, an own label nut processor and packer, for
Pounds 2.1m and taking on Pounds 1.5m of debt.
It is in advanced negotiations with two other companies and the cost of the
three deals, including borrowings taken on, will amount to about Pounds 12m.
In April JLI also has to make a Pounds 2m final payment for Playtime Foods,
a nut and popcorn business, acquired last July.
Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive, said that the aim of the rights issue
was to keep year-end gearing at about 25 per cent, and allow the group to
finance seasonal debt peaks.
He said that the issue would not cause dilution in 1992-93 even without any
economic recovery because of savings which could be made from combining
production.
He added that Mr John Alexander, non-executive chairman, who is 69, would
not take up the rights on his 1.1m shares but the other board members would.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Barratt returns to profit at mid-way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Lawrie Barratt, chairman of Barratt Developments, Britain's third
largest housebuilder, will this month receive his first pay cheque for seven
months in recognition of the group's return to profit after making a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 105.9m during 1990-91.
Sir Lawrie, who earns Pounds 220,000 a year, announced yesterday that the
group had a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.5m during the six months to the end
of December. This compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.5m during the
corresponding six months a year earlier.
Barratt's chairman, who came out of retirement last year to resurrect the
group's fortunes, had promised shareholders that he would not draw any
salary until the group returned to profit. He will receive seven months back
pay after taking the company back into the black.
Sir Lawrie, 64, was optimistic about housing recovery prospects in the UK
and California. He said that sales by British housebuilders had risen
between 5 per cent and 10 per cent during the first three months of this
year, compared with January, February and March last year.
He believed that a slow recovery had begun in the UK and that this should
continue irrespective of the outcome of the election - provided interest
rates did not rise by more than two percentage points.
He said that house prices in relation to annual earnings were the cheapest
they had been since the early 1980s. Higher taxes by a Labour government
would hit the upper-end of the housing market while many first-time buyers
would be better off.
He was encouraged by an improvement in California where housing starts were
forecast to increase this year by up to 25 per cent.
Barratt's share price rose by 8p to 65p yesterday, lifted by reports that
net borrowings had fallen from Pounds 184m at the end of 1990 to Pounds 108m
by the end of last year. This represented gearing of 63 per cent.
Off-balance sheet debt had fallen from Pounds 71m to Pounds 25m and had been
reduced by a further Pounds 10m since December.
Sir Lawrie said that the group intended to reduce gearing to below 50 per
cent by the year-end. He said that the group would not be paying an interim
dividend although intended to return to paying a dividend as soon as
possible. Earnings per share of 1.4p compared with a loss of 5.1p during the
first half of 1990-91. Analysts forecast a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7m for
the year.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Sharp fall at Lasmo as it alters accounting practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the independent oil and gas exploration company which acquired fellow
oil company Ultramar for Pounds 1.2bn at the end of last year, disappointed
the City yesterday when it announced a sharp drop in pre-tax profit from
Pounds 48.8m in 1990 to Pounds 28.8m last year.
The company has restated its results going back to 1983 after making
sweeping changes in its accounting practices which have reduced previous
profit levels. Post-tax profits in 1991 were Pounds 59m lower than they
would have been under the company's old accounting methods.
The drop in profit, combined with the weak oil price outlook, has prompted
many analysts to reduce their earnings' forecasts for the company this year
to about Pounds 20m. Lasmo's share price suffered from the decline in
earnings and in early trading dropped 17p, but it later recovered to close
1p down at 203p.
The company increased its debt to Pounds 1.2bn from Pounds 22m in 1990 after
acquiring fellow oil company Ultramar for Pounds 1.2bn.
This took gearing up to 83 per cent, although Lasmo hoped that it could
reduce this by selling off Ultramar's downstream assets by the end of the
year.
Earnings per share dropped to 3.4p from 9p and the company held its dividend
at 8.5p. After-tax profits slipped to Pounds 18m from Pounds 38m.
'Lasmo is trading at a big discount to asset value (of Pounds 2.19 a share),
but there are still worries about the dividend and debt level,' said Mr Rob
Arnott, analyst at stockbrokers, Hoare Govett. Some analysts said the
company could be forced to cut its dividend this year although cashflow
remains strong at Pounds 235m.
Lasmo will cut its exploration budget this year from about Pounds 200m to
Pounds 135m as oil prices remain low.
'In the last five years we've been growing our exploration portfolio
dramatically now we're going to rationalise from a very high base,' said Mr
Chris Greentree, chief executive.
Last year the company achieved a record level of exploration success,
finding 78m barrels of oil. Production rose to 85,200 barrels a day (b/d)
from 83,100 b/d, but has increased to 206,000 b/d this year after the
inclusion of Ultramar's fields.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Boeing's share price struggles to take off: Anxieties about
the US aircraft group outweigh opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is keeping Boeing grounded? Shares in America's leading airlines have
taken off since the beginning of the year on hopes that their recessionary
problems are almost behind them. But shares in Boeing, the world's leading
manufacturer of commercial aircraft, have not risen in the slipstream.
Not even an upbeat presentation to Wall Street analysts earlier this month
by Mr Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman, has had much impact on the shares.
They have been trading at around Dollars 45, giving a prospective
price-to-earnings ratio of about 9, compared to roughly 15 for the Standard
&amp; Poors 500 index of leading stocks.
But Boeing has a strong balance sheet, a Dollars 92bn (Pounds 53bn) backlog
of firm orders - equivalent to roughly three years' sales - and is one of
the few large US industrial companies which can still claim to be undisputed
world leader of its sector.
Moreover, its recent annual survey of the industry's outlook struck a
bullish note, predicting world air travel would grow about 5.2 per cent a
year for the next 18 years, and that airlines would buy around Dollars 857bn
worth of aircraft during that time.
Given that sales rose 7.2 per cent a year between 1970 and 1990, Boeing's
forecast - virtually unchanged from those of the two previous years - is
perfectly feasible. But Wall Street remains edgy about near-term prospects,
particularly over the order book.
During the past few months two of the three largest US airlines - United and
American - have announced cuts in aircraft purchases for the next three
years. United said it would take delivery of only 156 aircraft, compared
with 278 it had on order or options. The cuts include 44 Boeing 737s and 60
Boeing 757s.
Boeing says its contracted Dollars 92bn backlog has so far been unaffected.
But it has deferred delivery of many of these aircraft and will have to cut
737 production from 21 to 14 a month next October. This, with cuts in its
defence business, will mean 8,000 job losses by the end of the year.
Mr Shrontz said the company still expected to deliver a record 440
commercial aircraft this year, up from 435 in 1991, while the group's
revenues (including defence operations) were expected to total around
Dollars 29.5bn, against last year's Dollars 29.3bn.
Some analysts argue that deliveries by the three major manufacturers -
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Europe's Airbus Industrie - could suffer over
the next few years if other airlines follow American and United, and
economic growth outside North America slows further.
Mr Kenneth Holden, chief strategist for GPA Group, the large Irish airline
leasing company, predicted recently that while the jumbo jet market would be
stable over the next few years, deliveries of narrow-bodied jets by all
makers would decline by 42 per cent between 1991 and 1995.
At the very least, the market is likely to remain soft over the next few
years, which will intensify pricing competition Boeing faces from Airbus
which clinched a deal this month to sell nine A310s to Delta for Dollars
600m.
McDonnell Douglas could also become a more weighty competitor to Boeing if
it sells a large stake in its civilian aircraft business to Asian investors.
Boeing's earnings over the next few years will depend on the extent these
market weaknesses are offset by positive factors, including progress in
developing its 777 jet, and declining research and development spending; a
productivity drive to improve operating margins; and a return to health by
its defence business.
The 777, a wide-bodied twin jet which fits between the 767 and the 747-400
jumbo, is due to enter service in 1995, competing against McDonell Douglas's
MD-11 and Airbus's A-330/340.
Boeing said the 777 project would involve research and development spending
totalling Dollars 1.8bn for 1992, and then between Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars
1.6bn for several years. It is also spending between Dollars 1.5bn and
Dollars 2bn on new facilities over the next few years, including a plant
north of Seattle to produce the 777.
As a result, the company's cash flow will remain negative, but its balance
sheet is strong, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 16 per cent in spite of
about Dollars 1bn in debt last year. However, Wall Street remains worried
the company might plunge straight from the 777 into building an aircraft,
dubbed the 787, which could seat 600 passengers or more.
Boeing set up a group last year to investigate this market, but Mr Shrontz
insisted 'the studies are very preliminary.' Airbus is also studying
development of an ultra-large aircraft.
The company's earnings should also be lifted by the sale of its loss-making
de Havilland commuter aircraft business to Canada's Bombardier and a return
to profit by its defence business, after three years and nearly Dollars 1bn
of losses.
With the Pentagon cutting its procurement budget by 25 per cent over five
years, all US defence contractors face shrinking markets. But Boeing is
involved in two of the biggest contracts in the 1990s - the Advanced
Tactical Fighter and the Commanche Helicopter - and expects the division to
remain in profit this year on sales of around Dollars 5bn, down from Dollars
5.8bn last year.
Wall Street expects earnings per share of around Dollars 5 this year,
against Dollars 4.56 in 1991, rising to between Dollars 5.25 to Dollars 5.50
in 1993. Some analysts said this backdrop, and growing perceptions of
airline health, could trigger a sharp rise in the stock, but for now the
anxieties outweigh the opportunities.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Gloomy Kingfisher declines by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGFISHER, the property and retailing group encompassing the Woolworths and
B&amp;Q chains, yesterday held out little hope for the anticipated increase in
consumer spending this year as it reported a 10 per cent decline in annual
profits.
Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive of Kingfisher, warned that
1992 was likely to be difficult. 'My overall impression is that there is no
significant indication of any upturn in consumer confidence. I think it will
remain tough going for the rest of the year.'
Last year pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 252m to Pounds 227.7m on
turnover 5 per cent higher at Pounds 3.4bn. The profits fall was cushioned
by lower interest payments of Pounds 11.8m, down from Pounds 30.1m.
An exceptional profit of Pounds 20.6m on property disposals was offset by a
higher than expected Pounds 14.7m charge for restructuring Comet electrical
chain and closure of the Title video rentals business. The Pounds 5.9m net
gain compares with Pounds 37.2m last time. Mr Mulcahy said the charge was
also expected to cover the current year's closure costs relating to Comet.
At the trading level, the retail division increased profits by 2.2 per cent
to Pounds 205.4m. The star performers were Woolworths, which revealed a 13
per cent rise in profits to Pounds 71.4m, and Comet, which increased its
contribution by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 9.1m.
B&amp;Q increased its share of the competitive DIY market, said Mr Nigel
Whittaker, Kingfisher director, from 12 per cent to 14 per cent. The overall
market had advanced just 2 points last year.
Nevertheless, B&amp;Q suffered a Pounds 5.4m decline in operating profits on
sales 14 per cent ahead to Pounds 1.1bn. The division had suffered a 3-point
drop in margins in the second half. Mr Mulcahy said the group would not try
to boost profits through increasing gross margins. Growth would come from
improved efficiency.
Profits at Superdrug were flat at Pounds 34.6m.
The property division, Chartwell Land, suffered a Pounds 9.7m fall in
development income. Investment income fell less sharply from Pounds 42.8m to
Pounds 37.2m.
Fully-diluted earnings per share, before the exceptional gain, rose from
30.9p to 31.6p. The final dividend was increased to 9p, from 8.4p, for a
total of 13p, up from 12.2p.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Letter: Go-between urgently needed to resolve Russia's
'Falklands'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MASAYUKI TOMIMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's article, 'Cost of Russia's Falklands' (March 25),
made an important suggestion to world leaders about solving the northern
territorial problem between Japan and the former Soviet Union.
Both countries have discussed the problem for a long time and have entered a
cul-de-sac. The other day, the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, said 'Japan
is regarded as one of our allies', but he will surely hesitate to take a
bold step to solve the problem, considering the pride of the nation and the
practical gains of the inhabitants on four islands.
Although the Okinawa islands were returned to Japan through the direct talks
between Japan and the US, the relationship between Japan and Russia is so
complicated historically that the northern territorial issue cannot be
solved easily by direct negotiations. So, a geo-political solution is
desperately needed with the help of a go-between like Mr James Baker.
Regrettably, we are not pleased to co-operate with Russia to rebuild that
country until the spine between two countries is pulled out.

misleading. Foreign investors in eastern Germany and Poland need not be
frightened of having to foot the bill for cleaning-up the sites of companies
they acquire.
The Treuhand in Germany and the ministry of privatisation in Poland have
both evolved ways to fund the clean-up of land owned by companies being
privatised: the Treuhand using government finance, and Poland using funds
from the sale of the company. However, in both cases, the investing company
is expected to take on managerial responsibility.
Moreover, in order to ensure the remedial work is done cost-effectively, the
investor in both countries is expected to contribute between 5 and 10 per
cent of the cost.

FT  26 MAR 92 / All that is gold no longer glisters: Why the price of the
yellow metal has fallen so steeply, and examines the effect on the mining
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of gold has fallen to its lowest level for nearly six years,
prompting some desperate producers to consider accelerating mine closures
and to cut production further.
The global stock market crash in 1987; war in the Gulf; political turmoil in
South Africa, the largest gold producer; and collapse of the former Soviet
Union, once the second-largest producer, have all failed to reverse the
downward trend. Reduced demand, resulting from the international economic
slowdown, and production at pre-recession levels have compounded the
depression facing the industry.
Valued in Swiss francs, the yellow metal is at its lowest price since 1978.
In Japanese yen it is at a 20-year low. In dollars - the principal currency
for gold trading - the price has slumped from its peak of more than Dollars
800 in 1980 to less than Dollars 340 per troy ounce. At this level,
according to the Gold Fields Minerals Services consultancy group, at least
half the world's gold mining capacity is unprofitable.
Most of the uneconomic mines are in South Africa, where large workforces dig
to depths of up to two and a half miles to extract the metal from narrow
seams.
So far, no big South African gold mine has been forced to close. Instead,
many companies have discontinued mining in uneconomic seams and concentrated
on those where gold is more abundant and easily accessible. Jobs have gone:
gold companies affiliated to the South African Chamber of Mines said
employment fell from 505,262 in 1989 to 473,685 in 1990 - the lowest since
1980. There were thousands more redundancies last year.
Industry observers had forecast that this year the tide would start to turn.
But many are having to rework their price predictions for 1992 because gold
has fallen much further than they expected.
Last week the metal moved into uncharted territory, forced below Dollars 342
an ounce by relatively light, but consistent, selling at a time when there
were even fewer buyers in the market than usual. Dealers suggest that this
selling came from someone who needed dollars for gold so desperately that
there was no time to take market conditions into account. Some believe the
seller was an east European central bank, although not Russia's.
Several factors have combined to cause the present lack of demand. The
market for gold jewellery, which accounts for more than half of demand, is
weak because of the prolonged recession in industrialised economies.
Investors in North America and Europe have reduced their activity in the
gold market for some years, preferring to invest their assets in
interest-bearing financial instruments. At present, Middle East interest is
seasonally low because it is Ramadan, a month of religious fasting which
this year runs from March 6 to April 6. In Japan, one of the world's largest
markets for gold bars and jewellery, demand has declined in the face of an
economic slowdown.
Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, high interest rates and the opening up
of financial markets have provided new opportunities for investors and hence
have diminished the attraction of gold.
The market was also dealt a blow by India's budget proposals, announced at
the beginning of March and to be implemented in April, which will lift the
ban on gold imports and allow Indians living or travelling abroad to import
5kg of gold whenever they return to the country. The premium paid for gold
smuggled into India has fallen 14 per cent in rupee terms. Since about 200
tonnes of the metal - 7 per cent of world sales - are smuggled into India
each year, international prices have suffered.
Given the weakness of demand, the industry has been relying on falling
supplies to revive the gold price. But it is taking a long time for low
prices to eliminate uneconomic production. According to estimates by the
Mining Journal, a respected industry publication, gold mines outside the
former communist bloc last year produced a record 1,758 tonnes, 1.4 per cent
more than in 1990.
Even in South Africa, where there has been widespread rationalisation,
production was only slightly down - by 3.5 tonnes - to 601.9 tonnes last
year. Mining Journal says that small mine closures accounted for 1.2 tonnes
of the 3.5 tonnes.
But more substantial cuts in production are now in prospect. Mr Stuart
Murray of Gold Fields Minerals Services, whose annual review of the gold
market is the industry's statistical bible, suggests the first phase of cost
reduction at the South African mines is now complete. He says: 'The next
stage will involve real cuts in production such as the closure of a large
mine.'
His views echo those of Mr Harry Oppenheimer, former chairman of the Anglo
American Corporation, the world's second-largest mining company, who said
recently: 'Under present conditions South Africa's annual gold output could
fall by somewhere between 100 and 200 tonnes, that is possibly by as much as
30 per cent, between now and the year 2,000.'
Some Australian and North American high-cost gold mines which have protected
themselves from today's low prices by selling gold forward on the futures
market at guaranteed higher prices, are also running out of room to
manoeuvre, suggests Mr Murray. As existing forward sales contracts expire,
new ones are being offered on terms not nearly as attractive.
Furthermore, production difficulties in Russia and other former Soviet
republics - ranging from shortages of equipment to shortages of capital -
are limiting their exports of gold.
Despite these cuts in production, any recovery in price is likely to be
limited. The main problem is the practice of forward sales which is common
among western gold producers. This enables producers to lock in a guaranteed
profit in exchange for sacrificing a potentially higher return. When the
price of gold rises, however, producers rush to sell more gold forward,
placing a cap on any further increase.
Another less immediate difficulty may be the prospect of increased sales by
central banks. Between them, the world's central banks hold 35,619 tonnes of
gold, equivalent to 17 years' production. But many industry observers
believe there is now less need to maintain such stocks.
European central banks, in particular, may consider reducing their
positions. If the process of European monetary union runs smoothly, a single
European central bank would control 40 per cent of the world's official gold
reserves by the year 2000.
'A single European currency reduces the principal need for reserves of any
kind - intervention in currency markets. A European central bank could
economise on reserves,' says Mr Andrew Smith, precious metals analyst at
Union Bank of Switzerland. He says central banks might become net sellers of
about 700 tonnes of gold a year from the mid-1990s.
Not everyone in the industry agrees with Mr Smith's ideas: central banks'
collective gold holdings have hardly varied in the past 40 years. But just
hearing them expressed sends shivers through the embattled gold mining
industry.

Sir, Vanessa Houlder fails to give credit to a justifiable case of post hoc

Wharf have narrowed over the past two years, as rents in some parts of
central London have halved' (Property Market, March 20). Indeed, they have -
thanks almost entirely to the creation of new office capacity in Docklands.
In the process, London has very possibly been saved from pricing itself out
of the European office rentals markets.
To quote the conclusion of a recent survey: 'London must find a way to
improve its perception of itself and by others more fairly to reflect its
relative strengths.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / Hardship in the high street: In the sober 1990s, retailing
is undergoing a sea change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For British retailers, the 1980s are a dim memory. As the big groups report
falls in profits and predict further shake-outs in the high street, the
extent to which the recession has reversed industry fortunes is painfully
clear.
The 1980s saw an unprecedented surge in consumer spending, which led to a
relentless flow of ever-increasing profits and swept the industry into a
state of near-frenzied excitement. The slogan 'shop 'til you drop' seemed to
sum up the spirit of the age.
As John Brady, a partner at McKinsey, the management consultant, says: 'The
1980s were a dream for retailers - an era when almost anybody on the high
street made money just by being there.'
Now, even the stronger retailers are struggling. On Monday, Argos, the
catalogue showroom retailer, reported a 17 per cent fall in profits and
spoke of 'the most difficult retailing environment since the company was
founded in 1973'. Yesterday, the Kingfisher group, which embraces B&amp;Q,
Woolworths, Superdrug and Comet, announced a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits after exceptional items and forecast restructuring among its weaker
competitors.
High streets throughout the country have been transformed as familiar
retailing landmarks have been hit. The Lewis's department stores which
dominated town centres in many provincial cities collapsed last year. And,
according to figures from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, more than
300 retailers went into receivership last year.
While the overall picture is bleak, there are glimmers of light. Food
retailers have remained largely immune from the downturn because of stable
demand. And investment is picking up. 3i (Investors in Industry), the
venture capital company, reports an accelerating investment trend as small,
financially sound independent chains (mainly from the north of England and
Scotland) expand in the depressed areas of the Midlands and the south-east.
Overseas retailers have also been quick to enter the UK market in an effort
to build market share. Five of the six biggest acquisitions of UK retailers
last year were made by overseas companies, with famous names such as Daks
Simpson and Harvey Nichols falling to buyers from the Far East. These new
entrants will only intensify the pressures on established UK retailers,
adding to fears about their future profitability.
Compounding the grim outlook, there is a growing belief that a sea change in
the nature of retailing has recently taken place, and that the 1990s will
pose unparalleled challenges. The constraints of belonging to the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System are likely to ensure that the
UK economy will experience slower - if more stable - rates of economic
growth than in previous decades.
'Sales growth in the 1970s was driven by inflation and in the 1980s by very
high levels of consumer credit,' says Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and
chief executive of Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer. 'Life
will be much tougher in the 1990s. There won't be so much margin for error.'
In the 1980s, retail sales, fuelled by financial deregulation and strong
economic growth, increased in real terms by 20 per cent. Verdict, the retail
consultants, suggest that in 1990-95 sales will rise by 8.3 per cent.
The rising costs of operating on the high street will continue to squeeze
margins. The retailers' main occupancy costs - rents, rates, electricity and
security - are continuing to increase at a faster rate than sales.
Although new rent levels are beginning to fall fast, many retailers are
still facing a rising bill because they are bound by five-year contracts
which reflect the excessive demand levels of the late 1980s, when retailers
bid up prices in their scramble to acquire new sites.
The Uniform Business Rate, introduced in 1990, has also imposed a heavy
burden on many retailers. As a result of the UBR, a national chain stores
group faced an average annual increase of 15 per cent in its rates bill for
the following five years. Last month's Budget gave retailers a 'breathing
space' by freezing this year's rates increase but the cost pressures will
resume next year.
The possible introduction of a minimum wage if the Labour party wins the
general election will add another element to cost pressures.
The UK retail market currently suffers from a structural imbalance: put
simply, there are too many shops chasing too few sales. The recession may
have helped choke off some of the more speculative retail developments, but
big chains, such as Sears and Ratners Group, are now closing stores in the
saturated shoe and jewellery markets.
In the US, excess retail capacity has led to the era of the 'permanent sale'
to the detriment of retailers' margins. Some retailers fear that a similar,
if smaller-scale, phenomenon has developed in the UK as the recession has
resulted in widespread price cuts.
The changing nature of consumer demand will also impose new constraints.
First, the recession has encouraged the growth of discount stores with
implications for all retailers.
'It doesn't mean that you have to discount like a crazy man. But you will
have to provide the consumer with consistent evidence of value,' says Sir
James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, the chemists.
Second, the environmental movement has spawned an increase in 'ethical
shoppers' who are concerned about the consequences of their consumption.
Third, the ageing population is leading many retailers to adapt their
approach to customers. The Ratners jewellery chain thrived on selling 'flash
trash' to teenagers but will have to redefine its target market as young
people decline as a percentage of the population.
All of these considerations are likely to accentuate the trend towards
strengthening the strong and weakening the weak, a development which has
been such a marked feature of the recession.
On one hand retailers such as Marks and Spencer, Boots, W H Smith and John
Lewis Partnership, have battled their way through the downturn in reasonable
shape. Their resilience stems from strong customer loyalty, conservative
financing and low operating costs.
M and S, for example, retains a Pounds 1.3bn portfolio of freehold property,
accounting for 28 per cent of all that held in the retailing sector. Unlike
many competitors, M and S has largely sidestepped the cost pressures from
increasing rents.
According to a study by Nikko Securities, the Japanese stockbroker, M and
S's rent bill represents only 1.1 per cent of its Pounds 5.8bn yearly sales,
compared with 8.3 per cent of Pounds 1.7bn annual sales at Burton Group, the
next biggest competitor in the clothing industry, which sold and leased back
its freehold sites.
Another group of relative winners may be called the scientifically-managed
companies, which rely far more on professional management skills than
retailing flair. Retailers such as Argos and Kingfisher place a premium on
'backroom' retailing functions, emphasising cost control, the effective use
of information technology, and the efficient management of goods from the
suppliers' gates to their shop shelves.
On the other hand, weaker retailing companies have suffered more from cost
pressures on the high street. In many cases their problems have been
compounded by over-expansion and financial over-extension. Seduced by the
appeal of a seemingly good idea, retailers such as Sock Shop expanded beyond
their capacity to manage effectively. Others, such as Burton Group,
diversified disastrously into property development.
Many of the glamour stocks of the 1980s, such as fashion groups Next, Laura
Ashley and Storehouse (which runs BhS, Habitat and Mothercare), have seen
drastic falls in their profitability, but have assured their survival by
slimming operations and reducing high levels of debt by means of asset
disposals. But how rapidly they can return to sustained profitability
remains open to doubt. Although their profits may rebound quickly when sales
recover, they will face a longer-term struggle to remain competitive against
nimble independent chains and aggressive forms of retailing, especially in
out-of-town locations.
One of the most notable examples of the so-called 'category killer' - which
sells high volumes of discounted goods, killing competitors in a chosen
market - is Toys 'R' Us. In the seven years it has operated in the UK, the
US-based chain has revolutionised the UK toy market. Its 33 stores have
seized almost a fifth of the total market, leading to the demise of a string
of smaller specialist chains.
The concept is spreading to other sectors: Ikea, the Swedish furniture
retailer, has opened three stores with great success; PC World, a privately
owned computer retailer, has opened a discount computer superstore in
Croydon and is set to open another outlet in north London by May. Nevada
Bob, the US-owned chain of golf shops, has six outlets in the UK and plans
to open more than 40 stores by 1995.
The internationalisation of retailing, spurred by the recession, is raising
both competitive pressures and opportunities for UK retailers. Many groups,
from John Menzies to Dixons, which both fell foul of differences in the US
market when they entered it in the 1980s, have experienced the pitfalls of
trying to export a winning formula. In the 1990s, the emphasis is shifting
from acquisitions in north America to slow, but steady expansion of existing
stores in Europe. M and S, for example, has switched its focus from North
America, where it owns the Brooks Brothers clothing stores and the King's
supermarket chain, towards growth opportunities in Europe. Sir Richard
Greenbury describes expansion in Europe as the company's 'immediate
priority', and says he aims to open 40 stores as quickly as suitable sites
become available.
As a more subdued retailing climate evolves over the 1990s, the industry
will be faced with the challenge of extracting growing profits from a static
sales base. To do this, it will have to squeeze extra productivity from
existing physical and human assets; it will need tighter management; and it
will have to create demand, not just satisfy it.
But although the heady days of the 1980s have long since faded, the
principles that underpin retailing remain the same. As Sir Simon Hornby,
chairman of W H Smith, the chain of newsagents, says: 'Retailing is nothing
more than putting the right product in the right place at the right price.'
Yet never has it been so difficult to achieve something so seemingly simple.

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UNACCEPTABLE By Raymond Snoddy Faber &amp; Faber,
Pounds 14.99
The debate over the freedom of the press in Britain is full of those
apparently unresolvable contradictions that brilliantly illuminate society's
continuing divisions. It might dismay those who would have us believe in the
arrival of a classless society but it is undeniable that the central split
is one of class.
For this is one nation with two distinct presses appealing to different
audiences, with different concerns, applying different criteria to achieve
different ends. On one side is the growing minority, mainly the upper and
middle class but including an educated section of the working class, forming
an articulate, literate elite which reads the serious broadsheet newspapers.
On the other is the vast majority, the working class, which buys millions of
tabloid papers every day.
While broadsheets publish what they believe to be in the public interest,
tabloids, to survive, must publish what interests the public. Experience has
shown that the public tends to be very interested in the salacious and
sensational.
Newspaper articles from past centuries, as noted by Ray Snoddy in his book,
The Good, the Bad and the Unacceptable, prove that there has long been a
public appetite for crime, sex and gossip about celebrities, especially
royalty.
In the past 50 years there have been frequent demands for a clean-up and,
inevitably, popular papers have sought to defend themselves by asserting
that any interference by parliament is a threat to freedom. In these
battles, broadsheets have been forced to defend their rude tabloid cousins.
They realise thatany diminution of freedom for the tabloid press would
threaten what they regard as legitimate journalistic investigations.
The outcome of these conflicts between press and government has been
self-regulation; in return for good - well, goodish - behaviour by
newspapers the government agreed not to enact laws to restrict press
freedom.
The latest manifestation of self-regulation, the much-vaunted Last Chance
Saloon, is the Press Complaints Commission backed up by a code of behaviour
agreed jointly by tabloid and broadsheet editors.
As one of the people who helped draft the code I was aware of the strains
between the two branches of the press, not to mention the third branch of
regional papers. Nevertheless, although there were some imperfections, we
agreed a written code and there has been a discernible rise in standards
among the tabloids in the past year. I doubt that it will last if the threat
of legislation recedes and tabloid circulations continue to plunge as they
have done in the past 12 months.
A couple of years ago I interviewed, for a BBC film, tabloid readers as they
were buying the paper of their choice. I asked three questions: Why do you
buy it? Does it worry you that many stories might be untrue or
sensationalised? If you found out that the paper was regularly publishing
untrue stories would you stop buying it?
There was an unsurprising unanimity. The papers were bought because they
were entertaining or presented news in an easy-to-read way; buyers were
relatively untroubled by whether stories were true, often claiming they
could tell where facts ended and fiction started; therefore, they could not
imagine why lack of veracity should make them give up their daily habit.
Readers are notorious for their hypocrisy, though. Snoddy quotes a survey in
which people were largely against the reporting of adultery involving those
outside the public eye and against press intrusion into the lives of the
royal family. That may be what they say but it is what they do that counts;
it is well-known that stories of illicit sex and royal tittle-tattle
continue to be big sellers.
If readers cannot help, what about proprietors? Snoddy, who has managed to
get most of them talking at some length, places a lot of faith in owners as
sensible guardians of standards. But declining profits, or changing
ownerships, can erode the best of intentions. Snoddy therefore argues for
the formation of a Council of the Press, embracing owners, editors and
journalists from every kind of newspaper, to act as self-regulator on
standards and campaigner for greater press freedom.
This is not the kind of suggestion to oppose but I remain sceptical about
its having any chance of success, since it appears to attack the problem
from the wrong direction.
If the central contradiction is embedded in class-based culture, and we can
see how education is having a slow but positive effect in changing newspaper
reading habits, then the real effort must be in improving educational
standards.
My fear is that falling tabloid circulations are due not only to people
graduating to the broadsheets but to people failing even to reach a measure
of literacy to read popular papers. That should worry us more than whether
the royal family is upset at papers peeping over the wall of Buckingham
Palace.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Arts: Hindle and Balanchine - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oliver Hindle is the newest choreographer to be nurtured by Peter Wright
with the Birmingham Royal Ballet. His Sacred Symphony for the company last
May was a professional debut; now, with funding received by Peter Wright
(the 1991 Digital Premier Award), his second creation has been made
possible. Dark Horizons is set to Shostakovich's chamber symphony (the
eighth string quartet in Barshai's arrangement). Its theme is the fate of
North American Indians driven from their lands 'on to infertile
reservations', and it is cast with nine male dancers placed against a rocky
landscape designed by Peter Farley.
It is all - in the current cant phrase - 'politically correct' (even the
Shostakovich score bore a dedication to 'victims of fascism and war'), and
staggeringly worthy in ideals. In a threnody for a people dispossessed,
Hindle shows us the men (outfitted in what look like Iriquois bathing
trunks, body paint and modish hair-styles) who are by turns watchful or
sorrowing. There is nothing, though, suggestive of the extreme richness of
tribal dance - central to the identity of the Indian races, and, in the
Sioux ghost dance cult at the turn of this century, a war-like response to
persecution by the white man. Instead, Hindle gives us pieties with an
admixture of conventional academic movement and poses that look more
cinematic than ethnic.
The merits of the piece lie in Hindle's ability to make fluent lines of
movement, and to set a personal stamp upon the dynamics of a phrase. That he
is gifted there is no doubt, and he has inspired heart-whole performances
from his cast, admirably led by Joseph Cipolla. Yet, as with Sacred
Symphony, I find that Hindle has opted for a theme too static to allow the
emotional or physical development which will let his creativity soar and
dare braver things.
This new BRB triple bill opened with a sympathetic account of Les Sylphides.
Not grand, but sincere; musical (Philip Ellis, here as with the
Shostakovich, guiding sure accounts of the score) and graceful in manner,
and in Ravenna Tucker finding a sensitive ballerina for the mazurka and the
nocturne duet: gentle, lovely dancing. The programme ended with Hans van
Manen's Five Tangos, a work without which I can very well do.
Sir Kenneth MacMillan's new and stunning Judas Tree is framed in the Opera
House programme by two major Balanchine pieces: Stravinsky Violin Concerto
and Symphony in C. The evening is one which, with the addition of Brian
Elias' powerful score for MacMillan, reasserts the musical standards of our
national ballet and the responsiveness of our dancers to good scores and
fine accompaniment.
The influence of Constant Lambert upon the identity of the Royal Ballet can
never be over-estimated: as composer, conductor, arbiter of taste for two
decades from the inception of the company, his imprint still lies in the
civilised musical attitudes of our dancers and choreographers, even in
certain felicities of style. Balanchine, most musical and most musically
educated of choreographers, never put a dancer's foot wrong in relationship
with a note or phrase. And though the Royal Ballet manner does not aim for
the bright-edged clarity of New York City Ballet in works such as Violin
concerto or Symphony in C, there is energy and rigour to the dancing in this
current series of performances, and the sense of a company on fine and
secure form.
Part of this is owed to the vitality of the orchestral playing under Barry
Wordsworth. Stravinsky Violin Concerto on two recent evenings sounded
spirited and intense (and intensely poetic in the arias), with the young
Israeli violinist Hagai Shaham a dazzling soloist, and the dancers'
performance reflected these qualities exactly. Darcey Bussell exposed all
the linear tension of the first aria; Sylvie Guillem, looking at moments
like Sargent's portrait of Mme Gautreau, seemed to lose herself in the dance
to potent effect. In the sunburst of Symphony in C , the refinement of the
orchestral playing - textures airy, clear  - encouraged dancing that was
buoyant, generous, and radiant in spirit as in step.
About The Judas Tree I can but say that a second viewing revealed fresh
layers of meaning and fresh richness of choreographic invention (how vivid
is Mark Silver, seemingly the one sympathetic character, standing hand over
mouth, denying the truth, Peter-fashion, at the action's crisis). The detail
and power in the company performances is everywhere magnificent. It is an
astonishing, adventurous work of art. Brian Elias' score is superbly
theatrical, and it finds ideal advocates in the Opera House orchestra under
Wordsworth.

BRANCHES OF THE TREE National Film Theatre
Each time we see a film there are black spaces the human eye never
registers: tiny pauses, perceptual 'cat naps', when the projector goes dark
between moving frames. Gus Van Sant's dazzlingly original film My Own
Private Idaho is about a boy who keeps falling asleep. Mike (River Phoenix),
a male prostitute, suffers from narcolepsy, a tendency to go into sudden
sleeps like seizures. Each time he wakes up a new frame of his story has
been racked into view.
Wittingly or not, the film offers itself as a metaphor for cinema. And
throughout its haunting tale of lost love and homeward longings it is one of
those rare Hollywood movies modernist enough - or postmodernist  - to wear
its conceits and devices in plain view.
The film bares its aesthetic plumbing in the disruptive editing and the
party games with visual illusionism; including a hilarious scene in which
the pin-up males on a shop's magazine covers 'come to life' and chat to each
other. It hauls into view thinly disguised chunks of Welles's Chimes At
Midnight, alias Shakespeare's Henry IV, to illustrate the filial triangle
involving Mike's friend and fellow rent-boy Scott (Keanu Reeves) with his
Mayor father and roistering surrogate father (William Richert as an Oregon
Falstaff). And it turns Mike's own search for his parents into an eccentric
dream-odyssey somewhere between Twin Peaks and Van Sant's own last film
Drugstore Cowboy.
The director sounds the film's keynote of tender surrealism at the start,
with a flashbacking fantasy montage. Mike is shown asleep on a lonely
country road; then Mike's face is shown grimacing with passion as he
'climaxes' with a client; then this memory cues a shot of a wooden
homestead, his childhood home, tumbling from the sky onto the very tarmac
where he lies.
Slowly, in this 'gay' movie that makes no fuss whatever about its gay
background, we piece together dreams and reveries and encounters. Mike's
unrequited love for Scott is sewn into images of mock-sacred passion (a
Pieta posture in a narcolepsy fit) and then stammered out touchingly by a
midnight campfire. Scott's own macho high spirits - he is a heterosexual in
hustler's clothing - find their Hal-like home in the Falstaff subplot. And
everywhere Van Sant presents the mystery of 'home', that most achingly
undefinable word in the language, through a variety of filters: from the
backwoods-sentimental ('Home on the range' twanged out on a musical saw) to
the comforting fantasies of sex to the looming parental shadows who never
quite coalesce into a definable Mum and Dad.
Even sleep - the emotional punctuation marks of Mike's narcolepsy fits  -
seems like an oblique, absent-minded quest for rebirth. When his body wakes
time has moved on to a new reality and Mike himself has often been moved on
by a friendly Scott to a new 'birthplace'. In one scene he wakes in the
centre of town under a statue of America's early settlers with the
stirringly ambivalent inscription 'The Coming of the White Man.'
How often does a mainstream American film ask you to bring your thinking cap
with you? How often, having done so, does it keep taking it off and
playfully throwing it in the air. For My Own Private Idaho is no ponderous
movie cryptogram but a celebration, often funny, of cinema's own expressive
athleticism. That freedom of movement is not arbitrary: it is a reflection
of life's own bewildering cross-knitting of past and present, seeming
reality and evident illusion. Indeed only decades of narrative spoonfeeding
have made a film like My Own Private Idaho require the epithet 'surreal'
rather than 'real.'
What level of reality Pedro Almodovar's High Heels belongs to I have no
idea. The wacky Spaniard who gave us Women On The Verge Of A Nervous
Breakdown here gives us a film seemingly designed to keep audiences on the
verge of narcolepsy.
The story must have come from some dusty drawer marked 'last-resort plot
premises.' Pretty TV newsreader Victoria Abril (of Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down])
becomes entangled in the murder of her husband and the jealous sexual
intriguings of her mother. Meanwhile the friendly young investigating Judge
with the false beard looks suspiciously like the beardless drag artist we
first saw providing Miss Abril with lingual services as she hung from the
ceiling in his dressing room.
An everyday tale, you will gather, of media and showbiz folk. Unfortunately
Almodovar fails to see the ludicrous side of it, which is astonishing for a
director who seldom sees any other side to a story. As Miss Abril tearfully
confesses to the murder on network TV (though she might not have done it),
or as Mama gasps her last on an ambulance stretcher, or as the Judge whips
off his beard and reveals his essentials - the film remains as po-faced as a
gynaecologist presented with the entire nude cast of Oh Calcutta].
What ever happened, one asks, to the witty, maze-like insanity of Senor A's
early films (Dark Habits, Matador) or the open-plan farce of Women On The
Verge? Here one comes out humming the furniture - candy-coloured sofas and
tutti-frutti cushions - and wondering why its aesthetic tunefulness has not
spread as usual to the rest of the film.
As Cincinnatus was called from his plough, so ageing American film heroes
are called from the farmlands to become great statesmen or sportsmen. In
Necessary Roughness Scott Bakula is the 34-year-old retired footballer
summoned from his turnip patch to captain a Texas university football team.
Urged on by foulmouthed trainer Robert Loggia and stressed-out manager
Hector Elizondo, swallowing nitrate pills like Smarties, he must turn a
losing team into a winning one. Will he?
Will the sun come up tomorrow morning. Punch-drunk with cliches, the film
staggers up and down its chosen playing field with little idea of where it
is going and less idea of why. Wait, or not, for the video. Stan Dragoti
directed.
Geoff Murphy of Utu and Young Guns II directed Freejack, but I doubt that he
would want it to loom large in his career profile. Emilio Estevez and Mick
Jagger hunt each other through futuristic New York (2009 AD), watched by
psychotic billionaire Anthony Hopkins. There are many car chases, explosions
and violent deaths and the plot is all about reincarnation, clearly a
sunrise industry in this society. I most warmed to the nun played by Amanda
Plummer. On being slapped in the face by a baddie she meekly quotes Jesus's
words about turning the other cheek; then she says 'But he wasn't talking
about dickheads like you' and knees her assailant in the groin.
Such a contrast to the world of Indian director Satyajit Ray. I could have
done with a car chase, mind you, or even a runaway rickshaw, in Branches Of
The Tree. This deeply talkative drama about family guilt and redemption is
on the chairbound lines of Ray's recent An Enemy Of The People. There are
grace notes recalling the old mobile mastery: sudden gentle swirlings of the
camera, a bright montage of morning activities. But mostly this is less like
a movie than a diagram for one, sketched by a great seer of the cinema now
succumbing to stiffening artistry.

There is a lot of comedy on Thursday nights, though not all is either new or
good. Last Of The Summer Wine (8.00 BBC1) was exploiting the subject of
pensioners long before it became trendy in series such as 'One Foot In The
Grave'. Foggy, Compo, Clegg and the rest have been around for so long that
virtually everyone must have decided whether they like the series. This is
of course a repeat.
So is Porridge, which begins another run. My guess is that, once again, it
will get huge ratings. Clement and le Frenais have never written anything
better than this prison saga and Ronnie Barker has never given a better
performance than as Fletcher, the crafty old lag (10.00 BBC1).
Between the two comes Us Girls (8.30 BBC1), which looks as though it is on
screen because it is about black people and not because it was better than
everything else on offer. The Big One, with Sandy Toksvig and Mike McShane
as unlikely flatmates, is much the better choice (8.30 C4). Capable of being
the best of the evening if the script is on form, Red Dwarf V takes us into
outer space and a parallel universe to 'Star Trek" and all that.

FT  26 MAR 92 / People: Early departure of Taylor Woodrow chief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow, one of Britain's biggest construction and property
companies, surprised the stock market yesterday by announcing that it was
replacing its chairman little more than a fortnight before announcing a
sharp drop in profits.
Peter Drew, who has headed the group since October 1989, has resigned as
chairman and a director of the company with immediate effect. He has been
replaced by Colin Parsons, a 58-year-old chartered accountant, who is
currently president of Monarch Development Corporation, TW's quoted Canadian
affiliate.
Peter Drew will be 65 this year and was due to retire. However, the company
decided to bring his departure forward so that the new man could be in place
for the announcement of the company's results. Like many construction
companies TW has been hard hit by the recession and the collapse in property
values. It confirmed again yesterday that it intended to recommend a final
dividend of 9.5p net per share.
TW went out of its way yesterday to praise Drew's 26 'highly successful'
years with the company. He made his name as the first developer with
docklands and masterminded the St Katherine's dock development. However, his
chairmanship has not been regarded as a great success and there has been
increasing concern about the company's lack of leadership.
By choosing another TW veteran, the company has once again missed an
opportunity to inject some outside talent onto its board. Colin Parsons
joined TW in 1959 and joined the TW board in 1987. There will be some
surprise that he has leap-frogged deputy chairman John Topping who has been
on the board since 1976.

FT  26 MAR 92 / People: My Little Pony lassoes licences across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Licensing Group (ELG), in charge of licensing characters from
the Ninja Turtles to My Little Pony across the Continent from Portugal to
Latvia, has chosen Robert Watson from US toy manufacturer Hasbro as its new
managing director. His predecessor Oliver Reid was killed in a traffic
accident in January at the age of 54, shortly after taking up his
assignment.
ELG is a joint venture, trading since January, between Copyright Promotions,
the UK's largest character licensing operation and part of Mosaic
Investments, and Merchandising Munchen, part of the German media empire
belonging to entrepreneur Leo Kirch. It is located in Amsterdam and aims to
break down the barriers of European-wide licensing.
David Cardwell, joint managing director of Copyright, says Englishman Bob
Watson, 43, latterly vice-president of international licensing at Hasbro
International in London, 'knows the licensing business inside out' and
speaks fluent French, German and Italian; 'He was the person we reported to
at Hasbro,' in transactions connected with licences for My Little Pony,
Playschool and many others. Cardwell points out that
Watson also understands third party licensing, where Hasbro would buy in for
its own purposes licences from Disney, or the rights to Turtles from
Copyright.
He will be in charge of 16 countries - including a series of offices just
opened in eastern Europe and the Russian Republics, which are starting to
license characters such as the Turtles, Pink Panther, and, shortly, Indiana
Jones. 'Oliver did a tremendous job setting it up,' says Cardwell. 'Bob will
be there to keep the monster under control.'
*****
When the Euro Disney park opens outside Paris on April 12, Peter Woodhead
will be counting on the publicity to give a boost to such ageless characters
as Mickey Mouse and Goofy.
Woodhead's job is to ensure that the British have Disney characters for
breakfast, lunch and dinner. Appointed managing director of Disney Consumer
Products in the UK, Woodhead, 41, will continue Disney's activities in the
granting of licences to clothing manufacturers, retailers and publishers,
but he also sees a great future for Disney characters in food products.
One of his most important tasks, however, will be to take advantage of a
recently-concluded pan-European licensing agreement between Disney and
Nestle, the Swiss food giant. Lined up for UK consumers, says Woodhead, are
more Disney characters on yoghurt cartons; Easter eggs with Disney themes;
and, he hopes, pasta in the shapes of Disney characters.
Before joining Disney, Woodhead worked on the licensing of products based on
Mattel's Barbie doll. He also helped ATV to license the Muppets and Pink
Panther.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Business Law: Meeting old public liability claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RANDOLPH FIELDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The insurance industry is currently under threat from claims of catastrophic
proportions which stem from its carte blanche underwriting of unrestricted
pollution liability insurance in the UK between 1930 and 1990.
Up to now attention has been solely directed to US claims. In the recently
published Rowland Report, Lloyd's: a Route Forward, not a single reference
was made to the claims that Lloyd's may face from UK policyholders in
respect of UK environmental clean-up expenses.
There is no hard estimate yet for the amount of money that will be required
to clean up Britain's industrial heritage, but all experts agree the costs
will run into billions.
Lloyd's has acknowledged that the cost of cleaning up the US may reach
Dollars 1,000bn. If Britain's problem is only one-tenth the size of the
American problem the claims will be in the order of Pounds 50bn. (A recent
estimate published in the Financial Times put the cost at between Pounds
10bn and Pounds 30bn.)
One insurer recently described the pre-1990 enforcement of laws controlling
pollution in the UK as a farce. Since the Environmental Protection Act came
into force in November 1990, a much more rigorous regime of pollution
control and remediation has been in place.
Section 61 of that act, for example, permits local authorities to recover
the costs of cleaning up contaminated sites from the site owner.
Of more significance are the catch-all provisions of section 161 of the
Water Resources Act 1991 that empower the National Rivers Authority to clean
up actual or threatened pollution of controlled waters and reclaim the costs
of clean-up from anyone who 'caused or knowingly permitted' pollution.
As no element of knowledge is required to establish liability on the part on
anyone who causes pollution, it would seem that strict liability will be
imposed on any company which, quite properly and in accordance with all
applicable regulations in force, 'caused' its industrial waste to be
disposed in a landfill site owned and operated by a local authority and
which now threatens to pollute controlled waters.
It will be interesting to see whether a person who transported someone
else's waste to such a landfill site will also be liable under this
legislation.
The National Rivers Authority is the agency empowered under the Water
Resources Act to institute clean-up operations. Although they do not yet
appear to have used these powers, it cannot be long before they do so.
Also waiting in the wings is the anticipated European Commission Directive
on Civil Liability for Environmental Pollution.
Even in the absence of new laws, there is the spectre of lawsuits grounded
in nuisance and negligence which are directed at industry by those whose
property and health have been adversely affected by environmental pollution.
Recently in the US there has been a number of multi-million dollar
settlements of third-party injury claims emanating from consumption of
contaminated water over long periods of time. The same pollution problem
exists in Britain and it can only be a question of time before evidence of
mass poisoning emerges.
Thus Lloyd's and UK insurance companies now face an avalanche of claims on
public liability policies which have lain dormant for up to 60 years.
Why is this so? Insurance policies written in the 1930 to 1990 period
covered pollution losses unless specifically excluded. It is a facet of
these policies that there is no time limitation on claims and, as fantastic
as it sounds, it was well appreciated when the policies were written that
claims could arise years after the policies had apparently 'expired'.
US insurers acted in the early 1970s to restrict coverage for pollution
claims before ceasing in 1985 to write any form of coverage whatsoever. UK
insurers inexplicably waited until 1990 to restrict their own pollution
coverage.
Recently, Mr Brian Street of American International Underwriters (UK), a
leading London market insurer, remarked that the UK industry's practice in
writing unrestricted public liability policies on an 'occurrence basis' had
been 'naive'.
He described the typical public liability policy as including all forms of
pollution liability, gradual as well as sudden and accidental, unless
specifically excluded, and because the policies had been written on an
occurrence basis with no limit to the number of events in any one period of
insurance, they afforded unlimited coverage.
Most UK insurers of commercial liability risks have on their books
significant volumes of policies which until 1990 were silent on the topic of
pollution. Only those risks where there was a perceived pollution problem,
such as chemical plants, would have been restricted. Even where restricted
terms were used the effectiveness of these clauses will be open to challenge
in the courts.
The recognition of the risks of environmental pollution is not new. Until
the 1960s it was general practice to include, if there was a perceived risk,
an exclusion of liability from water pollution and the escape of fumes,
chemical effluent or other noxious gas, liquid or substance placed in the
policies of certain industrial insureds.
As far back as 1969 Mr Peter Madge, a prominent British writer in the field
of liability insurance, pointed out that an occurrence policy would cover a
claim for bodily injury and property damage to third parties due to the
deliberate emission of toxic chemicals from a chimney stack.
It was the writing of these old public liability policies on an occurrence
basis that was chiefly to blame for underwriters' current misery.
This is because, under the terms of a standard worded public liability
policy, the event that triggers coverage is when the injury or damage takes
place or occurs, not the accident giving rise to it.
Thus where a negligently designed building is erected and subsequently
collapses during a later policy period, it is the later policy that will
respond to the resulting claims. Similarly, where faulty electrical wiring
is installed before insurers come on risk and a building subsequently burns
down when insurers are on risk, the claim is covered.
It is, therefore, an important question of fact when the injury or damage
occurs, for this will determine the policy or policies under which cover
will be available.
Gradual pollution presents particular problems in this regard. Often there
will be little certainty as to when the property damage commenced and for
how long it may have continued until discovered.
In the recent asbestos-related litigation it was found, as a matter of fact,
that discrete bodily injury took place soon after first exposure and
continued until the manifestation of disease up to 40 years later.
In those circumstances most courts held that all policies in effect during
the continuing injury process were jointly and severally liable for the
ensuing claims.
It is this prospect of multiple years of coverage being triggered for
environmental claims that has got the insurance industry so concerned.
Since the introduction of the occurrence policy wording, it has been
recognised by those who gave any serious consideration to the issue that
gradual pollution claims would be covered.
In Britain in 1958 the Insurance Institute of London, in recommending that
an occurrence basis of coverage should be adopted for UK policies, noted:
'For the insurance to apply it is only necessary to establish that the
injury or damage giving rise to the claim has occurred during the currency
of the policy. There may still be difficulties if the injury or damage does
not manifest for some time . . .'
It is particularly poignant that in 1959 and 1960 certain Lloyd's
underwriters did try to introduce a standard policy clause that would
exclude coverage for gradual pollution. Unfortunately for today's Names, the
people whose capital backs underwriting at the Lloyd's insurance market, the
warnings of these underwriters were ignored by their fellow Lloyd's and
company underwriters who continued blithely to underwrite the risk of
gradual pollution loss.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Letting Rover off
the leash - The car group is severing relations with existing agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'OF COURSE it's completely weird. Advertising just does not happen this way.
And you can take it from me - it's not going to work.'
Such is the verdict of one Saatchi &amp; Saatchi executive on Rover Group's
decision to change the way it advertises and markets its cars in the UK and
continental Europe.
Relinquishing outside agencies, Rover yesterday formally handed the bulk of
its marketing accounts to a new company - Kevin Morley Group - set up by
Kevin Morley, a former commercial director of Austin Rover and now a
non-executive board member of Rover Group.
More than 30 advertising agencies, dealing with television, press and direct
mail, once handled Rover's advertising. The company is reluctant to put a
value on its marketing budget, but an estimate for expenditure in the UK and
Europe might be in the region of Pounds 100m. In the UK, the Rover account
was worth some Pounds 20m annually to BSB, part of the Saatchi group.
As the recession continues, commissions are being squeezed and advertisers
are trying to reduce advertising budgets. Where Rover advances, other large
advertisers may follow.
As the Saatchi executive said: 'Losing business to a flesh and blood rival
is one thing, but to lose it this way is something else again'.
Kevin Morley says that Rover's move had been planned for nine months. 'There
was a need in Rover to cut costs and to have a form of integrated marketing.
We have been trying for a number of years to get an integrated marketing
agency - there are plenty in this country and the US - but not of the size
required to handle Rover. Rover's stance is one name, one standard,
everywhere. You can't have one name and one standard everywhere with 30
different agencies, all with their own objectives.'
Morley's contract with Rover says that KMG will handle all Rover's marketing
business in the UK and Europe. However, initially he will have to use
existing agencies across Europe; it will not become a pan-Europe agency
overnight.
For the time being, BSB - part of the Saatchi group - will continue to act
on behalf of Rover, but through Kevin Morley. BSB Dorland retains Rover's UK
Land Rover account. Zenith, the media-buying wing of Saatchi, will also
continue to act for Rover in Europe and UK.
Kevin Morley has recruited 45 people for his new agency. The staff will
handle strategic advertising, including television, press and direct mail.
That strategic group will place advertising with the sales teams across
Europe.
'It is not common in the motor industry to have pan-European advertising but
in other industries it's been common for years,' says Morley.
'Kevin Morley Group is a separate company owned 100 per cent by me; the
relationship with Rover is merely that we handle all of Rover's marketing
activities. What I am trying to do is to get away from thinking purely in
terms of advertising.
'What clients understand, and I would suggest advertising agencies don't
quite understand yet, is that clients want the one name and one standard
running everywhere throughout all of their activities, from the TV
commercial right the way down to the salesman's handbook in the showroom.'
One area that prompted the new marketing policy is Morley's own encounters
with advertising agencies, which failed to look at what clients required,
including such supposedly unglamorous details as direct mail: 'It was
described to me by one advertising agency chairman as 'the other stuff'.'
Nor is the most important issue cost-cutting. John Towers, managing director
of Rover Group, says that while Rover expects 'a minimum of 10 per cent'
better value for money, that will not necessarily mean a 10 per cent cut in
the marketing budget. Morley says that fees will be lower because there are
less fixed costs associated with one agency rather than 30.
'We can probably also save 10 per cent by group media buying, by having
pan-European media buying done centrally out of London or Paris.'
According to Morley, Rover's decision to unify and slim its marketing plans
is in line with a policy to reduce its suppliers generally, from more than
900 currently to just under 200.
Morley is no longer an employee of Rover Group, though confusingly he will
act as managing director of Rover Marketing, a division within the group. He
is at pains to emphasise that Rover has not simply decided to take all its
marketing in-house: Rover Marketing, with a staff of 100, handles corporate
planning and future product development; KMG will handle what is
conventionally thought of as advertising and marketing.
Nevertheless, a condition of his company's five-year contract for the Rover
business is that he devotes himself to the Rover account.
Morley dismisses suggestions that his role as a non-executive director at
Rover Group and his control of Rover's new marketing supplier could lead to
conflict of interest. He is satisfied that, as Rover Group's marketing
budget is under the control of the group board and is not in the hands of
any one individual, such suggestions are groundless.
His view is that accusations of interest-conflict stem largely from the
advertising world which, he believes, fails to understand what his new
company - and Rover's policy change - entails.
'It has been said that the advertising industry is the youngest on earth
with the oldest ideas. The critics don't understand the move; there is no
conflict of interest.'

top of the hops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drinkers in England and Wales show a marked taste for international brands
of lager when they go to the pub but they remain loyal to regional brands of
ale.
Five of the pubs' best-selling beers last year were international lagers -
Heineken, Foster's, Castlemaine, Carlsberg and Stella Artois. But only two
ales, Allied-Lyons' Tetley bitter, and John Smith's bitter, brewed by
Courage, laid claim to national popularity by gaining places in the list.
Two national lagers, Carling Black Label and Skol, and Guinness stout
occupied the remaining places in the top 10 which had total sales of Pounds
2.3bn, more than the combined sales of the next 30 brands.
A survey by Stats MR, the market monitor, for Publican, the pub trade
newspaper, lists only one independent regional brewer's product, Marston's
Pedigree, in the top 100 best-selling drinks.
But Ruddles, the Leicestershire brewer now owned by Grolsch of the
Netherlands, wins a mention and regional tastes are reflected in the range
of beers from the national brewers - Bass, Courage, Allied-Lyons, Whitbread
and Scottish &amp; Newcastle - which dominate the Pounds 10bn a year pub market.
The five brewers supplied 69 of the top 100 brands.
A growing taste for stout has lifted Murphy's, distributed by Whitbread,
into the top 50, and Courage's Beamish brand into the top 70.
Holsten Pils leads the trendy premium packaged lagers but S&amp;N's Newcastle
Brown ale is the most popular bottled beer.
Bulmer's Strongbow and Taunton's Dry Blackthorn head five listed ciders.
Diamond White packaged cider rates a higher placing than many bottled
lagers.
Bell's whisky, Bacardi rum, Gordon's gin, and Smirnoff vodka lead the
spirits and specialty brands with places in the top 20, but the list also
includes Southern Comfort, Martini Dry, Malibu, Pernod, Tia Maria, and
Bailey's.
Two brands of dark rum, a drink long considered out of fashion, are listed
but not a single brandy. Perhaps less surprisingly, only one low alcohol
beer, Bass's Tennents LA gets a rating.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why viewers find
some TV soaps are a turn-on / Investigating new research into the way people
watch programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television viewers switch naturally between two distinct modes of watching
programmes - active and passive - according to new advertising industry
research.
The difference could be crucial for advertisers because evidence suggests
that when people are watching passively, they remember little of what they
have seen - which means that advertisments stand little chance of making an
impact.
Viewers, for instance, tend to watch TV-am, the commercial breakfast channel
passively, although they may briefly become active if there is a particular
item they are interested in.
By contrast, they are much more engaged when they are watching ITN's News at
Ten.
The BBC soap opera EastEnders with subject matter covering topics such as
Aids, homosexuality and rape is avidly watched and received high levels of
recall, says Jim Marshall, managing director of The Media Centre, which is
part of the DMB&amp;B advertising agency and one of those responsible for the
new research.
Neighbours, the Australian-made soap also shown on the BBC, was viewed and
enjoyed by a similar number of respondents in the research project, but the
programme was not absorbed in the same way. 'Most could remember little or
nothing about its plot or subject matter,' said Marshall who presented the
research findings with Margaret Tulley, planning director at DMB&amp;B, at a
Media Week conference in Harrogate last week.
The message seems to be that if programmes are challenging and involving,
viewers watch them actively.
Bland programmes produce bland viewing.
Marshall argued that research in both the UK and the US found that there was
a direct relationship between the impact a programme had and 'the way that
people process advertising'.
Viewing habits have changed in the last decade. A similar study conducted 10
years ago found that there was still a feeling of magic about television as
families gathered around the screen. That has now gone: people take
television and the extra choice of programmes and channels, immediate news
coverage and sophisticated video effects, entirely for granted.
Viewers happily chose to watch individual programmes on minority channels
yet the old distinction between 'selective' and 'non-selective viewers' is
now far too crude.
'Different audiences watch different programmes in different ways and this
can vary by day of week, through the day, or even in the course of an
evening,' Tulley believes.
For advertisers and advertising agencies, the implications are clear, Tulley
believes: it makes sense to schedule advertising against certain programmes
which are more engaging to particular target audiences.
DMB&amp;B plans to continue the research and believes that far more qualitative
research is needed on the way viewers interact with their television sets -
not as a substitute for counting the audience, as in traditional ratings
measurement, but as a supplement to it.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Technology: Australia joins EC network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELISABETH TACEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia has become the first non-European member of BC-Net, the agency
that links companies in different countries so they can conduct cross-border
business. The move should make it easier for European companies to penetrate
the Australian market by forging alliances with commercial, technical or
financial partners there, and vice versa.
BC-Net (Business Co-operation Network) was set up by the EC in 1988 and
later expanded to include members of the European Free Trade Association.
Companies connect with the system via business consultants, who enter
descriptions of the companies and what links they want. BC-Net, based in
Brussels, tells the consultants when it has found a match, and the
consultants liaise with each other before introducing their clients.
Under the deal signed last week by Gareth Evans, the Australian minister for
foreign affairs and trade, and Frans Andriessen, the EC vice-president,
Australia will pay the EC Ecu 35,100 (Pounds 25,100) to gain access to the
network.
In addition, Australian companies will pay ADollars 100 (Pounds 44) to the
EC for each profile entered, and the consultant's fee. Fayle says it is 'a
cheap way of exploring the opportunities' of forming alliances, which might
take the form of licensing agreements for manufacturing, distribution or
sales deals. But he admits that few Australian companies have heard of it.
Jon Finlay of Sydney-based management consultants Abacus says Australian
companies often try to expand abroad because the home market of 17m people
is small. 'Every client we've talked to about it will put a profile on,' he
says. 'Any way of shortening the process of forming trade alliances is
attractive.'
A six-month pilot programme begins at the end of April, when BC-Net manager
Eric Hamelinck visits Australia to train interested consultants.
Finlay expects the network to be used mostly by companies of 300-400
employees, with a minimum of 100. But, he adds: 'We're not relying on BC-Net
to produce the goods. We're looking at it as getting into a network of
business advisers in the EC. It's just a tool to set up the business link.'

FT  26 MAR 92 / Technology: Hoping for rich pickings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The contracting out of IT by the Northern Ireland civil service has aroused
much interest among central government computer departments on the mainland.
At least four have sent observers to Belfast.
These visits auger well for private-sector suppliers hoping that central
government will offer them a third wave of deals following their penetration
of local government and health authority IT in the 1980s. This time the
pickings could be much bigger as some government departments operate dozens
of mainframes spread around the country.
Government departments routinely contract out support services such as
cleaning, laundry and catering. But a White Paper last November extended the
government's policy of 'market testing' into professional and specialist
operations such as accountancy, legal services and IT.
While a Labour government would change the parameters of official policy and
end compulsory competitive tendering in local government, the underlying
drive for quality and value-for-money would continue - with some facilities
management proposals proving hard to resist.
The FM market for IT was worth Pounds 399m in 1991 according to market
researchers Romtec, of which the public sector accounted for 43 per cent.
Romtec expects the total market to more than double by 1994. 'In the public
sector, cost control is a major motive for choosing facilities management,'
says Jon Whiteley, of Romtec. It's different from the private sector where
FM is valued additionally for enabling a company to concentrate on its core
business, he says.
'FM has had some success in local government competing with well-established
and mature IT which has acquitted itself well,' says Whiteley. 'These very
large government departments are a more ambitious target for an FM supplier
to set itself,' he says.
The White Paper, Buying Better Public Services, listed central government IT
as a 'promising area' for market testing or contracting out. Already the
Department of Health is buying IT and management consultancy services worth
Pounds 15m from the private sector in 1991-92, while the Inland Revenue
expects to buy in more than half of its IT development and operations worth
Pounds 80m.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food uses facilities management
on some of its computer systems and buys consultant support worth Pounds
4.5m a year.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Technology: New well goes round the bend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Horizontal drilling, one of the more advanced areas of oil exploration and
production technology, takes a step forward next month on the sand dunes
north of Aberdeen.
The International Drilling and Downhole Technology Centre (IDDTC) will be
drilling an experimental well which will be made available to the equipment
and services industry as a testing ground. The IDDTC claims it will be the
first facility of its kind in the world.
The well will descend 1,000 feet. It will then be turned through a nine
degree per 100 foot angle, and continue for another 500 feet horizontally.
The total length of the well will be 2,440 feet.
The Pounds 900,000 cost will be borne partly by the oil services industry
and partly by the local regional council, Scottish Enterprise and Grampian
Enterprise. Although this sounds a lot of money, David Curry, the IDDTC's
managing director, says it is one twentieth of the cost of drilling a
similar well offshore. He describes horizontal drilling as 'the emerging
technology, the technology of the 1990s'.
One purpose of the well is to test compressed air drilling techniques which
are still being developed. These techniques are thought to be more efficient
than traditional liquid mud systems, providing higher penetration rates.
Horizontal wells are perceived to have several advantages over conventional
deep well drilling. They enable drillers to approach a reservoir from a
fresh direction and, usually, achieve higher recovery rates than by
traditional means. Although horizontal drilling is more expensive, a
successful well can pay for itself many times over. Several wells in the
North Sea are now being drilled horizontally, such as the Hyde, Forth,
Captain and Anglia fields. 'They're more costly, but you can achieve more,'
said Alan Miller, BP's drilling superintendent for the southern North Sea
region.
BP has ambitious horizontal drilling plans for its Wytch Farm field in Poole
Harbour, Dorset. Rather than place a drilling rig offshore, BP will reaching
out to the underwater field from an onshore site. This will not only be
cheaper than building an artificial island but also, the company likes to
point out, more environmentally friendly.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Member control of pensions is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS would be prevented from using pension fund surpluses for their own
purposes under pensions law proposals being urged by the Institute for
Policy Research, the left-of-centre think tank. It also proposes giving
control over funds to beneficiaries.
The report addresses the most sensitive question being considered by
legislators considering pensions law: whether a pension fund surplus is the
property of the employer or of the scheme's members.
A report by the cross-party Commons social security committee recommended
reform of pension law but declined to examine the question, saying it needed
further study.
The institute report rejects employers' arguments that liability to make
good any deficit entitles them to recoup surpluses. That, the report
concludes, is a 'post-hoc rationalisation of the employer's understandable
wish to control the fund'.
Although employers are correct in theory, the report notes that most scheme
rules give employers the right to cease their contributions at any time,
regardless of the financial state of the pension fund. Provisions in the
1990 Social Security Act will require employers to make good deficiencies
when a pension fund is wound up, but have not yet taken effect.
Even those, the report says, may be ineffective because a financially
troubled employer may simply stop contributing and not wind the fund up
until the options run out - upon bankruptcy. If that happens, there is no
hope of obtaining overdue contributions from the employer.
The report suggests that in return for surrendering their right to use
surpluses built up in pension funds, employers' contributions should be
defined and limited. Employer and employee contributions should be a
contractually binding matter to be renegotiated periodically. Contributions
levels in the event of a surplus or deficit would be spelled out in the
contract.
Meanwhile, making up shortfalls would be a matter to be negotiated between
employers and beneficiaries, by increased contributions from both or
reductions in benefits paid.
The report also dismisses arguments from industry that preventing employers
from securing pension fund surpluses will discourage them from offering
defined benefit schemes.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Scottish recovery remote, study finds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND is escaping the worst effects of the recession, but there is
unlikely to be any real sign of recovery in the Scottish economy in the
first half of this year and very little growth in the year as a whole.
The Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Scotland's main
economic study organisation, which made the forecast in its latest quarterly
bulletin, points out that in January the rate of unemployment north of the
border was indistinguishable from the UK average. That has not happened for
more than a generation.
Whereas unemployment in the UK rose by 62 per cent between March 1990 and
last January, and that in the south-east of England by 128 per cent,
unemployment in Scotland rose by only 13 per cent.
The institute points out that Scotland has been affected much less than
southern Britain by high interest rates, partly because Scots have a lower
level of home ownership and borrowed less in mortgages. Between 1980 and
1989 the ratio of mortgage advances to incomes rose by 19 per cent in
Scotland, compared with a rise of 41 per cent in southern England.
The forecast says the advantages that have protected Scotland from the worst
of recession will unwind as recovery gets under way.

<TEXT>
THE University of Wales has set up a 10-man committee under Sir Melvin
Rosser, a retired chartered accountant, to look at its future structure. The
move follows sharp disagreement over the shape of the university in the wake
of government funding changes.
Proposals by Sir John Meurig Thomas, deputy pro-chancellor, to sharpen the
university's federal structure were attacked by the heads of several
colleges amid accusations that Sir John was seeking to establish a tighter
central bureaucracy.
Sir John said last year that flaws existed in the way the university
operated. 'We now have a wonderful opportunity to take a federal university,
which is not really functioning as one, in a proper federal direction.'
That produced an outcry from the heads of the colleges and it was decided to
refer the matter of reorganisation and the relationship of the university to
other higher education institutes to a committee.

FULL TIME Communications, a new company, is planning to set up a
24-hour-a-day satellite television channel dedicated to football. It would
kick off at the start of the 1993-94 season.
It is believed to be the first single-sport subscription television channel
in the world.
The company is offering the English football authorities Pounds 50m a year
for 10 years for the right to broadcast all cup and league games.
The channel would show a mixture of live and recorded games in their
entirety and charge a subscription of about Pounds 10 a month.
Mr Gerald O'Connell, a director of Full Time who also set up Clubcall - the
telephone information service for football clubs - said yesterday that
negotiations with the football authorities were advanced.
Full Time would want some live matches on an exclusive basis, Mr O'Connell
said, but the deal would not preclude the new Premier League, the Football
League or the Football Association dealing with ITV or the BBC.

Bethan Hutton writes.
Two are standing in Conservative-Lib Dem marginals where a few hundred votes

Fife North East, where Mr Menzies Campbell faces Tory determination to win

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLENDA JACKSON, the Oscar-winning election candidate for whom the Hampstead
and Highgate seat would be an even classier prize, must imagine she is
heading for Westminster purely on the strength of local concern about the
health service.
If this week's constituency public meeting on the issue - a steamy blend of
slanted statistics and personal abuse - was any guide, fears for the future
of the NHS will hand Hampstead to Ms Jackson.
The north London seat, Conservative-held by just 2,221 votes, has hardly
clasped the government's health reforms to its bosom. There are no
fund-holding general practitioners in the borough, and residents voted
overwhelmingly against their local general hospital taking trust status. The
government's decision to overturn the result has not won many friends.
Ms Jackson scored a fairly easy victory over her principal opponent, Mr
Oliver Letwin, the Rothschilds banker who carries a Thatcherite banner and
is an unabashed proponent of the reforms.
The 'scandals' of the poll tax, poverty and the waste of female skills were
delivered with a passion which this election has failed to provoke.
NHS underfunding was identified by Ms Jackson but not quantified. The
Tories' 'bottomless pit' which could never be filled with enough cash was
exposed as a Tory plot to privatise. Labour, she said, would revive the NHS,
although it could not 'turn this pumpkin of a country into a golden coach
overnight'.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Pierced by disenchanted Democrats: Front-runner Clinton
still dogged tenaciously by Jerry Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST important message out of the Connecticut primary on Tuesday is an
old one: Americans are fed up, disenchanted, underwhelmed, unimpressed, both
with the state of their lives and with the choices offered to them by this
year's crop of politicians.
Thus the Democratic voters of the nutmeg state marginally preferred a man
who has almost no chance of becoming president over one generally conceded
at least to be in there with a shout.
No matter what gloss his spin doctors put on Connecticut - and there is
plenty that can be imparted - Bill Clinton, the governor of Arkansas, lost
most by succumbing to Jerry Brown, ex-governor of California, in
Connecticut. The burgeoning aura of invincibility about his candidacy has
been thoroughly punctured, before much larger audiences in rough-and-tumble
New York and frequently fickle Wisconsin can pass judgment two weeks hence.
The ruthlessness of Mr Brown's campaign against Mr Clinton, focusing heavily
on questions over the front-runner's character, paid dividends. Nearly half
Connecticut's Democrats, the highest percentage in a primary so far, said
they did not trust Mr Clinton, who has argued that, the more voters get to
know him, the less these doubts matter.
There were particular factors in Connecticut. Mr Paul Tsongas from
neighbouring Massachusetts, though he pulled out of the race last week,
scored 20 per cent of the vote. Had he stayed in, according to exit polls,
he would have won. His disappointed supporters seem to have taken it out on
Mr Clinton.
The Clinton camp also makes the point that little scrutiny has been devoted
to what Mr Brown is actually proposing, but a lot to what and whom he is
condemning. So it promises to take him and his sketchy policies head on, in
New York and Wisconsin, rather than begin to lift its sights to the ultimate
battle with President George Bush.
This will not be easy. New York is a political minefield, replete with the
sort of religious, ethnic and social divisions and underclasses that Mr
Brown is adept at exploiting. Mr Clinton's relationship with Governor Mario
Cuomo of New York also leaves a lot to be desired.
Already the New York media, particularly the tabloid press, have the knives
out for Mr Clinton and his wife, considering him some out-of-town hick
unworthy of the big league.
Mr Brown is in his element as leader of 'us' against 'them', which he
portrays as a shady, corrupt political hierarchy that thinks it knows best.
He is beginning successfully to paint Mr Clinton as the candidate of that
establishment.
What Mr Clinton probably has to do is to drive home to Democrats that Mr
Brown simply cannot win in November. He might use in evidence, for example,
an excellent new book by two professorial brothers, Earl Black of the
University of South Carolina, and Merle Black, from Emory University in
Georgia. They point out that, in five out of the six post-Great Society
campaigns, the Democratic candidate has done so poorly in the south that
unattainable majorities of between three-fifths and two-thirds in the north
were needed to win the presidency.
The exception was 1976, when the candidate, Jimmy Carter, was a southerner,
as is Mr Clinton. The Super Tuesday primaries in the south this month showed
no regional interest in Mr Brown.
This argument undoubtedly appeals to party leaders, who may now rally round
Mr Clinton more publicly than they have so far or, more privately, begin to
contemplate alternatives. But New York and Wisconsin are certainly not
southern and are capable of thumbing their noses at the party establishment.
These are, therefore, tricky times for Bill Clinton. One very prominent
Washington Democrat described him this week as a man with six javelins
already embedded in his flesh. The seventh might kill him, he said, or prove
he has developed an immune system.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US DURABLE goods orders fell slightly last month, offering a warning that a
full recovery may not yet be under way.
New orders for durable goods dropped by 0.1 per cent in February to Dollars
120.5bn, after two months when they had shown strong increases, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
Private sector economists had expected the increases to continue with a
1.6-1.8 per cent rise in February, but did not view the decline in the often
volatile durable goods figures as evidence that the incipient recovery had
halted.
Excluding the defence industry, new orders rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.3
per cent to Dollars 114.2bn, while shipments of durable goods in February
climbed by 2.6 per cent to Dollars 116.2bn.
Evidence of that a recovery might be under way came when the National
Association of Realtors announced that sales of existing single-family homes
had risen by 9.3 per cent in February.

FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Peru tightens up on import cheats -
Efforts to cut corruption and inefficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERU has turned to four European companies to spearhead a drive to improve
foreign trade efficiency and increase revenue from customs duties. The new
import-supervision scheme aims to end the widespread practice of
undervaluing goods to avoid duties.
A new law requires importers bringing in consignments worth more than
Dollars 5,000 to arrange pre-shipment inspection and certification.
The Geneva-based Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), with nearly 30
years' experience in Peru, expects to capture much of the new supervision
business. The three other companies to win authorisation from Sunad, the
Peruvian customs authority, are Specialist Services International (SSI) of
Britain, Cotecna of Switzerland and Bureau Veritas of France.
The costs of the new system - a maximum of 1 per cent of fob (free on board)
value, and 0.5 per cent for commodities - are borne by the importer. While
this is lower than the 1.2-to-1.8 per cent normally charged on higher-volume
operations in other countries, Peruvian importers are grumbling. 'But,' says
Mr Ricardo Tirado of SGS, 'they'll soon realise that we can be more of a
help than a hindrance.'
Although about 85 per cent of SGS business worldwide is with the private
sector and international organisations (they supervise, for example,
virtually all food aid to Peru), the company has around the world about 25
contracts similar to Peru's. Their Peruvian operation employs more than 200
people, but only in a co-ordination capacity. All physical supervision is
carried out at point of origin, either at factory or port.
SGS's reputation in Peru grew between 1987 and 1989, when the government
contracted them to combat capital flight. Local businesses, blocked from
remitting profits legally, regularly over-valued both imports and exports,
taking advantage of a complex differential exchange rate system.
Poor co-ordination between the authorities in such a complex system
encouraged illegal double invoicing - one copy for the central bank and
another, much lower, for customs purposes. The SGS payroll for the period
swelled to almost 800, and the company says its supervision saved Peru
Dollars 200m in two years.
In newly liberalised Peru, the focus of the problem has shifted. Anyone may
now import anything, profits can be freely remitted and foreign exchange is
readily available. The central bank is no longer a significant participant
in capital inflow and outflow.
However, evasion of duties and taxes is widespread. While almost 90 per cent
of imports entering Peru pay only 15 per cent, the fob invoice triggers a
cascade of other internal taxes, making under-invoicing attractive. And with
a fiscal deficit which could reach 4 per cent of GDP this year, the
government is seeking to close as many loopholes as possible.
Customs duties bring in around Dollars 90m a month on legally declared
imports of around Dollars 3bn, but officials believe the real imports total
could be above Dollars 5bn. Spot checks have revealed merchandise is often
declared at only a third of its real value.
'We can't really tell what has been going on for the past couple of years,'
says Mr Tirado. 'But we've heard plenty of hair-raising gossip about some
particularly scandalous cases.' Officials believe that underpaid customs
officers and profiteering customs agents have made a lucrative living from
turning a blind eye to sharp practice.
SGS points to Indonesian experience, where supervision dramatically cut
disembarcation time, pushed-up customs revenue and ultimately saved
importers around a fifth in costs.

<TEXT>
THE prospect of failure to negotiate a new multilateral code for the steel
trade by the March 31 deadline is causing concern in Brussels, which fears a
rash of US anti-subsidy complaints against EC imports after that date.
In autumn 1989, the US and the EC undertook to phase out so-called
'voluntary restraints' on steel imports by March 31 this year, provided a
code under the Gatt could be worked out to prevent subsidies distorting
trade in steel.
There is now no hope of getting such international discipline agreed in
Geneva by next Tuesday.
The Community hopes for political agreement to prolong talks on the steel
code, but is fearful of pressure by US steel companies on the Bush
administration in this US election year to maintain some form of protection.
The EC is a net exporter of steel to the US, with 7 per cent of the US
market.
After the US 'voluntary restraints' or quotas on EC steel expire next week,
Brussels fears US steel-makers may ask Washington to impose countervailing
or anti-dumping duties on EC imports.

FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Poland fails to take up loans
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND has made minimal use of Dollars 8.1bn (Pounds 4.68bn) of western
government-guaranteed credit lines promised since the autumn of 1989,
according to a government report. This includes loans from the World Bank
and other international financial institutions.
The report by the Central Planning Office (CUP) says that, as of last
January, concrete agreements had been signed with Poland for loans of
Dollars 5.4bn. At the same time, Polish banks acting as a conduit for the
funds had actually agreed to lend Dollars 1.7bn. However the actual sum used
by Polish lenders in the last two years is Dollars 524.2m including a
Dollars 300m World Bank structural adjustment which went to strengthen
foreign currency reserves.
The CUP report blames Poland's recession for the failure to take up credits
as well as high domestic interest rates which have increased local
investment costs. Polish banks, CUP says, are ill-equipped to handle loans
and are unwilling to take lending risks.
In addition, CUP points out that strings attached to loans by western
governments make it difficult to find borrowers who fulfil the right
requirements. The World Bank, which is committed to provide Dollars 2.2bn in
12 projects, has seen some Dollars 400m used. This performance is 'average'
in the World Bank's experience given that half of the value of the loans was
agreed only recently.
Western governments have signed actual agreements with Poland to provide
credits worth Dollars 3.7bn of the Dollars 5.5bn promised. However a mere
Dollars 109.8m has actually spent on imports by Polish companies. Austria
for example has offered to provide Dollars 435m of which a mere Dollars 23m
has been committed in the form of guarantees for Austrian hotel construction
projects. Germany, another major Polish trade partner, has seen Dollars
28.1m of the Dollars 1.6bn offered in trade credits actually used.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday unveiled detailed plans to increase the
number of its round trip flights in Europe by 25 per cent this summer and to
expand its fleet of aircraft, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
KLM has previously outlined in general terms a three-year expansion plan
that the Dutch air carrier hopes will eventually win it 15 to 20 per cent of
the European market.
KLM said that it will increase the number of its European round trip flights
to 1,000 per week from the current level of 800. The Dutch flag carrier also
said it would revamp its schedule at Amsterdam's Schipol airport to make its
home base act increasingly as a hub airport.
To accommodate the expanded European schedule, KLM said it would deploy
three new Boeing 737-400s of which the airline has taken delivery since the
summer of 1991.
In addition, KLM will lease a total of six Fokker F-100s from Air Littoral
of France by the end of the year. As part of the lease agreement, Air
Littoral will also supply cockpit and cabin crews, and these aircraft will
be used to serve French-speaking destinations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITROEN has shelved plans for a Rand 200m (Pounds 40m) car plant in Namibia
after failing to agree with the government the amount of components it must
buy locally. The setback, four years after feasibility studies started,
reflects a perennial problem in negotiating terms for car production in
third world countries, said the French car maker, part of the Peugeot group.
Namibia is part of the Southern African Customs Union (Sacu), which sets
strict rules on local content. At least 75 per cent of components must
originate from Sacu, which embraces South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho
and Swaziland. Citroen says this is too high and that it needs the freedom
to import more components.
Mr Anton Von Wietersheim, Namibia's trade and industry minister, said South
Africa's 110 per cent import duty on cars also weighed on Citroen's
decision. 'The influence of Sacu on industrialisation in smaller countries
is a negative one because many of the regulations are protective of the
South African existing industries,' he said.
Citroen is still in contact with the Namibian government. This was not the
first time the group had encountered a developing country which had an
unrealistic idea of its capacity to supply a western car company, said an
official.
Local content formed a central part of separate talks with the Chinese
government on a car assembly plant in central China, where Citroen is due to
sigh a final agreement shortly.
To increase the level of local content there, 26 mainly French components
suppliers have agreed to set up joint ventures with local partners.
This strategy, however, appears less appropriate in Namibia, where Citroen
has focused its negotiations on trying to reduce the level of local content
required.

FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Dismay at US stance in Gatt talks on
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE threat by the United States to withdraw large chunks of its services
sector from multilateral fair trade rules met an angry response yesterday
from trading partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
The European Community said on Monday the US move set back the chances of
reaching agreement on liberalising trade in services in the Uruguay Round of
global trade talks and would make it more difficult for the EC to compromise
on farm subsidies, still the central issue blocking completion of the Round.
At yesterday's meeting to review progress in the detailed country-by-country
negotiations on liberalising services, other nations joined the EC in
expressing dismay at the US position.
The US says it will refuse to guarantee access to maritime transport, civil
aviation, financial services and basic telecommunications on a
'most-favoured-nation' basis - equal treatment for all trading partners -
unless other countries come up with better offers to open their services
markets to foreign suppliers.
Defending Washington's stand, Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said
the US wanted a successful services agreement but that market-opening offers
by trading partners were not sufficient to ensure a balanced accord. The US
argues that the US services market is basically an open one, so that
guaranteeing MFN treatment to trading partners will freeze its market open
and those of other countries shut.
However, Mr Yerxa made it clear that the exemptions the US is seeking for
maritime transport and civil aviation were not negotiable. Sweden was among
those countries which said that if shipping was not to be part of the
services liberalisation accord it would have to review its own offer.
Shipping is also a key area for Japan, and for EC members such as Greece.
Trade officials fear the US tactics may backfire, leading to a withdrawal of
market-opening offers already made rather than making countries more
forthcoming. The mood yesterday was pessimistic. Little progress has
apparently been made in recent days in bilateral talks, with both the US
threat on services and the continued impasse between the US and the EC over
farm subsidies holding back final concessions.
The next stock-take on services has been fixed for April 3. Gatt members
have set an Easter deadline for finishing the Round as a whole.
Mr Yerxa denied that the US than other countries in its services proposals.
The EC has said it too might need to take MFN derogations if other
countries' offers were not improved. Of 21 Gatt members presenting MFN
exemption lists, ll included exemptions for financial services, 14 for
maritime transport, 10 for audio-visual services and 5 for
telecommunications.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Roh Tae Woo of South Korea is likely to reshuffle his cabinet and
the leadership of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) following the
government's narrow defeat in Tuesday's National Assembly elections.
Mr Roh said the DLP's poor electoral performance was because of the
'intra-party conflict' that has plagued the party since it was merged with
two opposition groups in 1990. The party needed 'a rebirth', Mr Roh said.
The DLP lost control of the 299-member National Assembly by one seat, with
149 representatives elected. It is now negotiating with some of the 21
independents, who include supporters of former President Chun Doo Hwan, to
obtain a majority.
The Democratic Party, the main opposition group that is to the left of the
DLP, increased its representation by 50 per cent to 97 seats based on a
strong showing in the key Seoul region, where it captured 25 seats to the
DLP's 16. Several of the newly elected Democrat members were leaders of the
student movement that pushed the country toward democratic reforms in 1987.
The new conservative party, the Unification National Party (UNP),
established by founder of the Korean conglomerate Hyundai, made an
impressive debut with 31 seats, giving it a pivotal role in the new
Assembly.
Some analysts saw signs of polarisation in the election result with the
Democrats gaining on the left and the UNP and independent candidates on the
right at the expense of the DLP, which has increasingly sought to occupy a
moderate position in the political spectrum.
The DLP received 38.5 per cent of vote, the Democrats 29.2 per cent and the
UNP 17.3 per cent. The turnout at 71.9 per cent was among the lowest for the
country.

<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINE government projects gross national product this year to grow
2.5-3 per cent, following zero growth last year.
Mr Cayetano Paderanga, economic planning secretary, yesterday briefed the
policy-making National Economic and Development Authority, headed by
President Corazon Aquino, on 'signs the country is on its way to recovery'.
Mr Paderanga said growth in the domestic economy in the last quarter of 1991
'turned slightly positive', against a 3.1 per cent third-quarter fall.
Higher growth had come from increased public building activities, higher
export receipts, and heavy industrial re-stocking.
Independent economists also expect increased spending in the first half of
this year to fuel a consumer-led buoyancy. This could be bolstered by a rise
in private-sector investments in the second half, especially with the
lifting after June 30 of the 5 per cent import levy. But Mr Paderanga
cautioned against complacency, citing the need for government to continue
stabilisation measures by carrying on with its strict fiscal and monetary
policies.
He also urged continuation of structural reforms in the economy. These
include: completion of import liberalisation; privatisation and
deregulation; broadening of the tax base and increased tax-collection
efficiency; financial-sector reforms, and continued liberalisation of the
foreign-exchange market.
Moslem gunmen freed two Americans and two Australians from eight days'
captivity in the southern Philippines, a spokesman for a Moslem rebel group
involved in negotiations with the kidnappers said, Reuter reports from
Manila.
Sharif Zain Jali, spokesman for the insurgent Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), said by phone from the southern city of Zamboanga the four captives
were unharmed and no ransom was paid for their release.
Australian and US embassy officials in Manila said they were checking the
report but had not been able to confirm it.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Atomic agency orders Iraq to destroy N-site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has ordered Iraq to start
destroying facilities at the al-Atheer site south of Baghdad, a complex
which the agency says is central to Iraq's efforts to develop a nuclear
weapon.
An IAEA-led team of United Nations inspectors will arrive in Baghdad on
April 5 to supervise the dismantling, which will be among the biggest
demolition jobs undertaken by UN teams overseeing Iraq's compliance with
Gulf war ceasefire resolutions.
Mr Maurizio Zifferero, who is leading the IAEA and UN nuclear inspection
efforts in Iraq, said by telephone yesterday that 12 or more buildings and
their contents will have to be destroyed of what he called 'the most
important component in its development of an enriched uranium weapon'.
The ordered destruction will be the most important test of Iraq's declared
willingness to co-operate more fully with the UN after the dressing down
received before the Security Council earlier this month by an Iraqi
delegation led by Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister.
The order follows four days of talks between the IAEA and Iraqi experts in
Vienna during which officials from the complex and the Iraqi Atomic Energy
Commission tried to persuade the agency that the al-Atheer site was used for
civil purposes.
But yesterday the agency issued a statement saying that it remains convinced
that al-Atheer was 'designed for special processes needed for nuclear
weapons development and manufacturing' and that its destruction should begin
in April.
Mr Zifferero said that despite the Iraqi officials' resistance to destroying
al-Atheer, there were nevertheless signs of greater willingness to
co-operate with the UN since Mr Aziz's appearance in New York.
He also said that although the UN inspectors may still discover 'some
surprises' in Iraq's nuclear weapons programme, he was confident that the
largest part of Baghdad's covert nuclear programme had been identified.
An Iraqi delegation will open talks with UN officials in Vienna tomorrow on
the possible limited resumption of oil sales to help meet Iraq's
humanitarian needs, pay for UN weapons inspectors in Iraq and offer some
compensation for victims of the invasion of Kuwait.
Iraq last year rejected a UN mechanism to permit the sale of Dollars 1.6bn
(Pounds 920m) worth of oil for these purposes on the ground that it violated
the country's sovereignty.
Most observers suggest that the latest round of talks are unlikely to
provide any swift agreement by Iraq to resume oil sales. Iraqi officials
have been quoted in recent days as saying they will not accept any mechanism
which in its view interferes with its internal affairs.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Asylum-seekers find refuge from the lunatic fringe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE NIGHT last year a half-drunk teenager on the way back from a disco in
the centre of Karlsruhe lobbed a makeshift petrol bomb over the fence. It
set fire to the window-frame of one of the dormitories, and then went out.
According to Karl Heinz Sieb, the burly, friendly deputy-director of
Baden-Wurttemberg's central reception centre for asylum-seekers, this is the
only disturbance the centre has had since it was built in 1990.
Otherwise, Baden-Wurttemberg's Zentralanlaufstelle fur Asylbewerbe - ZAST
for short - is a haven of tranquillity, with beds for 850, tidy courtyards,
volley-ball pitch and table-tennis.
The well-behaved and well-looked-after residents stand around, hands in
pockets, clearly nonplussed at what for many is their first experience of
European civilisation.
Between 250-300 asylum-seekers arrive here every working day of the week.
Although Romania and Yugoslavia account for nearly half the applicants,
others come from further afield, from China, Turkey, Afghanistan, India,
Nigeria, Sri Lanka.
They are given new clothes, food, medical attention. They sleep on clean
sheets in scrubbed, warm dormitories.
They stay here for an average of three or four nights while their initial
applications for asylum are processed.
Then they are shipped out to the villages and towns of Baden-Wurttemberg,
where they are billetted at the municipalities' expense until their
applications are fully processed. This can take months, if not years.
'All they have to do is say the word 'asylum' and the whole process is
underway,' says Mr Sieb. In the event most applications are rejected - only
6.9 per cent of the 256,112 applicants were granted asylum last year - but
the process is slow.
Mr Sieb is proud of the efficiency with which the centre deals with the
initial applications, but his success in processing asylum-seekers causes
problems for the rest of Baden-Wurttemberg. Every town with more than 1,000
inhabitants is obliged by law to find accommodation on the basis of 9.25
beds for every 1,000 inhabitants.
The rest of Baden-Wurttemberg is not always as welcoming as Karlsruhe: in
early January skinheads threw firebombs at a hostel housing 40 refugees at
Waldkirch in Breisgau, near Freiburg. This time they did more than set a
window-frame alight.
Both doors to the hostel were on fire by the time the fire-brigade arrived
and the residents had retreated to the third floor to escape the smoke. More
than half of them ended up in hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, and
one nearly died.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Germany seeks to speed up G7 aid to Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and REUTER

   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is hoping to reach agreement on a comprehensive economic aid
programme for Russia before the world economic summit of the Group of Seven
(G7) industrialised states in July.
The package would follow Russian membership of the International Monetary
Fund, which German officials hope will be agreed in April. It would include
co-ordinated technical assistance, in addition to immediate humanitarian
aid, and almost certainly a rouble stabilisation fund.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is chairing the economic summit in Munich, has
spelt out three areas where western aid should be concentrated, apart from
the stabilisation fund: on agriculture, infrastructure, and nuclear safety.
He wants to invite Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to attend the
meeting, but not in order to bargain over the shape and form of an aid
package, German officials say. That should be finalised in advance.
'We don't want Munich to be an occasion to fix how much money will be
given,' a senior finance official said. 'It would be wrong to think if
Yeltsin comes it is to get more money."
As far as Russia is concerned, the plan is for IMF membership to be agreed
as quickly as possible, which depends on final agreement on the Russian
quota, or share of the IMF capital, which in turn determines how much it can
borrow. That question the German government sees as primarily political, not
economic.
'We must be conscious that the Russian parliament might say to Yeltsin: 'Too
low a quota means you are selling yourself to the IMF and getting nothing
back.' The West might want the quota as small as possible, but if that means
Yeltsin has the (IMF-backed) programme rejected in parliament, it would be
self-defeating,' the finance official said.
At the moment, the Russian quota is expected to be fixed at something more
than 3 per cent, up from the 2.5 per cent first mooted.
Progress with Ukraine, the second largest ex-Soviet republic, has been much
slower, although the government in Kiev now appears ready to sign the
western-backed memorandum of understanding on debt-servicing. 'The Ukraine
is a bit crazy,' one official in Bonn said. 'They are only thinking of
political liberation from Moscow, and they are prepared to let their economy
suffer to get it.'
The German intention, as co-ordinator of the G7, is to finalise the overall
plan in the first half of the year. Another element will be an attempt to
co-ordinate technical assistance, to avoid competition between the western
countries. 'We cannot send a new adviser every day,' the senior official
said. 'We must ensure that they strengthen their own decision-making
capacity. And we must avoid national competition.'
The former Soviet Union is likely to be given another breather on the
repayment of billions of dollars of principal on its western commercial bank
debt, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Sources on the advisory committee
dealing with the bank debt of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
said a meeting in Frankfurt today would agree on a second 90-day extension
beyond its original repayment date, known in banking as a roll-over.
'Another deferral makes sense ..probably for three months until the end of
the second (1992) quarter,' said a senior banker.

A guidebook to help European public sector procurement officials cope with
the maze of standards and specifications for 'open systems' computer and
telecommunications equipment will be launched by the European Commission in
Brussels today, writes Paul Taylor.
'Open systems' are designed to work easily with similar systems made by
other manufacturers, unlike proprietary systems which are difficult to link.
EC member states spend more than Ecu600bn (Pounds 430bn) a year on public
procurement, and a growing proportion of that is on information technology.
The move towards open systems within the EC is intended to complement the
emergence of the single market which increasingly requires such systems for
the free movement of computerised information.

The Italian public-sector deficit could reach L160,000bn (Pounds 74.4bn)
this year instead of the L128,000bn targeted in the 1992 budget, Robert
Graham reports from Rome.
This was confirmed yesterday by Mr Guido Carli, treasury minister, in the
concluding remarks of the treasury's accounts for 1991. Ministers in the
outgoing Christian Democrat-led government of Mr Giulio Andreotti see the
need for an early mini-budget to correct Italy's deteriorating public
finances. But the timing is complicated by the April 5 general elections and
expected delays in forming a new coalition.
The blame for the increased deficit is being put on a mix of higher spending
and lower fiscal receipts.
Higher spending largely reflects the extra cost of servicing Italy's
L1,450,000bn debt as a result of higher interest rates.

FT  26 MAR 92 / CSCE breaks Karabakh deadlock: The decision by
representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia and the disputed enclave to begin
talks

EFFORTS to resolve the conflict over the trans-caucasian enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh gathered momentum yesterday when the three parties to the
dispute agreed to hold direct talks.
The talks would be separate from the 10-nation peace conference in Minsk,
the Belarus capital, which was set up on Tuesday by the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
Mr Raffi Hovannisian, Armenian foreign minister, announced the trilateral
meeting between Armenia, Azerbaijan and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh,
which is inhabited mainly by Armenian Christians but administered by
Azerbaijan. He had earlier held talks in the margin of the CSCE ministerial
conference with Mr Hikmet Cetin, his Turkish opposite number - the first
Turkish-Armenian meeting at this level since Armenia declared independence
from the Soviet Union. Mr Hovannisian said Armenians had also been in touch
with Azerbaijan at the highest level, through Mr James Baker, US secretary
of state, and the Turkish foreign minister.
Mr Hovannisian said the place and date of the trilateral meeting remained to
be decided, but he hoped it would take place in Nagorno-Karabakh. It would
be held 'in parallel' with the wider CSCE meeting.
The talks would address a ceasefire, the lifting of the Azerbaijani economic
blockade on Armenia, and the return of weapons which have been taken by
combatants from the former Soviet army.
Mr Hovannisian stressed that no CSCE talks could be successful unless
representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh were allowed to participate in their own
right. Under a compromise reached by CSCE ministers on Tuesday,
representatives of the enclave will be invited to the conference as
'interested parties' by the chairman of the talks, after consultation with
the participating states.
Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister and current chairman
of the CSCE, told the ministerial meeting he would go to Nagorno-Karabakh
next Monday to prepare the 10-nation peace conference. 'I expect that the
ceasefire mediated through Iranian efforts, which are appreciated, will be
extended,' he said.
Mr Dienstbier attacked CSCE member states who he said had spent more than
two years exchanging assurances about the collapse of totalitarianism and
the progress of democracy, while failing to react adequately to dangerous
developments.
The future of the European Community, Nato, the Western European Union and
the CSCE itself was secure only to the extent that they were able to deal
with the fundamental changes that had occurred in Europe and elsewhere, he
said.
The rights of national minorities in an increasingly fragmented Europe
emerged as one of the main themes of the Helsinki follow-up conference.
Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, strongly supported by his
German colleague, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, proposed the appointment of a
CSCE High Commissioner for Minorities, whose task would be to provide early
warning and early action to prevent 'simmering conflicts which have not yet
come to an explosion'.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Brittan outlines bank charge plan: EC cross-border transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EC CONSUMERS could save more than Ecu1bn (Pounds 710m) annually in bank
charges, if banks and building societies follow European Commission
guidelines aimed at making it easier and cheaper to transfer cash across
borders.
Sir Leon Brittan, the financial services and competition commissioner,
yesterday unveiled the Commission's programme for improving cross-border
payment systems in time for the launch of the single European market in
1993.
'It's a cumulative approach, not a big bang approach,' he explained, urging
banks, users and public authorities to work towards a cheap, quick and
reliable system. An independent study will be commissioned at the end of
this year to assess progress. If it is still dissatisfied, the Commission
may then press for formal legislation to improve the system.
The paper includes a five-point users' charter calling for banks to provide
clear and consistent information to the customer on transfer methods and
costs.
According to the Commission, private and commercial users should be able to
complain to national ombudsmen if they experience problems. At the moment
there are some 200m cross-border retail payments annually, costing on
average about 20 times more than the same domestic transfer.
Brussels aims to encourage electronic links between national clearing houses
 -which handle domestic money transfers.
David Barchard adds: APACS, the UK organisation which handles payments and
clearing, yesterday welcomed the proposals.
UK banks are relieved that Sir Leon and the Commission have not tried to
impose a framework on the market at this stage.
Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, which represents French banks belonging to
the Eurocheque system, said it would appeal to the EC's lower court against
a Ecu5m (Pounds 3.57m) fine imposed by the European Commission, writes
Andrew Hill. Brussels has accused the banks of striking an anti-competitive
deal with Eurocheque, the cheque guarantee organisation, to charge French
retailers every time they accepted a Eurocheque. Eurocheque was fined Ecu1m.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Yeltsin faces pressure to step down as premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL pressure is mounting in Moscow to remove Mr Boris Yeltsin as prime
minister and install an administration less committed to radical economic
reform.
Mr Yeltsin, who is both president and prime minister, remains the most
popular Russian politician in the polls, but has been identified with his
government's severe economic reforms and made vulnerable to parliamentary
attack.
The first strong signs of the political offensive against Mr Yeltsin emerged
this week. A meeting on Tuesday of the Constitutional Commission, which is
working on the draft constitution, cut the parliamentary votes needed to
remove a prime minister from two-thirds to a bare majority and deleted Mr
Yeltsin's right to appoint regional governors.
While Mr Yeltsin may be able to restore the clauses he has lost, the victory
of the anti-government forces shows the rising tide of discontent.
The opposition is concentrated among disaffected deputies who are unhappy
with Mr Yeltsin's concentration of powers.
Earlier this month, Mr Yeltsin added the post of defence minister to his
portfolios. Under his presidency, Russia has assumed most of the powers of
the former Soviet Union. In October last year he also won the right in
parliament to legislate by decree - a right deputies now regret.
Mr Yeltsin admitted yesterday that the government would fall if he were
replaced as prime minister, because it is sustained by his own popularity.
No one will challenge him as president, but many Russian deputies feel he
should go as premier.
Many observers believe he will have to sacrifice Mr Genady Burbulis, the
unpopular first deputy prime minister - who received a 0.8 per cent approval
rating in a public opinion poll yesterday - but he may be able to defend Mr
Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform.
A senior western diplomat said yesterday: 'Gaidar is very important for the
IMF right now, and Yeltsin knows how important the IMF is to him.' That
said, Mr Gaidar was accused by former presidential advisers on Tuesday of
being a tool in the hands of the Fund.
The opposition, focused on the figures of Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the
vice-president, and more particularly Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary chairman, pits the powers of parliament against those of the
government when the constitution does not clearly define either.
For example, Mr Khasbulatov has 'settled' the threatened airline pilots'
strike by promising to pay them everything they want, though there seems to
have been no liaison between him and the government, which will have to pay
the costs of the settlement.
Mr Gaidar is defending himself strongly, and has banned all talk of
resignation among his team.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Reviving Argentina's entrepreneurial spirit:  A dearth of
energetic venture capitalists after decades of stifling over-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO WORK, capitalism needs capitalists. But in Argentina, struggling to
establish a market economy, the entrepreneurial spirit burns low.
In less than three years, President Carlos Menem has reversed the
protectionism, statism and over-regulation that strangled Argentina for six
decades. After slashing the public sector and establishing the rudiments of
a free market, the 'new Argentina' that he and energetic economy minister
Domingo Cavallo want to build will increasingly depend on its capitalists.
While companies are not happy about facing foreign competition and losing
government support, Mr Cavallo has given them a juicy carrot -
privatisations. They are buying up the assets they helped build as
government contractors.
Techint, a big family-owned industrial group active in privatisations, has
been forced to practically split in two. 'The old guard will handle
traditional business in the traditional way. New business will be handled by
younger people not contaminated by the old way,' says a Techint executive.
All companies are grappling with similar changes, but not all will be
successful. Describing Perez Companc , a big family-held diversified
company, equity analyst Christopher Ecclestone, said: 'Perez Companc is a
mess. The unwinding of the tangled structure to release value is 10 years
away if it will ever happen.' A senior international banker added: 'I don't
think that more than half Argentina's big companies will be around in a few
years' time.'
Nearly all Argentina's companies are family-held. To grow, they must raise
equity capital - long term loans hardly exist - and infuse management with
new blood. But often this is strongly resisted, because owners fear losing
control and becoming accountable to outsiders.
Furthermore, Mr Eduardo Sguiglia, a sociologist who has studied Argentina's
biggest companies, says few owners show great innovative zest.
Like many others, he is worried that the free market environment is allowing
a few big companies to become too powerful. He criticises the government for
not enforcing anti-trust legislation. Mr Cavallo says Argentina needs strong
groups to survive in international markets. He is relying on imports and
utility regulators to check their power. But Argentine bureaucrats have
shown themselves notoriously inefficient and prone to corruption, and not
all companies are in businesses subject to international competition.
For the time being, companies are keeping busy with privatisations. The
government is selling all its enterprises, utilities and railways this year,
and every company that can is making bids with foreign investors.
But the most dramatic change could come from smaller, more responsive
companies that have already restructured. One such company is SICA, a small
family-owned electrical goods company. It has tripled its investment budget
to Dollars 1.5m in three years as sales have boomed. However, its
vice-president, Mr Cesar Wengrower, complains that 'we need capital to grow,
but there are no long-term loans'.
Wealth is heavily concentrated. Mr Ecclestone says 'the holders of capital
are lazy. They do not want the risk of becoming venture capitalists. It is a
rentier mentality; they want to be aristocrats. This outlook is dragging
companies down.'
Argentine industrialists are demanding an industrial policy, a euphemism for
subsidies, import controls, devaluation and less taxation. Mr Cavallo is
resisting demands that would mean the end of reform.
Undeterred, foreign investors are hunting for opportunities. They are
attracted by strong economic growth forecasts, the scope for raising profits
by improving the productivity of underperforming assets, and Argentina's
well-educated work force and relatively sophisticated management. Executives
who fled the upheavals of the 1970s and 1980s are trickling back from Europe
and the US.
Capital markets are being reformed and have already expanded rapidly. They
could grow even faster if about Dollars 50bn in offshore capital were
repatriated. But only a small part of this flight capital has returned -
mostly to the stock market, which boomed in 1991. Apart from privatisations,
there have been few large industrial investments.
A leading US business consultant with years of experience in Latin America
believes Argentina's greatest limitation is lack of ambition. 'To really
grow, they have to be competitive, entrepreneurial, aggressive. But the
average Argentine is kind of middle class, who just wants to be an
employee.' He argues that except for low value-added primary industries,
Argentina has few obvious sources of wealth and manufacturing industry lacks
economies of scale.
However, stability and free markets may unleash pent-up creative energies.
In the early decades of this century, Argentina was one of the wealthiest
nations on earth; it had vibrant, energetic entrepreneurs. But they were
stifled by the great depression and the decades of chaotic statism that
followed. Perhaps their spirit can still be revived.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Chicago set to embrace the gambling trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO, the ever-brash and competitive American city, may be about to duel
with Las Vegas for the gaming trade. Mayor Richard Daley, abandoning his
previous opposition to gambling, has embraced a controversial Dollars 2bn
proposal for a city-centre casino and hotel complex.
The proposal was made by three of the US gaming industry's leading players:
Circus Circus Enterprises, Hilton Hotels and Caesars World. Mr Daley's
about-face on gambling came, he said, because of the reality of
unemployment. The proposed complex would bring to the city an estimated
Dollars 500m a year in tax revenues and create between 15,000 and 45,000
permanent jobs.
But many in Chicago oppose such a project because of the taint of corruption
that has always accompanied gambling. They feel it would revive the city's
former reputation as mecca of Al Capone-style organised crime.
The city has never entirely shed that fame and as the home of the US futures
trading industry some argue it already has too many games of chance. If
Chicago were to legalise gambling and allow the complex to be built, it
would be the first major American city to do so. Las Vegas, considered the
US gaming capital, was created from a sleepy desert town.
Stiff opposition to changing the state's restrictive gambling laws is
already shaping up. Illinois Governor Jim Edgar, a Republican, whose support
would be needed to pass the legislation, has made plain that he does not
think more gambling is an appropriate way to finance government. Illinois
currently has riverboat casinos, off-track betting for horse races and a
lottery.
The three gaming and hotel companies, which are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, said they would privately finance the project in Chicago. Only one
area can readily offer a site of sufficient size for the development. That
location would bridge the central business district with the McCormick
convention centre, just south of the city.

FT  26 MAR 92 / Attitudes harden in dispute at Bank of Italy over pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG-running dispute at the Bank of Italy over the renewal of a three-year
wage and work conditions contract for the bulk of the institution's 9,400
employees has become more entrenched and the unions are threatening
stoppages and other disruptions next month, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor, is holding firm against a wage
increase which would breach the 4.5 per cent ceiling laid down in the 1992
budget for public sector pay rises. The bank cannot afford to be seen to be
setting a bad example at a time when it has been critical of high public
sector wage claims in the previous two years which have helped fuel
inflation.
But the unions are arguing that the current rate of inflation is unlikely to
be below 5.5 per cent this year and that the wage ceiling increase is
unrealistically low.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: World coal consumption forecast
to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COAL demand and trade will increase steadily over the next two
decades, though by the turn of the century increased energy efficiency and
measures to protect the environment will begin to brake growth. These
forecasts are made by the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe in
a study just published on prospects for world coal trade to the year 2010.
It also predicts sharp declines in coal production in Europe, more than
offset by rising output in the US and elsewhere.
Global hard coal consumption is expected to increase on average by 1.3 per
cent or 50m tonnes annually to the year 2000, but by under 1 per cent (30m
tonnes) a year from 2000 to 2010. This represents a total increase of 800m
tonnes between 1990 and 2010 to 4.3bn tonnes.
The ECE expects electric power generation - now accounting for 45 per cent
of world coal demand - to grow in importance as other uses decline. Coal
demand by industry, now a quarter of world consumption, is likely to suffer
from stiff competition from more convenient and less polluting energy
sources such as oil, natural gas and electricity. Steel, which accounts for
20 per cent of world coal demand, is also predicted to reduce consumption
because of technological changes in steel-making and lower steel output. The
household sector, now responsible for 10 per cent of world consumption, is
expected to switch increasingly to electricity and central district heating.
The ECE says the eight major coal producing countries - Australia, China,
India, Poland, South Africa, Russia, Ukraine and the US - will still be
producing 85 per cent of the world's coal in 20 years time. European
production is forecast to drop overall by 200m tonnes, with over half the
reduction taking place in eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union.
Falling European production and growing demand in other world regions will
sustain satisfactory growth of some 3.6 per cent a year in world coal trade,
at least until the year 2000, the ECE study says. Thereafter, import growth
is expected to fall back to only 1.5 per cent annually, with total imports
reaching 630m tonnes by 2010 against 390m tonnes in 1990.
Four-fifths of total coal exports will continue to come from the eight
biggest producers, in spite of increasing supplies of new coal exporting
countries.
By the year 2010, the combined coal export potential of China, Colombia,
Indonesia and Venezuela might be 120m tonnes, the ECE predicts. However,
Australia and the US between them will account for 60 per cent of world
exports, with the US replacing Australia as the leading exporter before the
end of the century. By 2010 coal exports from Europe - essentially Poland,
Russia and Ukraine - may have dropped to below 5 per cent of the world
total, the ECE says.
Western Europe's dependence on imported coal is expected to rise from 40 per
cent in 1990 to 70 per cent in 2010, and that of eastern Europe from 10 to
25 per cent, the ECE says. Most of the import demand elsewhere will come
from Asia, especially Japan and South Korea.
The study maintains that, despite ever more stringent environmental
measures, coal will remain for many years the dominant source of electricity
generation in the world and could once again become the leading source of
primary energy.
