FT  04 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: US futures exchanges to fight
transaction tax plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE three largest US futures exchanges are firmly opposed to a proposal in
President George Bush's 1993 budget for a 15-cent transaction tax to be
introduced on trading at US commodity and options exchanges.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York
Mercantile Exchange denounced Mr Bush's proposal as an ill-advised,
anti-competitive step that would discourage liquidity in US markets and
drive business overseas. Other countries have moved to eliminate or reduce
such taxes.
Mr William O'Conner, chairman of the CBOT, the world's largest futures
exchange, said his market's share of global futures trading had diminished
to 24.5 per cent in 1991 from 38.7 per cent in 1985 and he warned that the
tax would 'be the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of our
competitive position against foreign futures exchanges.'
The CBOT calculated that if the tax would reduce liquidity in the Treasury
bond futures market by as little as  1/32 of one per cent - the size of one
'tick', the minimum price movement of the contract - 'it would increase the
US taxpayers' burden of financing the US government debt by Dollars 1bn'.

BZ BANK, the vehicle for Mr Martin Ebner's aggressive activity in the Swiss
stock markets, reported a 153 per cent rise in its net income last year to
SFr25.1m (Dollars 17.8m), writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The seven-year-old bank made gross income of SFr114.9m, up 12.9 per cent, of
which SFr73.3m came from commissions, which advanced 20 per cent. The bank
said brokerage fees contributed about two thirds of the commissions with
underwriting commissions providing the rest.
Total assets surged 39 per cent to SFr506.3m due to higher current loans and
a higher inventory of securities.

<TEXT>
A NUMBER of significant Japanese companies are expressing interest in a
revolutionary new system of delivering feature films direct to the home.
Electronic video hire could turn out to be a powerful rival to both
satellite subscription film channels and the local video store.
Mr William Kraven, an American entrepreneur and founder of EMC2 -
Entertainment Made Convenient - is hoping to get his business off the ground
in Japan and then move to joint ventures in the UK and other European
countries.
Under the EMC2 proposal, a customer would be able to order a film and have
it downloaded to a special receiver in five minutes. Using the capacity of
six satellite channels, 200 different feature films could be delivered
electronically to customers across a continent.
'We don't see ourselves as being in the movie rental business. We are in the
digital distribution business,' said Mr Kraven, who emphasised that the
technology - digital compression - already exists to turn his venture into a
reality.
Mr Kraven, who has been working on the idea for more than three years, is
currently in negotiations with Bandi, the large Japanese toy company; NTT,
the national telecommunications organisation; and several leading Japanese
consumer electronics manufacturers.
Sanwa Bank has also expressed interest and has introduced Mr Kraven to other
potential investors in Japan.
In the UK, where EMC2 hopes to set up a joint venture operation, the company
is represented by Mr Roy Warman and Mr Terry Bannister, both former joint
chief executives of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Communications, the advertising agency
group.
To take part in electronic video hire, customers would need a special
receiver costing around Pounds 300, although Mr Kraven hopes the necessary
electronics eventually will be included in video recorders. Customers would
then call either a freephone number or use a keypad to order the film of
their choice from a catalogue.
'Unlike the video store, we will never be out of stock of the most popular
films,' says Mr Kraven, who hopes to launch his service in Japan in 1994.

FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Energy giants caught in quagmire
 -The continuing turmoil in Canada's oil sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Oil, Canada's biggest oil company, is set to take the knife to
itself within a few days in some of the most radical surgery ever inflicted
on a Canadian company.
If the analysts are correct, Imperial, 70 per cent owned by Exxon of New
York, will announce it is closing two, and possibly three, of its six
refineries, eliminating a quarter of its 4,200 filling stations, and laying
off more than 1,000 workers.
Imperial's restructuring, and similar measures now under way at its
arch-rival Petro-Canada, confirm that the turmoil enveloping the exploration
and production side of Canada's oil industry for the past few years has now
spread to the downstream refining and marketing sectors.
The shakeout, in the form of acquisitions, asset disposals and partner
buy-outs, is profoundly changing the shape of the Calgary-based oil and gas
industry.
The brunt of the blow is being felt by the integrated giants of the
industry, such as Imperial, Petro-Canada and Shell Canada, which is 78 per
cent owned by Royal Dutch Shell. Amoco's Canadian subsidiary is also
struggling to digest its acquisition five years ago of Dome Petroleum, the
crippled giant of the western Canadian industry.
'The big guys are toast and investing in them is not what you do for
growth,' says Mr Verne Johnson, president of Lasmo Canada, a subsidiary of
the UK-based oil and gas group.
Narrowing operating margins and hefty writedowns have recently put all three
of the integrated companies in the red. Imperial's CDollars 36m (USDollars
30.8m) operating loss last year was the first in its history.
The pain is only partly due to the dip in oil and natural gas prices and
weak demand at the pump. The protracted North American gas 'bubble' and a 10
per cent drop in sales of refined petroleum products over the past two years
have probably hastened what was the inevitable.
The recession has highlighted the high costs of maintaining a diverse
portfolio of exploration and production properties, and a coast-to-coast
retail network.
'What pays the bills are the discoveries (the integrated companies) made in
the '50s and '60s,' Mr Johnson says. 'Their bureaucracies are not able to
exploit the opportunities that remain.'
The pace in the industry is being set by a band of smaller and more nimble
operators. Headed by a new generation of entrepreneurs, they have snapped up
the assets put on the block by the industry's giants.
Unlike the bulk of US independents, many of the aggressive newcomers are
publicly listed, giving them wide exposure to institutional and retail
investors. Corporate finance has become a fast-growing business in Calgary.
Among the names that are mentioned most often are Chauvco Resources, Morgan
Hydrocarbons, Morrison Petroleums, Tarragon Oil &amp; Gas and Canadian Natural
Resources.
While the big energy companies are looking for ways to slim down, Chauvco,
for instance, boosted oil and gas liquids output by 72 per cent in the first
nine months of last year. Chauvco's cash-flow and earnings doubled.
These companies get their headstart from lower costs. According to the
federal government's Petroleum Monitoring Agency, junior oil and gas
producers had operating costs of CDollars 26.93 per cubic metre in 1990,
compared with CDollars 38.74 per cu metre for the senior companies. The
seniors' costs climbed by 6.6 per cent that year, compared with 2.9 per cent
for the juniors.
Many of the newcomers are foreign-controlled. Despite lingering restrictions
on foreign investment in the Canadian energy industry, the stake of US,
European and Far East investors has risen markedly. Mr Johnson says Lasmo is
still looking 'quite greedily' to buy light-oil properties.
The trend throughout the industry is towards specialisation. On the upstream
side, producers are increasingly concentrating on specific products, such as
conventional oil, heavy oil or natural gas.
Mr Jack Pelletier, a corporate finance consultant in Calgary, notes that
many companies are also moving away from the joint ventures which were
popular in the 1960s and 1970s, preferring to operate a smaller number of
properties themselves.
In the overcrowded refining and retail businesses, the most successful
companies are those putting the emphasis on a regional rather than national
strategies. They include Ultramar in eastern Canada, Suncor in Ontario and
Chevron in the west.
Last week, Pay Less Holdings, a small company which has waged a fierce
petrol price war on Vancouver Island, paid well above prevailing market
prices for Canadian Turbo, another regional marketer in the west.
Mr Frank Sayer, president of Sayer Securities, a Calgary firm which
specialises in the oil and gas industry, says that 'changes in the
downstream are just starting to match what's been happening in the upstream
sector'.
Mr Sayer predicts that it will be another year or two before the deal-making
begins to subside.

<TEXT>
COLES MYER, Australia's biggest retailer, has reported flat sales for the
six months to January, with particular sluggishness in its New Zealand
operations.
Mr Brian Quinn, chief executive, in his traditional 'curtain-raiser' for the
company's interim results in mid-March, said yesterday first-half sales had
risen 2.1 per cent, with a trend improvement in the latest two months.
Sales for the month of November fell 2.1 per cent, but December sales were
up by the same amount and January figures were ahead 4 per cent.
'The result was adversely affected by New Zealand sales which rose by 1.5
per cent in New Zealand dollars, but fell by 4.2 per cent in Australian
dollars after conversion,' he said.
'The increase in Australian sales for the half was 2.5 per cent.'
Mr Quinn said he expected profitability would not be changed significantly
from last year.
'The recovery in sales in December and January has only been achieved at
some expense to profit margins; however, this has been largely offset by
reduced finance costs, good control of corporate expenses and greatly
improved stock control.
'The immediate future will be dependent upon some recovery in the economy,
and particularly on the effect of the economic statement proposed by the
government.'

MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded long-term debt ratings
of Sanwa Bank, a leading Japanese bank, to Aa3 from Aa1. The ratings of
Sanwa's subsidiaries were also lowered to Aa3.
The agency attributed the downgrade to the bank's asset quality and
contingent risks associated with affiliates, especially non-bank financial
institutions.
The move follows other recent downgrades of Japanese banks by rating
agencies. Currently, there are no banks with Aaa ratings, three banks with
Aa1, two with Aa2, and six with Aa3.
Japanese banks, which expanded rapidly under easy monetary conditions of the
late 1980s, now face deteriorating loans and increasing bankruptcies due to
the fall in land prices and the stock market slump.
Most Japanese banks were hurt by last year's spate of financial scandals,
caused by loose credit controls and reckless lending.

<TEXT>
DOW CORNING, the US maker of silicon breast implants at the centre of a
controversy over their safety, yesterday reported a 35.3 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter 1991 net profit, to Dollars 28.9m.
The Michigan-based company, which is jointly owned by Dow Chemical, the
large chemicals group, and Corning, the glass products maker, said the
fourth-quarter results included a previously announced Dollars 25m pre-tax
charge related to the breast implant business.
Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 472.3m, compared with Dollars 449.2m in
the last quarter of 1990.
For the whole of 1991, Dow Corning's net income declined to Dollars 152.9m
from Dollars 171.1m the previous year. Revenues in 1991 were Dollars 1.85bn,
compared with Dollars 1.72bn in 1990.
Mr Lawrence Reed, chief executive of the company, said Dow Corning continued
to be in close contact with the US Food and Drug Administration and was
continuing to provide scientific information about the implants.
Controversy over the implants has escalated in recent weeks amid concern
over the product's safety.
Mr Reed yesterday claimed the implants are 'efficacious and have limited
risks and complications'.
Dow Corning recently hired Mr Griffin Bell, the former US Attorney-General,
to investigate the develop-ment and marketing of the implant.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CBS, the loss-making US television network, is believed to be offering deep
discounts to US advertisers in an effort to fill advertising slots for the
winter Olympic games, which begin next weekend in Albertville, France.
Mr George Schweitzer, senior vice-president of marketing, said he would not
comment on pricing policies, nor on a report in Advertising Age, the US
trade publication, that yesterday quoted buyers who estimated that CBS was
offering prime time advertising slots for as much as 40 per cent below
normal Olympic rates.
Some prime-time slots that originally sold for Dollars 250,000 were being
offered for as low as Dollars 150,000, according to Advertising Age. Mr
Schweitzer said he expected all of CBS's slots for the Olympics to be sold
shortly.
Over the past year, CBS has had a string of problems related to its sports
coverage. The network wrote off Dollars 282m last year because of losses on
its baseball and other sports coverage. In the third quarter of 1991, CBS
wrote off Dollars 322m pre-tax on its baseball and football contracts,
resulting in a Dollars 169.1m loss.
Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst at Oppenheimer, yesterday termed the network's
sports strategy 'pathetic' and said CBS had seriously overpaid for both the
baseball and Olympic US television rights.
CBS paid Dollars 243m for the winter Olympic rights.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust, the New York investment bank, has abandoned plans to buy
Integrated Resources, a New York finance group which is in Chapter 11
bankruptcy, in a complex Dollars 565m deal.
Bankers Trust, confirming the move yesterday, regretted it had been unable
to reach a definitive agreement with committees of the company's creditors.
It reached a tentative deal with them last November, under which it would
have paid around Dollars 210m for Integrated's non-cash assets. A final
agreement was meant to have been reached by mid-January.
Integrated said it and creditor committees were continuing discussions with
other potential funders of a reorganisation plan. It did not give details
but the wealthy Pritzker family of Chicago put in a bid last November which
was said to top the Bankers' Trust one by some Dollars 22m.
Saudi American Bank (Samba), 30 per cent owned by Citibank, has announced a
43 per cent rise in earnings to Dollars 200.4m for 1991, reflecting strong
profitability among most Saudi banks and a buoyant private sector in the
kingdom since the end of the Gulf war, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East
Correspondent.
Net operating revenues rose by Dollars 71m, a 27 per cent increase, while
operating expenses rose Dollars 17m, following exceptional costs from the
Gulf war.
Total assets rose 22 per cent over the previous year to Dollars 9.7bn, while
deposits rose by 24 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn.
Saudi bankers say they have seen a strong influx of Saudi-held funds since
the end of the war, a trend they say indicates growing confidence within the
Saudi private sector and recently diminished returns from overseas
investments.

CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, will have to seek additional
support from the state-backed bank insurance fund to meet new equity capital
requirements, the bank's president said yesterday.
Mr Borger Lenth said it would be clear how much additional capital would be
needed once the bank's 1991 accounts were published on March 5.
However, the state bank insurance fund, established last year with capital
of NKr5bn (Dollars 789m) and later boosted by NKr6bn, is depleted after
supplying cash to prop up the country's top three banks.
The bank was taken over by the government last December, and provided with a
NKr5.14bn injection of state funds following massive trading losses.
According to the Norwegian Bank Association, the commercial banks will
suffer combined losses of NKr15.9bn in 1991, compared with combined losses a
year earlier of NKr4.3bn.
Combined credit losses are estimated by the association at NKr12.3bn, up
from NKr8.2bn in 1990.
The association forecast that its members would return to profit by 1993.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SILVIO Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, yesterday unveiled a
FFr1.5bn (Dollars 270m) rescue plan for La Cinq, the floundering French
television station in which he is one of the largest share-holders.
The deadline for rescue bids for La Cinq, which earlier this year filed for
bank-ruptcy, closed at 6pm yesterday. Mr Berlusconi presented his proposals
to Mr Hubert Lafont, the station's administrator, during the afternoon.
Mr Lafont is believed to have received at least one, and possibly two, other
bids. He is expected tomorrow to announce if any of the proposals have been
accepted. Without a rescuer, La Cinq will close.
Mr Berlusconi said he had already identified enough investors to produce the
FFr1.5bn needed for his recapitalisation plan.
It is not yet known whether the other existing investors in La Cinq - which
include Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, the Hersant press group, and
Kleinwort Benson, the British bank - will participate. Hachette, the French
media group which ran La Cinq until its collapse, is still studying the
proposals.
Mr Berlusconi said Fininvest, the company through which he owns his La Cinq
shares, would participate fully by pumping in enough money to retain its
existing holding of 25 per cent - the maximum permitted under French
broadcasting law - after the recapitalisation.
He refused to elaborate on his plans to solve La Cinq's financial problems -
it lost an estimated FFr1.12bn in 1991 - or on his programming policy. Canal
Plus, the French pay-TV channel, mustered an estimated 15 per cent increase
in net profits, to FFr1.05bn, for 1991, on turnover which rose by just under
15 per cent to FFr7.03bn.

RHONE-POULENC Rorer, the Franco-US pharmaceuticals group, has reported more
than doubled profits for 1991, its first full year since formation, writes
William Dawkins in Paris.
The group - created in 1990 when Rhone-Poulenc, the French state-owned
chemicals producer, took control of Rorer of the US - made Dollars 326.1m
net income in 1991, against a pro-forma Dollars 145m in the previous year.
Sales rose by 5.8 per cent, to Dollars 3.82bn from Dollars 3.61bn, but the
group pointed out that the underlying rise, adjusting for exchange rate
changes and disposals, came out at 13 per cent.
Sales growth was strongest in the US, France and Germany. Turnover benefited
from the successful launches of three drugs: Vasten, a cholesterol lowering
product; Zoltum for ulcers; and Nasacort, for allergic nasal complaints.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's profits were also helped by a Dollars 22.1m
exceptional gain from the sale of non-strategic businesses, plus a fall in
interest charges, to Dollars 159.2m from Dollars 189.2m in 1990, due to a
fall in the volume and in the cost of debts.
Earnings rose to Dollars 2.37 per share from Dollars 1.08 in 1990.

<TEXT>
MARSH &amp; MCLENNAN, the world's biggest insurance broker, yesterday announced
the acquisition of Faugere &amp; Jutheau, a family-owned company and the
dominant force in French insurance broking.
New York-based Marsh &amp; McLennan, which already owns one-third of Faugere,
paid Dollars 105m in cash to secure the deal, which is still subject to
formal approval by the French government. In 1991, Faugere's profits after
tax were Dollars 6.51m on revenues of Dollars 125m.
A joint venture between Marsh and the family of the chairman, Mr Robert
Husson, is being formed to manage Faugere's African businesses, which
generated revenues of Dollars 21m of the total in 1991.
Europe has generated faster growth for Marsh than any other territory; the
completion of a continent-wide network has been a priority for the group,
according to Mr Robert Clements, Marsh &amp; McLennan chairman. 'France was the
missing link,' he said.
The Marsh network in Europe - which covers 16 countries - also includes the
Lloyd's broker, CT Bowring, in London and Germany's largest broker, Gradmann
&amp; Holler, which was acquired in 1989.
Marsh has had a correspondent relationship with Faugere since 1969, and
acquired its original one-third interest four years later. But hitherto the
French group had been unenthusiastic about sacrificing full control.
Mr Robert Husson accepted yesterday that closer collaboration had always
been on the cards. 'You have to become international or you are lost,' he
said.
Marsh's acquisition of Faugere comes at a turbulent time for the French
insurance industry. The state-controlled insurers - Union des Assurances de
Paris (UAP), Assurance Generales de France (AGF), and Groupes des Assurances
Nationales (GAN) - will see part of their equity sold in the government's
partial privatisation programme.

MICROSOFT has announced top management changes and a broad reorganisation of
its operations. The US computer software group said its president, Mr
Michael Hallman, had resigned, to be replaced by a three-man 'office of the
president'.
Mr Hallman's resignation was a 'mutual decision' by Microsoft's board of
directors on Saturday, the company said. His departure comes as a surprise,
since Microsoft's financial performance has strengthened since Mr Hallman
joined the company.
'I have great respect for Mike Hallman, and for his contributions,' said Mr
William Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive. 'But the unique
nature of our business has outgrown the role of the traditional company
president.'
Mr Hallman, a former Boeing and International Business Machines executive,
joined Microsoft almost two years ago. At the time he was viewed as bringing
a new level of maturity to Microsoft's management.
However, 'it became obvious that our business has become so large and
complex that it is an extreme challenge for anybody from outside the
personal computer software industry to dig into all of the many issues
facing us', said Mr Steven Ballmer, one of the three executives to take over
the office of the president.
Mr Hallman is to be replaced by three of Mr Gates' closest associates. Mr
Michael J. Maples, 49, formerly senior vice-president in charge of
application program products, has been promoted to the new position of
executive vice-president, worldwide products group. He will oversee all
Microsoft's product development activities.
Mr Steven Ballmer, 35, formerly senior vice-president with responsibility
for systems software, including the successful Windows program, will be in
charge of worldwide sales support and marketing activities in his new role
as executive vice-president, worldwide sales and support group.
Mr Francis Gaudette, 56, Microsoft's chief financial officer, will be
responsible for manufacturing and distribution, finance, human resources,
corporate services groups and Microsoft Press.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Abbey National sets up share service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL, the retail banking group, is setting up its own retail
stockbroking and share registration services.
The operation, which will be based at Sheffield, marks a departure by Abbey
National from its traditional core business areas.
The share registration services will be introduced in the late summer of
1993 when Taurus, the electronic share record system, is introduced by the
Stock Exchange. Its introduction will bring to an end Abbey National's link
with Lloyds Bank registrars which at present looks after the certification
of its 3.5m shareholders.
The bank will phase out its existing business with Sharelink by the end of
the year.
Mr Geoffrey Osbaldeston, commercial services director, said that the share
dealing service would operate by post and on an execution-only basis. Abbey
National branches will not handle the share dealing.

<TEXT>
British Aerospace is selling its Aerostructures Hamble aircraft components
subsidiary for Pounds 47m to a new company to be set up by Legal and General
Ventures.
This is a first step in BAe's rationalisation policy of concentrating on its
core defence, commercial aircraft, Rover cars and property and construction
businesses.
Aerostructures was set up in 1989 to produce components for civil and
defence aircraft. It employs about 1,700 and supplies parts for BAe aircraft
programmes as well as to other customers, including Saab McDonnell Douglas,
and Westland, the helicopter group.
Last year its turnover was Pounds 66m and pre-tax profit Pounds 4m.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Court forbids release of Pounds 6m in
PPI-frozen account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CENTRAL bank of the internationally unrecognised Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus yesterday lost an Appeal Court battle to be allowed to take
Pounds 6m spending money from Pounds 23m frozen in its main UK account.
The freezing order was imposed in October at the request of the
administrators of Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics group,
who are seeking to recover funds allegedly improperly removed from the
company.
Yesterday's appeal was against a High Court ruling on January 14 by Mr
Justice Harman, refusing leave to take out more funds.
The bank argued that it was unable to discharge its obligations because of
the freeze on its funds in the UK.
Lord Justice Parker, sitting with Lord Justice Stocker and Sir David
Croom-Johnson, said that it was plain that, since October, the bank had
operated its account so as to defeat the protection given to the Polly Peck
administrators and remove assets covered by the freezing order.
The bank was ordered to pay the administrators' costs incurred in opposing
the appeal.

THORN EMI, the music and rentals group which last week decided to withdraw
from UK electrical retailing, is to expand further in the US by acquiring
Remco America, a rent-to-own company, from a group of private investors for
about Dollars 55m (Pounds 30.3m).
Texas-based Remco operates 64 stores in Houston, Dallas, Chicago and North
Carolina and achieved turnover of Dollars 69m in the year to September 30
1991.
Remco's profits were not disclosed, but Thorn said the record was good.
Thorn's Rent-A-Center subsidiary, acquired in 1987, claims to be the largest
rent-to-own company in the US, with about 20 per cent of the market.
Remco will retain its existing management, but its operations will be
incorporated with those of RAC or of Thorn International Rentals, a small US
chain set up in an attempt to create a second trading brand.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Recession prompts Thwaites to seek buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THWAITES, the Leamington Spa-based company whose sturdy dumpers are a
familiar feature of UK construction sites, is exploring a possible sale of
the company after a sharp fall in demand caused by the recession.
Thwaites said yesterday that, following several approaches from parties
interested in buying the company, it had asked Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank, to advise shareholders and the company in connection with the possible
sale.
The company, formed in 1937 by the late Mr Basil Thwaites, has more than 50
per cent of the UK market for site dumpers from three quarter tonnes to
eight tonnes payload, and like many in the industry has jealously guarded
its independence.
The recession, however, has caused its main market to contract by about 50
per cent. This, and approaches from a number of Far Eastern and continental
European construction equipment manufacturers, had persuaded the
family-owned company that now might be an appropriate time to sell.
Yesterday the company and its advisers were stressing that the potential
change of ownership was not a fire sale. Thwaites is in a sound financial
condition and will remain independent with the full support of its present
shareholders if acceptable terms cannot be negotiated.
The announcement is likely to spark considerable interest in the
construction equipment industry.
'It has a lot to offer: a nice facility with a very good engineering track
record and a good product reputation round the world,' said Mr David
Phillips, director of the Corporate Intelligence Group's Off-Highway
Research Division.
'It could be a very good purchase for a Japanese or Korean company that
wants a manufacturing presence in the European Community.'
Mr John Webb, Thwaites managing director, said site dumpers were primarily a
product for the UK market, and there was a limit to the extent that exports
could be increased.
Diversification with the launch in 1986 of the Alldig small backhoe loader
had been hard going against the bottom end of JCB's range, and Thwaites'
recently acquired Pegasus range of all-terrain access equipment had been hit
by the market downturn despite being popular with users.
Mr Webb said there were a number of German, French and Japanese
manufacturers which did not have a good UK distribution base. There was also
plenty of room for expansion at Leamington - a streamlined workforce of 170
is working in 160,000 sq ft of a 260,000 sq ft site.
No financial details were available, but Fleming is sending details to
potential purchasers worldwide.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Anglo United prepares for coal bid with
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID MCERLAIN, chair-man of Anglo United, owner of the Coalite smokeless
fuel business, has detailed his strategy for selling businesses worth about
Pounds 100m which would enable him to proceed with his ambitious plan to buy
British Coal's assets.
The Department of Energy is studying Anglo's plan to acquire British Coal
through a reverse takeover of the corporation.
A new company would be established to acquire both Anglo and British Coal by
issuing new shares. But Anglo does not want to acquire the corporation
through borrowings and would thus like to reduce its current debt. The
latest disposals will also reduce Anglo's interest payments which in the
last six months totalled Pounds 16.6m.
Cash generated from the planned disposals will be used to repay the largest
part of the loan repayment schedule established after Anglo bought Coalite
for Pounds 487m in 1989.
While the present schedule is being paid from the first wave of disposals
and cash generation, Mr McErlain has decided to embark on a second round of
disposals to enable the group to pay back Pounds 108m - the biggest single
amount owed and due in 1996, within the next 18 months.
Mr McErlain is confident that he can raise about Pounds 100m, possibly
within the year, by selling the following businesses:
Liquid fuels, with sales of Pounds 200m and operating profits of Pounds
11.2m for the year to end-March 1991 and valued in the balance sheet for
Pounds 23m, may raise some Pounds 50m by way of a flotation. If a public
offer takes place Mr McErlain would maintain a 20 per cent stake so he could
classify it as an associate.
Chemicals, with turnover of Pounds 28m, operating profits of Pounds 5.6m and
valued in the balance sheet at Pounds 7m, is lined up for a possible
management buy-out for about Pounds 40m. If Anglo did proceed down this
route Mr McErlain said he would want to keep 15 per cent in order to benefit
from the increased productivity that MBOs normally generate.
Instruments, Seaham Harbour and Pozament, with combined sales of Pounds
19.7m and operating profits of Pounds 3.8m, may be sold as a package to one
entrepreneur for Pounds 3m.
The Falkland Islands Company and its associated businesses on the south
Atlantic Islands, with net assets of Pounds 7m and pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.25m, is on sale for about Pounds 10m. Mr McErlain has already received
offers of interest.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons leasing plan to proceed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food, and retailing group, yesterday confirmed
that it intends to go ahead with its plan to lease 734 pubs to Brent Walker,
the debt-laden leisure group.
The deal, which is vital to Brent Walker's financial restructuring, will be
sealed in spite of a warning from the Office of Fair Trading that the leased
pubs would still be counted as part of Allied's tied estate.
Allied, which has to free 2,380 pubs from tied beer supplies by November to
comply with government orders, said its legal advice was that the 734 pubs
would count towards that disposal target.
Under the terms of the deal, Allied will buy 50 pubs from Brent Walker and
supply two thirds of the beer requirements of its remaining 1,800 pubs for
seven years.
If the OFT should be successful in persuading the courts that the 734 pubs
are still 'tied' after the November disposal deadline, Allied and Brent
Walker have agreed a fall-back position to safeguard Allied's position.
This involves varying the duration and volume of the beer supply agreement
and the leasehold rents of the pubs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G, the fund management group, has issued preliminary details of its
Recovery Investment Trust, which it plans to launch later this month.
The trust will have a split capital structure, like the Income Investment
Trust which M&amp;G launched last year. There will be three classes of shares:
income, capital and zero dividend preference.
The issue will have two parts: an offer for subscription, in which investors
will only be able to apply for a package of all three shares, and a tender
offer by SG Warburg in which investors will be able to buy the individual
components and a geared unit, comprising the income and capital shares
together.
Listing particulars will be published on February 14 and the offer will
close on March 27. The launch of the trust is timed so that investors will
be able to place a full Pounds 6,000 into a personal equity plan for each of
the tax years 1991-92 and 1992-93.
As with the Income Trust, M&amp;G has put an intensive marketing effort into the
launch and this has resulted in higher expenses - at a maximum of 4.76 per
cent - than are normal for an investment trust launch. The annual management
fee will be 0.75 per cent.
The yield on the trust is expected to be about that payable on M&amp;G's
Recovery unit trust, which currently pays 5.1 per cent.

Allied Partnership Group, the environmental contractor and fork lift truck
distributor, said yesterday that a receiver had been appointed to the group
holding company following an application from Humberclyde Industrial
Finance, a leasing company.
Shares in Allied Partnership were suspended last Thursday at 9 3/4 p and on
Friday the company unsuccessfully tried to set aside Thursday's appointment
of Touche Ross as the receiver.
Humberclyde said that the receiver had been appointed last Thursday at
12.15pm.
Dew Group, which is the main construction company within APG, is currently
trading profitably and continues to have the support of its bankers, APG
said.
Humberclyde had taken the step of appointing the receiver to protect its
security interests which it believed were in danger of being undermined by
the granting of additional security to other parties.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Petrocon targets James Wilkes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETROCON, the engineering and surveying group, yesterday launched a hostile
Pounds 36.6m paper bid for James Wilkes, the acquisitive engineer which is
also the world's largest manufacturer of beer mats.
The offer of 13 new Petrocon shares for every three of Wilkes' values the
target's stock at 199.3p. Petrocon's shares held steady after the
announcement to close at 46p. Wilkes's shares rose 5p to 182p.
Mr Stephen Hinchliffe, Wilkes chairman, attacked the offer as an 'unwelcome
and damaging intrusion to James Wilkes' development'. It 'significantly
undervalues (its) present profits and performance', he said.
Mr Colin Robinson, Petrocon chairman, said, however, that Wilkes' gearing
and overheads had been allowed to reach 'excessive levels'. Petrocon, which
owns a 2.84 per cent stake in Wilkes, claimed to have received the support
of investors holding 29.1 per cent.
Mr Robinson said there were synergies in the companies' engineering
divisions. One of Wilkes' main subsidiaries is Floform, the spark plug
electrode maker, bought from Hollis Industries in 1989 when Mr Robinson was
chief executive there. Petrocon makes and distributes valves and pipe
fittings.
Mr Hinchliffe dismissed the synergy claim, saying: 'To put these businesses
together is basically having just James Wilkes.' The company had embarked on
a programme in December to 'substantially cut gearing', he added.
Petrocon also yesterday announced an agreed Pounds 2.68m offer for Beverley,
an engineering, software and management services company controlled by Mr
Robinson and three other Petrocon directors.
Mr Robinson, who set up Beverley in 1989, holds 70 per cent of the smaller
company and will earn about Pounds 2m in cash and Petrocon shares through
the deal. The directors have agreed to retain the Petrocon shares until
1993.
If both offers are accepted, the new stock issued would represent 69.1 per
cent of Petrocon's share capital.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Poor high street trading leaves Menzies at
Pounds 2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN John Menzies fell by 31p to 429p after the Edinburgh-based retail
and wholesale group said the recession continued to reduce margins and
restrict profits.
Turnover rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 489.3m but trading profits fell from
Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 4.5m in the six months to October 31. Pre-tax profits
were Pounds 2.1m compared with Pounds 200,000 last time, when there was an
exceptional loss of Pounds 4m in the Hammicks Book Wholesaling business.
The group said trading conditions were particularly poor in the high street,
where the core John Menzies Retail business reflected the depth of the
recession.
Mr John Menzies, chairman. said: 'A return to satisfactory results must
await the end of this recession and the more buoyant rates of growth which
it will bring.'
The second-half results would include the important Christmas period, when
sales were broadly as expected, although trading conditions generally
remained poor and margins continued to be under pressure.
In the UK, the Early Learning chain recorded significant volume growth
against general market trends. In the US, Early Learning had shown sales
increases above trends in the depressed retail sector.
The US business is still for sale, but the group said the prospect of
attracting external investor finance would have to await recovery in the
retail and venture capital markets.
Although the performance of Early Learning in the US is much improved, it is
still incurring losses. These are covered by a Pounds 15.2m extraordinary
provision, which the group took in 1990, and which has almost been
exhausted.
Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, managing director, said the group would decide at the
year end whether to make a new provision or to take in the results of the
business above the line.
John Menzies Wholesale, which handles newspaper distribution, and TBD, which
is a wholesaler in home entertainment, continued to increase market share.
Earnings per share fell to 0.9p (losses 1.4p) and the interim dividend is
lifted to 3.6p (3.4p).

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome study backs efficacy of Retrovir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceutical group, yesterday published preliminary study
results demonstrating that Retrovir halved the likelihood of healthy people
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) developing Aids and
related diseases.
The data also challenged doubts about the drug's toxicity in healthy
HIV-positive patients. Wellcome's shares rose 24p to Pounds 11.73 in a
falling market.
The company said that, if the findings were confirmed by full analysis, the
range of HIV-positive people who would benefit from Retrovir would be
broadened.
The data showed that patients receiving a placebo had a 28 per cent
probability of deterioration compared with 14 per cent of those on Retrovir.
Analysts said the study, which involved nearly 1,000 patients, should be
taken seriously and could prove influential on medical opinion.
Mr Robin Gilbert, analyst at James Capel, pointed out that, although the
study patients had taken high doses of 1,000mg a day, the drug had been well
tolerated. This suggested the drug's reputation for toxicity was not
justified for healthy HIV-positive patients. A shorter Anglo-French study
has recently come to the same conclusion.
Wellcome has had difficulty selling the drug to HIV-positive people who have
not developed Aids because of fears about the drug's toxicity. Many patients
have been taking lower than recommended dosages.
'The implication of this study is that anybody with HIV - even those at
early stages of the disease - will benefit from the drug,' said Professor
David Cooper, chairman of the international co-ordinating committee for the
trial.
Wellcome was cautious about any immediate increase in sales following the
study. The company pointed out that the results were preliminary and that
the drug would have to negotiate regulatory hurdles before it could be
administered to patients without Aids symptoms. Any financial benefits were
not likely to emerge until next financial year, said the company. Last year,
the drug had sales of Pounds 177m.
Mr Jonathan de Pass, an analyst at BZW, said: 'This study should help the
company overcome the perception of the drug's dangers. We believe sales
forecasts have been scaled down too far. If the perception can be changed,
usage could grow moderately fast to as much as Pounds 400m a year.'

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Securiguard confounds City expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURIGUARD confounded City expectations with a 30 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits and a sharp reduction in debt that sparked a 17p jump in the
share price to 136p.
Pre-tax profits for the year to November 3 1991 rose from Pounds 3.86m to
Pounds 5.03m on sales up 7.5 per cent at Pounds 161.6m.
Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman, said debt had been cut from Pounds 17.2m to
Pounds 12.7m after payment of a Pounds 1.9m installment for the acquisition
of Madison Building Services group, increasing interest cover to over three
times.
Most of this reduction came from reducing the level of debtor days as
management focused more time on existing businesses rather than new
acquisitions.
The core security and cleaning activities in the UK grew strongly. Trading
profits expanded 22 per cent to Pounds 3.8m for security services, while
cleaning rose 16 per cent to Pounds 1.62m.
In the US, where the company was suffering from a more serious recession,
trading profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 1.8m on sales 24 per cent higher
at Pounds 49.6m.
A reorganised overnight parcel delivery service increased its profits on
reduced sales as the volume of 'next-day' deliveries carried by City Link
networks grew by more than 40 per cent.
The weak link remained the personnel service division where losses were
slightly reduced to Pounds 700,000 following cost cutting, but on sales down
from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 12.9m.
Mr Baldwin said contracts won in Europe would reduce the losses to under
Pounds 500,000 this year, a level that justified the decision not to close
the division.
Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 17p (14p) and the final dividend is
raised to 5.3p, giving a total up from 8p to 8.5p.
COMMENT
Securiguard has incurred its share of City wrath in the last couple of years
for letting debt rise too high and for surprising the market with profits
warnings. Last year's sharp reduction in debt will go a long way towards
regaining confidence. Even though it will be difficult to repeat the debt
reduction by further squeezing working capital, fewer acquisitions should
mean interest cover can again increase. Concerns remain about the the
personnel services sector where the only signs of improvement come from
additional contracts in Europe rather than an upturn in the industry.
Nevertheless, estimates of pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.7m for 1991 seem
conservative. This would give earnings per share of 19.2p and a prospective
multiple still languishing at a modest 7. The stock may not, however, be
fully priced until bridges are fully rebuilt with the City.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: CRT defies downturn in sector with 6% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRT, the consultancy, recruitment and training company, defied the downturn
in its sector with a 5.6 per cent rise to Pounds 2.61m in pre-tax profits
for the six months to October 31.
The interims mark the first set of accounts to be released which show CRT -
created through the reverse takeover of textile manufacturer Smallshaw in
1989 - in its virtually finished form. Smallshaw's knitwear businesses were
sold in the latter part of last year.
'CRT is now actually happening, whereas previously it was a concept,' said
Mr Barrie Clark, finance director. In the last two years, the group has paid
more than Pounds 20m for seven companies.
The pre-tax figure was struck on turnover 7 per cent higher at nearly Pounds
20m, on a pro forma basis, and compared with Pounds 2.47m. During the six
months CRT made two acquisitions, Pitman Office Training for Pounds 2.2m,
and Doctus, the management consultancy, for a nominal sum. Pitman, which
incurred losses last year, had contributed profits of about Pounds 100,000,
said Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive.
Of the group's three divisions, the decline in general recruitment had been
offset by the demand for workers in information technology. 'We are doing as
badly as everyone else in general recruitment,' he said.
However, the training division - which accounted for50 per cent of sales and
80 per cent of profits - had shown steady progress. Profits were held back
by a switch in the method of fee payment to a performance-related basis.
This meant CRT's group profits would be more weighted towards the second
half, Mr Chapman said, as payments came in when students achieved
qualifications.
The consultancy side, which was formed from the Doctus acquisition and
included for three months, had performed to expectations.
Earnings per share rose to 3.47p (3.19p). The interim dividend is raised
from 0.5p to 0.575p.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BT considers selling Aeradio in refocusing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications is considering selling International Aeradio, its
airport and hospital management subsidiary, as part of its strategy of
refocusing on telecommunication services.
IAL, with annual turnover of some Pounds 100m, is one of the larger
acquisitions made by BT after its privatisation which no longer fits into
the core activity of running telecommunication networks. Recently, BT said
it was trying to sell the much smaller Telecom Security, its alarm business.
BT said yesterday that there was nothing active happening with IAL, which
was bought from STC, the electronics group, in 1986.
IAL runs hospitals in overseas territories, particularly in the Middle East.
It also manages airline security systems. These activities were no longer
considered core to BT.
But other parts of IAL may still be considered by BT to fit in with its
strategy, including its airport communications businesses and overseas
offices.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday Wellcome's market value rose above Pounds 10bn for the first time,
ranking it ahead of Hanson as the seventh biggest stock on the London
market. Nine months ago its value was Pounds 5bn. In the past three months
it has outperformed Glaxo by over 40 per cent. This is partly because the
market has begun to see Glaxo as overvalued. Wellcome is on about 32 times
this year's earnings, Glaxo on 25 times. How long can Wellcome keep it up?
Yesterday's 2 per cent rise was due to further evidence that AZT delays the
onset of Aids in HIV-positive patients who have not yet developed Aids
symptoms. But that is a familiar story. As Wellcome has always conceded, the
problem lies rather in getting symptom-free patients to take a drug of AZT's
fearsome reputation. In any event, Wellcome's earnings growth depends more
on the versatility of its older anti-viral drug Zovirax. Its stock market
reputation has also benefited of late from the infusion of fresh management,
which can have little immediate effect on the development of a drug
portfolio. Unlike Glaxo, which has on the whole risen fairly steadily over
the years, Wellcome has always been prone to wild speculative swings. Like
Glaxo, it is in fundamental terms a remarkable company. It might be
over-valued just the same.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP's extended foray into food processing does not rank in the first division
of failed oil company diversifications: remember Mobil the retailer, or
Exxon in its brief days as an electric motor manufacturer. But the group's
decision to label its nutrition division a 'non-core' business certainly
places it in the league of embarrassing mistakes, not least because such
high hopes were invested along with BP's cash. Three years ago, BP made a
similar change in the status of its coal business, saying nutrition would be
the engine of future non-oil growth. So much for that.
Assuming the division will now be sold off piecemeal, BP should avoid
write-downs of the sort associated with rivals' ventures. It will be rather
harder to hide from scrutiny a return on capital averaging only 6 per cent
in the past five years. BP may try to restore investors' faith by increasing
its final dividend next week, even though it would thereby increase the
pressure on its cash flow.
The group's narrow concern is to make the nutrition division self-funding in
the meantime. Given that the business was cash-generative in 1990, that
should be simple. Selling it will be rather harder. But if BP is lucky, it
could raise up to Pounds 700m, equivalent to about a tenth of group debt.
Whether it can raise anything like that this year is another matter.
The broader question concerns big oil's inability to do anything sensible
with its profits except invest them in further exploration or pay them out
to shareholders. If the recent round of dismal fourth-quarter results from
US oil companies is an accurate reflection of the industry's woes, it might
be as well to avoid the sector altogether.

FT  04 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Granada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt there will be tears shed at the Rover's Return, the pub
immortalised by Granada Television's long-running series, Coronation Street.
But sober shareholders ought to accept yesterday's enforced resignation of
chairman Mr David Plowright as the inevitable and probably welcome
consequence of the changing face of commercial television.
The abruptness of the departure of one of the doyens of UK programme-making
is an embarrassment in the short term. But it is already clear that a fresh
combination of management skills will be needed when the new terrestrial TV
regime begins in earnest next year. Granada admittedly has a well-deserved
reputation as a cash cow, and last year pulled off a brilliant coup by
retaining its franchise on the cheap. But with its old monopoly profits no
longer assured, and a higher annual bill from the Treasury under the new
levy system, a cheaper cost structure is required. Differences with Mr
Plowright evidently go deeper than this. But whatever they are, they have
distracted attention from the main task. Granada, for example, has been
absent from the power bloc building up around Carlton, LWT, Central and
Scottish.
On balance, yesterday's development should do nothing to dent the recovery
in investor sentiment towards Granada. But having outperformed the market by
50 per cent since last July the shares may now find the going harder.

FT  04 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A lack of steel in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,560.2 (-11)
The unexpected resolution of the German steel dispute leaves the markets
slightly wrong-footed. The avoidance of a strike is evidently good for
German industrial output, which is scarcely robust at present. On the other
hand, an increase of 6.4 per cent for a crippled industry such as steel
scarcely augurs well for the rest of the wage round, even if it is argued
that the settlement is a hangover from last year. It seems highly unlikely
that the Bundesbank will raise rates at this early stage, if at all. But the
postponement of a rate cut until the second half of the year looks still
more likely than before.
The implications for the UK economy are correspondingly glum. Whatever hopes
were raised a week or two ago about a cheeky pre-election cut in base rates,
it is worth recalling that three-month money rates never fell below 10 9/16
per cent. That is, the market always rated a rise as fractionally more
likely than a cut. Granted, since the rate technically expresses
expectations of average base rates over the next three months, it has to
balance the chances of a Budget cut against the possible effects of a Labour
victory in an early election. If the equity market were to follow the same
logic, it should not be unduly sanguine about economic recovery.

<TEXT>
In 'Technically Speaking' (January 28), Paul Abrahams was, of course,
expressing the frustration of users of countless manuals for both British
and imported goods. Now, instead of just time being wasted, it is money as
well when using a 0898 number at 48p per minute, or, say, Pounds 9.60 for 20
minutes, the average length of a call dealing with a problem.
We frequently come across the problem of incorrect software instructions
which need translating into foreign languages. We instruct our translators
to sit at the computer and go through the manuals, checking that the
directions give the results they should. Only then are the directions
translated.
In this way, the client using his computer can be certain that he is not the
victim of xenophobes, and, at the same time, is given the opportunity to
make the necessary amendments to original documents so that they become
com-prehensible. This procedure saves time, money and frustration for both
users and suppliers.

<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Lindsay's estimated cost of a 230-mile round trip (Letters,
January 31) may be an improvement on that of Richard Tomkins ('When fare is
not fair', January 29), but it is still not good economics. For example,
road tax is a fixed cost and has no bearing on the costs of a journey, which
must be variable. He also ascribes the loss in value entirely to use,
whereas in the UK a car can lose value merely on account of a change in the
letter on its number-plate. In addition, no allowance has been made for
repairs as distinct from servicing, not to mention parking (and/or fines).
Finally, irrespective of the precise costs involved, there is also the issue
of relative convenience, journey time and blood pressure to take into
account. Some costs are thus overstated while others are understated, and
some not stated at all.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Letter: Criteria for rail investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms GILL SAMUEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins, in his article 'When fare is not fair' (January 29) on
the costs of road and rail travel, is wrong to say that 'the case for rail
investment is judged solely according to commercial criteria'.
While this is true of investment by the commercial sectors (Freight and
Intercity), which are in direct competition with other - unsubsidised -
forms of transport, it is not true of investment in Network SouthEast and
Regional Railways. In these sectors, the overriding objective is to maintain
the existing network of services in the most cost-effective way, even if the
investment needed to do so does not make an 8 per cent return. And, where
the network is being expanded, wider benefits such as the relief of
congestion in urban areas can also be taken into account. Similarly,
essential safety investment is not required to make an 8 per cent return.
This means that in practice well over half of British Rail's programme of
investment in its existing rail network is not judged 'solely according to
commercial criteria'.

<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your report ('Debtors may add Pounds 21 to community
charge', January 31) on poll tax surcharges to cover the cost of non-payers,
surely the answer to this manifest injustice is to index all poll tax debt
with an interest rate that covers the financial expense of delayed
collection plus court costs.
If this were coupled with a discount for early payment, it would allow the
local authority to borrow the shortfall on the open market and pass the cost
directly back to where it belongs, the late payers.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr MICHAEL W POYNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your story 'Air France to halt flights from Stansted' (January 29)
you report that Paris-bound passengers on Air France will no longer be able
to fly from Stansted and will have to restrict their choice to just two of
London's airports. What you do not mention is that in Paris there is only
one possible airport for flights to and from London - Charles de Gaulle at
Roissy.
There are six carriers - Air France, Air UK, British Airways, British
Midland, Brymon and Danair - with scheduled daily flights between London and
Paris. In London, passengers may select from four airports - Gatwick,
Heathrow, London City and Stansted - depending on time of travel,
geographical convenience and/or onward connections. In Paris, there is no
choice.
When are we going to be able to use Orly again? For passengers from London
with rendezvous to the south of Paris or with connections to other French
towns (many Air Inter flights to provincial destinations use Orly
exclusively) it is frustrating and time-costly to have to use Roissy.
Surely at least one of the six carriers could offer a service into Orly from
at least one London airport.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R D HARMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To relate maximum tax rates to a present rate of 40 per cent ignores
the charge on family income for those whose children are students at
college.
The 'parental contribution' imposes an additional tax at 18.75 per cent on
the joint income of both parents. Thus, the present marginal rate of tax on
income is almost 59 per cent. Under Labour proposals, the marginal rate of
tax would be 78 per cent.
The government imposed a massive increase in tax in the 1988 budget when it
abolished any tax saving from covenants for students. Overnight, family
costs increased by up to about Pounds 2,000 a year.
Additionally, families lose child allowance of about Pounds 700 a year at
the time when costs rise to their highest level.

Sir, As a house, we have long argued that the current suppression of
inflation is, as yet, more cyclical than structural in nature, and owes more
to recession than to sterling's entry into the ERM. What is more, the
benefits of the latter, in terms of the producer prices index (PPI), are
being negated by still high inflation in the non-traded goods and services
sector of the economy.
We are thus indebted to your own newspaper for once again forcing the point
home ('FT price rise', February 1). We note with interest that since the
beginning of 1988, the price of the FT has risen by one third while the PPI
has risen by less than 20 per cent. The financial markets should henceforth
read any comments in your newspaper about the supposed benefits of price
stability with some scepticism.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Heinz Kriwet, head of the Thyssen group, and paymaster to more than
50,000 of west Germany's steel workers, said last week that the weather had
turned, writes Christopher Parkes. After several years of progress with a
following economic breeze, he said, 'the wind is blowing in our face again'.
The outlook is unchanged by yesterday's last-minute about-turn in the pay
arena. There will be no strike. But there is worse to come for the workforce
than picket duty on freezing streets. And steel company shareholders will
feel the cold.
At least 6,000 of Germany's 130,000 steel jobs will go before December, and
many more are certain to be lost in the next two or three years. Thyssen and
the other leading steelmakers, Hoesch and Krupp, which together account for
more than half German production of 38,000 tonnes, are bracing themselves
for a painful and quick restructuring bout. The slow erosion of the
workforce from more than 200,000 in the early 1980s will now be followed by
cuts.
Barring calamities, the slow-burn takeover of Hoesch by Krupp should be
completed by the end of this year, and Thyssen will have bundled together
its mainstream Thyssen Stahl subsidiary with its loss-making special steels
division, Thyssen Edelstahl. When that is over, Thyssen is likely to reopen
talks on pooling resources in special steels with Krupp. The inevitable
result is job losses as the companies strive to regain competitiveness.
All three groups say they have already identified multi-million-D-Mark
savings, but all three still see no signs of short-term improvements in the
marketplace. Adverse trade winds, which blew Thyssen Edelstahl into a DM63m
(Pounds 21.90m) loss last year, blasted 22 per cent off the value of
incoming orders in the first quarter of the current year. Orders at Thyssen
Stahl dropped 6 per cent, and Mr Kriwet forecast a further profits fall for
1992 to follow last year's 42 per cent slump. According to Hypo-Bank, one of
Germany's leading banks, earnings per share at Thyssen this year will fall
from DM22 to DM16, and Hoesch shareholders can expect a DM3 drop to DM20.
Yesterday's pay deal, a basic 5.9 per cent compared with 6 per cent agreed
last year when demand from east Germany and the booming car industry
cushioned steelmakers from world recession, spells gloom for North Rhine
Westphalia, heart of the steel industry. The domestic market has become a
bed of nails: economic growth is slowing to about half last year's rate, and
the important car industry, faced with falling domestic orders, promptly cut
10,000 jobs in the last three months of 1991. A pay injection may have eased
some local symptoms, but in the end it can only exacerbate the disease
diagnosed as the main impediment to the health of German steel.
The IG Metall union yesterday declared itself pleased that steel pay was
being brought into line once again with engineering workers' rates. But as
Mr Kriwet pointed out before yesterday's deal: 'Steel companies are not in
competition with metal-working industries, but with steel businesses in
France and Britain, where wages costs even now are 30 per cent lower than
ours.'

FT  04 FEB 92 / Arts: Gertler, a story of doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At certain decent intervals the attempt is made to restore the reputation of
the painter, Mark Gertler. The last was nine years ago, at the Ben Uri
Gallery; the one before that, a touring show put together by the Minories at
Colchester in 1971. This latest retrospective study has been organised by
the Camden Arts Centre, which it now fills (Arkwright Road NW3, until March
8, then on to Nottingham and Leeds). Again, sadly, it just will not do,
quite. The trouble is clear and simple enough: his own life. Intriguing and
ultimately tragic, it was one of manifest talent and early promise followed
by years of struggle, doubt and failure, both critical and financial. In the
high summer of 1939, it ended in suicide, at the second attempt, at the age
of 47.
Gertler came of a Polish-Jewish immigrant family lately settled in the East
End. As with Epstein and Bomberg, his Jewishness was always to be a positive
element in his work, though not always overtly so. He was handsome, bisexual
and evidently charming, once he had overcome his youthful shyness. From his
student days he enjoyed the interest of powerful friends and supporters,
found largely within Bloomsbury and the broader circles of Jewish cultural
life. He had been recommended to the Slade by William Rothenstein, where he
was sponsored by the Jewish Educational Aid Society.
Later he was supported by the collector, Sir Edward Marsh, lionised by Lady
Ottoline Morrell, at whose house at Garsington he became one of her wartime,
pacifist coterie. He was an intimate of Lytton Strachey and his friends, and
indeed had been the lover of Dora Carrington whom he had met at the Slade,
who left him for Strachey. To be a painter in an essentially literary pool,
Bloomsbury's most important painter even, is not all that much: small wonder
that the circumstances of the life should so readily be entered as special
plea for work so long decently obscured and disregarded.
Gertler had been a star pupil at the Slade, in a period of conspicuous
stars, with such as David Bomberg, Paul Nash, Christopher Nevinson, Edward
Wadsworth and Stanley Spencer among his contemporaries. While not following,
with Bomberg, Wadsworth and the others, along Wyndham Lewis's Vorticist
path, he was radical enough in his way, in those pre-war years, aware of the
general work of the avant-garde. He was, if anything, closer to Spencer in
his symbolist figure compositions, with their mannered and exaggerated
groups, yet looking too at Matisse and Gauguin, seen at Roger Fry's
post-impressionist exhibitions, for practical example.
Yet he had won prizes for his drawing in the academic Slade tradition,
supposedly the best draughtsman since Augustus John though the line would
continue quite as well in the hands of such as Strang and Kennington. The
drawings shown here are fine, strong portrait studies, powerfully sculptural
in their modelling, the studies of his mother oddly close both in feeling
and likeness to those that Henry Moore would make of his own mother more
than ten years later.
These are indeed the work of the gifted, conscientious student, just as
there is the gifted, conscientious student in every generation. And it is
precisely this quality that gives us pause. Here is Gertler as a young man,
looking sensitively and intelligently now this way, now that and producing,
it must be said, usually creditable and sometimes positively beautiful
versions, but versions of something not yet, if ever, convincingly his own.
This search for an authentic personal vision was to become increasingly
desperate as his life went on and, quite as much as anxiety and ill health,
was eventually to kill him.
The irony is that it is in this early period, of the Slade and just after,
when the work is most various and yet unselfconscious in its acceptance of
other influences, that it seems most personal and true. The painting of his
mother, of 1911, is a straight-forward essay in the way of the Slade and the
New English Art Club, shades of Steer and Rothenstein, but none the worse
for that. The Violinist of 1912 is no more than the head of a young woman
with a mop of hair, set, as a Renaissance head might be, against a clear
blue sky, could hardly be stylistically more different in its close and
meticulous description. It is the single most beautiful image in the show,
and so distinct as it might be by quite another hand.
There is no doubting the competence, again the good student. The composition
is sound, the realisation unfailingly thorough whichever scheme or
convention proposed. But always the more modest and straight-forward the
work the better: the portrait that for all the mannerisms of handling and
surface betrays a true, transcending interest in the sitter; the still-life
that so engages the artist that he forgets himself, and his artfulness, in
its complete and little world. The later the work, the more uncertain it
becomes, a curiously decorative amalgam of Renoir and Cezanne misunderstood,
or increasingly desperate reworkings of the painting then coming out of
Paris, of Picasso especially.
I said, of the Ben Uri show in 1982, that it was easy to see how convincing
he must have seemed in his early days, and equally easy to understand how
desperate his sense of his own subsequent failure must have been. I thought
those later paintings extraordinary, flailing exercises in pastiche, but not
in any knowing or cynical way. Rather more poignant than that, they
suggested a repeated and despairing effort to catch the secret of another's
authentic vision. In this he inevitably failed, and stood revealed as a
truly tragic, unenviable figure.
In the light of this latest show, I would moderate that judgment only for
the 'flailing exercises in pastiche', which is clearly unfair. For the rest,
it stands. Gertler was an honourable, serious, sympathetic and persistent
painter, but never the outstanding artist his apologists claim and he tried
so hard to be.

Just under a year ago at the Wigmore Hall, French-Canadian pianist
Marc-Andre Hamelin was Sophie Rolland's partner in Beethoven's cello
sonatas. He offered a striking complement to her gentler muse: confident,
big-boned, imaginative playing, perfectly apt for the young Beethoven, and
yet always solicitous for the cello's softer voice. On Friday, his dazzling
solo recital in St. John's showed just how remarkable a pianist he is.
It consisted merely (merely]) of Schumanns's Carnaval and the concerto for
Piano Sola by Charles-Valentin Alkan, that obscure, obsessive
composer-pianist whose works took virtuoso writing almost beyond any
performer's limits. Just getting through the Concerto with a decent
proportion of the right notes, especially in public, is a trial so fearsome
that hardly anyone tries. Even with a seasoned Alkan champion like Ronald
Smith, the sense of reckless courage in the face of ever-present danger is a
constant feature of the performance.
Hamelin's account of Carnaval was rich and satisfying, marked out with bold
contrasts, interpretatively on sound, cultivated lines. His fingers were
more than equal to all Schumann's demands (his 'Paganini' was uncommonly
brilliant), and he also scaled down beautifully for the small, intimate
confessions. There were many things to admire and enjoy; but one was never
actually surprised, never made to hear something in a radically unexpected
way. Hamelin isn't that kind of virtuoso - and so much the better, some
would say.
With Alkan's Concerto, he demonstrated what kind of virtuoso he is. It is a
rare kind indeed: viz the kind for whom Alkan's mounting, torrential
challenges are so completely, even comfortably in hand that he can give his
full attention to expounding the music - lyrically, structurally,
intellectually - as if it were just as serious as Beethoven. Nothing sounded
'grotesque': rampant and slightly mad, yes, but cogent enough to justify its
monstrous scale. After such a performance, a swift collapse in the
green-room would be natural. In fact Hamelin plunged at once, superbly, into
encores of the same order, like Godowsky's left-hand version of Chopin's
E-flat minor Etude. Extraordinary.
*****
On Sunday the Queen Elizabeth Hall played host to Janina Fialkowska, latest
participant in the South Bank's current 'International Piano Series'. Her
programme choice was, among other things, a reminder that she has been an
Artur Rubinstein competition prizewinner in the early 1970s, and that
Rubinstein was her mentor in the last years of his life. A large selection
of Chopin in the second half and the choice of Szymanowski's Variations on a
Polish Folk Theme in the first - both of these were composers to whom
Rubinstein showed particular devotion - also served to highlight her special
strengths: crystalline articulation, absolute control in layering textures
and varying colours, formidable strength and speed in bravura passages.
Fialkowska is such a superbly gifted and musicianly pianist that her
intermittent failure to hold a listener's attention seemed puzzling. At this
stage in her career, strangely fluctuating tendencies can be sensed in
musical commitment - sometimes her performances come across as fully
'personal', mature and richly absorbed, sometimes merely facile (and, odder
still, sometimes unpredictably both).
The opener, Liszt's piano transcription of his BACH Prelude and Fugue for
organ, was flashy, not interesting. In the Mozart A minor Sonata, K310, the
approach was miniaturised, brittle, detached from any sparking engagement
with Classical discourse - and this in spite of numerous slow-movement
felicities. A piece called In the Stillness of the Seventh Autumn by the
pianist's fellow Canadian Brian Cherney proved a dispiriting combination of
eclectic modernism and droopy sensitivity.
My overall impression was of a remarkable technician who has yet to come
fully into her own as an artist. Throughout the recital there were
tantalising hints of how exciting it will be when she does.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Arts: Jommelli's 'Dido' - Lugo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lugo is a flourishing market town in the fertile, misty plain between
Bologna and Ravenna. Until recently, its chief visitors were livestock
traders; but then, enterprising local authorities, with considerable
financial effort and with impeccable taste, restored the 400-seat Teatro
Rossini, which dates from the mid-18th century and boasts an interior by the
great Antonio Galli Bibiena. Since the restoration was completed, five years
ago, the Rossini has annually produced one or two operas, chosen
intelligently with the theatrical space in mind and generally avoiding the
standard repertory.
This year's programme comprised a single, but important and fascinating
work, Niccol Jommelli's setting of Metastasio's magnificent drama Didone
Abbandonata. I should be more precise and say one of Jommelli's settings,
for he used the text three times; and Lugo - advised by the scholar Giovanni
Carli Ballola, who prepared the performing version - staged the third and
last Didone, given in Stuttgart in 1763, when Jommelli was court composer to
the Duke of Wuerttemberg. There, he had a good orchestra at his command, the
court choreographer was Noverre, and the Duke Karl was generously eager to
engage the best singers and designers.
The Teatro Rossini, especially in these lean times of Italian recession, has
to think in less sumptuous terms. Nevertheless, it was able to give the
audience a good idea of what the opera is like and what it must have meant
to a cultivated audience of two centuries or more ago. To begin with, Lugo
engaged the Bolognese architect Pier Luigi Cervellati to design the set,
inspired by Bibiena: an elegant grey-beige arrangement of columns and arches
with what looked like a drypoint vision of a towered and cupola-ed Carthage
in the distance. Elements were moveable, including a ghostly white ship
which appeared as needed. Cervellati, with Antonio Taglioni, was also the
sensible producer. Mariangela Capuano created handsome baroque costumes;
Mauro Mazzali made an impressive statue of Neptune.
Even with some minor cuts, this Didone made a long evening; and it must be
said that the young singers, brave as they were, could not always fulfil the
demands of the score. Fortunately, the all-important role of Enea was in the
hands of an ardent, assured mezzosoprano, Adriana Cicogna. As in most of
Metastasio's dramas, the conflict is more intellectual than physical. In
Didone there is some fighting, but indecision is the real enemy. Cicogna
made the hero's dilemmas real and cogent.
Understanding the text, a work of noble, seductive beauty, is of supreme
importance. Before and after Jommelli it was set by about 60 composers, from
Sarro, in 1724, to Saverio Mercadante 99 years later. Jommelli must have
loved the words, because, while he produced stirring or affecting arias, his
recitatives are supreme as he subtly underlines the speeches with nuanced
orchestra, strange textures, wisps of melody or simply what might be called
a vague sonorous ambiance.
At times the listener thinks of Monteverdi, but then there is a stunningly
modern effect. With unclear words, the audience could still appreciate the
superb deployment of the instruments (a sudden trumpet-soprano duet in the
last act was hair-raising), but the listeners could not enjoy the full
excitement. This was particularly regrettable in Dido's final monologue.
Maria Angeles Peters has a voice of some sweetness and agility, but not of
great power, and by the end of the opera, though she produced the sounds
acceptably, she was evidently tired and she failed to move.
As her sister Selene, the soprano Alessandra Rossi looked suitably unhappy
(Selene is secretly in love with Enea), too, but the voice was often
expressionless. The sole male in the cast, the tenor Ezio Di Cesare (Iarba,
the African king, Dido's enemy and suitor) sang forcefully; experts might
have said this was not proper baroque style, but it was convinced singing,
and it was appreciated.
With the exception of the Dido, all the interpreters seemed to gain
assurance as the opera progressed. Except for an occasional, perhaps
inevitable indulgence granted some sluggish singers, the conductor Amedeo
Monetti persuasively drew lively or sensitively-coloured played from the
reduced Orchestra Sinfonica dell'Emilia Romagna.
Many Italian towns the size of Lugo have charming opera houses. Of these,
the luckiest survive as cinemas, while others have been turned into
supermarkets, garages or ruins. Lugo has achieved then a double distinction:
it has saved a beautiful theatre and it has filled it with great music (and
capacity audiences).

FT  04 FEB 92 / Technology: Engineers by design - A degree course designed
to meet industry's needs beyond 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A future British Aerospace technical director, taking up the job in the year
2010, might have been sighted recently in a teaching hangar at Loughborough
University of Technology.
He or she would have been sitting on a plastic chair with back to an
opened-up Jaguar fighter aircraft, listening to university staff extolling
the virtues of their institution.
This putative director was an applicant for what the university, in its
prospectus, cautiously describes as 'a multi-disciplinary course aimed at
preparing you for a career concerned with the design and project management
of complex engineering systems'.
What makes this course different is not only that BAe will be paying for it,
at least for the first five years, but also that BAe and the university
designed the course together. The undergraduate study is tailored to fit
what Harry Thomason, the Loughborough pro vice-chancellor, called: 'The
concept of the kind of person BAe wants.'
The group wants to create an elite of systems engineers, the next generation
of technical leaders. 'They're going to head the company,' said Stephen
Grigg, soon to be appointed as BAe's director of educational affairs. The
first aspirants start their undergraduate studies at Loughborough next
October and should emerge as technological polymaths in 1997. That, at
least, is the hope.
The university claims that 'this is the first-ever degree course to be
designed from scratch for the needs of industry beyond 2000'. Certainly it
is a rare attempt to marry the intellectual rigour and independence, which
traditionally have been the base of academic life, to the ruder commercial
demands of industry.
Some universities would find the juxtaposition uncomfortable, but
Loughborough historically has had a strong vocational bias; indeed, it and
the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, in a country with a
notorious and chronic shortage of engineers, have the biggest engineering
departments among British universities.
Loughborough and BAe enjoy a long history of co-operation. The donation of
the Jaguar, precisely to enable students to understand how systems knit
together, is testimony to that. The genesis of the new course was a private
conversation between senior BAe executives and Thomason.
From this, it emerged that BAe could see the need over the next decades for
a new type of engineer but did not believe that British universities could
supply them.
This new type of engineer is a systems engineer. Someone who understands,
without being bogged down by detail, individual and specialised engithe
ability to knit these practices together to create a system or series of
interacting systems.
BAe hitherto has been creating its own systems engineers, explained Grigg.
'It takes them off a variety of courses and converts them, in an ad hoc
way.' The Loughborough venture 'turns the whole thing on its head. It puts
into people a breadth of engineering and an integrated approach.'
Instead of starting with the particular and going to the general, the
general approach is adopted from the start, with reference to the
particular.
The graduate from this course, once imbued with industrial practice, should
be in a position to manage research and development teams by talking to and
controlling specialist engineers. Products and systems as a whole will be
designed by teams: the old approach of designing the separate bits and then
trying to fit them together has gone for good.
But that is years away. Next October the first 50 students will start the
course. In 1997 they will emerge as M. Eng. (Systems Engineering). Of these
50, 40 will be sponsored by BAe; the remaining 10 will be selected by the
university through the normal university places clearing system.
There will be ample opportunity for BAe to decide whether it likes the
students and for the students to decide whether they like BAe. Although the
implication of sponsorship is that the successful graduate will join BAe,
there is no contractual obligation on either side outside the course itself.
BAe will pay the students Pounds 1,200 a year on top of what would normally
be received in grants, but the students will be expected to do vacation work
and a year of work experience at BAe. When they are at BAe, doing this work,
the students will be salaried employees.
Although BAe has been sponsoring university students around the UK for
years, the better to secure its corps of engineers, it has never before so
deeply committed itself to a university.
The teaching costs for each student will be Pounds 6,000 a year. BAe
representatives sit on a joint committee with university staff to review the
progress and content of the course. Alongside the undergraduate course, BAe
is contemplating new grants for research projects at Loughborough.
But the benefits are not all one way. Given the present system of university
funding, Loughborough would not have been able to start a new course without
financial assistance from the outside; it simply does not have the money.
The University Funding Council will not support new courses until they are
up and running, until there is proven demand. A university with a strong
vocational tradition and expansive ambitions has therefore little choice but
to forge partnerships with industry.
At the same time, the establishment of the course is a means of breaking
down departmental fiefs: it is genuine mix of engineering disciplines.
The degree course will be managed by Roger Goodall, the head of
Loughborough's department of electronic and electrical engineering.
But the course draws in seven other departments: transport technology,
computer studies, mathematical sciences, human sciences, mechanical
engineering, materials engineering and polymer technology.

<TEXT>
Football teams visiting British Aerospace's Woodford plant in Cheshire know
all about the sloping pitch, but not even the home side realised until
recently that they were playing on a parallelogram.
The revelation that one end of the pitch was 3m askew from the other came
from a survey of the 480-acre site. Sophisticated electronic logging
equipment charted the discrepancy in the course of plotting the site down to
the nearest inch or two.
The survey was the prelude to a new computer-aided approach to managing the
facilities adopted at the site over the past two years.
Manual drawings of the airfield and the assembly facilities nearby have been
almost entirely replaced by a Pounds 200,000 computer-aided design (Cad)
system from Isicad, a specialist in cable and facilities design, planning
and management.
Mike Fursey, Woodford's facilities planning manager, says BAe is already
benefiting from the Isicad system, particularly when investigating the
implications of change anywhere on the site, part of the airlines division
at BAe Commercial Aircraft.
Isicad's deal with Woodford took about two years to come to fruition, and
illustrates the challenges for manufacturing companies in selecting the
right equipment and software.
It also shows how the use of computer-aided solutions in more 'central'
areas such as product development and design - increasingly well-established
over the past decade - are spreading quietly into support areas which have,
until more recently, made do with their drawing boards.
Either way, one aim is to save time by cutting out laborious manual work.
But, as has happened with the use of computer-aided design and
manufacturing, the Isicad system goes beyond that: 'It enables them (BAe) to
do a hell of a lot that they would not have attempted before,' says Gerry
Berks, Isicad UK business development director.
One recent problem Fursey and his team were asked to address involved a
proposal to turn a disused short runway into a parking space for aircraft.
Calculating whether aircraft would have enough space to manoeuvre while
adhering to clearance regulations would have been a task bordering on the
farcical without the system, involving leaking paintpots hung from the end
of the wings to trace their path.
Instead, the Isicad system enabled the team to show within a day that the
runway could be used as a parking space with minor widening. One of the
benefits of such a system is the ability to take real measurements off the
screen once the initial surveys have been completed.
The team at Woodford had decided early in 1988 that it could no longer cope
with the site's scope and complexity using existing manual systems, and
opted for a computer-based solution rather than an increase in staff.
With the help of the Advanced Manufacturing &amp; Technology Research Institute,
BAe decided that workstations powered by a minicomputer would be best for
its needs, giving more power than a PC-based system, and more dependability
than a mainframe for use at all hours.
The Woodford site now has two Isicad workstations. The entire airfield has
been surveyed, along with most of a new assembly complex. Work is starting
on including the flight sheds.
The system is proving particularly useful for office reorganisations. The
time taken to produce agreed layouts can be reduced from three months to
less than a week.
Comparative costings can also be provided at an early stage in a project's
planning, as basic data on the cost of paint and ceiling systems are stored
in the system.
Reorganising aircraft manufacture is a difficult business. Working out
whether aircraft wings can be manoeuvred past stanchions and over low
buildings might normally have involved laborious construction of full-sized
cardboard mock-ups. With BAe's decision to move final assembly of the 146
airliner to Woodford, the implications of reorganised production can be
explored more quickly on screen.

THE MANAGING director of a Wrexham engineering company yesterday admitted
bribing an agent of Exxon Chemicals, a division of the US oil group.
Mr Colin Stuart, 56, of Chester, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court in
London to a charge that he corruptly gave Pounds 7,000 in July 1990 as an
inducement to Mr Robert Wanstall, a construction manager at Exxon.
The court heard that Mr Stuart had a series of meetings with Mr Wanstall at
London's Inn on the Park Hotel. These were in connection with a dispute over
payment for petrochemical work carried out at the Fawley oil refinery in
Hampshire by Dutton Engineering, Mr Stuart's company.
Exxon had made repeated demands for a detailed breakdown of how Dutton
arrived at its final demand of Pounds 110,000.
The Pounds 7,000 payment was made as an inducement to Mr Wanstall to resolve
the dispute quickly and favourably towards Dutton.
The case was adjourned for sentencing today.

ULSTER Unionist politicians yesterday stepped up their campaign for tougher
security in Northern Ireland after a Protestant deliveryman was murdered by
the IRA in Dungannon, County Tyrone, our Belfast Correspondent writes.
Mr Gordon Hamill was shot as he took bread to a supermarket. He is the 17th
civilian to be killed by terrorists in Ulster this year.
His death came 12 hours after the outlawed Loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters
shot dead Mr Patrick Clarke, a Catholic taxi driver.
There were fears last night that the latest killings could spark a series of
revenge attacks across the province.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, accused a 'gutless
government' of lacking the political will to tackle terrorism, and called
for the reintroduction of internment.
Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland Office minister, said the extremists
were attempting to drive a wedge between the two communities. He called for
public support for the security forces' efforts to rid the province of
terrorism.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Foot, the former Labour party leader, last night defended his
talks with the leaders of the Soviet Union in Moscow ten years ago in which
he unsuccessfully sought an agreement on the abolition of tactical nuclear
weapons.
He insisted that, far from being the 'scandalous behaviour' alleged by some
Conservative ministers and their supporters in the press, it had helped
negotiations forward.
Strongly condemning how The Sunday Times had reported the references to the
talks in archives obtained from the Kremlin, Mr Foot stressed that US
President Ronald Reagan had subsequently backed the so-called 'zero option'.
He said: 'If Mr Andrew Neil (the editor) is partly ashamed, something very
degrading must have occurred.'
Mr Foot recalled that Mr Denis Healey, then Labour's deputy leader and
shadow foreign secretary who accompanied him in Moscow, was widely regarded
as the most powerful 'anti-Soviet warrior of the lot'.
Mr John Reid, a Labour defence spokesman, accused the government of not
being interested in preventing nuclear proliferation, and having nothing
positive to contribute to international arms control.
Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister of state, said he deeply distrusted
the Labour party's commitment to keep Britain's nuclear deterrent.
He recalled that until 1991 Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, had been a
member of the unilateralist Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and claimed
that until very recently the party had been 'wholeheartedly unilateralist'.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Glasgow shows return of up to Pounds 14m as EC city of
culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW'S economy, tourism and culture received a strong boost in 1990 when
it was the EC's European city of culture.
The year, during which Glasgow provided an uninterrupted stream of cultural
events, is reckoned to have created more than 5,000 temporary jobs and
produced a net return to the regional economy of between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 14m.
The European city of culture accolade passes to EC cities in turn. Glasgow
says it was the only city to provide an all-encompassing programme running
for 12 months. Other cities to hold the accolade have provided concentrated
programmes of arts events.
This year the city of culture is Madrid. Last year it was Dublin.
A report by Mr John Myerscough, a consultant specialising in the economic
impact of cultural events, says there was an 81 per cent increase in visits
by tourists to arts events compared with 1986.
During the year attendance at theatres, galleries, halls and museums rose by
40 per cent.
The report says the cost to the public sector of creating between 5,300 and
5,600 jobs during the year was Pounds 7,286 per job, which compared
favourably with other job-creating initiatives.
The net gain to the economy of up to Pounds 14m took into account
public-sector support of Pounds 36m. The private sector contributed Pounds
6m, and total spending was Pounds 400m.
Mr Myerscough said Glasgow now needed to main-tain the momentum created by
the year of culture and to promote the city as a cultural tourist
destination, especially for the short-breaks market.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Party leaders seek to step back
from rows - Election campaigning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE leadership of the three main parties took a step back yesterday from the
bitterness of the weekend's campaigning, with appeals from party leaders for
the political debate to return to the issues.
Along with the row over the break-ins at party offices, there was still some
fall-out from claims that Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, had been
'smeared' by a story in The Sunday Times giving details of a discussion he
held with the Soviet ambassador in 1984.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, made it clear he was keen that the
election should be fought on the policy issues rather than personalities.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, and campaign
organiser Mr Des Wilson proposed an all-party meeting of the campaign
managers to agree some ground rules.
Labour claimed, however, that the prime minister's attitude was belied by Mr
Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman. Mr Patten yesterday wrote to Mr Roy
Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, challenging him to deny that a Labour
spokesman had indicated that Labour would try to involve Mrs Norma Major in
the election campaign.
There was some sign of a response to Mr Major's appeal in the muted reaction
of Tory backbenchers during the prime minister's Commons statement on the
United Nations summit. Tory MPs could have sought to use their questions to
exploit the Sunday Times' story, but the matter was not raised.
Labour still believes that the thrust of the Tory attack would be to
denigrate Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader.
Mr John Cunningham, the party's campaigns co-ordinator, said: 'If they want
to put a stop to personal abuse of the leader of the Labour party, why don't
they do it now?'
Speaking on BBC radio he reiterated the charge that Tory newspapers were
intent on damaging Mr Kinnock's credibility, but said that he believed the
smear campaign had now been exposed.
He added: 'We want to move on to the issues like education, housing and the
National Health Service.'
Evidence of Labour's readiness to move on came yesterday with the party's
launch of a fresh offensive against Tory policies on schools, under the
heading 'Pay as you learn'.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, published examples of how
parents were getting drawn into fund-raising not just for extras in their
children's schools but for items such as computers and other equipment for
the national curriculum.
If the Tories won the election, he said, 'schools in prosperous areas would
be forced to rely more and more on fund-raising, while those in poorer areas
would be forced to lower standards.'

Searching high and low: the hunt for a site for a central London heliport
took off again yesterday when the government announced a 12-month study of
the possibilities, Daniel Green writes.
The last proposal for a heliport, to be sited in the City beside the Thames,
was blocked by the government on the ground that the environmental
disadvantages outweighed the benefits.
The Confederation of British Industry said yesterday that London needed a
heliport to maintain its role as a leading financial centre.
The study, announced by Lord Brabazon of Tara, the aviation minister, will
be conducted by government departments, the Civil Aviation Authority, the
helicopter industry and London planning bodies.

<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Democrats yesterday took aim at the Bush administration's
Dollars 267.6bn (Pounds 147.8bn) defence budget proposal, unveiled last
week, complaining that the Pentagon was too reluctant to cut its armed
forces after the end of the Cold War.
Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who chairs the Senate budget
committee, led the onslaught, complaining that the administration's budget
proposal would trim only 4 per cent a year from spending, compared with
reductions that were already set at 3 per cent a year before the break-up of
the Soviet Union.
'It would seem to many unbiased observers that the reward for peace is
modest indeed,' Mr Sasser said.
Governor Roy Romer of Colorado, the chairman of the National Governors'
Association, urged President George Bush in a White House meeting to double
the Dollars 50bn savings he has planned on defence spending over the next
five years.
Speaking at a budget committee meeting with Mr Richard Cheney, the defence
secretary, and General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
Mr Sasser said the Pentagon's plans for reducing its force structure from 18
to 12 active army divisions and from 10 to six reserve divisions had been
devised at a time when the Soviet Union was fielding 190 ground divisions.
The 'base force' plan for 12 rather than 14 navy carrier battle groups was
laid out at a time when the Soviet navy had 240 surface warships operating
daily in international waters, he went on.
'Today, that entire Soviet fleet, which I frankly thought was greatly
overestimated, save for the submarine force, is in port and is dry-docked.
There's no fuel. There's no morale,' Mr Sasser said.
But Mr Cheney counter-attacked, demanding that Congress give him greater
freedom to make the defence cuts he wanted instead of compelling him to buy
equipment he did not want, such as the experimental V-22 Osprey aircraft or
the F-14 and F-16 fighters.
Mr Cheney and General Powell have argued that the base force structure they
propose is the minimum necessary to ensure that the US retains a strong
national defence, rather than a hollow force that will leave the country
unprepared for the next threat.

FT  04 FEB 92 / US 'double standards' under fire: George Graham weighs US
asylum policy as Haitians are sent home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US COAST Guard cutter landed in Haiti yesterday bearing the first of
thousands of Haitian refugees to be shipped back to their island home after
failing in their bid for asylum.
The repatriation began after the US government won court approval for its
action, after a 10-week judicial struggle reached the Supreme Court in
Washington.
But the policy faced immediate criticism from human rights advocates as well
as from Mrs Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Mrs Ogata said continuing reports of human rights abuses and violence
committed by security organisations in Haiti were a cause for great concern,
and pleaded with the US to delay the repatriation.
For the time being, at least, the administration is repatriating only
volunteers who have lost hope of winning entry to the US after being
interned for weeks at the US naval base of Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
But Brigadier-General George Walls, in command of the internment camp, said
he was ready to use force if necessary to complete the operation.
The US argues that the Haitian refugees - of whom more than 14,000 have been
picked up by the Coast Guard as they attempted the sea crossing to Florida -
are fleeing only poverty, not political repression. Officials claim that
there is no evidence that refugees face persecution when they return to
Haiti.
'The bulk of them are in fact economic refugees, and for that reason, can be
returned to Haiti without fear of their lives,' said Mr Richard Cheney, US
defence secretary, this weekend.
By keeping the refugees at Guantanamo, the administration has been able to
deal with them more summarily than if they had set foot on US soil. However,
since the Immigration and Naturalisation Service set up processing
facilities at the naval base, 3,400 Haitians have been found likely to
qualify for asylum, far more than had been expected.
Human rights organisations, however, say there is substantial evidence of
persecution by Haiti's police, and that the level of violence has increased
in the four months since a military coup ousted the government of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People have criticised US policy as racist, noting that lighter-skinned
Cubans are routinely granted political refugee status.
Politicians from Florida, which could be expected to bear the brunt of the
wave of Haitian immigration, as well as some leaders of the Cuban exile
community, have joined in the condemnation of US policy.
While the US is certainly open to charges of applying a double standard, it
may be more on the grounds of political hue than of skin colour.
'There is a double standard between communist and non-communist countries
that lingers,' says Dr Charles Keely, Herzberg professor of international
migration at Georgetown University.
'The second double standard is that the US sees things differently in its
own hemisphere; it doesn't want to become the Thailand of the western
hemisphere,' he adds.
The US has, in fact, firmly condemned the Haitian coup leaders as a military
dictatorship. Nevertheless, the US has for years been much more tolerant of
abuses by right-wing dictators such as as Haiti's Papa Doc Duvalier than
left-wing dictators such as Cuba's Fidel Castro.
The difference in policy towards Haitian and Cuban refugees today conjures
up shades of Franklin D. Roosevelt's dictum about Nicaragua's first Somoza
dictator: 'He may be a son of a bitch, but at least he's our son of a
bitch'.
The US's greatest problem is that it does not, in fact, have any ready
strategy for reversing the Haitian coup.
The trade embargo which it has enforced, in concert with the Organisation of
American States (OAS), has had its fiercest impact on the Haitian poor and
may, if anything, have accelerated the outflow of refugees.
Military action might work, but officials fear that it would inevitably
resemble the 19-year occupation that followed President Woodrow Wilson's
decision to send the Marines to the impoverished island in 1915, not the
rapid in-and-out campaign that overthrew General Manuel Noriega in Panama in
1989.
Underlying the US determination to turn back refugees is the fear that a
more welcoming policy would only stimulate an unmanageable flood, like the
Mariel boatlift from Cuba.
'The world works on a fiction that policy decisions are based on
humanitarian grounds. In essence, refugee decisions are political decisions,
and no amount of legislation will make that different,' concludes Professor
Keely.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Borough says staff taking pay cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHWARK Council in south London says more than 100 of its staff have
accepted a 5 per cent pay cut as the local authority attempts to win
contracts in competition with the private sector.
The council also says that the white-collar workers affected will suffer the
cut from the beginning of June - when 400 building workers will also have a
two-year pay freeze imposed. Both groups will lose four days of holiday.
The two unions involved believe the cuts will be restored in annual pay
negotiating rounds. Those take place in July for white-collar staff and
September for the blue-collar workers. The labour-controlled council
disputes that that will happen.
The deal, which was negotiated with Nupe, the public-service union, and
Ucatt, the building workers' union, will save the council about Pounds 1.8m,
according to Mr Keith Furnett, a management consultant who is advising the
council.
The council has put four contracts worth Pounds 20m out to tender for
housing repair and maintenance. The contracts will be awarded in the next
two weeks. Under compulsory competitive tendering arrangements, the council
must compete with the private sector to provide services.
In the past 14 months, 493 building staff have been made redundant. Up to
100 more jobs may go, depending on the results of the tender, due to be
announced on February 18.
The two unions say the agreements are subject to review and open to
negotiation. The council says its building staff will not receive any pay
under the national awards until other workers in the construction industry
catch up with the Southwark rates, which it says are inflated by local
enhancements.
The 400 blue-collar staff have also agreed to move to performance-related
pay. Staff will be paid per unit of work completed in addition to basic pay.
Last year the council won two of the contracts. This year, contracts are
likely to be awarded for between two and four years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS white South Africa's worst nightmare come true: thousands of black
squatters are to be settled in the verdant Johannesburg suburb of Randburg,
and the local white residents have taken to the barricades to keep them out.
Ironically, residents have turned to the black liberation movements for
their strategy in opposing a plan to move 10,000 to 20,000 squatters to an
area bordering one of Johannesburg's smarter suburbs. Reminiscent of street
scenes in the black townships of the 1980s, Randburg residents have erected
barricades out of barbed wire, tin drums and wood and decked them with
banners reading 'No squatters, not now, not ever'.
Borrowing the language of the African National Congress, the members of the
local resident's action committee proclaim their belief in 'people power' to
keep the squatters out. They say they will boycott taxes and rates,
mimicking the successful strategy adopted by the anti-apartheid movement to
defeat local councils in black townships. They plan mass street protests to
keep their suburb squatter-free.
Residents insist they are not racist: wealthy blacks are welcome to purchase
homes in the area, which includes middle-class homes of R130,000 (Pounds
26,000) to R180,000 and an area of expensive properties ranging from
R500,000 to R1m.
Instead, the plan is to develop a vacant area of 44 hectares for low-cost
housing - which in practice means providing serviced sites on which
squatters will build makeshift shacks from corrugated iron, cardboard, wood
and other scrap materials.
The dispute, which is now in the courts, highlights the tensions provoked by
the abolition by President FW de Klerk a year ago of legal segregation of
residential areas. Under apartheid, South Africa's cities were designed for
whites; blacks were viewed as temporary sojourners, accommodated in what
amounted to labour camps far from the city centre. Soweto, for example, is
at least 25km from Johannesburg.
Now, with statutory apartheid gone, ways must be found to house blacks
closer to potential jobs. So the Transvaal Provincial Administration has
agreed to purchase vacant land in Randburg - near an industrial estate and a
local commercial centre - and develop it for the resettlement of squatters
currently illegally occupying a nearby farm, Zevenfontein.
The provincial authorities now say they are reconsidering the plan, in light
of the Randburg residents' outrage. But with an estimated 2.5m people living
in shacks or informal housing in the Johannesburg area alone, more conflicts
of this kind can be expected. Whites hope that high purchase prices for
housing will maintain de-facto residential segregation now that legal
apartheid is gone; but the numbers are against them.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Feudal nonsense and monkey business ring in New Year:
China's family planners fear baby boom in auspicious year - after low-birth
Year of Sheep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ANCIENT Chinese superstition that babies born in the lunar Year of the
Monkey, beginning today, will enjoy good luck is bad news for China's family
planners trying to hold the birth rate down.
Babies born in the Year of the Sheep, which has just ended, have always been
considered ill-fated, especially girls who are said to be born to a life of
bitterness and tragedy. The superstition is so powerfully held it
contributed to an increased incidence of abortion and a lower birth rate
last year.
Forty per cent of the births which should have occurred in 1991 occurred in
1990 - the more favourable Year of the Horse - or were put off until 1992,
the Legal Daily newspaper reported.
Even city maternity hospitals were 'idle', according to Beijing
gynaecologist and obstetrician Professor Yan Renying, who told the China
Population Newsletter she had seen nothing like it in 50 years of practice.
A low birth rate means a good job has been done, she said, but not if people
were waiting to have a lucky 'little monkey'.
If the figures reflect delayed births on the part of deeply superstitious
peasants and even urban parents seeking to maximise the life chances of the
one child they are permitted, the number of births could soar in this
auspicious Year of the Monkey.
The Chinese calendar, based on the phases of the moon, gives each year of a
12-year cycle an animal symbol. The Year of the Dragon is especially
favourable because of its association with emperors, and there are also
years of the rooster, dog, pig, rat, ox, tiger, hare and snake.
Monkeys are blessed; they have a great ability to make money, are wise,
sociable and witty; it would be hard to find a bigger success story than a
monkey in a monkey's year . . . or so the legend goes.
Choosing the most propitious time to have a baby, especially when couples
can have only one, is so widespread that the Beijing Evening News published
a long article at the beginning of the Year of the Sheep calling the
superstition a lot of feudal nonsense.
It said many successful and famous Chinese had been born in the Year of the
Sheep, and quoted mortality statistics for sheep years since the 1949
revolution - 1955, 1967, and 1979 - to show there had been no increase in
the number of deaths during those years.
Younger women who reject such 'feudal superstition' can find themselves
pressured by their mothers and mothers-in-law. 'They do not want us to have
babies in the Year of the Sheep because they say girls born then will see
their husbands die young,' said the official China Women's Journal, quoting
a young woman who was forced to have an abortion by her family.
Prof Yan, former director of Beijing's No 1 Hospital, says more babies born
this year will put heavy pressure on available hospital maternity beds and
create problems for 'little monkeys' enrolling in kindergarten or schools,
and later in finding jobs.
It is obvious from the newspaper reports and from ordinary Chinese that the
old beliefs die hard. The communists have failed to wipe them out, though
not for want of trying. Beijing people will tell you many believe nine out
of 10 sheep babies are born to endure a life of tragedy.
In the often quite primitive countryside the superstition flourishes. Fewer
than 50km from Beijing there are villagers who have never been to the
capital, never seen a foreigner, and are prey to every ancient fancy passed
on from one generation to another.
China's worried family planners remain fearful of the consequences of being
unable to convince the population that all babies born under the same symbol
are not necessarily destined for the same fate. Put your faith in science,
Prof Yan advises. Don't rush to have a little monkey: Think of the problems
it will create for the next generation.

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT AND Sudan have become embroiled in a border dispute over oil
exploration in the Red Sea, and the argument seems likely to complicate
already tense relations between Cairo and Khartoum.
Egypt has advised all international oil companies that Sudan has no
authority to sign exploration agreements for acreage north of their
'political' boundary delineated by latitude 22 degrees north under an 1899
treaty.
Egypt was reacting to an agreement signed last month between Sudan and the
Canadian-registered International Petroleum Corporation for seismic work in
waters north of 22 degrees in an area Egypt claims as sovereign territory.
Sudan, however, believes an 'administrative' boundary, agreed in 1902, which
runs north of the political boundary, entitles it to allow exploration north
of 22 degrees.
The dispute could hardly come at a more awkward moment, with relations
between moderate rulers in Cairo and the Islamicist-dominated military
regime in Sudan under severe strain. It also coincides with reports of
recent troubles between Egyptian and Sudanese patrols in the triangle formed
by the 'political' and 'administrative' boundaries.
The 'political' boundary came into effect with the Anglo-Egyptian
condominium agreement of 1899. It was followed three years later by an
amendment that gave Sudan administrative responsibility for tribes north of
1899 boundary in the east.
Egypt was given responsibility for a small section south of the line about
half-way between the Red Sea coast and the Nile.
It is unclear whether the 'political' or 'administrative' boundaries have
international boundary status. This issue may in the end require
international jurisdiction.
In the meantime Egypt, which is keen to promote offshore exploration in the
Red Sea, is offering a large block which runs south to its 'political'
boundary with Sudan, and in fact includes acreage targeted for exploration
by International Petroleum.
In Geneva, International Petroleum said it was planning to go ahead with its
seismic survey in its 10,000 square kilometre Halaib block. A spokesman said
that until the Egyptians had complained he had not been aware that the area
was in dispute.
Egypt, through its embassy in Ottawa, informed the Canadian government, and
through it International Petroleum, that it regarded exploration in waters
off the area under dispute latitude as 'illegal.'
In Cairo, a spokesman for the Canadian embassy said the issue was under
discussion with both Egypt and Sudan. He said the Sudanese were insisting
they had a right to enter into exploration a greements for areas in their
'administrative' zone.

<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in remarks likely to
escalate the war of words between Japan and the US, told parliament
yesterday he had long felt that Americans 'may have lacked the work ethic,'
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
He told the budget committee of the House of Representatives: 'Because so
many American university graduates were recruited into Wall Street, the
number of engineers in charge of developing goods has declined.'
Mr Miyazawa made the remarks when Mr Kabun Muto, former trade minister,
asked for his views on trade friction between Tokyo and Washington. 'The
problem lies in the management of US plants, doesn't it?' Mr Muto asked.
The prime minister added: 'I think a similar case was found in Japan's
bubble (economy). It is important to have the sweat on one's brow to produce
added value.'
The Foreign Ministry said later that Mr Miyazawa did not intend to criticise
American people. An official said:
'The thrust of what the prime minister said in the Diet (parliament) was
 .to stress, as a part of his economic philosphy, the importance of
producing things and creating values by the sweat of our brow in our
approach to work.'
'The phrase 'work ethic' was used to explain such philosophy of work, and
the prime minister regrets any misunderstanding which may have been caused.'
The White House later said that disparaging Japanese remarks about American
workers were 'not helpful' but they could benefit the US in the long run.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said: 'These kinds of comments
are probably helpful in stirring the rages in all of us who want to compete,
and show who the best work force really is.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT said yesterday its banks must either merge or raise their capital to
internationally required levels after the government clears them of about
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11bn) worth of bad debts, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
'Although the solution to the problem of difficult debts will ease burdens.
. . this on its own will not be sufficient to achieve reform in the banking
and financial system,' said Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Saud al-Sabah, the
central bank governor.
'Merging appears to be necessary. . . the units that do not favour merging
will only have the option of increasing their capital base to required
levels in conformity to international requirements,' the Kuwaiti News Agency
quoted him as saying.
Economists in the emirate said the step would force its eight commercial
banks to merge because most of them were undercapitalised before Iraq's
invasion on August 2 1990.
Sheikh Salem did not say what capital adequacy requirements Kuwait would set
for its banks. But economists believe Kuwait and its partners in the
six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council are likely to adopt the 8 per cent
capital-to-assets ratio required by the Basle-based Bank for International
Settlements (BIS).
Since US-led forces liberated it from Iraqi occupation last February, Kuwait
has frequently said it would merge its banks into four bigger institutions
to help them operate profitably.
The scheme has been held up because of delays in implementing a government
plan to buy their debts by issuing bonds with a maximum 20-year maturity.

NEW ALIGNMENTS are being forged among the Philippines' diverse political
groups as the Friday deadline for registration for the May national
elections nears.
Over the past few days the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), the
strongest political grouping, has received a double boost.
First, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, Mr Marcelo Fernan,
announced he would be its vice-presidential candidate.
Mr Fernan, previously regarded as a strong contender for the presidency,
should boost the stock of LDP standard bearer, House Speaker Ramon Mitra. Mr
Mitra had lagged behind in popularity polls in recent months.
Yesterday, the LDP cause got further support from an unlikely ally - the
opposition Nacionalista Party of Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and former
senator Arturo Tolentino.
Although its members are currently split in three camps, the NP
Enrile-Tolentino wing will form a coalition with the LDP for the May
elections, in exchange for slots in the ruling party's line-up of candidates
for the Senate, House of Representatives and local government positions,
which are also at stake.
Mr Fidel Ramos, the former defence secretary who is the preferred candidate
of retiring President Corazon Aquino, has meanwhile declared as his running
mate Mr Emilio Osmena, the governor of Cebu province. Cebu has won national
admiration for sustaining a buoyant economy amid a slowdown in most parts of
the country. Mr Osmena's leadership is widely credited for the Cebu success.
However, the Cebu governor will be pitted against his younger brother,
Senator John Henry Osmena who has also just been drafted as the
vice-presidential candidate of Mr Eduardo Cojuangco under a separate wing of
the NP. The Osmena family enjoys a substantial following in the southern
Philippines, but the brothers' decision to run for the same position under
rival banners could split this support to the benefit of the other
candidates.
The family feud dates from the early 1970s when Mr John Osmena campaigned in
the US for support for the then newly imposed martial-law government of
former President Ferdinand Marcos. The Osmenas had opposed the re-election
bid of Mr Marcos in 1969, and Mr John Osmena's U-turn did not sit well with
the family.
There was a rapprochement in the mid-1980s when Mr John Osmena returned to
the Philippines and campaigned in Cebu against Mr Marcos.
The affiliation of Mr Fernan and Mr Osmena with the two main political
groups has narrowed the field of likely presidential candidates to eight.
Another prominent politician from Cebu, Mr Antonio Garcia de Escano, a
successful businessman and also currently a member of the Cebu provincial
board, is being considered as running-mate of presidential candidate,
Senator Joseph Estrada, who gained popularity originally as a movie actor.
Others who are expected to file candidacy bids by this weekend are
Vice-President Salvador Laurel, former immigration commissioner and
agrarian-reform secretary Miriam Defensor Santiago, and Mr Marcos' widow
Imelda.

computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDRANGE computers designed by ICL, the UK-based manufacturer owned by
Fujitsu of Japan, will be built in the Tatar Republic under terms agreed
last week by Mr Muhanmat Sabirov, the prime minister, and Mr Peter Bonfield,
ICL chairman.
The agreement commits the Tatar Republic, an autonomous republic within the
Russian federation, to financing the import of ICL computer components
between 1992 and 1994.
The components will be assembled into ICL's advanced 'Risc' computers by
ICL-KMECS, a joint venture which ICL established last year in the republic
with the Kazan Manufacturing Enterprise of Computer Systems (KMECS).
KMECS was the second largest supplier of computers in the former Soviet
Union, manufacturing Soviet-designed 'Riad' mainframe systems. Since the
fall of the union, local computer manufacture has collapsed. So far the
ICL-KMECS venture has been a distributor of fully assembled systems.
The computers to be built in Kazan will be sold and supported throughout the
former Soviet Union, ICL said.
Established there for over 25 years, ICL was in 1968 the first western
information technology company to be accredited to establish a Moscow
office.
The machines will be of 'open systems' design based on advanced processing
chips and the Unix operating system.

<TEXT>
IBM World Trade Corporation of the US and Tata Industries have launched a
joint venture in India to make computer systems, along with software
development, in which each will have an equity of Rs260m (Pounds 7.1m).
The joint venture will be known as Tata Information Systems but IBM
representatives maintained yesterday that their commitment to the company
was total. Its products will bear the brand name of IBM. The company will be
registered in Bangalore.
The joint venture marks the return of IBM to India after 15 years. It wound
up its operations in 1978 when it was asked to 'Indianise' its ownership
under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), which governs foreign
investment.
At the time, IBM's worldwide policy was that its subsidiaries in other
countries should be fully owned by it. Rather than partly 'Indianise' its
ownership, it chose to withdraw from India.
Since then, the attitudes of the Indian government and of IBM have changed.
FERA provisions have been changed and an equity ownership of 51 per cent is
allowed to foreign companies under the new foreign investment policies.
Equally, IBM has started joint ventures in other countries without insisting
on full ownership.
IBM's return to India is considered a breakthrough by the Indian government.
It considers it a sign that its liberalised foreign investment policy is
becoming acceptable.
IBM is making a direct investment of Rs260m under the new policy framework.
The joint venture will manufacture high end microprocessor systems.
Other IBM products will be taken up in response to market opportunities.
Both system and application software will be developed for export and the
Indian market.
The focus will be on OS/2 and AIX/Unix operating systems. The initial
project cost will be about Rs850m and will be funded by equity from Tata and
IBM as well as long-term loans. The initial import of capital equipment will
be covered by IBM's equity contribution.

FT  04 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Putting risk reality back into export
cover - The new ECGD chief's commitment to discipline in trade financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN Willott, newly-appointed head of Britain's export credit agency,
the ECGD, has declared that his leading international aim is 'to get premium
rates raised to reflect the reality of debt liabilities'.
The commitment sweeps him to the heart of one of the most controversial  -
and intractable - issues in export finance. It will be greeted with hollow
laughter from British exporters who complain that they suffer a severe
competitive handicap while the UK holds a solitary position among OECD
exporters in forcing export insurance premiums up to match risk levels more
accurately.
For many UK exporters, the villain of the piece is the portfolio management
system (PMS), introduced by the Treasury in May last year to impose
discipline on export credits to risky markets, or those where exposure is
substantial.
ECGD staff admit that PMS has led to higher costs for premiums to risky
markets. They also admit that costs average between one third and two thirds
more than premiums charged by European competitors. Exporters would argue
further: that cover in many risky markets is either unavailable or costs two
to three times as much as it does on the continent.
While it is far too early to signal to cynical exporters that a breakthrough
is in sight, there are nevertheless signs that foreign export credit
agencies - among them Italy's Sace, France's Coface, and Germany's Hermes -
are becoming increasingly anxious over the potential liabilities they face
as a result of their comparatively lax policies.
In addition, an OECD study due for completion in April will for the first
time allow accurate comparison of the 24-member industrial countries' export
credit insurance policies: enhanced transparency is expected to make
national treasuries more starkly aware of the potential cost of existing
policies. It is more doubtful whether stark awareness will prompt the sort
of policy changes Mr Willott strives for.
However, said Mr Willott last week, 'revealing the facts will generate a
fair deal of pressure'.
'We are not saying that premium rates should necessarily be identical in
every country for every agency. What we would be looking for is a regime
that gave a reasonable assurance that, over a period, the agencies are to
break even, taking one year with another. That must mean that other premium
rates come closer to us.'
Most openly alarmed is Germany's finance ministry, which until recently gave
struggling manufacturers in the former eastern Germany 'no questions asked'
export credit cover for sales to the former Soviet bloc.
The government had found itself in a vice: without the ability to continue
exporting to old markets in the east, many east German manufacturers faced
almost certain closure. At the same time, the exposure of Hermesto former
Soviet republics has risen to DM29bn (Pounds 10bn). Outstanding untied
government credits to the former Soviet republics, coupled with credit
approvals given in principle, lift this to DM63bn. Even more alarming, the
government faces a DM70bn backlog in applications for insurance cover to
these markets. This compares with a gross exposure by ECGD to the former
Soviet republics and Yugoslavia of no more than Pounds 1bn.
Close behind Germany is Italy's Sacewhich says its exposure to the former
Soviet republics totals L5,600bn (Pounds 2.6bn). Most of the agency's
exposure represents a conscious policy of encouraging trade with countries
from which Italy imports large quantities of energy supplies and with which
there are substantial trade deficits that need balancing. This has meant
that Sace has provided cover where other leading industrial countries have
slammed the door.
Argument between Sace and the Italian treasury over how to treat Soviet risk
provoked the resignation in February last year of Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the
Sace chairman. The debate centred on whether premiums should be raised to
cover increased risk and whether Sace should guarantee 100 per cent or
merely 90 per cent of the risk. Premiums have since been raised by 20 per
cent, and only 90 per cent of risk is covered.
Sace expects to pay out indemnities worth L2,400bn, with provisions for a
further rise to L2,800bn in 1992. It has been obliged to seek L1,800bn in
extra funds from the treasury in the 1992 budget to make up the growing
shortfall between indemnity payments and income from premiums.
Sace and the Italian government are under pressure from Brussels to create
greater transparency to ensure that political risk cover is not a disguised
form of subsidy. Nevertheless Mr Roberto Ruberti, the new head of Sace, told
reporters recently: 'ECGD's policy of portfolio management system, which
closely relates premium to risk, would not be acceptable here. It is the
only agency to have adopted such a rigorous policy, and the competition is
now taking advantage of it. Italy is saying 'No' to PMS unless the rest of
the world follows.'
France's export credit agency, Coface, which along with Sace has a
reputation for offering the cheapest export credit cover in Europe, also
acknowledges that past policies cannot be maintained. One adviser noted: 'We
should put up the rates - but even if you double rates, it becomes
prohibitively expensive, and still doesn't raise enough money to cover
funding costs.'

FT  04 FEB 92 / Serbian leaders' dispute threatens UN peace plans

<TEXT>
AN open dispute among Serb leaders threatened yesterday to derail UN plans
to deploy peacekeeping troops in Croatia, while the Croatian government
continued to impose obstacles to their deployment.
Mr Milan Babic, head of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in
southern Croatia, accused Serb and Yugoslav officials of using 'police
methods and physical torture' to gain his acceptance of the UN peace plan.
Mr Babic had refused to accept the plan - agreed last month between Serb,
Croat and federal army leaders - on the grounds that the peacekeepers should
be deployed on current frontlines, rather than in Krajina.
He also accused the Serb-dominated federal presidency and the army of
planning a coup d'etat in Krajina, and of forcing the Serbs from Krajina
into signing the peace document.
Mr Borisav Jovic, Serbia's representative on the rump Serb-dominated
Yugoslav presidency, denied plans to use the army against Mr Babic. However,
he warned that 'if political measures to implement the UN plan failed, we
will do it by state measures'.
Mr Babic's open criticism of the leadership in Serbia shows how prominent
Serbs are betraying each other in the struggle to remain in power.
In his bid to gain political autonomy for Serbs in Croatia, Mr Babic was
openly supported by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia. Now Mr Babic
is accusing Serbia of betraying Serbs in Krajina, while the Belgrade media
is saying Mr Babic is wrecking chances for peace.
The UN plan envisages withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia after the
deployment of peacekeepers in selected parts of the republic, but Mr Babic
continued to insist that 'Serb territorial units should not be disbanded'.
However, he said the government of Krajina approved in principle UN
involvement, adding he was prepared to hold talks with Croat leaders to find
a 'political solution' for Krajina.
Even if Mr Babic accepts the peace plan, UN officials face opposition from
Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia.
Mr Tudjman wants troops to be deployed in such a way that they will win back
for Croatia the third of its territory now under army and Serb control.
However, UN diplomats said yesterday Mr Tudjman was distorting the spirit of
the UN plan.
'The troops will be deployed only as peacekeeping troops. They are not there
to impose a political solution. Their role will be complemented by the
European Community peace conference,' a diplomat said.
The EC decided yesterday to restore trade concessions to all Yugoslav
republics except Serbia, but still expressed concern at lack of
co-operation, particularly on Croatia's part, in international efforts to
create a lasting peace, writes David Buchan in Brussels.
The decision leaves only Serbia facing economic sanctions. The other five
republics' tariff and quota concessions are to be restored to the level
enjoyed under the old EC-Yugoslav trade and co-operation accord. EC project
finance, however, remains frozen.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government yesterday retreated from its economic reform
programme in the face of sustained criticism from parliament, industrial
leaders, economists and the public.
The presidium of the Russian parliament was last night reported to have cut
the rate of value added tax on some foods from 28 to 15 per cent, which
would reduce government revenue by an estimated Rbs20bn-Rbs30bn.
Parliamentary leaders were also discussing rises in the level of social
security and pensions to protect the rising number of people living below
the poverty line.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform,
said yesterday that the changes were 'technical adjustments, but it is
important that these adjustments should not be chaotic and dangerous'.
He added that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, still stood firmly
behind the reforms.
The changes, details of which are still the subject of debate, are being
mooted at a time when hostility to the reform programme is growing louder.
Introduced on January 2, the programme has brought sharp rises in value
added, profit and export taxes, together with deep cuts in food and other
subsidies and an 85 per cent cut in defence procurement as a means of
balancing the budget and freeing prices.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Russian parliament and one of the
chief critics of the reform, yesterday told a congress of Russian farmers
that large parts of the economy, including the farming sector, should remain
under state control.
A meeting of prominent economists convened by Mr Khasbulatov over the
weekend concluded that the reform programme was 'not realistic', according
to Mr Pavel Bunich, who took part in the meeting. They called for a sharp
drop in taxes, and for continuing subsidies to loss-making industries, farms
and oil and gas production.
Mr Bunich, writing in Pravda, the former mouthpiece of the Communist party
leadership, said that 'a balanced budget is a good thing but not an end in
itself'.
It now seems likely that Mr Gaidar's efforts to bring in a balanced budget
in the first quarter, already modified to a forecast deficit of about
Rbs11bn, or 1 per cent of GNP, will be undercut.

FT  04 FEB 92 / OECD sees slowdown in steel decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE decline in the industrialised world's steel output should slow down this
year, according to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD).
The organisation's latest steel industry outlook predicts a fall of between
0.5 per cent and 1 per cent in OECD crude steel production in 1992, much
less steep than last year's 4 per cent decline. This is mainly due to
expected growth in its 24 member countries' average gross national product
of 2.2 per cent this year, as against 1.1 per cent last year.
Demand from the US and European car industries is expected to revive, but
demand from their Japanese competitors should weaken. Steel use by Canada's
housebuilding industry is expected to grow strongly, having been very
depressed last year, while non-residential construction should slacken in
the US, Finland, Norway and Switzerland, says the OECD.
Geographically, the OECD expects 'notable' upturns in steel demand from the
US and the Middle East, while Japanese steel consumption should decline by
6.4 per cent.
Employment in the steel industry continued to fall last year, by about 2.5
per cent overall, highlighting the continued need to reduce capacity - as
shown by the recent job losses at Usinor Sacilor of France and Bethlehem
Steel in the US. Overall capacity fell by 1 per cent last year, but the
decline in demand was still strong enough to cause a fall in capacity
utilisation to 76 per cent, from 78 per cent in 1990.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Monday Interview: Full speed ahead for 'Fujimobile' -
Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When agricultural engineer and university rector Alberto Fujimori decided to
run for President of Peru, a campaign organiser told him to forget it. Even
a seat in the senate was unthinkable. Mr Fujimori fired the consultant and
got his family painting posters and distributing leaflets. He pressed into
service an elderly tractor as a campaign vehicle that soon became known as
the 'Fujimobile'.
That Peruvians chose as their president this political novice, of Japanese
parentage, backed by a rag-bag party of unknowns was a measure of their
disenchantment with traditional politicians from right and left. In a decade
of democracy after 12 years of military rule, they had opted for a
free-spending, patrician elder statesman and then for a young, charismatic
populist who left Peru on the verge of economic collapse.
As a first generation Peruvian made good, Mr Fujimori provided hope for both
immigrants and the mixed-race majority, traditionally despised by the ruling
Hispanic elite. The antithesis of his predecessors, he came to power
offering a new direction. Accurately reading the Peruvian mood, he named his
party 'Cambio (Change) 90'.
Once the jewel in the Spanish imperial crown, Peru had become one of the
poorest countries in South America. At home, the state was under threat from
left-wing guerrillas. Abroad, it had defaulted on all its foreign debts and,
partly as a result, had become an international pariah.
In 18 months of government, Mr Fujimori has not solved Peru's problems. But
even his critics admit he has made progress towards his goal of radically
changing the country. 'In legislative terms,' says a confident Mr Fujimori,
'there is virtually nothing left to do. What we must concentrate on now is
putting our reforms into full effect.'
Among successes, he has reduced inflation from an annualised 3,000 per cent
upon taking office in July 1990 to about 4 per cent a month; tax
collections, while still inadequate to cover essential services, have
doubled; a bloated and inept state bureaucracy has been trimmed; financial
and commercial reforms have converted Peru into one of the most liberal
regimes in the continent and relations with international financial
organisations have been normalised.
However, austerity has plunged more people than ever into poverty and
economic reform is reckoned by critics to have benefited only a small group
of businessmen. Mr Fujimori is under attack as an autocrat for ruling by
decree and by-passing the legislature. He has been criticised for his
closeness to an army accused of human rights violations, and for using
repressive measures to combat the guerrillas.
In the faded splendour of Lima's government palace - an operatic stage-set
of a building complete with marble halls, French gilt mirrors and
magnificently-attired story-book soldiers - Mr Fujimori cuts no dash. His
private office is austere. He sits with shirt sleeves rolled up, a
flickering television screen permanently showing the silent images of a
favourite afternoon soap opera.
Mr Fujimori is a self-proclaimed pragmatist and technocrat. His Spanish
lacks eloquence, his vocabulary is limited. Not for him the rhetorical,
sonorous discourses of his predecessors, Mr Fernando Belaunde and Mr Alan
Garcia. He rarely departs from the text of competent but dull speeches, read
in a tightly controlled monotone. Even his occasionally colourful verbal
attacks - he has called judges 'jackals' and parliamentarians 'pachyderms' -
are rehearsed.
But for a man who lacks a power base, he has attacked some of Peru's most
powerful institutions. The judiciary, Congress and the Catholic Church have
all felt his waspish tongue. Establishment ripostes frequently smack of
racism - the jumped-up 'chinito' (Chink) - but the average Peruvian admires
oriental hard work and honesty and Mr Fujimori has learned to joke about the
shape of his eyes.
In recent months, Mr Fujimori has been travelling more. Late last year he
went with an entourage of Peruvian businessmen to the US, Europe and Asia to
court potential investors. He has started a bridge-building exercise with
traditionally hostile Ecuador and has signed a treaty giving landlocked
neighbour Bolivia access to the Pacific. Trade and economic benefits
underpin each diplomatic initiative.
This week, he arrives in Britain, primarily to deliver a lecture at the
Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew on ecology and the environment on a visit
likely to attract demonstrations from environmentalists, human rights groups
and supporters of the guerrillas that are fighting the government.
Peru has recently awakened to the fact that, as the principal world producer
of coca, the raw material from which cocaine is made, it possesses at least
one product in which the international community is intensely interested.
'The subject that interests me most is drugs trafficking, in relation to
ecology' he says.
'I'll be raising the alarm over the damage being done to the Amazon basin by
the drugs trade,' says Mr Fujimori. Processing coca leaf into cocaine paste
or base releases thousands of tonnes of kerosene, sulphuric acid and
quicklime into Amazonian tributaries, while jungle hillsides are ravaged as
growers slash and burn trees to make room for the lucrative coca bushes.
He will aim to present Peru as caretaker of a unique world treasure. Mr
Fujimori hopes to win economic help from governments, including those of the
US and Spain, in the drugs battle. But private sector contacts are higher on
the Peruvian agenda.
Foreign investment is needed elsewhere in the economy too. Last year's 2.4
per cent economic growth rate made scarcely a blip in a steep 23 per cent
decline over the preceding three years.
But for all its mining, fishing and agro-industrial potential, will foreign
businesses come to a land where an 11-year guerrilla war has already cost
some 25,000 lives and Dollars 20bn in material damage? Mr Fujimori's eyes
gleam with messianic conviction. 'I am certain that I will defeat terrorism
before I leave office. We are making real progress in pacification.'
Although many Peruvians are not so sure, the president claims the government
is winning its battle against South America's deadliest left-wing guerrilla
groups, the Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and the MRTA (the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement). Both are finding 'they have little physical
or political space to manoeuvre now that the population as a whole is
supporting us more.'
Initial parliamentary reaction to presidential decrees on what he calls
'pacification' was hostile, but much of his plan has now been accepted. The
president will personally lead a new 'united pacification command' to
co-ordinate civilian and military strategy against the guerrillas. He has
made the controversial move of arming peasant self-defence groups, the
'rondas', who now form the front line (cannon fodder, say opponents) against
terrorism in the generally lawless Peruvian countryside.
The army and 'the people' are now the twin pillars on which the Fujimori
government rests. In a strategy to bring the two closer, the army is now
charged with 'civic action' programmes, helping rebuild badly deteriorated
road infrastructure, providing basic medical assistance and distributing
international food aid to rural communities.
Mr Fujimori is also pledging this year to start implementing a social
emergency programme to cushion the impact of his economic reforms. The
ending of subsidies on basic foodstuffs and higher prices for public
services has plunged another 5m Peruvians into 'extreme poverty'. More than
half of Peru's 22m people now exist below the poverty line.
The Fujimori knack of reducing apparently insurmountable problems to simple
steps is disarming to some, alarming to others. 'It all boils down to
planning and methodology,' he says, whether it's getting elected president
or beating the continent's deadliest guerrillas.
Making a virtue out of an absence of organised support, Mr Fujimori likes to
claim he has no personal allegiances. 'My four children and my wife are my
only friends,' he says. A succession of overworked ministers and advisers,
summarily tossed aside once their usefulness has expired, can testify that
loyalty is not a presidential failing.
Increasingly, his tersely authoritarian public style - which conflicts with
a mild-mannered, gently humorous private disposition - is being called
dictatorial. 'It's just my own personal style,' Mr Fujimori insists,
'neither oriental nor Peruvian; and I haven't developed it since becoming
president. I've always preferred tough, outspoken criticism to the silence
of complicity.'

FT  03 FEB 92 / Beware of an absence of hindsight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The silliest and one of the most durable of all investment slogans is: 'The
market is always right'. If markets had perfect knowledge and rational
foresight, they would never move except in reaction to genuine and
significant surprises, and there aren't very many of those. In the real
world markets are far more volatile than the economy.
But for that very reason, the second silliest slogan - which is in any case
remembered only during ugly awakenings - is: 'You can't fight the
fundamentals'. For much of the time you can and do. That is why 'active' -
which means short-term - investors do much better following the charts than
studying the fundamentals. Fundamentals are for the lazy, who like to review
their portfolios only at long intervals or at moments of stress. Oddly
enough, they often come out ahead in the long run.
For the ordinary mortal, though, knowing when to follow the fundamentals,
and how long you dare ignore them, is the whole art and fun of the thing. A
time like now, when equities keep rising as the current situation gets
worse, is the time when such a decision has to be faced. Do the markets know
something ministers and economists don't know? Or is this just another of
those speculative climaxes which are so easy to recognise with hindsight? If
you can keep your head when all about you are indulging in wishful thinking
. . .
The strongest argument in favour of current values is in fact the vaguest:
recessions are usually relatively short, and this one is already getting on
in months. Since recoveries are normally invisible until they have been
running for quite a time, the market's timing looks quite plausible. That is
what you might call normalised hindsight, and it is a powerful argument;
indeed, you can reject it only if you believe this is not a normal
recession, or if you are seriously worried by the fact this is not the
justification being offered by brokers at the moment.
There is no need to spend too much space on the thesis (advanced by Lord
Rees-Mogg) that we are suffering not a recession, but a debt deflation,
because any regular reader of this column already knows it by heart. The two
strongest arguments in favour of this idea are, first, as Mr Nigel Lawson
reminded us last Monday, the recession started and persists in precisely
those countries which previously enjoyed a runaway credit boom; and, second,
that it was forecast only by those economists who were expecting a debt
deflation, and not by those expecting a normal cycle. I find this
persuasive; you may not.
The more widely supported bearish thesis is based on our membership of the
European Monetary System. You may believe the historical version - that we
went in at too high an exchange rate, and are repeating the history of the
1920s. Or you may simply observe that every inflation-prone country that has
joined the ERM has had a hard time for some years. Either way, a sense of
history - the respectable name for hindsight - should make you at least
question the comfortable belief in a normal, though so far invisible,
recovery.
But perhaps the easiest way to get alarmed is to listen to a broker
explaining the market's strength. Brokers have given up talking recovery,
since the government gave economic optimism a bad name, and now base their
case simply on falling inflation. When inflation fell in the early 1980s,
they explain, London market yields fell well below recent levels; so now a
fall in yields can be expected again. Buy now while stocks last.
This is the worst kind of selective appeal to history: cite the facts that
support your case, and ignore the rest. It ignores most of the background to
the 1980s bull market - a strong recovery in the profit share of national
income, a falling pound which further boosted profits, strong economic
growth (which not even the optimists now expect), and a level of profit
distribution which left plenty of room for hope. We now have a weak dollar,
a reasonable profits share, and dangerously high distribution levels.
The falling-inflation case is not in fact a serious argument at all. It is
simply a broker talking his book. (Remember Harris's Law: dealers never know
why prices are moving, because they are too busy moving prices.) And it is
not only sloppy as recent history; it completely ignores the more distant
past. Inflation is the debtor's friend; so in a debt deflation, a sagging
price trend means that things are getting worse, not better. President
Roosevelt understood this well in the 1930s, and opened the champagne at the
first news of rising prices.
If this kind of thinking was restricted to brokers fumbling for something
plausible to tell their clients, it would only be a subject for a little
gentle ribbing. What is serious is that the same kind of sloppy thinking
seems endemic among those we pay to think seriously - economists, banks,
directors and political leaders. The whole rightwing counter-revolution in
the English-speaking world has been led by conservatives (some nominally
socialist) who seem to have no sense of the past.
For instance, consider again Mr Nigel Lawson: 'A financially deregulated
economy, while more efficient and more dynamic, is less stable . . .' This
is not argument, but assertion, and arrogant at that; for it brushes aside
as fools all the governments down the centuries that thought it necessary to
regulate markets. We would be safer in the hands of the Prince of Wales, who
has a vivid sense of the past, even if it does make him a bit timid.
The claimed advantage is suspect, too. More efficient and dynamic than what?
Than the highly regulated Japanese economy, or the subsidy-ridden German
one? And can an economy which is less stable really be more efficient? The
whole argument suggests that those who brush aside the past are also blind
to the present.
Mr Lawson handsomely admits that he 'greatly underestimated the demand
effects' of deregulation; but that is because he wouldn't listen to the
fuddy-duddies who could remember even the recent past. More hindsight,
please.

FT  03 FEB 92 / BAe chairman struggles to find a successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR GRAHAM DAY, the interim chairman of British Aerospace, is engaged in an
increasingly difficult search for a full-time successor after his favoured
candidate, Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Courtaulds and Reuters, turned
down the post.
Sir Christopher was first asked whether he was interested in the job shortly
after Professor Sir Roland Smith was forced out as chairman last September.
Sir Christopher, who is increasingly absorbed by his chairmanship of
Reuters, the financial information services group, has told Sir Graham that
he is not interested in the job.
His decision is a severe setback for BAe as his stature and track record
would have been welcomed by the City and the company's industrial partners.
In the 1980s he oversaw the rationalisation of Courtaulds' sprawling
chemicals and textiles empire, and its eventual demerger into two companies
 -Courtaulds, a speciality chemicals producer, and Courtaulds Textiles.
Many City fund managers and analysts believe that similar radical surgery is
required at BAe.
BAe's senior management has been increasingly beleaguered since the autumn
when a profits warning was followed by a mishandled emergency rights issue.
The company's standing with City institutions fell further last month when
the company was forced to disclose that Mr Dudley Eustace, its finance
director, would be leaving the company in the spring.
Sir Graham is still hoping to announce the appointment of a new full-time
chairman and a replacement finance director around the time of the company's
annual meeting in late April or early May.
City analysts and fund managers would prefer a chairman with a sound
commercial and industrial background rather than an aerospace specialist.
Many feel an outsider would have a clearer picture of BAe's strengths and
weaknesses.
After Sir Christopher's rejection, attention is likely to focus on Sir James
Blyth, a non-executive director of BAe and chairman of Boots, the chemists.
Sir James, a former senior executive with Plessey, the electronics group, is
well qualified for the post. However, he turned down the job in the autumn
and it is thought he wants to stay with Boots.
Another candidate thought to have been mooted by headhunters working for BAe
is Mr Chris Lewinton, the chairman and chief executive of TI, the
engineering group. Mr Lewinton is highly regarded in the City for the
transformation of TI since 1986 from a diversified engineering group,
heavily dependent upon the UK, into an international company focused on
three main product areas.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Inquiry into school arson rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILD arsonists are wreaking millions of pounds of damage to British
schools, according to insurers who will today announce their backing for a
research initiative into the problem.
The cost of damage caused by arson attacks has doubled over the past five
years and is already leading to a rethink about the design of school
buildings.
It may prompt the government to back costly new fire prevention measures.
Evidence suggests that in some areas, such as Tyneside and Strathclyde,
school arson is becoming endemic.
Municipal Mutual, the company which insures four out of five local
authorities, reports that claims from all school fires cost it more than
Pounds 57m in 1991, up from Pounds 47m in 1990 and Pounds 18m in 1987. More
than two thirds of the claims stem from fires started deliberately.
The insurer reported 84 fires costing more than Pounds 100,000 each in 1991,
compared with 51 five years ago.
Mr Larry Stokes, fire underwriting manager at Municipal Mutual, said the
average cost of school fires had risen sharply. He said this reflected the
increased use schools were making of electronic equipment such as computers
and videos.
The research is being launched by the Arson Prevention Bureau, a joint Home
Office and insurance industry initiative set up last year. The bureau has
asked a team of academics to examine the causes of the fire attacks. There
is also increasing concern among educationalists about the long-term costs
of arson such as the disruption of classes and the loss of project work and
records.
The APB investigation is also expected to look closely into ways arson can
be prevented.
It will examine possible changes in building design, the introduction of new
safety and security devices and risk management techniques already being
deployed by some headteachers and school managers.
Insurers say all schools are lagging behind the private sector in the
introduction of alarm and sprinkler systems, and protective fences.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Next Irish premier likely to be Reynolds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, the rebel former cabinet minister, looked set yesterday
to become Ireland's next prime minister after his main rival decided to back
him, Reuter reports from Dublin.
Mr Charles Haughey, who has dominated Irish politics for a decade, agreed to
step down on Thursday after accusations that he knew about the phone-tapping
of two Dublin journalists in 1982.
Mr Reynolds, 55, sacked by Mr Haughey last November after leading a failed
party mutiny against the prime minister, is now likely to enjoy an easy road
to victory after Mr Bertie Ahern, the man who replaced him as finance
minister, decided not to contest the leadership.
Mr Ahern, at 40 the youngest member of the cabinet, said: 'I think it's far
less divisive to rally behind one leader and I am backing Albert.'
He denied that his decision not to stand had been prompted by his admission
that he had separated from his wife and backed divorce, which is banned in
predominantly Roman Catholic Ireland.
Mr Ahern, much praised for the budget he presented last week, said of his
leadership ambitions: 'I worked on this for three days. Albert has been
working on it for three years.'
He added: 'After Albert Reynolds, I will be the next Taoiseach (prime
minister).'
The new leader will be picked by the 77 deputies in the ruling Fianna Fail
party on Thursday. The winner needs to have a simple majority.
Mr Reynolds said: 'I am becoming more confident with every day that passes.'
Mr Ahern, who reckoned he had the support of about 32 deputies against 36
for Mr Reynolds, did not expect all his backers to switch to Mr Rey-nolds
but said his former rival should win easily.
The other candidates in the leadership race are the health minister Ms Mary
O'Rourke, trying to become Ireland's first woman prime minister, and Mr
Michael Woods, the agriculture minister, whose chances of victory as a
compromise candidate always looked slim.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Letter: Misleading view on Mexico's exchange rate policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALEJANDRO FOXLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was disturbed by your suggestion ('Mexico gambles on parity with
dollar', January 23) that I believe the Mexican finance minister, Pedro
Aspe, is courting disaster with his exchange rate policy. I have never said
such a thing.
I have long been critical of the policy pursued by the previous government
in Chile of freezing the exchange rate in nominal terms. This created a
serious crisis because of the very slow convergence between domestic and
international interest rates. This in turn made Chilean producers lose their
competitive position and suffer enormous losses and bankruptcies, and caused
a collapse of a large part of the financial system.
I have discussed these views at length with my friend Pedro Aspe and other
Latin American finance ministers, so they are well known and widely shared
by my colleagues.
Your comment gives a wrong impression about my opinion of Mexico's economic
policy. I have enormous admiration for what President Salinas and his team
have achieved and will continue to achieve in the economic field. I think
Mexico is implementing a set of economic policies which are not only sound
but appropriate to Mexico's exceptional circumstances. Our own economic
policy is very similar to theirs and the results in both cases are very
solid.
Mexico has not fixed the exchange rate but is following exchange rate rules
fully consistent with the excellent condition of its balance of payments.
And if they were to fix the exchange rate in the future, it would not be my
role to comment on it, because each country has specific circumstances that
may justify such a policy. In the late 1970s, the policy did not work in my
country; that does not mean it will not work in other circumstances, for
example in present day Argentina.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Rival models of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are now so many libraries of books on privatisation that even reading
them is more than a full-time job. It is therefore extremely useful to have
within the covers of one pamphlet an analysis of British experience.
Privatisation Everywhere* has been written by John Moore, who was a minister
at the Department of Energy and then financial secretary of the Treasury
with a special responsibility for the subjects, before his spell in the
Cabinet as secretary of state, first for transport and then for health and
social security.
Many mainstream economists were initially sceptical of privatisation, not
because they were enthusiastic about nationalisation but because they
believed that competition was what mattered and that ownership was
unimportant. The economic analysis of property rights - not very developed
in the UK when privatisation started - suggests, on the contrary, that
ownership is crucial. Moore summarises the reasons as the inevitable
subordination of commercial to political objectives in state concerns; the
absence of the bankruptcy threat; and the weakening of the link between
customer gratification and financial success.
The sceptics have been persuaded to lie low partly by the popularity (after
the event) of privatisation in Britain and other western countries, but even
more by its prominence in the reform programmes of the ex-communist
countries, almost irrespective of the political hue of the reformers.
Governments in central and eastern Europe and their western advisers are
united in believing that it is not enough to free prices and remove other
controls unless managers have a direct personal stake in the profitability
of their enterprise. A further condition is, of course, a functioning
monetary system, which is not required to finance sky-rocketing government
deficits. But I will not enlarge on the latter problem.
John Moore writes from an unashamedly British background. He points out that
legitimate political worries about, for instance, foreign ownership or the
continuation of uneconomic but socially necessary services can be
safeguarded either in the privatisation legislation or through normal
government powers - the 'golden share' under which governments can prevent
an undesired sale - was a British invention. The author is perhaps
over-enthusiastic on the 'RPI minus X' formula for price regulation of the
still monopolistic public utilities. But he legitimately points out that
political opponents have shifted their demands from re-nationalisation to
arguments about how to tighten the regulatory regime.
He is rightly scathing about the hostility of senior City figures to mass
shareholding. The head of one big brokerage house explained: 'But John, we
don't want all those kind of people owning shares, do we?' In fact, the
original BT sale amounted to double the new issue capacity of the market as
estimated by the professionals. Not before time the government realised that
it was too much at the mercy of professional bankers and brokers and made
these experts compete for highly lucrative privatisation business by means
of so-called beauty contests.
Doubt sets in, however, when the author boasts about the increase in the
number of individuals holding shares from 7 per cent to 25 per cent of the
adult population. Assuming this degree of mass ownership was more expensive
for the government than outright sale to institutions at the best price,
then the losers have been the other 75 per cent. Unfortunately, Moore
dismisses the alternative of 'free' distribution to all citizens on the
ground that 'what we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly'.
Whatever the pros and cons of free distribution in the UK context, it looks
very different in the ex-communist countries where very few people can
afford to subscribe for conventional privatisation issues. There are three
basic options:
Sales to foreign investors, which at least bring in some hard currency and
release resources for domestic investment or consumption;
Mass distribution by some variant of vouchers, as in Czechoslovakia or
Poland today;
Handing over to existing management and workers, which in practice will
often mean the former communist appointees.
So great is the urgency that all three methods have to be used. Even the
third cannot be ruled out for small and medium-sized enterprises. The same
manager may behave differently if his personal fate depends on
commercially-earned profits rather than satisfying the local party chief in
a heavily rigged market.
Cultural change is also required. None of these three methods will yield
good results if a Russian manager believes that the key to successful
competition is breaking the windows of his competitors or overturning their
trucks. But a start has to be made somewhere. The lessons from Britain, in
which about one tenth of the economy was taken out of state control over 13
years, need to be modified before they are used in countries where far more
enterprises have to be transferred far more quickly in much more elemental
conditions.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Letter: Why not a level airport?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM NAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Paul Betts has sadly fallen into the habit of several other aviation
correspondents when referring to London City as 'the loss making airport,'
while Stansted is described as a 'Pounds 400m complex'.
I have no quibble with either description in isolation, but within the same
article ('Zurich jet service brings boost for City airport', January 30) why
bias the reader one way or the other?
If we wish to describe airports according to their profit-making ability,
let's refer to both Stansted and Gatwick as loss-making airports in line
with their 1991 published accounts.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Letter: Brands too valuable not to be in balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M MURPHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex, in its tirade against brands and other intangibles on the balance
sheet (January 30), has got it wrong. Lex comments that 'the Savoy name
would be worth rather more to Mr Rocco Forte than it would be attached to a
boarding house in Blackpool'. But the Savoy's kitchen equipment would also
be of more value to Mr Forte than to a small Blackpool boarding house, yet
the Savoy's kitchen equipment is accommodated quite readily on the balance
sheet.
Lex then argues that 'accounts are there to allow the user to judge future
cash flows'. If we accept this definition, as brands are for many companies
the key determinants of future cash flow, it is particularly important that
they do appear in accounts.
Finally, let us consider Maxwell. Lex implies that MCC's collapse
illustrates the inappropriateness of putting brands on the balance sheet,
yet virtually the only assets which will emerge unscathed from the wreckage
will be the brands and publishing mastheads.
In today's world the 'worth' of a company frequently resides more in its
intangible assets (brands, patents, copyrights, software, etc) than in its
tangible assets, yet current accounting techniques are rooted in the 19th
century and virtually ignore the importance of intangibles in contemporary
wealth creation. Railing against brands on the balance sheet is
inappropriate; Lex should be championing their inclusion.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Showing tonight, a picture of chaos: The French government's
television deregulation drive is in deep trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At six o'clock this evening, the deadline for rescue bids for the ailing
French television channel La Cinq, Mr Hubert Lafont, the company's
administrator, will thumb through the dossiers on his desk to see whether a
rescuer has emerged to keep the station going.
On New Year's Eve, Hachette, the indebted media group which ran La Cinq and
is one of its biggest shareholders, told the staff that the channel was
filing for bankruptcy.
La Cinq is the first serious casualty of the French government's TV
deregulation drive. Its plight bears testimony to the problems of the rest
of French TV. Only one of the five commercial TV channels is making money.
The rest are in the red, as is the struggling cable sector. This has
provoked demands for reform of the whole broadcasting system.
The prospects are far from reassuring. The slowdown in the economy, which
has already depressed the FFr14bn (Pounds 1.43bn) TV advertising market, is
expected to worsen. The independent contractors which provide production
facilities for the main channels are threatened by bad debts after La Cinq's
collapse.
This gloomy picture is very different from that painted in the early 1980s,
when France's socialist government announced its plans for TV deregulation.
It believed its proposals, which were heavily criticised inside and outside
France at the time, would be a model of a modern media policy - cultural
dirigisme in a mixed economy. The aim was to foster plurality by bringing
private capital into the then state-owned TV system to launch new channels,
thereby offering more choice.
But deregulation went only so far. The government was worried that France
might follow the example set by Italy where deregulation had heralded an era
of dozens of uncontrolled - and uncontrollable - private channels pumping
out soft pornography.
It was also anxious to prevent the new stations from filling their schedules
with cheap US series; private channels would then be forced to buy French
programmes and thereby promote the development of independent producers and
facilities. As a safeguard, the government retained its right to intervene
by imposing restrictions on ownership, programming and advertising.
As expected, deregulation prompted an increase in the number of competitors
in the domestic broadcasting market. At the start of the 1980s there were
three state-owned channels, TF1, Antenne 2 and FR3; were three new private
stations - Canal Plus, La Cinq and M6 - and a privatised TF1, run by the
Bouygues construction company, as well as the two remaining state channels.
But instead of the virtuous combination of cultural diversity and commercial
buoyancy envisaged by the government, French TV is in chaos. The supposedly
pluralist system is dominated by one channel - TF1 - which has thrived in
the private sector and now commands more than 40 per cent of the French TV
audience and 50 per cent of the advertising market.
The power of TF1 has left the other stations scrabbling for advertising
revenue. A2 and FR3 are in the red; although state owned, they are partly
financed by advertising and have been affected by the economic slowdown. M6
is still struggling to break even. TF1 apart, the only successful station is
Canal Plus which, as a pay-TV channel, makes most of its money from
subscriptions, not advertising. The other channels are locked in a vicious
circle; their viewing figures are not high enough to attract advertising
away from TF1 and, as a result, they do not have enough money to invest in
the new programmes they need to increase their audiences.
The worst case of all is La Cinq, which tried - and failed - to compete
directly with TF1. In the past year or so its finances have been so strained
that it has resorted to broadcasting cheap pornography, to the horror of the
regulatory authorities. La Cinq made a loss of more than FFr1.1bn last year,
slightly more than its overall turnover.
'The crux of the problem is that there are too many channels chasing too
little revenue,' said Mr Claud Ravilly, finance director of Canal Plus.
'There is a limit as to how many mainstream channels the advertising market
can support. Three is probably the maximum. Five is too many.'
La Cinq's collapse has, temporarily, at least, helped to alleviate this
problem. It is possible that it will find a rescuer. So far the only
would-be saviour to have stepped forward is Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
Italian media magnate who is one of its larger shareholders. However, his
bid may not be acceptable to the French government given that his Italian
stations broadcast exactly the kind of pornographic programmes that the
socialists were eager to avoid in France.
If no suitable rescuer comes forward, La Cinq will go off air. Its likeliest
replacement would be the current affairs channel - a French version of CNN,
the US round-the-clock news format - recently proposed by TF1, Canal Plus
and M6. They claim such a channel would be financially viable, as a
low-budget service funded partly by selling its own advertising and partly
by the revenue they expect to gain after La Cinq's demise.
There would then be four mainstream commercial stations. Most observers of
the French media sector believe, like Mr Ravilly, that there is only room
for three. The likeliest scenario is that the government might merge the two
remaining state channels - A2 and FR3. So far though, it has given no
definite indication that it plans to do so.
In the meantime the government could try to aid the TV industry by relaxing
state restrictions on advertising - which are stricter for the state
stations than their commercial rivals - and programming. These restrictions
range from a ban on TV advertising for certain products, such as most forms
of retailing, to a stipulation that at least 40 per cent of all programmes
be made in France.
Some observers claim that these constraints impose an unfair burden on the
TV companies by artificially inhibiting the growth of advertising revenue
and inflating overheads. The '40 per cent French' rule alone is estimated to
add 20 per cent to programming costs.
'It is a ridiculous situation,' said Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European
media analyst at Morgan Stanley Securities in London. 'You can't expect
commercial TV companies to fend for themselves in a competitive market when
they are shackled to the ball and chain of government regulation.'
The government has, in recent years, made slight modifications to the
advertising constraints. This may reflect the fact that these restrictions
are partly a legacy of the era when France's powerful regional press used
its political influence to try to curb TV's potential as a competitive
advertising medium. Given that a number of the leading regional press
publishers, notably Hachette and Havas, are now big investors in TV, the
situation today is less sensitive.
On programming, the government shows no sign of relinquishing its controls.
The lynchpin of its arts policy under Mr Jack Lang, the powerful minister of
culture whose brief includes broadcasting, has been to protect the French
language and France's heritage. Mr Lang recently fought a fierce campaign in
Brussels over the '40 per cent' rule.
One area of broadcasting where the government does seem prepared to take
action is cable. The French cable system is struggling to build an audience
in the face of hefty losses and an embarrassingly high 'churn', or
disconnection rate. Ten years ago, when the socialists unveiled their 'plan
cable', they forecast some 1.25m subscribers by 1992. But cable's progress
has been so slow that fewer than 700,000 homes subscribe.
One reason for cable's problems is that, just as TF1 has drained advertising
revenue away from the other commercial channels, so the popularity of Canal
Plus has made it difficult for cable to attract subscribers.
Earlier this month the French cabinet ordered a review of the cable sector.
The collapse of La Cinq has led to calls for the government to do the same
for the rest of the broadcasting arena. So far there has been no response
from the government, probably because it is desperate to distance itself
from the political embarrassment of the La Cinq debacle.

Had trouble getting hold of the FT recently? Then look no further than
Harvey Nichols, the Knightsbridge department store. Its display windows are
crammed with sculpted piles of FTs. There is even a huge head with its

The up-market store, which prides itself on the originality of its displays,
used 100,000 copies. The bad news for Observer and colleagues is that the
papers were not bought, but given away . . . and that was before the price

Great minds think alike. Or so it would seem from the Times Literary
Supplement's observations on Melvyn Bragg's novel A Time to Dance about an
affair between a bank manager in his mid-50s and an 18-year-old secretary,
whose TV adaptation has variously titillated or appalled Britain's
chattering classes over the past three weeks.
In the novel, the TLS points out, Bragg's hero rhapsodises about his young
lover's name, Bernadette, as follows:
The three syllables, softly clacking my tongue against my palate. Bern - how
urgent, how hot] A - the pause, a sigh the fulcrum of anticipation; dette -
the stab, the claim.
What a coincidence, then, that 30-odd years in advance of Bragg's 1990 novel
Vladimir Nabokov's middle-aged character Humbert Humbert should have
rhapsodised thus about the name of his 12-year-old step-daughter lover,
Lolita:
Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the
palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.

With the life assurance industry under fire for its sales practices, it
might seem that the self-regulatory regime has fallen somewhat short of its
goals. But not to the Association of British Insurers.
In a submission to Sir Kenneth Clucas, who has been charged with overhauling
the current regulatory regime for retail products, the ABI urges the
creation of a new super-retail regulator. This would require the merger of
two existing self-regulatory bodies, Lautro and Fimbra.
But there's a catch. For the merger to be acceptable to the association,
half the combined outfit's directors would have to be life assurance
industry representatives. The rest, the ABI concedes, could come from 'other
providers, independent financial advisers and public interest
representatives.'
The association argues that this is justified because its members represent
the lion's share of the market and will pay a commensurate amount of the new
body's costs. Talk about self-regulation]

In true coals-to-Newcastle spirit, Tyneside businessman Michael Reay is off
to this week's International Camel Symposium in Dubai to sing the praises of
his company's feed products to Arab racing-camel owners.
Reay's Newcastle-based Equine Products, founded 10 years ago and now
exporting a quarter of its Pounds 750,000 annual turnover, has hitherto
catered primarily for horses, from Derby winners to Shetland ponies. But
with help from the department of trade and industry's export information
service, Reay is now cultivating the racing-camel market, where he sees big
sales growth potential.
At the invitation of the Dubai royal family he will address the symposium on
camels' training and dietary requirements, giving his audience the benefit
of his seven years behind-the-scenes observation of camel races, a popular
Middle East sport, and his discussions with vets, trainers and dieticians.
Trials of the company's products are already under way in the desert to see
how food additives could improve racing camels' performance, if not their
tempers.

UK readers may have wondered at the author's by-line behind yesterday's
circulation-ramping Sunday Times extravaganza on 'Kinnock's Kremlin

In fact Sebastian left the BBC a few years ago to concentrate on writing
political thrillers, although he has since undertaken a series of reporting
assignments in Moscow for BBC TV news on a freelance basis.
How come, then, that Sebastian did not take his world exclusive to the Beeb?
The answer is that he did, but the BBC current affairs editors decided the
story wasn't worth the cost of a film crew.
Anyone who bothered to read the predictable out-pourings of the Soviet
embassy in London will be inclined to agree with the BBC's judgment.
Conservative Central Office, however, will no doubt consider it yet another
act of Broadcasting House treachery.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Hard slog for Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOEVER succeeds Mr Charles Haughey as prime minister of the Irish Republic
will have the daunting task of trying to run an economy which is
geographically peripheral to mainstream Europe and where unemployment is
about 15 per cent - much higher in some regions - and emigration is still a
central problem.
On the face of it, Mr Haughey's imminent departure may look like the passing
of a generation which had its roots in the old Ireland. That is to
underestimate, however, how much has been achieved in the years when he
alternated in power with Dr Garret FitzGerald. Ireland now is a more or less
contented member of the European Community: relations between Dublin and
London have improved beyond recognition and it has become possible to
contemplate dropping the formal Irish claim to the whole of Ireland.
Although the Anglo-Irish agreement was negotiated on the Irish side by Dr
FitzGerald, Mr Haughey has played his full part in sticking to it. Even on
cross-border security, he has been reasonably helpful. On the economy, while
he has been occasionally profligate, his government has moved to a more
self-disciplined position, as last week's budget showed. Yet it is a gauge
of the problems that Ireland faces that it has to run remarkably fast simply
to stay in the same place.
Old-style politician
The customary charge against Mr Haughey is that he was an old-style
politician who ran his party and the country like a Mafia: uno duce, una
voce, as the Irish Times has commented. Yet you can only do that if the
prevailing society allows. Ireland did allow it. It is notable that none of
the candidates for the succession are putting forward very radical plans for
change. Ms Mary O'Rourke, the health minister, for example, says that she is
opposed to the repeal of Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution (which lay the
claim to govern the whole of Ireland) on the grounds that 'for us and our
party they are very important and we subscribe to them'.
A more damaging charge against the outgoing prime minister is that, like
other leaders in other countries, he stayed too long. The succession of
scandals and accusations of croneyism were becoming embarrassing if not so
much for Mr Haughey at home as for the image of Ireland abroad. Houdini had
begun to give the country a bad name. Nevertheless, his departure will not
necessarily produce a substantial change of policy.
Challenges ahead
The challenges for his successor are to establish a sustained economic
growth rate way ahead of the European average, to reduce the level of
unemployment, to attract inward investment and to encourage Irish
entrepreneurs to stay at home. Again, however, it may be pointed out that
that was precisely what last week's budget was designed to do. Mr Bertie
Ahern, the finance minister, acknowledged the debt to the financial
transfers from the EC, which he described as 'our other homeland'. He
outlined a considerable reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement
 -down to just over 2 per cent of gross domestic product. Success in the
battle against inflation - down to 3.2 per cent - compares favourably with
that in other countries. But, he added, unemployment remains the biggest
social and economic problem.
Given modern communications, there is no definitive reason why a small,
outlying economy should not be a success story. It is a matter of finding
niche markets and, particularly in Ireland's case, further developing
tourism. Yet there is one area where the Irish economy remains peculiarly
distorted: that is the economic disunion between the two parts of the
island. It is there - in the joint development of trade, agriculture and
industry between north and south - that progress most needs to be made.
A new prime minister may not be expected to change the constitution
overnight, but he or she could take note of economic imperatives and resolve
to embark upon a long hard slog.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Management: Bouquets and barbed ire - Total Quality / Martin
Dickson finds sharply contrasting views of a top US award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apostles such as Robert Galvin, chairman of electronics group Motorola, call
it 'the most important catalyst for transforming American business' methods.
Dissenters say it is nothing of the sort and may even represent a religious
fervour of dangerous, destructive proportions.
In its four-year life, the 'Baldrige' prize (more formally known as the
Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award) has become the subject of
controversy among US management experts - a debate which has just
intensified in the pages of the Harvard Business Review.
The controversy is hardly surprising, since the award - ceremonially handed
over by the US president to up to six companies a year - centres on a kind
of corporate religion.
The creed in question is Total Quality Management - TQM to the faithful -
which has been one of the hottest topics in US business theory for the past
decade. At its simplest, this means focusing all a company's energies on
improving the quality of its work.
The Baldrige gives awards to companies which have excelled at TQM, and
winners undertake to share their knowledge with other US businesses.
'More than any other initiative, public or private, it has reshaped
managers' thinking', says David Garvin of the Harvard Business School. It
has set off 'America's rediscovery of co-operation as a national strength',
adds Donald Peterson, Ford Motor's former chairman.
Critics, however, fault it on a number of counts, complaining variously
about its methodology, focus and philosophy.
The most cynical point out that it has been won by subsidiaries of several
large US companies which at present are hardly examples of financially
successful American businesses - IBM, General Motors and Westinghouse
Electric.
All three are struggling and their shares have performed dismally in recent
years. Indeed, some on Wall Street view a Baldrige award as the kiss of the
death for a company's shares.
The debate may find some echo over the coming months in Europe, which has
copied the idea of the Baldrige: next autumn, the Dutch-based European
Foundation for Quality Management will hand out its first award for TQM.
The origins of the Baldrige lie in a simple American emotion: fear of the
efficiency of the Japanese industrial machine and a desire to emulate it.
There is great irony in this, since modern theories of quality control
originated in the US between the first and second world wars. But US
companies largely ignored the ideas and it was left to the Japanese to apply
them rigorously, a lesson they learnt from US advisers sent to rebuild the
shattered economy in the late 1940s.
In the early 1950s, the Japanese instituted their own quality prize and
named it after W Edwards Deming, the foremost of those American advisers.
The US finally followed suit in 1987 with the Baldrige award, which was
named after a US Commerce Secretary who died in a rodeo accident.
It is run by an offshoot of the Commerce Department, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology, and gives up to two awards a year in each of
three categories - manufacturing, service and small business.
Companies nominate themselves and have to submit a lengthy application form
describing their quality practices and performance. Those which score well
are visited by a team of examiners for a detailed look at their operations.
What are the Baldrige judges looking for? Firstly, adherence to the
underlying tenets of the quality movement. These include a belief that the
customer is the most important judge of a company's quality.
It is also deemed important for the company's top management to create clear
quality values, that the workforce be fully involved, and the whole
enterprise aim for continuous, long-term improvement.
Companies should also be trying to build bridges with outsiders, such as
suppliers and the local community, and be responsible corporate citizens.
The judges examine a business under seven categories, awarding points in
each area. In order of priority, these are: customer satisfaction, quality
results, human resource development and management, management of process
quality, leadership, information and analysis, and strategic quality
planning.
The current controversy was set off by the Harvard Business School's Garvin,
a former member of the Baldrige's board of overseers. In a lengthy article
in the Harvard Business Review, he claimed criticisms of the award
represented 'deep misunderstandings', and concluded the Baldrige was
positioned just right. That sent many management gurus rushing to their word
processors. The issues in the ensuing debate include:
Financial performance. Garvin and his supporters say it is meaningless to
fault the Baldrige for not rewarding financial success since it is not meant
to measure this, but total quality management processes. Financial success
can depend on other factors, such as luck. Nevertheless, Garvin reckons the
award is a 'strong predictor of long-term survival'.
Critics say the award does not honour superior product or service quality,
pointing to the example of General Motors' Cadillac division, which won the
award at a time when surveys showed American consumers did not rate its cars
very highly.
Again, Garvin dismisses this as beside the point, saying the Baldrige is not
meant to reward product excellence alone, but more a company's management
systems and processes. The Baldrige bashers say this approach sends the
wrong message to corporate America. Says Phil Pifer, of management
consultants McKinsey: 'The Baldrige needs to reinforce that 'just do it' is
not enough if you don't do it right'.
The philosophy of the award. The critics say that no coherent philosophy
underlies the Baldrige, unlike its Japanese equivalent, which is based
firmly on the ideas of W Edwards Deming - himself a strong critic of the
American prize. Since the world of TQM is so full of clashing academic egos,
each with its own approach, the organisers of the award merely lay down a
list of broad quality criteria, without prescribing how a company should
achieve them. Garvin defends what he calls this 'non-denominational
approach, with a strong ecumenical flavour', but says it does not mean that
the award lacks a general philosophical direction.
The impact on US companies. Defenders of the Baldrige say that it has had a
significant effect in waking up American managers to the need for TQM - a
prime reason for starting the award in the first place. According to Robert
Galvin at Motorola, another past winner: 'Those companies that embrace the
Baldrige are beginning to make giant strides. The difference between the
alert business leader's attention to quality today versus 10 years ago is
like night and day.'
However, the critics say there is a grave danger that the Baldrige, with
most of its points going to management processes rather than market place
results will simply encourage a knee-jerk, 'check the box' approach to
quality issues.
McKinsey's Pifer warns that his consultancy is 'seeing a disturbingly large
number of companies whose total quality management programmes are failing to
show signs of meaningful business impact. More and more senior executives
privately express reservations or concerns to us about the eventual impact
of their quality activities.'
An important contributory factor, he says, is a blind pursuit of TQM, when
quality or the other benefits of such a programme may not be the most
important priority for a company. 'The Baldrige award contributes to this
problem, by perpetuating the religious fervour and universal appeal of TQM.'
Garvin, however, gives short shrift to such apostasy. And to those who argue
that the Baldrige is stuck in the middle ground, neither a reward for
all-round corporate excellence, nor narrow, traditional quality control, he
says that that is precisely where it should be: any narrower and it would
not attract the attention of top management; any broader and it would become
impossible to judge.
He does acknowledge one flaw - the award is a competition with a limited
number of winners, rather than a qualification prize which any number can
achieve.
The latter approach, he says, would enhance the co-operation among
businesses which the Baldrige is meant to promote.
Yet Garvin's satisfied tone itself seems at odds with the spirit of the
award, with its strong emphasis on the need for companies to strive for
continual improvements in their working practices.
As Shoji Shiba, a visiting professor at MIT's management school points out:
'When you consider something 'ideal', you lose the opportunity to improve
it'.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Labour condemns training underspend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT budget to provide Employment Training places for the long-term
adult unemployed in England and Wales for this financial year was underspent
by Pounds 70m in November, according to a leaked Department of Employment
document.
Some of the money, which amounts to nearly 10 per cent of the annual budget
of Pounds 802m, is to be used to meet overspending on other training
schemes, including Youth Training.
The Labour party claimed the underspend showed that the government's
training schemes were in a state of chaos.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour employment spokesman, accused the government of
raiding the ET budget to cover its guarantee to young people of a place on
Youth Training.
He said one reason for the ET underspend was that unit costs, the amount
provided to train each participant, had been held down. That had reduced the
number of employers wishing to take part.
The Department of Employment said that it was normal practice for government
departments to switch money from one budget to another.
Spending of money earmarked for ET was a matter for Training and Enterprise
Councils and there was a variety of reasons why the full budget had not been
spent, it said.
It was possible that Tecs had been particularly cautious on spending in the
early part of the year because they wanted to meet demand later. None the
less, the full year is likely to show a significant underspend and the
deparment said that adjustments to training budgets would be made in the
spring.
Separately, the Labour party issued an analysis showing that the proportion
of YT leavers entering a full-time job fell from 64 per cent in 1989-90 to
53 per cent in 1990-91. The proportion of trainees obtaining a qualification
dropped from 43 to 38 per cent.
Mr Henry McLeish, shadow employment minister, said that the analysis, which
is based on Department of Employment statistics, showed that YT was
inadequate and should be replaced.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Return to grammar schools signalled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, yesterday signalled the
widespread return of grammar schools.
Up to one in 10 schools should be free to choose children according to
academic ability if parents and governors want it, he told BBC 1's On The
Record.
He said: 'I have no objection to the re-emergence of grammar schools if that
is what people want, if it is adding to the education system for all.'
Mr Clarke reinforced the Conservative commitment to a diversity of schools
so that parents could chose the type best suited to their child. This meant
greater parental choice, not the return of a two-tier system.
It would not cause prob-lems if as many as 10 per cent became selective,
said Mr Clarke, who believes that nearly all secondary schools would become
grant-maintained if the Conservatives won the election.
He said he would look favourably on applications from opt-out schools to
become grammar schools where plans were well-judged and had parental
support. The decision would depend on there not being too many grammar
schools in the same area.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Large majority predicted for merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians predicted
yesterday that their members would vote overwhelmingly for a merger in a
ballot that begins today.
After a three-week campaigning tour taking in 30 cities they said they
expected the 1m members of the two unions to vote by at least four to one in
favour of merger.
Amalgamation of the unions would create a powerful rightwing force in union
politics and might take the EETPU back into the Trades Union Congress.
Leaders of both unions have promised a vote of all members within the next
year on TUC affiliation. The EETPU was expelled three years ago for failing
to carry out TUC instructions to withdraw from two single-union deals.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, and Mr Eric Hammond, his EETPU
counterpart, said yesterday that they would ask other unions in
manufacturing to join them in a union that could counter the growing power
of multinational corporations.
They would also ask the Engineering Employers' Federation for national
negotiating rights for a white-collar section to be formed after a merger.
Voting in the ballot will last all this month, with a result expected early
next month. If approved, the new union would initially have an executive
combining equal numbers of AEU and EETPU leaders. The final constitution
would be drawn up within four years.
If the vote is in favour, Mr Laird would become general secretary for two
years. He would be succeeded by Mr Paul Gallagher, EETPU general
secretary-elect, who would hold office for up to two years.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Managers' pay doubled under Thatcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THATCHER years saw British managements double their earnings and become
less Oxbridge-dominated and better qualified, according to a survey of
British Institute of Management members published today.
At the same time, they changed jobs more often and had to work longer hours.
Managers were five years older on average in 1990 than in 1980. By the end
of the decade he - she remained very much the exception - was more likely to
work in commerce, rather than industry, to own part of his company and to
have mellowed in his attitude to trade unions.
In 1980 the average manager's annual earnings were Pounds 10,000 to Pounds
15,000. By 1990 that had grown significantly more than inflation to Pounds
20,000 to Pounds 30,000.
The study finds that reductions in the higher levels of taxation during the
decade contributed to greater affluence, particularly for senior managers in
the private sector.
Middle-class origins still prevailed at the end of the Thatcher reign but -
her successor will be cheered to learn - 'not to such an extent (as) to
suggest that there is no possibility of social mobility within our society'.
More than half of all managers had degree-level qualifications by 1990,
compared with about a third in 1980. Oxbridge representation among those
with degrees fell from 14 per cent at the start of the decade to 7 per cent
at the end.
A shift to the sciences was pronounced. In 1980, 12 per cent of managers had
a science qualification, compared with 27 per cent in 1990.
The survey authors, two Cardiff Business School professors, nevertheless
point out that British managers cannot afford to be complacent about their
academic achievements.
They say: 'Managers are significantly better educated than the population
generally, but equally it is clear that they do not compare with the learned
professions, where almost 100 per cent of today's professionals are
graduates.'
Working hours have increased, according to questionnaires completed by more
than 800 BIM members. In 1990 nearly a third said they worked between 51 and
60 hours a week, compared with nearer a quarter in 1980. The authors note
that the trend does nothing for family life or equality of the sexes.
The sharp decline in trade union influence in the Thatcher years is
reflected in the benign tolerance British managers now feel able to express
towards their former adversaries.
In 1980, 82 per cent of mangers thought trade unions had too much power,
compared with 32 per cent in 1990.

FT  03 FEB 92 / City status fails to become the talk of the town: This month
the Queen is expected to announce the name of the town that will be awarded
city status to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession to the throne.
Twenty towns are competing. Emma Tucker visits Derby, which was made a city
in the Queen's Silver Jubilee year of 1977, to see what - if anything - it
has gained from its new status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDE the mayor of Derby's stately office a heavy red box conceals a
much-coveted document. In ornate script a charter declares that Derby 'shall
henceforth have the status of a city and shall have all such rank,
liberties, privileges, and immunities as are incident to a city'.
'We still haven't worked out what those are,' shrugs Mr Philip O'Brian, the
mayor's secretary.
They have had since 1977 to do so. That was when the Queen last granted
civic honours to a town - but city status is apparently not all it was once
cracked up to be.
Indeed the Brightons and Croydons queueing up for the privilege to mark the
40th anniversary of the Queen's accession may find the granting of a royal
charter something of an anti-climax.
There was a time, in medieval England, when a charter gave legal
independence and some degree of self-government.
Previous charters awarded to Derby gave the town market rights (1154), power
to appoint a bailiff and a monopoly in wool dyeing (1204), and power to
appoint a coroner (1256). The 1977 charter granting the grander title of
city gave no real powers.
That is not to say that the people of Derby are indifferent to their
enhanced civic status. Councillors and those working in the prosperous
business community fall over themselves to tell you what city status has
done for Derby.
National athletics events and party political conferences have taken place
in Derby City, they boast. 'The first ever SDP conference was held in
Derby,' says Mr O'Brian.
Derby also has enough cinema screens to shame any seaside resort, town or
city. Two multiplex centres have given it a total of 20 screens for a
population of a quarter of a million.
'Never mind that they all show the same films,' says Mr Paul Farrow, chief
executive of the chamber of commerce.
At least he can feel safe in Derby, where the movies and 10-pin bowling have
kept potential lager louts off the streets. Derby's crime rate has yet to
take on city status. Recorded crimes to the end of July were about 16,000.
In nearby Nottingham, an old hand at city status, the figure was more than
double at 33,173.
One thing though, is sure. City status has helped Derby's attempts to escape
from under the shadow of Nottingham.
'Derby has always felt inferior to Nottingham,' says Mr Farrow. 'It is much
more vibrant and, from that point of view, city status was important. It
elevated us to the same level - not the same size, but the same level.'
What is more, it has given the once city-less county of Derbyshire a city.
Mr Nick Brown, Conservative leader of the city council, believes the title
has given the town better economic standing.
'What it has done more than anything is give us more status in economic
development and relocation terms,' he says.
Next year the prison service will relocate to Derby, generating about 800
local jobs. Toyota, the Japanese car manufacturer, is soon to open a plant
there. Derby's status, says Mr Brown, was probably not very significant, but
he adds that the Japanese are very conscious of history and culture.
Back in the mayor's office, another title is at stake. Derby felt just a
little short-changed in 1977 when it discovered that city status did not
include Lord Mayor status. So this year it is applying for the title which,
if granted, would apparently involve little more than altering Mr Mayor's
headed notepaper - the title does not bestow a grander chain or even furrier
robes.
'It is a name but it means a lot to us really,' says Mr John Keith, the
mayor. 'Derby is the largest-populated city that hasn't got a Lord Mayor.'
While the Europeans might not make much of the permutations of mayoral
status, Mr O'Brian says the title of city helps when talking to Europeans.
'City gives the impression of infrastructure.'
Mr Roger Waterhouse, head of Derby College of Higher Education, says the
title is all to do with image.
'Previously you felt that if anybody came here they were doing Derby a
favour,' he says.
Mr Waterhouse has a vested interest. The college is currently applying for
polytechnic status. Under legislation going through parliament, any
polytechnic will be able to call itself a university, so the once sleepy
town may soon be the proud possessor of the City of Derby University.
For all the enthusiastic talk from those running the place, Derby people
have a reputation for straight-talking. The mayor warned that out on the
street people would be likely to treat city status with healthy scepticism.
He was right.
'It hasn't made any difference, to be honest,' said a bemused shop
attendant, scratching his head trying to remember 1977.
Mr Donald Eddison, who has lived in Derby for 30 years, was less kind.
'City? That's like calling the East Midlands airport international,' he
said.
WILLIAM HILL, the book-maker, has closed its book on the competition to be a
new city. Chelmsford and Brighton are favourites amid rumours that they are
the only two to have made a shortlist.
The Home Office, which will make the recommendation to the Queen, refuses to
confirm that a shortlist exists. It will not discuss the criteria for
selection, but three factors will be critical: a population of at least
250,000, some history and trade and cultural significance. Having a
cathedral or university is no longer necessary.
Other bidders that have had strong backing include Shrewsbury, Blackburn,
Wolverhampton, Guildford, Ipswich and Preston. Outsiders include Colchester,
Milton Keynes, Northampton, and Croydon. A rank outsider is Telford.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Companies warned on reporting standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 240 companies have failed to comply with a statutory requirement on
financial reporting in their most recent annual accounts.
Under a 1989 amendment to the 1985 Companies Act, companies must state in
their annual report that the accounts have been prepared in accordance with
applicable accounting standards.
The Financial Reporting Review Panel, the recently created monitor of
accounting standards, has so far warned 238 companies that their most recent
accounts fail to comply.
Mr Sydney Treadgold, secretary to the panel, emphasised that the companies
had not necessarily contravened accounting standards but had failed to make
the statement.
Several companies made the statement and wrongly assumed that they no longer
needed to disclose full details of accounting policies. The panel sought
legal advice and last week issued a notice making clear that companies must
provide the statement and details of accounting policies.
Last week the panel issued its first reprimands against three companies that
breached accounting standards: Ultramar, the oil and gas group now owned by
Lasmo; Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate; and Shield Group, the
property developer and estate agent.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Labour steps up campaign against 'dirty tricks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S aggressive media handling of the revelations about meetings between
senior party figures and Soviet diplomats went into overdrive yesterday as
frontbenchers queued up to denounce the claims as 'a typical old red smear'
and a further sign that the Tories were in difficulties.
The Sunday Times gave extracts of reports from Mr Victor Popov, the Soviet
ambassador, and his colleagues of discussions with prominent Labour members
between 1979 and 1984.
The opposition's pre-emptive weekend strike against the report marks a
distinct change of strategy from previous political campaigning. Labour
believes that its vigorous attack prompted The Sunday Times to tone down its
story.
Like the pursuit by Mr Roy Hattersley, the party's deputy leader, of Sir
David English, the editor of the Daily Mail, the approach is aimed at
ensuring that the broadcast media have to report such stories in the context
of Labour allegations of 'dirty tricks'.
Ironically, it was Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, who highlighted
the mundane and unstartling nature of the Soviet reports.
Referring to the account of Mr Popov's meeting in July 1984 with Mr Neil
Kinnock, the Labour leader, at the House of Commons, Mr Patten said: 'It
would not be surprising if Mr Kinnock said those things to the ambassador
because he said them in public, in the Commons and in the country.' Mr Popov
reported that Mr Kinnock believed that people 'were ready to fight, to
defend their rights and to speak out against Tory pressure on the left and
progressive forces'.
When Mr Popov complained that Sir Geoffrey Howe, then foreign secretary, had
simply repeated US and Nato positions in discussions with the Soviet
leadership, Mr Kinnock said that Labour was ready to develop a 'concrete
dialogue' with the Soviet Union, and criticised the Tories for continuing to
deploy US nuclear weapons in Britain.
The story divided traditionally Tory Sunday newspapers.
The Sunday Express ran the story with a headline: 'Kinnock, KGB and
Kremlin,' but the Mail on Sunday said that the Soviet files were based on
'inaccurate' notes, and carried an editorial condemning the 'outrageous
slur' on Mr Kinnock's patriotism. The Sunday Telegraph quoted Mr Oleg
Gordievsky, a former KGB agent, saying that there was no implication that Mr
Kinnock had been disloyal in any way.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Single agency proposed for rivers and pollution
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFWAT, the water industry's economic regulator, believes that the National
Rivers Authority and the pollution inspectorate should be combined in a
single organisation under the government's plans to form a national
environmental agency.
The government has outlined several alternatives in a consultation paper on
the proposed agency, which would be launched in the autumn if the
Conservatives are returned in the general election. One of the elements to
be decided is the role of the NRA.
As part of the consultation process Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat
(the Office of Water Services) has written to the environment department
supporting the idea of a single organisation as a way of achieving quicker
and more cost-effective decisions.
Mr Byatt considered it essential to retain the current approach of
river-basin management for both resources and quality of water supplies,
'which suggests that most of the current functions of the NRA would need to
be transferred to the new agency'.
Ofwat considered it essential that the costs of proposals for environmental
and other quality improvements should be properly understood before
decisions are taken. Mr Byatt writes: 'The terms of reference of the agency
should therefore include the analysis of the financial implications of
proposals.'
As most proposals for environmental improvements entailed increased costs
that were eventually borne by customers, it was essential that the new
agency was required to consult with economic regulators such as Ofwat.
Further advantages of a single 'quality regulator' for environmental and
public health issues arising from pollution would be and increased ability
to attract specialists, and a 'one-stop shop' for industry and the public.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Auditors oppose shake-up in monitoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International has not
demonstrated a need for significant changes in auditing practices, the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says.
Greater statutory powers of access by Bank of England investigators to
auditors and reporting accountants are not required, the institute has said
in a written submission to the Bingham inquiry, which is investigating BCCI.
It says the case for detailed examination of banks' internal control systems
every year is also not proven, in spite of the existence of stricter
procedures by regulators in other financial service sectors. Examinations of
banks take place on a 'rolling basis', typically every four or five years.
That saves costs and need not reduce the effectiveness of banking
regulation, the institute says.
It argues that there should still be annual meetings between the regulator,
the reporting accountant and a bank's management.
The institute says auditors of banks have a responsibility to conduct their
work 'so as to have a reasonable expectation of detecting material
misstatements in the financial statements'. That should normally allow them
to detect frauds with a significant effect on figures in the statements.
It emphasises that concealment by collusion or forgery are among actions
that may prevent an auditor detecting fraud. It says a company's management,
not auditors, is responsible for preventing fraud.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Breeze of change for accountants: The candidates standing in
the first election for a vice-president of the ICAEW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTING opens today for the post of vice-president of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales as a gentle breeze of democracy
wafts through the dusty corridors of the 97,000-member organisation.
Three candidates are standing for the position, which has always previously
been awarded to a successor chosen by the president's advisory committee of
about eight senior council members.
The election presents the possibility that a non-practising accountant may
become president. That is believed to have happened only three times in more
than 100 years.
It also shows an institute deeply concerned about attacks on accountancy
from outside the profession, prompted by recent corporate collapses.
Mr Patrick Brenan, a director of Minories Finance, formerly Johnson Matthey
Bank, is widely regarded in the City as a safe pair of hands. His many
activities include positions with the Investors Compensation Scheme, the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission and numerous institute committees.
Mr Chris Swinson, national managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the
seventh-largest accountancy firm by fee income last year, is respected for
his technical and intellectual skills. He has stirred controversy, however,
with outspoken views on the future of the profession - including possible
conflicts of interest in business conducted by large accountancy firms.
Mr Roger Lawson, director for Asia, the Pacific and the US at 3i, the
venture capital group, is chairman of the accountancy business group in the
institute, representing those outside the accountancy firms. He is one of
the few non-practising accountants to have been active for long in the
institute.
Voting will remain open for two weeks. The candidates are not allowed to
canvass but short manifestos from all three will be circulated to council
members.
The three are concerned about attacks on the profession and talk about the
need to maintain the integrity of the chartered accountancy qualification.
Opinion is split on who is likely to win. Some say there will be a showdown
between the divisions in the institute's membership, such as practising and
non-practising members, or large versus small firms.
One senior insider at the institute said, however, that all the candidates
were well known and the election was likely to be decided more on personal
respect and affection than on the section of members a candidate was seen to
represent most strongly.
Whoever wins, it will be some time before his full influence is felt. Under
present procedures the vice-president takes up office in the summer, becomes
deputy president a year later and president a year after that.
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive, said: 'I hope members
will recognise the election for the advance that it is. It represents a move
towards a more open system in touch with our members' needs.'
The election nevertheless remains only partly democratic. Only the 78
elected members of the institute's council will be allowed to vote. The
reformers do not want too much change too soon.

THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has issued further writs alleging

The first writs were issued in 1990 and further action is likely. Individual
investors in Barlow Clowes assigned their legal rights of recovery to the
government in return for compensation. National Westminster Bank was among
the institutions to receive one of the recent batch of writs. The bank said
the action would be vigorously defended.

A FALL in the number of mortgage arrears and of house repossessions has been
well under way since the third quarter of last year, according to the
Council of Mortgage Lenders, David Barchard writes.
A group of mortgage lenders met the council last week and was given
preliminary details of the numbers of repossessions last year. The figures
are to be formally announced on Thursday next week.
Although two lenders have yet to submit their final figures, it seems clear
that the total repossessions last year were well below the 85,000 originally
forecast. The final total could be about 80,000.
Lenders have also been told that the number of accounts between three and
six months in arrears began to fall sharply from last autumn.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Tories scorn Scots backing for home rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has dismissed the recent upsurge of
support for Scottish independence as a temporary 'flicker of interest'.
In a speech to Scottish Conservatives at the weekend he said Labour's plans
for a Scottish parliament had failed to stand up to detailed scrutiny and,
if implemented, would become 'an engine-room for complete separation which
the Scottish National party seeks'.
He added that the SNP's aim to make Scotland an independent country in the
European Community would be 'the worst of all worlds'.
Last week an ICM opinion poll indicated that 50 per cent of Scots wanted
independence, the highest level ever.
Mr Donald Dewar, Mr Lang's Labour shadow, accused the secretary of state of
fuelling Scottish nationalism by an 'arrogant and obstinate' stance on home
rule. He said: 'If he is genuinely worried about nationalism, he should not
be stoking the fire in this way.'
Mr Jim Sillars, SNP MP for Glasgow Govan, shrugged off the idea that Scots
did not particularly care about independence - in spite of a recent poll in
which independence was ranked sixth in importance behind issues such as
unemployment and the National Health Service.
On TV-am he said the SNP had managed to persuade people that independence
was the key to meeting social and economic needs.
A System Three opinion poll in Saturday's Glasgow Herald newspaper showed
support for Labour at 38 per cent in Scotland, a drop of 9 percentage points
on early January. The SNP was up 5 points at 26 per cent. Support for the
Conservatives rose 2 points to 23 per cent, 1 point short of their share of
the vote in the 1987 general election.
Liberal Democrat supporters are split three ways over a hung parliament,
according to a poll for BBC Television's Panorama programme tonight. NOP
found that of 504 supporters, 29 per cent wanted a post-election deal with
the Tories, 29 per cent with Labour and 31 per cent no deal with either.
A separate poll, of nearly 1,000 voters, found 56 per cent supporting
proportional representation, compared with 34 per cent wishing to keep the
existing first-past-the-post system for elections.

FT  03 FEB 92 / CBI attacks planned EC consumer laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday warned that a proposed
European consumer law directive would result in higher insurance costs for
business and a field day for litigants and lawyers.
The directive, which forms part of the European Commission's three-year
consumer law programme, would reverse the burden of proof in negligence
claims by consumers against suppliers of services. Suppliers would have to
prove they were not at fault to avoid paying compensation.
All services except medical and construction would be covered by the
directive. Miss Judith Vincent, head of the confederation's law group, said
the CBI would fight its implementation.
Miss Vincent said: 'If, for example, there is a car accident when the car
has just been to the garage for a service, the garage would have to prove
that it carried out the service correctly.'
The result of such a burden on service businesses would be a less
competitive economy caused by potentially vast legal fees and higher
insurance costs, she warned.
The CBI believes the commission has not demonstrated the need for the
directive.
It says services are not the same as products, and liability for them should
not be treated in the same way. Products are distributed widely from the
point of production to people with no contract with the supplier, whereas
services are subject to a contractual relationship between supplier and
end-user.
The CBI urges the commission to:
Assess the directive's impact on business costs.
Place a limit on claims - without one, liability under the directive may
prove to be uninsurable.
Restrict liability claims to customers and prohibit those from third
parties.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Plan for ninth container terminal opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government has announced plans to build the colony's ninth
container terminal, which it hopes will be completed by 1995, writes Simon
Holberton.
The decision, although expected, has raised complaints from local residents,
environmentalists and politicians over the effect it will have on the
quality of life for those living nearby.
Hong Kong houses the world's second largest container port. Rapid
industrialisation in southern China has boosted container throughput, which
grew last year by 20 per cent, exceeding 6m TEUs (20-foot equivalent units)
for the first time.
An eighth container terminal is currently under construction and is due to
open in August 1993.
This and the ninth terminal will each have a capacity of 1.6m TEUs.
The site chosen for the terminal, on Tsing Yi island, faces existing
container port facilities across the Rambler Channel. Two Hong Kong
companies - Hutchison and Wharf - dominate the port.
Mrs Anson Chan, secretary for economic services, said yesterday she favoured
greater competition among providers of port services. She would not comment
on reports that the Taiwanese group Evergreen and Jardine Matheson, the Hong
Kong-based trading group, were separately considering bids to operate the
ninth terminal.

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOMINATIONS for the first state elections in Punjab for several years closed
at the weekend with 1,216 candidates contesting.
Notably absent from the list were Sikh militants, boycotting the February 19
election in the Indian state despite reports that they would be standing.
Mr Gurbachan Singh Manochahal, the militants' leader, said yesterday the
boycott would strengthen the cause of Khalistan, the independent Sikh nation
the militants are fighting for.
New Delhi has poured fresh troops into Punjab to prevent disruption of the
polls.
The main parties contesting the elections are Congress, Bharatiya Janata,
Janata Dal and Communists. But without the dominant factions of the Akali
Dal, the Sikhs' main political party, the election will not reflect the
political will of the Punjabi people. The Akali Dal formed the last popular
government elected in Punjab nearly five years ago.
Last June authorities cancelled elections a day before they were due to be
held after militants killed 26 candidates in the run-up to polling, despite
the presence of 250,000 security personnel in the state.
Under Indian laws prevailing then, an election was cancelled if a candidate
died before polling began. Last month the government amended the law, making
it only applicable to candidates from recognised political parties.
Most of those killed in the June violence were independents.
At least 5,700 people, most of them Sikhs, were killed in violence in the
state in 1991. Nearly 4,000 people were killed in 1990, double the previous
year's total.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UN group sends BCCI report to Abu Dhabi: Alternative rescue
scheme for the failed bank's depositors endorsed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A UNITED Nations study group has delivered to Abu Dhabi's rulers a report on
the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and has
endorsed a depositors' rescue scheme prepared by Paine Webber, the New York
investment bankers.
The alternative scheme would pay out more than the amount forecast by the
liquidators of the collapsed bank.
The 23-page report, prepared by experts working with the UN's Centre on
Transnational Corporations, was sent on January 22 to Mr Ahmed Khalifa al
Suwaidi, one of the closest advisers of Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan,
the ruler of Abu Dhabi.
The letter to Mr al Suwaidi, from Mr Kamal Hossain, special adviser to the
UN centre, says a rescue plan prepared by Paine Webber for a group of BCCI
depositors could 'better protect the interests of depositors and indeed
those of the shareholders than the way in which the matter is being
approached by the liquidators'.
The confidential Paine Webber plan describes the scheme prepared by Touche
Ross, the provisional liquidators of BCCI, as 'unrealistically
conservative'. The initial liquidators' plan last November estimated a
recovery value on BCCI assets of ten cents per dollar.
Paine Webber's plan calls for a contribution of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 1.68bn-Pounds 2.24bn) from the Abu Dhabi government, BCCI's majority
shareholder.
Mr Peter Hansen, executive director of the UN centre, said the letter to Abu
Dhabi was not designed to exert pressure 'so much as to make ourselves
available'. Mr Hansen called for international co-ordination of the BCCI
liquidation rather than individual winding up of the collapsed bank in
various countries.
The UN report, which has already been circulated among 35 central bank
governors, may, however, have arrived too late in Abu Dhabi.
An agreement between the Touche Ross liquidators and Abu Dhabi majority
shareholders was said last week to be no more than a 'signature away' from
completion. The last leg of negotiations on this plan, which is believed to
call for a Dollars 2.2bn ceiling on Abu Dhabi's contribution, was expected
to take no more than a week.
It was unclear yesterday just how seriously Abu Dhabi is considering the
intervention by the UN centre, but the approach was being played down by the
liquidators who do not want anything to get in the way of a deal.

FT  03 FEB 92 / S Africa's whites look to a future past: The country's
rulers want an influential role in post-apartheid government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS South Africa's new parliamentary session gets under way, there is only
one real issue at stake in the debate over the country's new constitution:
the role of whites in a post-apartheid government.
Will their share of political power be entrenched in the constitution, or
purchased through electoral deals with black political parties? Will they
exercise power because the law says they must, or because the black majority
finds it impossible to govern without them?
The recent constitutional proposals from the ruling National party -
offering general elections for a multiracial interim parliament - have
obscured these issues. The Nationalists are offering to scrap the current
cabinet and parliament, and to elect a new government in national elections
which would include every South African for the first time in history. What
they are not offering is to step off the political stage they have dominated
for the past 43 years.
The Nationalists' proposals - which were unveiled last December at the
multi-party negotiating forum known as the Convention for a Democratic South
Africa (Codesa) - are a clever attempt to steal the negotiating initiative
from the African National Congress (ANC).
On the face of it, they appear to meet two key ANC demands: for an interim
government to replace the current apartheid-tainted administration and for
an elected constituent assembly to draw up a permanent constitution. The two
would eventually be merged, with the interim parliament drawing up the
constitution.
The ANC has so far rejected the Nationalists' proposals, though officials
concede privately that they cannot refuse to discuss them without appearing
to reject the right to vote - the issue on which the movement has based 80
years of struggle.
The details of the government's offer remain unclear. Indeed, members of the
committee charged with drawing up detailed proposals disagree fundamentally
over their content.
What is clear is that Pretoria is for the first time offering an elected
interim government, rather than merely black appointments to cabinet and
that the Nationalists are no longer insisting that such a government rule
for five to 10 years before a permanent constitution takes effect.
Equally clear is that Pretoria will insist on guarantees for the white
minority in the proposed interim constitution.
Mr Gerrit Viljoen, minister for constitutional development, has suggested a
model based on National party proposals adopted at last year's party
congresses, which provide for a presidency which revolves between three to
five of the country's top political leaders, and a bicameral legislature,
including an upper house where whites have an effective veto. Mr Viljoen
hopes this interim model will eventually be adopted as a final constitution.
According to his timetable, an interim constitution would first be
negotiated at Codesa, where 19 political groups meet to plan South Africa's
political future. That constitution would then be put to a referendum of all
races, which the government hopes to hold by year-end.
White votes would be counted separately and, unless whites did not approve,
the constitution would be implemented. It would then be passed by
parliament, elections would be held, and a new cabinet formed by the middle
of next year. The interim parliament would draw up a permanent constitution.
The best-laid plans of the Nationalists seem unlikely to survive the tussle
ahead in Codesa, however. Any one of a range of options could emerge.
At one end of the spectrum would be a limited form of interim government,
where Pretoria would share power with other parties only to the point of
jointly overseeing the run-up to elections. Alternatively, joint control
might be established over the security services, the public media, the
budget and electoral processes - viewed by the ANC as key areas. Or the
Nationalists and the ANC might agree to an interim cabinet with full powers,
leaving the current legislature in place.
The shape of an interim parliament is likely to prove even more contentious.
The model proposed by Mr Viljoen uses a complex formula to guarantee
minority political parties - in practice, whites - a disproportionately
large say. This could take years to negotiate. Other officials propose using
the current parliament, which includes only whites, Indians and coloureds,
as a house of minorities, with veto power over a lower house elected from
all races.
Despite the current excellent relations between government and the ANC -
whose officials dine, drink and joke together at Codesa - there are many
obstacles to agreement. The white referendum, giving whites an effective
veto, is condemned by the ANC in public but seems likely to gain eventual
acceptance.
But with government insisting on excluding the South African Communist
party, the ANC's closest ally, how can agreement be reached on an interim
cabinet? How can the gap be bridged between the ANC's one man-one vote
parliament and the Nationalists' model?
In the end, the central issue will always be how black aspirations for
majority rule can be reconciled with white demands for minority safeguards.
The ANC knows that any deal which whites oppose is no deal at all: without
white skills, capital and expertise it can run neither the government nor
the economy effectively. The threat of white terrorism is also very real.
But the ANC rejects the Nationalist model for consensus government as an
attempt to retain white privilege. The Nationalists' argument - that every
group must be given an equal say in government to reduce the risk of racial
or tribal conflict - is anathema to the ANC with its ideal of non-racialism.
The struggle for real power in South Africa has only just begun.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Building trade blocs in east Asia and the Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REGIONAL trade bloc bug is spreading around the globe. The success of
the European Community in generating internal trade between its members has
encouraged the emergence of new free-trade zones in north and south America,
while Efta and the EC are set to create a wider European Economic Area
(EEA). Last week the bandwagon reached East Asia. The six members of the
Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) have agreed to establish an
Asean free-trade area within 15 years, thereby inventing a new acronym:
Afta.
Yet the Afta agreement, unlike the EEA or Nafta (North American free-trade
area), has been greeted with considerable scepticism. It is not difficult to
see why. Lower tariffs on internally traded goods will apply only to
manufactures and processed agricultural goods and can be dodged if a product
is deemed 'sensitive' or the industry needs protecting as an 'emergency
measure'. The Asean members do not, in fact, have a compelling reason to put
internal trade links before their external interests. More than 80 per cent
of Asean exports went to non-Asean countries in 1990, as the chart shows.
Moreover if Singapore, which re-exports many of its imports, is excluded,
the share of intra-Asean exports in total exports falls to just 4.6 per
cent, against 61 per cent for the intra-regional trade of EC members.
The Afta agreement is less a reflection of regional self-interest than a
product of Asean fears that they will be excluded from the benefits of
global free trade and foreign direct investment. They suspect that developed
countries are more concerned with safeguarding their regional trading
interests than the multilateral trading system. The EEA will further raise
the share of intra-bloc trade in total European trade; the share for the EC
and Efta combined was 68 per cent in 1990. Little wonder that the EC appears
more interested in completing the internal market than bringing the Uruguay
Round of Gatt negotiations to a successful conclusion. Afta is the right
response, argued President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines last week, to a
world which 'adopts economic exclusion and attrition as a new strategy of
national defence'.
Yet Asean's modest weight in world trade means it has little negotiating
clout alongside the EC. One option is to expand the free-trade area into an
East Asian Economic Group (EAEG), including Japan and the three remaining
newly industrialised countries (Nics) - South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
This idea has been championed, with little success, by the Malaysian
premier, Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Many potential members, especially Japan,
cannot afford to upset the US, which remains opposed to any East Asian
free-trade zone. The US has instead backed the toothless Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation group (Apec), a 15-member forum which includes
Australia, New Zealand and China.
The share of intra-regional trade within total EAEG trade was, in fact, a
relatively low 33.8 per cent in 1990. But growing economic ties within East
Asia, and the emergence of fledgling market economies, are increasing the
proportion of intra-Asian trade. Foreign investment and market structures in
southern China have caused China's exports to more than double since 1982,
of which 60 per cent goes to other East Asian countries. China, Taiwan and
Hong Kong have all joined Apec within the last year, while Vietnam and Laos
are queueing to join Asean. Adding in Australasia, China and the remaining
East Asian countries to the EAEG increases the proportion of intra-regional
trade to 44.2 per cent, higher than the 41.5 per cent of total US, Canadian
and Mexican exports that were traded within the proposed Nafta in 1990.
That both Nafta and the largest possible East Asian free-trade zone still
rely on external trade for more than half their total trade suggests that
neither has an interest in undermining the multilateral trading system. But
Apec could offer an alternative route to trade dynamism if Europe becomes
overtly protectionist or simply loses interest in global free trade.
Combining the 23 Nafta, East Asian and Australasian countries into one
Asia-Pacific bloc boosts their intra-regional trade ratio to 69.4 per cent
in 1990, exceeding that of the EC and Efta combined.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Serbs in Croatia hold out on UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDLINE leaders of a Serb enclave in the republic of Croatia denied last
night that they had dropped their objections to a UN peace-keeping plan.
According to the Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav presidency, after three days
of talks in Belgrade the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina, in southern
Croatia, had accepted the UN plan to send 10,000 peace-keepers to Croatia
In a statement reported by the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency, the
presidency said that the president of Krajina's parliament, Mr Mile Paspalj,
had accepted the plan on behalf of the parliament in the absence of Mr Milan
Babic, Krajina's president.
But later, in a statement signed by Mr Babic and issued by the Krajina
government office in Belgrade, the Krajina government said it had not agreed
to accept UN peace-keepers on its territory.
A spokesman at the office said Mr Paspalj did not have the authority to sign
any agreements on behalf of the Krajina government.
In more than 30 hours of closed-door talks Serb leaders from throughout
Yugoslavia were unable to persuade Mr Babic to agree to the UN plan.
In a sign of the widening rift with Serbia, under President Slobodan
Milosevic, Mr Babic accused the rump Yugoslav presidency of plotting a coup
d'etat to unseat his government.
While Mr Babic's opposition has blocked the Serbian side, Croat leaders have
also objected to the UN plan.
They insist that the mandate for peacekeepers should not be extended for
more than a year, fearing long-term deployment would mean the permanent loss
of Krajina to Serbia. The federal army and Serb irregulars currently control
about one-third of Croatia.
Mr Babic says the Serb-controlled federal army must remain in Krajina even
after peacekeepers are deployed. He insists Serb paramilitary units should
not be disarmed unless Croat forces are disbanded.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Bonn to raise concern over debt with Kravchuk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING concern in Germany over developments in the newly and determinedly
independent republic of Ukraine will dominate talks this week when Mr Leonid
Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, pays his first official visit to Bonn.
The refusal of the republic to sign the western-inspired memorandum of
understanding on the servicing of the debt of the former Soviet Union is a
serious bone of contention in Germany, which is owed by far the largest
portion of outstanding debt.
At the same time, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, on whose invitation Mr Kravchuk is
coming, has expressed concern at the establishment of new armed forces in
the former Soviet republics on a scale which could upset the balance of
forces in Europe. On that score, Ukraine is also the most obvious offender.
Mr Kravchuk will meet Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, as well
as Mr Kohl, and Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the German president.
Finance Ministry officials have made it clear Germany will oppose the
admission of Ukraine to the International Monetary Fund, until an
internationally acceptable agreement is reached on shared repayment of the
former Soviet debt. The German government will also refuse to support any
new export credit guarantees for contracts with Ukraine until the problem of
old debts is resolved, according to the Economics Ministry.
Ukraine has said that it will pay its share of Soviet foreign debt -
accepted as 16.37 per cent - independently, but not as part of the joint
'memorandum of understanding' signed by eight of the former Soviet
republics. Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Georgia have also failed to sign.
In an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel, he said Ukraine was ready to
resettle several hundred thousand Volga Germans - deported to the east by
Stalin during the war - in the south of the republic, and in the Crimea.
With 500,000 Volga Germans having submitted applications to emigrate to
Germany, and five times that number having the right to do so, any attempt
to persuade them to remain in the former Soviet republics will be warmly
welcomed in Bonn.
The only problem with Mr Kravchuk's offer is that the Crimea itself is
disputed territory with the neighbouring Russian republic.
He also stressed in the interview that Ukraine was determined to get rid of
all nuclear warheads on its territory. So far, one-third of all tactical
nuclear weapons had been removed from the republic and by July 'they will
all have disappeared,' he said.
As Mr Kravchuk arrives in Bonn, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister,
is leaving on a four-day visit to Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, aimed at
reviving Germany's collapsed trade with the region.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Yeltsin returns to confront rising Russian discontent:
Mounting economic problems and tensions with the other republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OTTAWA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin returned to Moscow from a triumphant international
tour yesterday to confront once again the dangerous struggle over domestic
issues.
He now embarks on the second month of radical economic reform following the
highly unpopular liberalisation of prices of January 2. At the same time he
faces the challenge of mounting social hardship, tensions with other former
Soviet republics and impatience within the armed forces.
An increasingly visible focus for discontent is provided by his own
vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, a former air force colonel, who says Mr
Yeltsin's government may fall in a very short time unless it 'corrects' its
policies.
The vice-president, who on Friday equated queues at the McDonald's
restaurant in Moscow with Russia's spiritual decline, has no economic
programme of his own, but he has attracted support with calls for more
social protection, a strong-arm approach to law and order and war cries over
Russia's territorial integrity.
Unless the government reforms show results soon, such rhetoric is likely to
attract ever growing support from a still patient if bewildered population.
Mr Rutskoi favours not just a military crackdown on autonomous areas seeking
independence within Russia, but the reversal of a 1954 Kremlin decision
ceding the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Aware that this would result in
protracted bloodletting, Mr Yeltsin is seeking to avoid confrontation
through backroom diplomacy and tough talking in public.
But Russian feelings about the Crimea may be just the start of the troubles.
The Russian parliament has set itself a deadline of Thursday to voice its
opinion on the legitimacy of the peninsula's transfer to Ukraine, which in
turn refuses to discuss the issue.
A negative statement by the parliament would not only plunge relations with
Ukraine to a new low, but complicate a summit of commonwealth leaders on
February 14.
Although Mr Yeltsin failed to secure any significant pledges of western
economic help, Moscow is busily trying to establish a clearly defined rouble
zone within the commonwealth to make requests for a western stabilisation
fund more convincing. Last week for instance, it gave other republics a
choice of issuing their own currencies or joining central bank consultations
in which Russia would cut off financial transfers and cash supplies to
republics which exceeded given credit limits.
Ukraine for one is determined to press ahead with its own currency. But in
the telling sign of the key role of economics despite political tensions,
officials from Russia, Ukraine and other republics are due to meet European
Commission officials in Brussels next week to discuss proposals for a
payments union.
Mr Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Russian parliament foreign affairs
committee is due to be appointed Russia's ambassador to the US.
Canada signed a five-year, 25m tonne grain deal with Russia on Saturday, the
highlight of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's brief visit to cement the
growing friendship between the two countries, Reuter reports from Ottawa.
Mr Yeltsin told a news conference that he was heartened by Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney's warm reception and concrete gestures to help Russia through
difficult times.
Canada also extended a CDollars 100m (Pounds 47.8m) credit line for capital
goods.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Labour accuses Tories of 'smears' against Kinnock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK pre-election campaign yesterday slid into acrimony as Labour
protested that Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, had been outrageously
'smeared' by newspaper stories about a meeting with the Soviet ambassador in
1984.
The Tories reacted almost as strongly to the charge from Mr Gerald Kaufman,
the shadow foreign secretary, that Mr John Major had authorised 'the
dirtiest Tory election campaign of the century'.
The row follows publication in The Sunday Times of reports in the KGB's
archives of contacts in the early 1980s between Soviet diplomats and Labour
politicians.
Mr David Mellor, the Treasury chief secretary, fuelled opposition
allegations of a conspiracy between the Tories and some of the press when -
according to the story - he condemned the 'craven and cringing' approach
shown by Labour to the Soviet Union.
Senior figures from the two parties clashed angrily on BBC radio. Mr Roy
accused Mr Mellor of bringing Mr Kinnock's patriotism into question as part
of a Tory technique. It enabled Mr Major 'to keep his hands clean' while
'the intentional damage over patriotism is done by the rougher, tougher
members of the cabinet'.
Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, said the material revealed no more
about Mr Kinnock's views than what he had been saying publicly at the time
and raised no questions about his patriotism.
His judgment, however, was in question. The documents were a reminder that
the Labour leader had been wrong in his reaction to the deployment of SS-20
missiles and the abuse of trade union power, Mr Patten said.
The bitter exchanges undermined the expressed desire of all the main parties
to fight the election on the political issues. Although Labour and the
Tories plan a full week's campaigning, the weekend's furore is likely to
affect the atmosphere at Westminster, where the prime minister will today
make a statement to MPs about his meeting with Mr Yeltsin and the United
Nations summit.
Labour will today launch a fresh offensive on education, at the start of a
week in which it will seek to move the political debate into the areas of
education and health which are traditionally stronger ground for it. But the
party is still keeping up the pressure on the Tories over value added tax,
and yesterday seized on remarks made by Mr Mellor as being a hint that the
tax's scope might be widened.
In an interview on TV-am, Mr Mellor emphasised that the commitment made last
week by Mr Major that there would be no increase in VAT was for the lifetime
of a parliament. On the possibility of broadening the scope of tax, he said
that the government had 'no plans' to extend it.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary, called on Mr Major to give
a categorical pledge that its scope would not be widened.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Early Russian IMF entry urged: US financial aid for Yeltsin
hampered by domestic pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush gave his full backing to Russia's early entry to the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank after weekend talks with Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president.
The pledge reflects a growing sense of urgency within the administration for
supporting Mr Yeltsin's economic reform programme. It brings the US closer
to Britain, which is pressing for Russia to become a full IMF member by
April, a move which would speed efforts to create a fund to help to
stabilise the rouble.
Mr Bush's call for early membership also reflects his own domestic political
difficulties in overcoming congressional opposition to direct US financial
aid to Russia and other reformist republics.
During 3 1/2 hours of talks at Camp David on Saturday, Mr Yeltsin delivered
an impassioned appeal to Mr Bush - repeated later to Congressional leaders -
for western support. Failure to respond would mean a return to the Cold War
and the arms race, he said.
Mr Bush, who is facing the conflicting pressures of a Dollars 400bn (Pounds
220bn) budget deficit and calls to spend money at home to ease the effects
of recession, avoided a commitment to provide direct financial aid. Instead,
he stressed the provision of food and medical supplies.
This week congressional leaders will hold talks on Mr Yeltsin's request for
further humanitarian aid.
The US administration shifted its opposition to Russian membership of the
IMF late last year. The move stemmed from a growing realisation that the
Fund - a neutral body with substantial credit resources - was best placed to
deal with economic reform in the former Soviet republics.
But a senior US official expressed concern at 'bureaucratic delays' over
processing the Russian application for membership and dispensing advice to
reformers in Moscow. The British government is also chafing at talk that
Russia may not gain access to the Fund - and therefore credit - until the
autumn.
Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin agreed to hold two summits this year. Mr Yeltsin will
make a state visit to Washington this spring, with Mr Bush going to Moscow
by December.
The two leaders also signed a joint declaration that the US and Russia 'do
not regard each other as potential adversaries'. From now on, the
relationship between both countries would be characterised by mutual trust
and respect and a common commitment to freedom, it stated.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, will visit Moscow in the middle of
this month to discuss the latest proposals to cut offensive long-range
nuclear missiles. Mr Yeltsin's proposal to work on a joint project for a
global space-shield against missile attack will also be discussed.
Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, yesterday rejected Mr Yeltsin's
call for massive cuts in long-range nuclear weapons beyond those already
proposed by Mr Bush.
'There's a level . . . we want to hold at,' Mr Cheney said on Cable News
Network's weekly news programme.
On Friday night at the United Nations, Mr Yeltsin spoke in glowing tones
reminiscent of former US president Ronald Reagan of the prospects for a
'Star Wars' defence shield which would ultimately render nuclear weapons
obsolete.
Congressional leaders who spoke to Mr Yeltsin said he had urged them to
approve immediate new shipments of food and medicine in the next three
months to help Russia and the other republics through the winter. Asked for
specifics, Mr Yeltsin replied: 'Everything.'

FT  03 FEB 92 / Brittan urges role for Gatt in competition regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDRTEW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLDWIDE competition rules covering subsidies, cartels, merger policy and
even public monopolies should be drawn up under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, according to Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for
competition.
Sir Leon will tell the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, today
that, in the next round of world trade discussions, a strong role should be
sought for Gatt in the field of competition law and enforcement.
The aim would be to pass the benefits of free trade on to the consumer. Sir
Leon considers the speech to be the most important of his career.
Without wanting national competition laws to be swept away, Sir Leon, a
former minister in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, envisages a gradual
increase in the scope of Gatt, offsetting its reliance on trade law:
Subsidies. Gatt already has the power to rule on the acceptability of state
aid to companies, but Sir Leon believes that power should be increased and
the system of enforcing Gatt decisions strengthened.
Cartels. The first priority should be to draw up clear international
definitions of cartels and restrictive practices. Such cartels should be
outlawed through the national legislation of Gatt signatories. As a safety
net, Gatt's central dispute settlement mechanism should be reinforced.
Mergers. Sir Leon concedes that a supranational merger authority - along the
lines of the EC's 16-month-old merger control task force - is impracticable
at this stage. However, he would like to see a core of common rules on
mergers enforced by member states, with Gatt as an international forum for
handling deputies.
Public monopolies. The European Commission's recent attempts to break up
monopolies in telecommunications, energy and postal services, for example,
have proved this is the most controversial area of EC competition policy.
Nevertheless, Sir Leon will suggest that distortions caused by public
monopolies, or exclusive rights granted by public authorities, could also be
tackled through Gatt.
Sir Leon's speech will be the most forceful expression of his conviction
that the Commission is leading the assault on anti-competitive practices and
that the rest of the world should follow suit.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Storm over Habash affair shakes Cresson government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government was under renewed political fire yesterday as some
Socialist party members demanded government changes following the
controversial admission into a Paris hospital of Palestinian guerrilla group
leader George Habash.
The political storm which broke last week after the stay in hospital of Mr
Habash, leader of the extremist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP), has continued to rage since his sudden departure on
Saturday for Tunis.
Mrs Edith Cresson's Socialist administration has been shaken by the crisis,
which even government ministers have admitted indicates a serious
malfunctioning of the machinery of the state, and it is not clear that the
government's authority can be restored without a reshuffle.
Speculation about a reshuffle was prompted on Saturday when President
Francois Mitterrand summoned Mrs Cresson to the Elysee for an 80-minute
post-mortem on the affair, followed by a 90-minute interview with Mr
Philippe Marchand, the interior minister.
Until last week, Mr Mitterrand was expected to postpone any reshuffle until
he had measured the results of next month's regional elections. The crisis
may force an acceleration of that timetable.
It has already claimed five victims. Mrs Georgina Dufoix resigned as adviser
to Mr Mitterrand, and also faces demands toresign as president of the Red
Cross, which endorsed Mr Habash's request for hospital treatment. Four civil
servants from the foreign and interior ministries have also resigned.
However, these resignations have failed to convince the French that the
decision to allow into the country a man suspected of masterminding aircraft
hijackings in the 1970s was taken by civil servants without clearance from
their political masters.
The government's official story is that Mr Habash was admitted for hospital
treatment last Wednesday without the knowledge or the authorisation of the
highest levels of the government, while Mr Mitterrand and Mr Roland Dumas,
the foreign minister, were visiting Oman.
But the Red Cross has said it told the Foreign Ministry of Mr Habash's
request for hospital treatment last Monday, before Mr Mitterrand and Mr
Dumas left for Oman.
The lawyer representing Mr Habash has claimed the decision to admit him to
France had been taken at the Elysee 'at the highest level'.
Mr Jack Lang, government spokesman, yesterday vigorously defended the
disciplinary measures and claimed the incident was now closed. But
conservative opposition leaders have continued to call for the resignation
of Mr Dumas, Mr Marchand and Mrs Cresson.

FT  03 FEB 92 / The proliferation of power: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear proliferation is now one of the leading preoccupations of western
governments. This anxiety, that nuclear weapons may get into the hands of
states which are unstable, uncivilised or plain malevolent, is the direct
consequence of the end of the Cold War. But there is another consequence
which is more profound and far-reaching, and that is political
proliferation. The two are directly connected; and those nuclear-weapons
states which are most anxious to prevent nuclear proliferation, are also
most anxious to prevent political proliferation.
Their efforts are doomed to fail, since neither form of proliferation can be
prevented; delayed for a while, perhaps, but not prevented. But the problem
of nuclear proliferation will be easier to handle if governments face up to
the inevitability - and desirability - of political proliferation.
The fear of nuclear proliferation is the corollary of the nuclear age.
Throughout the Cold War, when terror of nuclear war was greatest, the
nuclear-weapons club was for many years officially limited to five nations.
Some bandit states acquired various degrees of illicit capability, but the
stress of the east-west confrontation helped to contain the risks of overt
break-out.
The polarising discipline of the Cold War has now evaporated. The rogue
behaviour of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is the most eloquent witness of
the collapse of Soviet influence; but other renegade states may seek to
tread the same path.
On the supply side, the disintegration of the Soviet Union is causing
concern over the future of its nuclear arsenal. The Russians say the weapons
are under secure control from Moscow; but control cannot be secure until
there is a stable political system of reasonably satisfied states, and that
is many years off. Moreover, economic collapse and nuclear disarmament could
create optimal incentives for unauthorised exports of nuclear materials or
mercenary emigration of nuclear experts.
The corollary of nuclear discipline was political discipline. The east-west
confrontation of the Cold War compelled lesser powers to accept the
domination of the US and the Soviet Union. The western alliance was, of
course, democratic and therefore much less monolithic than the eastern. But
on both sides the line-up was clear-cut and consistent, and the opposing
champions were the so-called 'superpowers'.
The end of the Cold War has let loose a vigorous jostling for position
between leaders and followers. Russia under Mr Boris Yeltsin is asserting
its claims as the successor state to the Soviet superpower; the US under Mr
George Bush is being just as hyperactive in asserting its role as the
successor state to the American superpower. Now it may suit the
ex-superpowers to prop each other up: Bush and Yeltsin, like Reagan and
Gorbachev before them, are trading disarmament gestures abroad, because they
cannot deliver economic well-being at home. But in neither case do their
international claims carry conviction.
The latest exchange of nuclear disarmament bids by the superpowers looks
like the reiteration of an old trick out of season. The elimination of
multiple warheads on strategic missiles may seem spectacular, but there is
one problem: what are these missiles for, anyhow, and why do you need 4,500?
The world is now less impressed by bilateral number-cutting of the
superpower arsenals, because it is starting to look irrelevant. The most
urgent nuclear priorities today are the control and stability of the weapons
systems inside the ex-Soviet Union, and the containment of proliferation;
but neither of these tasks can be handled privately by the two superpowers.
On the contrary, they need far-reaching international co-operation.
It is not clear that the US welcomes this aspect of the new world order.
When President Francois Mitterrand of France suggested last September that
the four nuclear powers with weapons in Europe (US, UK, France and the
Soviet Union) should jointly discuss the security of Soviet nuclear weapons,
the idea was icily ignored by the US. The three western foreign ministers
have now made separate trips to the ex-Soviet republics to study the
question, and have returned with different conclusions.
Unfortunately, America's European allies have been equally slow to accept
the egalitarian nature of the new world order. Mr Mitterrand's four-power
suggestion annoyed the Germans as well as the Americans, because Bonn could
see no reason why it should not be equally involved in the problem of Soviet
nuclear security. It is not surprising, therefore, that Germany has now
proposed, in Nato, that the unilateral US and Soviet offers to eliminate all
their tactical nuclear weapons should be subject to a collective process of
verification. The proposal has been kept fairly discreet; but it is a
significant warning shot to the so-called superpowers.
Last Friday's summit meeting of the UN Security Council is another case in
point. France (which first suggested it) and Britain (which organised it)
may have intended to shift the bilateralism of the Cold War to the
multilateralism of the UN. In practice, this declaratory meeting will have
achieved little apart from TV exposure; it annoyed the Germans, because it
underlined the fact that they are not members of the Security Council.
Unlike the Japanese, the Germans will probably refrain from demanding a
permanent seat on the Security Council. But the incident can only reinforce
their determination that their views will in future play a role in the UN
postures of France and Britain.
Political power is leaking uncontrollably away from Moscow and Washington.
Lesser powers are no longer prepared for the role of docile followers,
although some still hanker irritatingly after anachronistic privileges. But
the old hierarchies have to go, because the world is changing.

FT  03 FEB 92 / A teenager's guide to the budget: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President George Bush seemed to have three objectives in last week's budget:
to revive confidence with upbeat economic projections; to stimulate spending
with temporary tax incentives (most of which expire shortly after the
election); and to distract attention from alarming long-term fiscal trends.
The administration is betting on economic recovery beginning in the spring
and gathering pace through the year. A recovery of some description does
seem likely. But its strength and timing remain uncertain. As if to spite
the administration, a raft of forward-looking economic data released last
week was uniformly gloomy.
Durable goods orders plunged 5 per cent in December, the biggest drop for
more than a year. Much of the decline was concentrated in the volatile
aircraft sector, but non-transportation orders fell 1.6 per cent, to
register their fifth monthly decline. New homes sales fell 6.6 per cent in
December and now stand at the same level as in August when last summer's
brief economic recovery sputtered out. The index of leading indicators fell
0.3 per cent in December, for the second month running. The index, which
anticipates turning points in the economy, has now failed to advance
significantly for five months. Consumer confidence slid further in January,
instead of reviving as analysts had hoped.
Such indicators do not invalidate the budget forecast. But they leave plenty
of scope for scepticism. Even if the recovery materialises, growth could be
less than 2 per cent at an annual rate - in other words invisible for the
purposes of an election campaign.
Will the budget tax breaks make a difference? This is hard to say if only
because the shape - and timing - of the final package that emerges from
Congress is uncertain. It could involve substantially larger tax cuts for
middle income Americans. Few presidents, however, have tried quite as
blatantly to accelerate spending for political purposes. The change in rules
for withholding income tax will automatically increase purchasing power by
about Dollars 25bn this year. But whether the cash will be spent depends on
taxpayers' attitudes: since next year's tax rebates will be correspondingly
reduced, many may decide to save the extra cash.
The proposed 15 per cent investment tax allowance for companies must be
spent before next January. But the revenue loss this year is estimated at
only Dollars 6.1bn, so it seems unlikely to provide a huge stimulus in a
Dollars 6,000bn economy. The temporary tax credit for first-time homebuyers,
which also expires next January, is even smaller beer, costing only an
estimated Dollars 200m this year. Even if Mr Bush succeeds in influencing
business and consumer decisions, fine-tuning the tax code could easily prove
counter productive. It contradicts the philosophy of the 1986 tax reform act
 -- which tried to reduce fiscal distortions - and only serves to highlight
the White House's short-term economic horizon.
This brings us to the longer term fiscal trends. Mr Richard Darman, the
budget director, claimed the budget was prudent because it avoided a big tax
cut and stuck to the 1990 budget agreement. That he could respect the pact's
terms yet produce a record Dollars 400bn (6.7 per cent of gross domestic
product) deficit this year merely underlines its shortcomings. The deficit
has been boosted by short-term factors beyond the administration's control,
including the recession and the costs of bailing out bankrupt savings and
loans institutions. But the fundamental problems run deeper.
The administration has spent as though the boom of the 1980s were still
under way yet pulled in much less revenue than expected because the economy
has actually been stagnant for three years. Total federal spending this
fiscal year will be a staggering 29 per cent higher in cash terms than in
fiscal 1989 - the last year for which Mr Reagan was responsible. But
revenues have risen by only 8.5 per cent over three years. The contrast is
even starker in the past fiscal year: spending has risen 11.5 per cent but
revenues are up only 2 per cent. This compares, incidentally, with a
forecast this time last year of a spending increase of 2.5 per cent and a
revenue increase of 6.7 per cent.
Looking ahead, the administration forecasts 3 per cent economic growth and a
rapid reversal of spending and revenue trends. It expects revenues to rise
more than 8 per cent in fiscal 1993 and spending to grow by less than 3 per
cent. By 1997 it expects spending as a share of GDP to have fallen by four
percentage points to just under 21 per cent and revenues to have risen
slightly to 18.5 per cent of GDP. On past trends such austerity does not
look feasible: deficits may thus remain much higher than most analysts
expect.
The core problem is the growth of mandatory 'entitlement' programmes, such
as health care and pensions for the elderly. In cash terms, total
entitlement spending (which accounts for more than half the budget) has
grown by about a third since 1989. There is not enough scope for cuts in
other programmes, such as defence (which is already declining fast) and
discretionary domestic spending (pared in the 1980s), fully to offset likely
growth of mandatory spending. The US can thus cure its deficit in one of two
ways: by rigorously means-testing entitlements or by permanently raising
taxes by 2 or 3 percentage points of GDP. Most countries opted for higher
taxation long ago, but US politicians seem strangely unwilling to admit that
a choice has to be made.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Volatility continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The volatility which has dominated the foreign exchange markets this year
shows no signs of abating, writes Simon London.
This was clear in the dollar's behaviour against the D-Mark last week. On
Monday, the US currency strengthened from DM1.59 to nearly DM1.62 on the
absense of concrete exchange policies from the Group of Seven meeting. Many
analysts had expected an agreement to moderate any appreciation of the
dollar.
However, the dollar had tumbled back as low as DM1.5850 by Wednesday as weak
consumer confidence figures underlined the deep malaise of the US economy.
Yet by mid-week it rallied back to DM1.62 following comments by Mr Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, that US interest rates were unlikely to
be cut again.
Finally, on Friday, the US unit lost more than 2 pfennigs in 20 minutes on
the announcement that German steel workers had voted in favour of strike
action in pursuit of higher pay.
This underlines that there is no consensus among analysts and traders on
three important issues; the prospects for US economic recovery, whether US
interest rates will be cut, and when German interest rates will start to
decline.
This week market participants are hoping that a clearer picture emerges.
Today, the US National Association of Purchasing Managers report will be
watched closely. US employment data for January, released on Friday, is
regarded as a key indicator.
Also this week, German industrial production, employment and trade figures
are due. Finally, the Bundesbank council holds its regular bi-weekly meeting
on Thursday. Here at least there consensus: no-one is expecting an immediate
cut in German interest rates.

FT  03 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Ecu sector keeps pace with France and
Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECU bond market, one of the beneficiaries of the shift of assets into
European bond markets, has kept pace with France and Germany so far this
year, despite a heavy supply of new issues.
In January, the market absorbed over Ecu5bn of fixed-rate and floating-rate
Eurobonds, compared with Ecu25bn for the whole of 1991, itself a record
year. However, the current pace of activity is unlikely to be maintained.
Indeed, signs that the market could face the same problems of oversupply
which knocked it off its feet for much of last year would be most unwelcome.
Uncertainty over the future of the currency may have been removed at
Maastricht. But, from a technical point of view, the Ecu market has appeared
expensive compared with its constituent bond markets since the Maastricht
conference, prompting some concern about the market's continuing appeal. Ecu
bonds trade at a yield around 60 basis points below the 10-year theoretical
yield - that is, the weighted average of yield of each of the component bond
markets.
Some institutional investors have been eschewing the market, on the grounds
that French franc or D-Mark bonds offer better value, or constituting their
own Ecu baskets.
However, many bond analysts expect the longer end of the yield curve to
outperform short-dated Ecu bonds, assuming that European monetary union goes
ahead as planned. Consequently, they believe the Ecu bond yield curve will
become more inverted. However, this will largely depend on the performance
of the underlying markets.
Bonds maturing in 10 years or more will be redeemed after monetary union,
which removes some of the currency risk for investors. There is a risk that
bonds maturing in, say, five years could suffer from the devaluation of one
of the component currencies ahead of monetary union.
France's recent issue of 30-year Ecu bonds, under its OAT programme, has
performed strongly, and is now yielding 8.36 per cent, less than the 10-year
Ecu OAT.
The UK's first issue of three-year Treasury notes has performed rather
disappointingly, on the other hand, despite being bid very aggressively
ahead of the auction last month.
The yield on the UK Ecu note, from 8.48 per cent at the tender, has widened
to 8.61 per cent, and dealers report a disappointing level of investor
interest.
Nevertheless, the three- and 30-year issues from France and the UK have
provided a useful function in extending the yield curve.
Last year, a flood of new issues, mainly by sovereign borrowers, in the
first few months deluged the market, causing a substantial setback. Traders
are hoping the same problems of oversupply will not recur this year, partly
because many sovereign borrowers are instituting more regulated systems for
tapping the market, in some cases via domestic auctions in their own
markets. For example, Denmark and Belgium both plan to issue bonds in their
domestic markets this year.
The UK will be issuing through its T-note programme, while France will
continue to supply the market through OAT issues.
However, the investor base will still be the same as for Eurobond issues. In
addition, a number of other sovereign issuers - Spain, Portugal and Norway,
for example - may tap the market.
The motivation for domestic issuance is based on self-interest as much as a
desire to regulate the market: European financial centres are keen to
attract Ecu trading business.
For the moment, the bulk of Ecu bond trading is still conducted in London,
but futures trading is based in Paris. The Matif, the French futures
exchange, traded 5,000 Ecu bond futures contracts on Friday, compared with
just 100 on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
However, the market is still driven by cash-market trading. Indeed, many
dealers prefer to hedge trading positions through sovereign benchmark bonds,
rather than the futures market, because of liquidity concerns.
Competition in the market remains intense. Although still relatively small
compared with government bond markets, it is a market which many banks feel
they cannot afford to ignore.
Yamaichi International, which became the 41st market maker in Ecu Eurobonds
last month, yesterday launched an Ecu500m seven-year issue for Finland,
priced to yield 8.45 per cent, which was considered the most aggressively
priced deal so far this year.
There is little outstanding paper in the seven-year area, but the deal was
priced more tightly than Belgium's 9 1/8 per cent bonds due 1996, yielding
8.56 per cent, or the 9 1/2 per cent French OAT due 2000, yielding 8.50 per
cent. Finland, which recently devalued its currency and was downgraded, is
considered a declining credit.
Yamaichi pointed to a European Community deal due 1998 yielding 8.30 per
cent, but other dealers said that deal was trading very tightly.
The deal closed at 99.60 bid, just below the fixed re-offered price,
according to the lead manager.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Syndicated Loans: Middle East deals hold the limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Middle East has emerged as an important source of large syndicated loans
over the past year in an otherwise drought-stricken market.
The latest Middle Eastern borrower to tap the international loans market is
Saudi European Petrochemicals Corporation - or Ibn Zahr - which has launched
a Dollars 500m eight-and-a-half-year term loan.
The deal follows the huge syndicated loans to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which
raised Dollars 4.5bn and Dollars 5.5bn respectively in the international
markets last year.
Other Middle Eastern deals in preparation include a large loan to Saudi
Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil group, and a large project financing for an
MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) plant in Qatar.
Kuwait Airways has also been in discussions with bankers recently about
financing the purchase of new aircraft since much of its fleet was destroyed
in the Iraqi invasion.
The Kuwaiti airline signed a Dollars 2bn contract with Airbus last year for
up to 24 new aircraft. Bankers in London say there are rumours of a Kuwaiti
oil project financing as well. Originally, Ibn Zahr planned to borrow
Dollars 600m, but now it has decided to reduce the loan to Dollars 500m,
having made some savings on the project costs.
The funds are intended to cover two particular projects. The first is the
expansion of an existing MTBE facility. The second project is the
construction of a polypropylene plant. Both plants are expected to come on
stream in 1993.
The deal has been underwritten by The National Commercial Bank (the agent),
Riyad Bank (the book-runner), Saudi American Bank and Saudi French Bank.
The borrower (70 per cent- owned by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation - or
Sabic, the Saudi Arabian petrochemical group, which is itself 70 per
cent-owned by the Saudi government) carries a full 100 per cent risk
weighting for capital adequacy purposes.
Bankers say this factor is reflected in the overall pricing on the deal.
While the interest margin over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) is
relatively tight, the front-end fees are considered generous.
Ibn Zahr is paying a margin of 50 basis points over Libor, against the 37.5
basis points the Saudi government is paying on the Dollars 4.5bn syndicated
loan launched last May (in the case of the Saudi government, the borrower
has a zero risk rating).
The front-end fees are 75 basis points for banks lending Dollars 40m, 65
basis points for Dollars 30m, 50 basis points for Dollars 20m, and 40 basis
points for Dollars 10m.
Less attractive, however, is the commitment fee structure of 25 basis points
on available amounts and 12.5 basis on unavailable amounts. Many bankers
dislike being paid less on unavailable amounts. They argue that even if the
borrower does not use the full loan initially, the banks still have to be
prepared to lend the full sum.
However, with so many Middle Eastern deals in the pipeline, bankers who
dislike this two-tier structure can probably afford to wait for a more
attractive loan.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Gilts: Traders undecided on outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILT YIELDS fell slightly as investors were caught undecided about the
market's direction over the next few months.
Although recessionary conditions in the UK are unlikely to abate for some
time, political and supply factors may push up yields ahead of the general
election.
Last week, almost all the movement in the market was at the short-maturing
end of the yield curve, where yields for gilts maturing over the next three
years moved down by as much as 10 basis points (0.1 per cent). Elsewhere,
the change was much more muted.
The switch by investors towards this end of the curve was in line with the
general perception that base rates, now at 10.5 per cent, will soon be
coming down as part of a broad move towards lower interest rates across
Europe.
At the same time, yields for long-dated securities may well stay relatively
high due to the large volume likely to go on sale over the next two years to
fund the public sector borrowing requirement.
That would lead to a further flattening in the shape of the yield curve. Due
to recession and the resulting reduction in inflationary pressures, the
curve has, in the past year, lost much of its traditional downward-sloping
character.
The moribund state of the UK economy was underlined by last week's
industrial trends survey by the Confederation of British Industry, which
reported a big drop in business confidence since the autumn.
It also showed that the extreme weakness of demand was continuing to force
manufacturers to cut prices, producing inflationary pressures at the factory
level.
Another sign that the recovery in the UK will be slow, a factor which should
put downward pressure on gilt yields over the next six months, came from the
most recent figures for UK trade.
The 1.1 per cent growth in import volumes, less oil and erratics, between
the third and fourth quarters of 1991 followed a 1.5 per cent rise between
the third and second quarters. That was after a 1.3 per cent fall in the
second quarter. On one interpretation of the statistics, the slight
reduction in import growth in recent months backs up the anecdotal evidence
that the upturn from the recession has slipped back.
It could be that the more pronounced upward blip in imports in the third
quarter was largely due to factories purchasing stocks of components and
other items for goods for exports, a view supported by the surprisingly high
growth in export volumes in the final three months of 1991. Not including
oil and erratics, exports grew in this period by 2.3 per cent compared with
August to October, after a 1.4 per cent decline between the second and third
quarters.
In spite of deflationary conditions, a worry for gilt specialists is the
volume of bonds that might be needed over the next two years to pay for
increased public sector borrowing.
According to Goldman Sachs, Pounds 26.2bn worth of gilts will be sold in
1992-93 by the Bank of England, nearly twice as much as this year. Although
one view is that the large supply will push down prices and raise yields,
others reckon the worries are overdone and that buyers will emerge for the
debt at relatively high prices.
Supporting this theory is the strong buying support for gilts for much of
the past year. That was underscored in last week's gilt auction, when the
Bank sold Pounds 1.8bn of the Treasury 9.75 per cent stock maturing in 2002
at a reasonably high price. The average accepted bid for the gilt was 102
5/32 , while the lowest was 102 3/32 . Bids amounted to Pounds 3.64bn,
giving a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.02, a figure indicating relatively high
demand.
In December, domestic institutions bought Pounds 977m worth of gilts from
the Bank, after Pounds 1.2bn in November, while buying support from overseas
investors was also high. These groups purchased gilts worth Pounds 224m last
month, after Pounds 83m in November, according to Bank statistics issued
last week.
Another problem for the gilt market might be the uncertainty due to the
election, which could depress prices.
However, Mr John Shepperd, an economist at Warburg Securities, is generally
bullish about gilts. He notes that with inflation falling in the UK, the
yield difference between 10-year gilts and the equivalent German bonds will
continue to decline. The number stood at more than 200 basis points in
mid-1991; it has now come down to about 170 basis points, and Mr Shepperd
thinks it will fall to around 120 basis points by later this year.

FT  03 FEB 92 / US Money and Credit: Investor unease over Fed optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush delivered his much-vaunted State of the Union message last
week, but investors in the bond market shrugged off the election year
package of tax gimmicks and took their cue instead from Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman. His comments in Congress appeared to pour cold
water on the prospect of more interest rate cuts in the near term.
Mr Greenspan's declaration that an economic recovery looks likely this
spring sent the Treasury bond market into a tail-spin on Wednesday, with a
sell-off of a full point on the benchmark 30-year long bond.
Bond investors seem to have over-reacted to the Fed chairman's optimistic
prognosis - and they nudged prices upward again later in the week.
The reason the market's reaction to the Fed chairman looked overblown is
that Mr Greenspan and most of America's leading economists have been saying
for the past 18 months - regularly and quite erroneously - that a US
recovery is just around the corner.
What really worried Treasury bond investors was Mr Greenspan's proclamation
that the Fed had lowered interest rates 'enough' to get the economy moving
again. This was taken as a sign that further rate cuts were not imminent,
and would probably not be decided at this Tuesday's and Wednesday's meeting
of the Fed's Open Markets Committee.
While Mr Greenspan may be returning to his cautious form - convinced that a
100 basis point reduction in the discount rate last December was sufficient
to stimulate the economy - the raft of macro-economic statistics available
last week suggests a gloomier scenario.
Durable orders were down by 4.9 per cent in December, the biggest such drop
since 1982. Had it not been for military orders, the decline would have been
9 per cent.
The Chicago purchasing managers' index fell in January, while the Conference
Board said its consumer confidence index fell from 52.5 to 50.4 during the
month.
The continuing lack of confidence among US consumers was highlighted in New
York last week, when Macy's, a pillar of the retail market, filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. TWA
followed Macy's with its own Chapter 11 filing later in the week.
Leading economic indicators for December meanwhile declined by 0.3 per cent,
worse than expected. New home sales in December were down by 6.6 per cent,
closing out a year that experienced a 5.6 per cent decline, the third year
in a row of declining sales.
All of this made last week quite volatile in terms of Treasury bond price
movements. However, the bad news eventually outweighed Mr Greenspan's
curious optimism, and the benchmark 30-year bond ended the week less than
half a point down at 102 3/4 , yielding 7.75 per cent.
The yield was thus little changed on the week, although some 30 basis points
higher than at the end of December.
These statistics - and this week's expected offering - do not paint a
picture of a speedily recovering economy. Today, for example, the national
purchasing managers' composite index is expected to be little changed from
its December level of 47.4.
On Thursday, factory orders for December are likely to be lower, while
non-farm payrolls should show a further decline in manufacturing employment
and a higher overall unemployment rate.
One economist who does not believe Mr Greenspan when he demurs on further
interest rate cuts is Mr Phillip Braverman, of DKB Securities. Mr Braverman,
who noted on Friday that the 1990-1992 US recession was by far the longest
and, by some measures, the worst since the depression of the 1930s, reckons
real GDP will sink in the first quarter of 1992. He is also one of the few
US forecasters to suggest 'there could be no recovery at all this year'.
In such an environment, says Mr Braverman, the Fed would have no choice but
to ease further and substantially. He is looking for a Fed funds rate (now 4
per cent) of 3.5 per cent by the end of March, and as low as 3 per cent
later this year.
If one accepts the present round of statistics and takes a bearish view of
supposed US recovery prospects, there should be an improvement in the
Treasury market's fortunes, on the grounds that bad economic news drives
bond prices higher.
However, the effect of Mr Greenspan's caution on the interest rate front
could be strong, and may well lead to a period of stasis in the market, at
least in coming weeks.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Dutch Government Bonds: Borrowing programme off to flying
start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUGH 1992 is barely five weeks old, the Dutch government has already
managed to raise more than 40 per cent of its total public borrowing
requirement for the year. This is thanks largely to the overwhelming success
of two recent state bond issues.
On Wednesday, the finance ministry's agent closed the state's 15-year, 8.25
per cent 'tap issue', after raising a total of Fl 5.5bn (Dollars 3bn).
The previous Friday, a 10-year bullet bond with the same coupon - sold this
time through the standard tender system - attracted successful subscriptions
worth Fl 10bn.
These two loans, combined with a late 1991 issue which raised a more modest
Fl 2.8bn, mean the ministry has already pulled in Fl 18.3bn, or 40.3 per
cent, of the 1992 PSBR of Fl 45.4bn. Analysts believe private placements
have probably pushed the figure up to nearly 45 per cent.
With the state's needs covered, no new state issue is expected for the time
being, enabling investors to concentrate on existing state loans.
The bullish sentiment that characterised the market in January augurs well
for February, though sentiment has been tempered in recent days by the
threat of steel industry strikes in Germany.
On Friday, these worries caused the 10-year 8.25 per cent issue to close
down nearly 0.20 points at 99.31, for an effective yield of 8.35 per cent,
up 3 basis points from Thursday.
The success of the state's 10-year and 15-year loans was due to
institutional investors scrambling to buy now that Dutch interest rates  -
contrary to previous expectations - seem to be heading downwards. Following
January's declines in interest rates, pension funds and insurers are keen to
lock into current levels before they drop even further.
Foreign institutions were also active buyers, with the 15-year bond in
particular helping to satisfy overseas demand for longer maturities.
With Germany facing industrial strife, the guilder market is again
benefiting from its reputation as a safe alternative to the D-Mark.
The guilder's favour with foreign investors makes it unlikely that the
Netherlands will soon issue its first Ecu-denominated state loan. Mr Wim
Kok, finance minister, reiterated last week that he had no objections in
principle to Ecu issues, but stressed that the time was not ripe for a Dutch
debut on the Ecu stage.
Though Ecu rates had recently fallen to around the levels prevailing in the
guilder market, the cost of issuing Ecu loans was still higher than that of
guilder-denominated bonds.
'The success of the past two state issues, which raised more than Fl 14bn in
the space of a single week, shows that guilder-denominated bonds have not
lost any of their attractiveness,' he noted.

FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: EC closer to accord on capital
adequacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community deadlock on common capital adequacy standards for EC
securities firms could be loosened this week following agreement in Geneva
last week on international capital rules.
European Commission officials will this week try to engineer a deal between
feuding EC member states on the draft capital adequacy directive. One
described the international agreement as 'pretty helpful' to the EC
negotiations, which aim to establish a parallel capital adequacy regime.
The Commission is expected to produce a new compromise text today, for
discussion by national representatives tomorrow and Wednesday. Mr Geoffrey
Fitchew, who heads the Commission directorate responsible for financial
institutions, was an observer in Geneva and may report to the Brussels
meeting on the outcome.
EC discussion about the capital adequacy directive has been characterised by
disputes between countries such as Spain and Germany - which want to apply
tight bank-style rules to securities firms - and others, notably Britain,
Denmark and the Netherlands, which want to preserve the distinction between
the regulation of banks and brokers.
Banking and securities regulators were split along roughly the same lines,
but the Geneva meeting appears to have narrowed the gap.
They have, for example, reached general agreement on the ratio of
subordinated debt to other capital which can be counted for regulatory
purposes. Commission officials believe some EC members will consider the
2.5:1 compromise too loose.
The new EC text differs in some unspecified details from last week's
international compromise, which will still be the subject of long
negotiations between bank and securities regulators.
But the broad rapprochement between regulators may persuade bickering EC
governments that it is worth forging a parallel deal which could be fed into
the renewed international debate later this year.

SANYO Electric, the Japanese electronics maker, announced a rise of 12.5 per
cent in consolidated pre-tax profits, to Y39.9bn (Dollars 324.4m) for the
year to November, 1991. The result was struck on a 7.8 per cent rise in
sales, to Y1,587.1bn, writes Emiko Terazono.
Operating profit rose only 1.9 per cent to Y49.5bn, due to increased
competition and foreign exchange losses caused by the yen's sharp rise
against the dollar. After-tax profit fell 3.8 per cent to Y16.8bn due to
increased corporate taxes.

FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Italy approves takeover rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-awaited rules for takeover bids of stock market quoted companies have
been approved by Italy's politicians, just hours before the dissolution of
parliament.
The new ruling, designed to protect the rights of minority shareholders,
brings Italy into line with market practice in other big industrialsed
countries.
It should put an end to the Italian practice of exchanging crucial stakes in
listed companies at premium prices without offering the same terms to small
investors.
The new law was welcomed on the Milan bourse. Brokers said it should bolster
the image of Italy's capital markets and attract more private investors to
the stock market. Mr Attilio Ventura, head of the stockbrokers' committee
which runs the Milan bourse, said the law represented 'a decisive step for
the market'.
Under the rules, the sale of a controlling stake in a company will have to
be followed by a full bid by the buyer. Stricter reporting requirements also
apply to deals involving large packets of shares falling below the legal
ceiling for launching a full bid.
A purchaser of 25 per cent of a company's equity would now be obliged to
mount a full takeover should it seek to buy any more than a further 2 per
cent in the following 12 months.
Once a takeover has been launched, a bidder may raise the offer price only
once, and by at least 5 per cent. The new law also allows contested bids,
with the counter-bidder being required to make an offer at least 5 per cent
superior to that of the original bidder, which may in turn improve its
offer.

deal
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI, the Italian agro-industrial and chemicals concern, has unveiled
terms for the merger of Eridania and Beghin-Say, its Italian and French
sugar subsidiaries. The deal will create a foods group with expected sales
of over L11,000bn (Dollars 9.2bn) this year.
Early market reaction suggested that the transaction, first mooted last
November, could prove controversial because of the price attributed to the
Eridania assets being bought by Beghin-Say.
Mr Giuseppe Garofano, chairman of Ferruzzi's Montedison subsidiary, which
controls Eridania, stressed the valuation had been carried out with the
knowledge and approval of the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the
French stock market authority.
Under the proposal, Beghin-Say will make an exclusive rights issue on behalf
of Eridania, which will participate by conferring its Italian sugar business
and its 30 per cent stake in Cerestar, the starch group in which Beghin-Say
is the other shareholder. Beghin-Say will then be renamed
Eridania/Beghin-Say (EBS).
Eridania itself, which will remain as a shell company to be renamed
Finanziaria Agroindustriale, will be absorbed by Montedison.
Ferruzzi controls Montedison, which in turn controls 55 per cent of
Eridania. The latter holds 60 per cent of Beghin-Say's capital.
The transaction will be highly benefical for Montedison, which should gain a
L65-70bn a year profits boost by eliminating the dilution of earnings
attributable to minority shareholders at Beghin-Say.
However, the acquisition of Eridania's assets, valued at FFr7.6bn, (Dollars
1.4bn) may be less palatable to Beghin-Say's shareholders. The company,
which enjoys high operating margins, could become less attractive an
investment when combined with Eridania's less profitable Italian business,
analysts said.
Beghin-Say will issue 9m new shares, priced at FFr800 each, to pay for the
Eridania assets. Minority shareholders in Eridania will then be offered
shares in EBS on the basis of two new EBS shares for every 37 ordinary
Eridania shares, or one new share for every 24 Eridania savings shares held.
Investors not accepting the offer can either take Montedison shares, at a
ratio yet to be determined, or sell their rights for cash.
Mr Garofano justified the valuations on the basis that the merger would
create Europe's third biggest foods group.

CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products suffered a loss of CDollars 571.5m
(USDollars 492.6m), or 13 cents a share, in 1991, after special pre-tax
charges of CDollars 528m to cover mill shutdowns and a write-down of its
packaging business, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Most of the loss came in the fourth quarter. In 1990, the company lost
CDollars 9.4m, or 21 cents a share.
CPFP, 80 per cent owned by Canadian Pacific, is one of Canada's three top
newsprint producers. It was this sector that caused most of the problems.
CPFP is closing one new mill permanently near Montreal this year, and its

CONSOLIDATED profits at Petrofina, the oil company and Belgium's largest
industrial group, slipped by nearly 25 per cent in 1991, from BFr21.7bn
(Dollars 665m) to BFr16.3bn.
The results were hit by the 66 per cent decline in profits at Fina, the
group's US affiliate, which made only Dollars 42m in the year, compared with
Dollars 125m in 1990.
Fina reported a 17 per cent drop in the average well-head price for the
company's crude oil and natural gas production, and a 15-year low for
natural gas prices. A cost-reduction programme is under way, as is the sale
of 'non-strategic' upstream and downstream assets.
Overall, Petrofina's group production was down 1.4 per cent in 1991, with
reserves almost unchanged at 849m barrels. Sales of petroleum products rose
1.4 per cent, despite the recession in its main European and US markets.
The profit figure also included an extraordinary amortisation charge of
BFr1.7bn, reflecting the effect of changed accounting rules and adjustments
to the value of inventories to bring them into line with market prices.

BANESTO, the Spanish retail bank, lifted pre-tax profits of its financial
group in 1991 by 27 per cent, to Pta75.6bn (Dollars 763m), and will raise
its dividend by 5 per cent to Pta157.5 net per share.
The financial group, excluding industrial holdings, increased its operating
margin by 26 per cent. Income from commissions grew by 67.7 per cent.
The profit figure was boosted by the first inclusion in the consolidated
results of the Banesto-controlled Portuguese bank, Totta y Acores, and by
Pta34.1bn from the disposal of assets, a 50 per cent increase on 1990.
Last year, Banesto sold its majority stake in the petrol refiner, Petromed,
to British Petroleum; 24 per cent of its insurance arm, La Union y Fenix, to
France's AGF; and a small subsidiary bank network, Catala de Credit, to a
consortium that included the Italian bank San Paolo di Torino.
The pre-tax consolidated profits of the bank's industrial conglomerate,
Corporacion Industrial y Financiera de Banesto, showed a 16 per cent fall
last year, to Pta27.7bn.
Telefonica, the telecommunications group and one of Spain's foremost
corporations reported a net 1991 profit increase of 6.7 per cent.
Telefonica lifted net profits to Pta80bn. In the second half of the year,
the telecommunications company reduced its financial charges from 21.3 per
cent of income to 16.8 per cent.
Banco Exterior de Espana, the state-controlled Spanish retail bank which
pooled its business last year with smaller public credit agencies, posted
net profits of Pta31.4bn in 1991.
This represents a 47.4 per cent increase on the sum of the profits declared
by its constituent banks the previous year.

FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Nobel to reclaim unit's rescue
cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals and defence group, is
to seek repayment of the SKr1.92bn (Dollars 326m) capital contribution it
made last August under an agreement to help a 14-bank consortium save its
finance subsidiary, Gamlestaden, from collapse.
The company also believes it should not have to pay a further SKr400m to
Gamlestaden, which is now owned by the banking consortium, by the end of
next year.
Nobel's move follows a recommendation to reclaim the money in a report last
week by Mr Jan Ramberg, professor of private law at Stockholm university. He
was commissioned by the company to investigate the crisis that led to the
downfall of Nobel's owner, Mr Eric Penser, and its takeover by the bank
consortium.
Nobel's demand seems likely to involve further negotiations with the banks,
who have suffered substantial losses as a result of their SKr5bn rescue of
Gamlestaden.
Professor Ramberg's report concludes that the terms of last August's
agreement between Nobel and the banks, covering the company's capital
contribution, are invalid. This is because of the pressure applied by the
banks on Nobel, contrary to Swedish law.
In discussions between the two sides last August, Nobel was forced not only
to accept paying a SKr2bn contribution (of which SKr1.6bn would be paid by
the end of 1991 and the rest by December 30, 1993) to help save Gamlestaden,
but also SKr320m in the form of a promissory note.
'Nobel was subjected to hard pressure to comply strictly with the agreement
obligations', says Professor Ramberg in his report. 'The credits were cut
off and the banks refused Nobel the right to deposit the disputed
contribution in a blocked account, pending legal examination, and thus
forced the board members, at the risk of personal responsibility for
damages, to pay the amount to Gamlestaden.'

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BP decision opens the way for disposal of
agricultural side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM has decided that the agricultural interests under its BP
Nutrition division are no longer a core asset, opening the way for the
businesses to be sold.
The decision to re-classify nutrition as a non-core activity was taken at
the end of last year following an operational review of all BP's activity.
The division will now have to be self-financing, with capital investment
coming from internal resources rather than the parent company.
A BP spokesman said: 'The business is not up for sale but we are looking for
it to feed cash back rather than absorbing capital investment.'
However, the decision has raised expectations that BP will be willing to
sell the business should a suitable buyer come forward. Bankers estimate
that the company could raise up to Pounds 600m from such a sale.
BP Nutrition breeds poultry and other livestock, manufactures animal feed
and markets meat products. In 1990, it turned in a profit of Pounds 48m on a
turnover of Pounds 2.68bn. Capital investment totalled Pounds 152m.
BP has trimmed total capital expenditure plans for this year by Dollars 500m
to Dollars 6.5bn. This has been accompanied by a campaign of cost-cutting
which has seen head-office staff reduced by 50 per cent and job losses
elsewhere.
Already this year, BP has announced the Dollars 125 sale of oil production
assets in Egypt and pulled out of a big liquified natural gas project in
Qatar. At the end of last year, bankers were appointed to secure the sale of
BP Canada's loss-making mining business, which has a book value of CDollars
200m.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Airedale wins more breathing space after
Pounds 56m interim loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIREDALE, the private holding company for the Magnet kitchen retailing
business, has won another year's breathing space from banks which it owes
over Pounds 660m, writes Simon London.
Announcing an interim loss of Pounds 56.1m for the six months to the end of
September, against Pounds 58.3m last time, Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman, said
that senior lenders have agreed to continue rolling up interest and
repayments of principle. The position will be reviewed again in December.
While interest costs of Pounds 47.3m (Pounds 43.3m) were charged, no cash
payments are being made. On the trading side, Magnet managed to trim
first-half operating losses from Pounds 15m to Pounds 8.8m, although there
was no improvement in trading conditions.
Sales were down 11 per cent at Pounds 99.9m.
While senior lenders are continuing to support Airedale, the company faces a
claim from GE Capital, which is pressing for early repayment of Pounds 70m
mezzanine debt.
The debt was provided in 1989 to finance the management buy-out of Magnet.
GE is claiming that it was misled over the conditions under which the loan
was made.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel to seek damages for cost of
extra safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL, the Channel tunnel operator, intends to claim damages from the
British and French governments to compensate for the cost of additional
safety requirements.
The company has written to the British department of transport about changes
to the tunnel's operation and rolling-stock design imposed by the
Anglo-French tunnel safety authority.
Eurotunnel says that since the increased standards were not part of the
original concession contract, the additional costs should be paid for by the
governments.
'We are looking for compensation for the additional requirements,' said Mr
Douglas Hogg, commercial and communications manager at Eurotunnel. 'It's
impossible to say how much exactly, but it's likely to be in the order of
Pounds 100m.'
The company has also complained that it has to implement the new
requirements by 1994, while cross-channel ferries are not obliged to meet
international stability standards until 1999. It said Eurotunnel's
concession contract obliges the governments to allow it to compete on equal
terms with ferry companies.
Mr Hogg pointed out that the National Audit Office reported last week that
spot-checks on ferries between 1989 and 1991 uncovered defects that could
have 'a serious impact on the survivability of passengers in the event of an
accident.'
Eurotunnel's complaints follow a report last December by the House of
Commons home affairs select committee rejecting the group's allegations that
its commercial prospects were being hit by the safety authority's
bureaucracy.
Meanwhile Eurotunnel is in dispute with contractors building the link about
cost-overuns. Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French
construction companies, is claiming additional payments of Pounds 800m at
1985 prices to cover changes to tunnel specifications.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell recycled seized funds to banks -
Last details of official investigations to be completed within weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY ALL of the Pounds 900m siphoned away by Mr Robert Maxwell from public
companies, pension funds and banks was recycled to other banks in a frantic
attempt to shore up his tottering private empire.
This is the conclusion of an analysis by the Financial Times based on the
initial findings of official investigations into the Maxwell empire.
Accountants and lawyers have spent months penetrating secret overseas trusts
and will complete last details of their search within weeks. Their answers
to where the money came from and where it went lay the ground for the next
stage of the investigation: how it got there, and who is responsible.
As the accompanying chart shows, between January 1991 and his death on
November 5 the late Mr Maxwell seized a total of around Pounds 900m.
The biggest part, an estimated Pounds 390m, came from Maxwell Communication
Corporation, one of his public companies. The mechanism for the transfer was
simple: he took around Pounds 200m from MCC's bank account in the form of
unsecured loans to his private companies, which also owed MCC a further
Pounds 50m in deferred payments on property transactions.
A further tranche was syphoned from MCC in the form of shares in Berlitz,
the language instruction company. Although MCC had agreed to sell its 56 per
cent stake in Berlitz, just after Mr Maxwell's death, it subsequently
discovered that most of these shares had been pledged to banks as
collateral, making the sale void and depriving MCC of a further Pounds 146m.
There is evidence that some of this happened after Mr Maxwell's death.
At least Pounds 300m was taken from the pension funds of Maxwell's
companies. Worst hit was the fund of Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr Maxwell's
second public company, whose pensioners are now facing poverty.
MGN also lost Pounds 97m from its bank account. Of this Pounds 47m was
transferred out to London &amp; Bishopsgate Group, a private Maxwell investment
vehicle, which was supposed to invest it in gilts, a particularly secure
form of investment. However the money disappeared - partly to the New York
Daily News, Maxwell's loss-making American venture.
The other Pounds 50m was a loan to MGN from Bankers Trust, the US bank - but
MGN never received the money.
Mr Maxwell also seized the Pounds 50m assets in First Tokyo Investment
Trust, which he acquired in 1991, for use by his private companies.
Evidence emerged last week to suggest that in the spring he also began to
"borrow" money from banks overnight by arranging foreign exchange deals with
them, and failing to close the position - or settle the account - at the end
of the day as the contracts required. It is now thought that this procedure
 -at which the banks began to protest vigorously - made him up to Pounds 50m
in 1991.
In round numbers, therefore, around Pounds 900m was obtained by Mr Maxwell
in 1991 from a variety of unorthodox sources. The investigators now have a
reasonably complete view of the uses of these funds.
Around Pounds 150m was soaked up rapidly by the trading losses of his
private businesses. His taste for investing in new or troubled newspapers
around the world had become a huge burden. The European consumed around
Pounds 20m, the New York Daily News an estimated Pounds 40m, and the
Berliner Verlag, a joint venture in Germany, another Pounds 40m.
AGB, the market research group, and other businesses such as the North Sea
helicopter fleet, together used some Pounds 50m.
It is now clear that Pounds 500m of the money went to satisfy the pressing
demands of the bankers who had lent nearly Pounds 1bn to the Maxwell private
companies. Around Pounds 200m went to repay debts that fell due. Another
Pounds 100m went in interest on the debt.
The Berlitz shares, and at least Pounds 50m of other stocks, were given as
additional collateral to the banks. The banks were demanding more collateral
because much of their loans in 1990 and early 1991 were backed by Mr
Maxwell's holding of MCC shares, and the MCC share price was falling.
That pressure on the MCC share price led to the operation that has most
shocked bankers and accountants working on the investigation - the secret
deals to support the MCC share price.
At first the share support was public. Mr Maxwell spent Pounds 150m in 1990
and a further Pounds 50m in 1991 on openly buying MCC shares. This took his
publicly declared stake in MCC to 68 per cent by early 1991.
But in April and May 1991, shortly before MCC issued a profits warning and
just ahead of the MGN flotation, he began to buy shares secretly through
hidden trusts in Lichtenstein, Switzerland, Panama and the British Virgin
Islands.
Some of this money - which ultimately totalled Pounds 200m - was from MCC
itself. It is illegal under UK company law for companies to buy shares
without their shareholders' permission.
So how much of the Pounds 900m is recoverable for creditors? The private
companies have some assets that are now being sold to help meet the debts
they owe to the banks, the public companies and the pension funds. But most
of this Pounds 900m seems unlikely to be recovered.
Accountants believe that in the last few days of their investigations of the
secret trusts they are unlikely to find hidden pots of Maxwell gold.

FT  03 FEB 92 / GPA rejects advice over flotation price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, has
rejected the advice from its merchant banks to price its new shares at
around Dollars 20 in its forthcoming flotation.
Mr Tony Ryan, the group's chairman and founder, was reported by one of his
advisers as telling the group's investment banks that such a price, which
would value the company at around Dollars 3bn, would mean selling the
company on the cheap. Mr Ryan owns 8 per cent of the company and every
dollar reduction in the share price would reduce his wealth by Dollars 10m.
GPA yesterday called an emergency board meeting at its headquarters in
Shannon, in the Republic of Ireland, to discuss the impending sale which
could take place as early as March or April.
The group's executives were first told on Friday, in a meeting with its
advisers in London, that the banks were proposing to price the new ordinary
shares at between Dollars 20 to Dollars 25, with the emphasis on the lower
price.
GPA executives immediately insisted on flying the bankers to Shannon.
Representatives from Japan's Nomura, Schroders, the UK merchant bank, and
Goldman Sachs of the US then had a meeting with Mr Ryan. Representatives
from Barclays de Zoete Wedd, GPA's UK brokers, were also present. Mr Ryan,
already irritated by what he heard, was reported to be even more angry when
told that one of the advisers was proposing selling the shares for as little
as Dollars 17 in order to be sure of placing Dollars 500m (Pounds 276m) of
the stock in the US.
One adviser to the group said: 'Mr Ryan hit the roof when he heard that'.
The offering will make multi-millionaires out of most of GPA's executive
directors.
GPA's advisers have now been told to come up with a new price in the next
few weeks. The row could cause a serious rift between the advisers, since
there are sharp differences of opinion between them on the proper value of
the company. It is understood that GPA would like to price the shares nearer
to Dollars 30.
Earlier this year GPA raised Dollars 100m through a private placement of
convertible redeemable preference shares in the US. These convert into
ordinary shares at a price of Dollars 34. GPA is considering raising about
Dollars 700m of new money in its flotation. However, shares with a value of
up to Dollars 1.5bn are likely to be on offer, the precise amount depending
on how many of its existing shareholders wish to sell.
The sale will also help GPA finance its ambitious programme of aircraft
purchases.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Economics Notebook: Tug-of-war starts over European central
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle to provide the home of the future European central bank is
hotting up.
The past few weeks have seen Mr Eddie George, the deputy governor of the
Bank of England, pressing London's case and Germany's Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, no less, taking up the cudgels for Frankfurt.
Considering that Britain has not fully embraced the idea of economic and
monetary union, Mr George's assertion that London's strength as an
international financial centre makes it the 'logical' location for future
European monetary institutions appears rather cheeky.
In unguarded moments, Bank officials have conceded that the headquarters of
the European central bank (ECB) may slip from their grasp. But they hope
that the issue is politically too finely balanced for any of the big
European financial centres, such as Frankfurt or Paris, to win. Instead they
have consoled themselves with a second-best option: basing the ECB in a less
prominent place such as Amsterdam or Lyons with the Bank of England in
London acting as its 'operating arm'.
The idea has a strong superficial appeal, not least because its advocates
see a working model for such a structure in the US Federal Reserve System.
At the centre of the Federal Reserve System is the Federal Reserve Board.
Those who see London as the operating arm of a future European system of
central banks take the reserve board as the model for the ECB with the Bank
of England cast in the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The seven-member reserve board is based in Washington, a long way (in
mentality, at least) from the financial markets of New York, Chicago and the
US west coast. The reserve board staff acts as a think-tank for the system
and helps inform the discussions of the Federal Open Market Committee, which
sets monetary policy.
The FOMC, which incidently gathers tomorrow and on Wednesday for the first
of its eight meetings this year, comprises the reserve board's seven members
and the president of the New York Fed as permanent members, and the
presidents of four of the other 11 regional reserve banks, who serve on the
FOMC in rotation.
The Federal Reserve Board does not carry out the FOMC's monetary policy
decisions. Instead, they are transmitted to the New York Fed which
implements them through its domestic trading desk. The New York Fed is very
clearly the 'operating arm' of the US central bank system. Its activities in
the US domestic financial markets subtract from or add to the reserves of
the US banking system and so determine the nation's interest rate structure.
Over the years, the New York Fed has acquired other responsibilities that
make it uniquely influential among the regional reserve banks. It acts as
the agent for the US Treasury in foreign exchange intervention. It is a
major participant in the US payments and settlements system, much of which
is concentrated in New York. Because of this, it gets caught up in dealing
with financial crises. It was, for example, closely involved in the damage
limitation exercise on financial markets that followed the demise of Drexel
Burnham Lambert, the junk bond securities house.
The activities of the New York Fed seem very much like those of the Bank of
England in the UK. But how relevant is the US example for the future
European economic and monetary union? And can the Bank of England
realistically aspire to influence on a par with that enjoyed by the New York
Fed in the event of the ECB headquarters being placed outside London?
Much will depend on the choice of location. If the ECB were to be based in
Frankfurt, for example, it would be more likely to develop powerful
centralising tendencies than if it were located in Luxembourg or Lyons.
But some things are running in London's favour. Thanks to careful nurturing
by the UK Treasury and Bank, London has emerged as the premier market
dealing in the European currency unit and Ecu instruments. It is, along with
New York and Tokyo, one of the three leading foreign exchange trading
centres in the world.
Foreign exchange market clout might seem of little consequence as the
European Community moves towards adopting the Ecu as a single currency. But
if present trading patterns are any guide, London would probably be the
preferred centre for a future ECB to intervene with Ecu against other
currencies such as the dollar, yen - or even a future convertible rouble.
As Mr George pointed out last month, London trades a smaller proportion of
national European currencies than are traded in other European foreign
exchange markets, and a correspondingly higher proportion of non-EC
currencies.
On the other hand, London is nowhere near as dominant a financial centre in
Europe as New York is in the US. Frankfurt and Paris are bigger in relation
to London than Chicago and San Francisco in relation to New York.
Although London has been developing its settlement and clearance systems, it
has a long way to go before it can provide facilities on a continental
scale. National practices will also persist long after Europe moves to a
single monetary policy and currency. It is barely conceivable that French or
German banks would move to London from Paris or Frankfurt to be supplied
with central bank funds in the same way the US money centre banks are
supplied with reserves by the New York Fed.
The future European central bank system will therefore be more likely to
have several rather than just one operating arm. Some of Europe's former
national central banks may develop special responsibilities: foreign
exchange intervention could perhaps be concentrated in London. But such
developments will not come without a fight.
That at least is the view of officials working on the structure of the ECB
and its forerunner institute, the European Monetary Institute (EMI). Several
were contacted last week and none of them believed that a single EC central
bank, such as the Bank of England, could be designated the 'operating arm'
for the system.
This adds to the importance of the decision that EC leaders must make before
the end of this year over where to put the EMI. The ECB is generally
expected to be based in the same location as the EMI. Once the future home
of the European central bank is decided, fierce competition will break out
among the central banks in the 'losing' financial centres to secure as much
influence as possible.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Parker Pen auction may raise up to Pounds 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARKER Pen, the writing instrument maker, is for sale in a global auction
likely to raise up to Pounds 300m, its advisers said yesterday.
After three previous attempts to sell the company, this is the first time
the international group has been marketed throughout the world.
Mr Gerry Grimstone, head of the disposals unit at Schroders, the UK merchant
bank, which is handling the sale, has drawn up a list of potential buyers in
Europe, America and Asia.
Parker is expected to make operating profits of about Pounds 33m this year,
after investing Pounds 1m in a new stationery line, on sales of around
Pounds 180m. It has borrowings of Pounds 54m. The group's managers, who
bought out the group in 1985, are likely to become millionaires following
the sale.
Parker failed twice to float itself on the stock exchange in the 1980s. It
agreed a friendly takeover with Pentland in 1988, only to see the Pounds
180m deal fall apart when its institutional backers objected. Mr Jacques
Margry, chief executive, was then quoted as saying: 'I do not want any more
offers.'
However, advisers to Parker said Mr Margry and his management now want to
leave the group after seven years in which they have concentrated on brand
promotion and taking the group's image up-market. A sale by flotation was
rejected because Schroders expects to raise more through a trade sale.
Parker's advisers stressed that at the time of the aborted Pentland deal the
group was not marketed to any other company.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Waste group in Dollars 500m offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 500m (Pounds 276m) public offering of shares in Waste Management
International is being brought forward and is likely to take place in late
March, according to City firms with a close knowledge of the company.
The flotation is expected to value the whole of the business, which is a
subsidiary of the US company, Waste Management Incorporated (WMI), at
between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn.
WMI is the world's biggest waste disposal and treatment company and has a
market value of Dollars 20bn. It wants to float Waste Management
International to help finance rapid expansion of this overseas business.
The timing and structure of the share sale is similar to the offering of
shares planned by Guinness Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft
leasing company.
A listing for Waste Management International will be obtained in both London
and New York. Around 50 per cent of the shares are earmarked for the US: the
rest will be distributed throughout Europe.
The sale is being organised by the US investment banks, Merrill Lynch and
Kidder Peabody, with the City of London merchant bank, Lazard Brothers, and
the City stockbroker, Cazenove.
At the end of last week, UK fund managers received a document on Waste
Management International prepared by Cazenove. One who received the document
said it was an obvious signpost on the road to flotation.
WMI currently has a direct shareholding of 70 per cent in Waste Management
International. It has an interest in the remaining 30 per cent through two
quoted subsidiaries, Wheelabrator Technologies and Chemical Waste
Management, which have respective holdings of 15 per cent in the
international business.
After flotation, WMI's holding is expected to fall to 56 per cent.
Wheelabrator and Chemical Waste are expected to reduce their holdings to
approximately 12 per cent each.
Waste Management International is likely to make a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities regulator, in the next
few weeks, in preparation for the share sale. It cannot discuss flotation
until it has done this, so yesterday it refused to comment.
Over the past 20 years, WMI's annual turnover has grown from Dollars 16m to
Dollars 7.5bn and earnings per share have risen at a compound annual rate of
29 per cent.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Anatomy of a banking nightmare: The cautionary tale of the
TSB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no better cautionary tale for bankers than TSB Group's ill-fated
foray into commercial lending. It is the story of a savings bank which got
into a business, corporate lending, whose risks it did not properly
appreciate.
It then lent too much too quickly and concentrated much of the lending on a
particularly risky sector, property.
The price of this mistake has been high. The bank recently disclosed an
annual loss of Pounds 47m, in large part because it made provisions of
Pounds 432m to cover possible losses on commercial loans made by its
subsidiary, Hill Samuel.
These provisions were equivalent to 9 per cent of Hill Samuel's loan
portfolio, a very high rate. But just over four years ago, TSB was confident
that by paying Pounds 777m for Hill Samuel, it would shed its dowdy image as
a savings bank and pose a challenge to England's quartet of clearing banks.
It can now claim close kinship with the clearing banks, but not in the way
it wanted. As a proportion of its total loan book, its losses from corporate
lending are even bigger than theirs. The group would be in trouble without
its unglamorous traditional business.
At the end of March 1987, six months before the deal with TSB, Hill Samuel
had a Pounds 1bn portfolio of corporate and personal loans. Mr Don
McCrickard, TSB's chief executive, says it then inherited another Pounds
2.5bn of corporate loans already made by TSB and its subsidiaries. But the
loans which have caused today's difficulties were made in the main between
the end of 1987 and mid 1990. In this period, Hill Samuel lent a further
Pounds 3.5bn, according to former Hill Samuel executives. Mr McCrickard says
that most of the growth in lending took place before mid 1989, when Pounds
3bn was added. In other words, for a year and a half, TSB was expanding its
loan book at an annual rate of more than 50 per cent, an unusually high
rate.
When a lending book is being expanded so rapidly, it is difficult to
maintain the standards used to assess potential borrowers.
'Where we might have lent Pounds 2m in the past, we were suddenly lending
Pounds 5m. The decisions were not bad at the time they were taken, but the
amounts lent were probably too large,' says a former Hill Samuel executive.
Lending was directed towards the particularly vulnerable sectors of property
and construction. Together these sectors account for 59 per cent of Hill
Samuel's 1991 bad debt charge.
TSB's board has made it plain whom it holds responsible for the Hill Samuel
mess. About a third of Hill Samuel's management has left in the past nine
months. The most notable departures are Mr Hamish Donaldson, who was chief
executive, and Mr Ted Emerson, head of banking.
Only two out of the top 12 executives from the expansionist epoch have
survived - those in charge of personnel and legal and administrative
affairs.
Hill Samuel's corporate banking department has been cut from 600 people to
less than 540. Only four of Hill Samuel's 11 branch directors survived.
The departed executives do not deny their share of blame. But they are
bitter that the TSB board has apparently absolved itself of responsibility.
'From May 1988 onwards Hill Samuel was very firmly under the management of
TSB executives', says another former senior Hill Samuel director. 'Some of
the blame for the loans that went wrong must lie with them.'
Their anger is directed principally at Mr Don McCrickard, TSB's chief
executive. Mr McCrickard did not initiate the increase in lending, which was
the joint responsibility of TSB's chairman at the time, Sir John Read, and
his then managing director, Mr Philip Charlton.
However former Hill Samuel executives say that from 1988 onwards, Mr
McCrickard was the principal link between the merchant bank and its parent
and thus in a position to curtail the lending spree earlier than he did. TSB
accepts that Mr McCrickard had responsibility for Hill Samuel from an early
stage - though his capacity to control the bank is now difficult to assess,
because TSB's cumbersome management structure of the time has since been
simplified.
During 1988 Mr McCrickard, already a TSB main board director, moved across
from running UDT, TSB's finance house operation, to its head office. He
became group deputy managing director for banking in February 1988, and in
April was appointed as chief executive of a new bank holding company which
embraced both TSB and Hill Samuel.
His main task from 1988 was to forge the group's six or seven scattered
banking operations into a unity. A year later he moved upwards again,
becoming chief executive of TSB Bank in January, and chief executive of the
entire group in December.
Mr McCrickard says that he started to apply the brakes on lending in May
1989: 'From then onwards we gripped the business increasingly firmly . . .
We started to slow down the business in the summer of 1989.'
'We could have put our foot on the brakes a few months earlier, but it would
not have changed the nature of the problem.'
By the second half of 1990, Mr McCrickard says he was badly alarmed at the
way things were going at Hill Samuel. 'I put the business under the
microscope and saw a clear element of managerial shortfall' he says.
However, Mr McCrickard is hopeful Hill Samuel, under new management, can
recover. He adds that Hill Samuel now falls into two distinct parts: its
healthy mainstream business and a Pounds 680m rump of non-performing loans,
managed as a separate business unit, on which the bank has doubts about
borrowers' abilities to make payments.
One former executive warns: 'TSB board members' public criticism of Hill
Samuel has been damaging. They have hurt the business so much that it is
going to be a long haul for it to recover'.
Mr McCrickard is a realist. He says that further bad debts may keep Hill
Samuel in the red for at least another year: 'It depends on how quickly
there is a turn around in the economy.'

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK urged to set up another tier of research institution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN should promote a new tier of technological research institutions,
modelled on German lines, to act as a bridge between universities and
industry, an independent report says.
As part of a bold attempt to improve industry's use of technical expertise,
the interim report prepared by the Working Group on Innovation, an
independent initiative set up last year, also proposes a Faraday City award,
similar to the European City of Culture label.
The report, to be sent to party leaders this week, was written by Sir John
Fairclough, former chief scientific adviser to the Cabinet Office and now
chairman of the Engineering Council, an umbrella body for 46 professional
institutions.
It says that existing independent research and development companies, which
pay their way by doing contract work for industry, should be given a higher
public profile, copying the German Fraunhofer Institutes. They would then
receive some public funding and be encouraged to take on higher degree
students.
The idea is that this would bridge the gap between industry, which rarely
sees academia as a source of fruitful new ideas, and scientists who fail to
exploit fully their ideas in the private sector.
The Association of Independent Research and Technology Organisations
represents many companies that could fall into this category. Its members
employ 10,000 staff, more than half of them scientists or engineers. They
turn over more than Pounds 300m a year, representing more contract research
than UK universities and polytechnics combined.
By upgrading these companies, the expense of building new institutions from
scratch would be avoided.
At a local level, the Faraday City tag would concentrate advice and
facilities for industrial research and development on one city for a year or
two.
The models for this plan, the Fraunhofer Institutes, are permanent bodies.
Their success is measured by revenues they generate from industrial
contracts. They also have close links with universities. The managing
director of a Fraunhofer Institute usually has a chair at a university and
the laboratories are on campus.
Institute employees often regard themselves in transition from academia to
industry. Such a bridge does not exist in the UK, says the Centre for the
Exploitation of Science and Technology, a UK industry and state-funded
research organisation also chaired by Sir John Fairclough.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Brooke hints at post-election pact with Ulster Unionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave the clearest
hint yet that the Tories would consider a pact with the Ulster Unionist
party in the event of a hung parliament.
In a television interview, Mr Brooke did not rule out the possibility of a
deal and said it might even provide 'impetus' to his efforts to start
roundtable talks on Northern Ireland's political future.
He said the government might amend the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement - a
central demand of Unionist leaders - if such a move could be agreed with the
Irish government.
His comments will add to speculation that the Tories would turn to Ulster
Unionist MPs for support at Westminster rather than to the Liberal
Democrats.
Mr Paddy Ashdown has made it clear that the Liberal Democrats would push for
electoral reform as the price for their support.
There are nine Ulster Unionist MPs plus three from the Rev Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionist party - who might also support a Tory administration -
compared with 22 Liberal Democrats.
The Ulster Unionists and Tories have historical ties but, since the
imposition of direct rule from Westminster of Northern Ireland in 1972, the
two parties have drifted apart. In Ulster they will be standing against each
other in the general election.
Mr John Major has previously heightened speculation about a deal by
rejecting Labour and Liberal Democrat calls for a tripartite understanding
that the Anglo-Irish Agreement would not be renegotiated during the election
campaign. No formal talks between the Ulster Unionists and Tories have taken
place so far.
Mr Brooke, speaking on LWT's Walden Programme, reiterated his determination
to resume round-table talks if he remained as Northern Ireland secretary
after the election.
However, he said he might impose some form of local or regional government
if negotiations failed to reach a conclusion within the lifetime of the next
parliament.
Mr Brooke said that the outcome of the general election might match that of
February 1974, when no party won an overall majority and Mr Edward Heath,
the Tory leader, considered a pact with the Ulster Unionists.
Rather than insist that the Conservatives would win an overall majority, Mr
Brooke added: 'I'm not going to predict what might happen on a future
occasion.'
He did not accept that the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party
would refuse to take part in round-table talks if the Unionists and Tories
struck a deal.
One senior SDLP official warned that Mr Brooke was being 'naive' if he
thought the party would simply shrug off a Tory-Unionist pact. He said: 'It
would colour people's views very heavily.'
Mr Brooke refused to pledge that changes to the Anglo-Irish Agreement would
not be part of any negotiations with the Ulster Unionists.
However, he emphasised that, because it was an international treaty, changes
would have to be agreed with the Irish government.

<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Rigg's letter (January 28) is incorrect, irrational and insulting to
our customers and to those employed in, and associated with, the life
insurance industry.
For the large majority of people in this country life insurance is by far
the most popular means of long-term savings. It offers financial protection,
peace of mind and pooled investment expertise. This has led to a record of
excellent long term returns in a very competitive market place, with
millions of satisfied policyholders.
Policyholders enjoy the protection of a regulatory framework that has never
been stronger. Selling practices, which Mr Rigg attacks, are in particular
closely controlled and monitored. Great emphasis is placed on suitability
and the long-term nature of the contracts.

Sir, So Mr Neil Kinnock is going to raise pensions 'at once' if elected, ie
before equalising state pension ages. That would, of course, not only
benefit many not in need, but further widen the gap in the treatment of
comparable men and women, thereby certainly breaching the spirit - and
probably, also, the law - of the EC directive on equal treatment in social
security.
Would not the Pounds 3bn or so it would cost to raise the pension be better
spent in equalising pension age at 60 (to be the starting age of a pension
decade) to bring justice to half the population and benefit to many now
without pension or earnings?

Sir, In view of the correspondence about the importance of using the
Japanese language to do business successfully in Japan which has appeared in
your columns (Letters, January 15, 21 and 27), two points may be worth
noting.
First, in research recently undertaken by Gallup in Japan into Japanese
corporate buyer attitudes, the majority of respondents believed that 'it is
important for businessmen from abroad to have the ability to conduct
business in the Japanese language'.
Second, Priority Japan, the industry-to-industry campaign which follows on
from the Opportunity Japan Campaign, is actively trying to spread the word
among British companies about the need to do business in Japanese and to
take advantage of the various schemes to train their personnel in the
language.
This is not to contradict senior industrialists quoted by Mr Alan Tomlinson
(January 27) as preferring Japanese staff for their Japanese operations.
On the contrary British industry needs to invest both in a presence in
Japan, staffed by Japanese and/or non-Japanese nationals, and in a greater
awareness and knowledge of things Japanese at home.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Self-appointed patron of poor: Imelda Marcos's presidential
aspirations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Mrs Imelda Marcos returned to the Philippines last November she has
collected law suits as she used to collect shoes. The widow of the country's
late dictator and self-appointed champion of the poor has already been
charged on more than 100 counts, ranging from tax evasion to theft of
hundreds of millions of dollars.
In spite of these lawsuits, Mrs Marcos is pressing ahead with her attempt to
become president of the Philippines. Last week she filed as a candidate in
the May polls, the first since President Corazon Aquino came to power in
1986 after a failed coup had triggered a popular revolution.
A comeback by Imelda could be dismissed as the dream of a deluded and
unemployed former First Lady. But Mrs Marcos is creating enough of a stir to
suggest that, even if she will not win, she will again play an important
role on the political stage.
For this she has Mrs Aquino in part to thank. Restoration of democratic
institutions after 14 years of martial law under President Ferdinand Marcos
has been a painful experience.
Mrs Aquino's reluctance to seize the reins of power and give firm leadership
has led to policy drift, an uncertain investment climate and a stagnant
economy.
Divisions in the ruling party will be exacerbated by Mrs Aquino's choice of
General Fidel Ramos, the former defence secretary, as her preferred
successor.
A protestant in a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Gen Ramos was also
head of the Philippine Constabulary for a decade under President Marcos and
may have awkward questions to answer.
Mrs Marcos is astute enough to capitalise on these shortcomings. Remarkably,
the nation's greatest shopper is presenting herself as the underdog, an
'oppressed widow and orphan', rebuilding her ties with the poor.
'For years the poor have cried with me,' she said last week from the
splendour of her Dollars 2,000-a-day Imperial Suite at the Plaza Hotel.
She brushes aside suggestions that these statements are inconsistent with
her fabulously opulent lifestyle before she was ousted with President Marcos
in 1986. 'When you are First Lady you are like a guiding light holding some
kind of torch,' she says, waving a diamond ring she says Mr Marcos bought
with a fortune he had already made when they married 37 years ago.
Sceptics have suggested that Mrs Marcos's presidential aspirations might not
be entirely divorced from her imminent trials in Manila.
But Mrs Marcos dismisses this suggestion. 'They say the voice of the people
is the voice of God,' she says, hinting that being elected would be
vindication enough. 'But I am not afraid to go through judicial and legal
process.'
Manila's intelligentsia has largely scoffed at Mrs Marcos, partly because of
a string of outlandish theories. She believes, for example, that Chinese
adventurers are poised to strike south to reopen Manila's seventeenth
century galleon trade with Mexico.
These critics say that she can only win by buying the elections, like her
husband tried to do in 1986. But they may be missing the point; Mrs Marcos
is not talking to them. 'I have support from the masses, the people, the
poor ones,' she claims.
At a rally outside an army camp last week, Mrs Marcos did indeed seem to
inspire a collective amnesia. She also has a surprisingly commanding
presence before her 'little people'.
Such advantages may not be enough. Realistically, Mrs Marcos is running for
president from too far back in the field. Her best chance is to link up with
her husband's most accomplished business associate, Mr Eduardo 'Danding'
Cojuangco, another of the eight presidential candidates.
But for the moment she sounds like a true believer in her own humbug. 'I was
like a tree that was fruitful, flourishing and productive, who could not
grow a leaf, not a single flower to share with people in need,' she says of
her time in exile. 'To be uprooted was the beginning of slow death.'
If forgiving Filipinos fall for this line and allow Mrs Marcos her comeback,
the outside world will surely feel that the restored democracy has failed.
The Philippines could then lose much of the international business and
political support it still badly needs.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Ballot box conundrum: The merits of proportional
representation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown favours it. Mr John Major doesn't. Mr Neil Kinnock is
thinking about it - but agreed to it for Scotland and London last week.
Every other country in the European Community except France has it. All the
emerging democracies in eastern Europe have chosen it.
'It' is proportional representation (PR) as the system for electing
political representatives, and the debate on its pros and cons is
intensifying in the UK as the election looms.
Mr Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have a vested interest in a proportional
voting system. As a third party with support spread across the country, the
first-past-the-post system serves them ill: the Liberal Democrats and their
predecessors have never won more than 23 seats (out of up to 650) in a
general election since the second world war, despite gaining up to 26 per
cent of the vote. With strict proportionality, they would have been entitled
to about 150 seats in 1987, and held the balance of power.
However, the growing interest in electoral reform is due not to the Liberal
Democrats alone, but to the possibility of a hung parliament after the
election. Mr Major has ruled out trading PR in a deal with Mr Ashdown. But
Mr Kinnock, whose Labour party last won an election nearly 18 years ago, is
already moving towards electoral reform.
Last week, Labour agreed to PR for elections to the Scottish Assembly and
the Greater London Authority it plans to set up. It is also likely to
introduce PR for elections to the European Parliament, where the UK's
adherence to first-past-the-post has produced extreme distortion, affecting
the overall party balance at Strasbourg.
It might not be too difficult for Mr Kinnock to go the whole hog and
introduce PR for the House of Commons should Labour require Liberal Democrat
votes to oust the Tories in a hung parliament - provided there can be some
agreement on which system to adopt.
The variety of PR systems has been an obstacle to wider discussion of
electoral reform - first-past-the-post at least has the merit of
familiarity. The detailed working of Ireland's system of single transferable
vote are understood by few, and even sophisticated German voters have
difficulty in grasping their additional member system.
Yet in reality, there is little complex about the options, which can be
reduced to five broad choices (see illustration). The decision about which
voting system is to be chosen depends on the weight to be given to five
factors:
Fairness. The traditional raison d'etre for supporters of PR is that it is
fairer - the number of MPs would correspond more closely to the popular vote
than under first-past-the-post.
The degree of fairness can be measured using the index of proportionality
devised by Professor Richard Rose of Strathclyde University. This
widely-accepted measure is based on the sum of the differences between each
party's share of seats and its share of the vote, divided by two and
subtracted from 100. The higher the index, the greater the degree of
proportionality.
The UK index has fallen from a peak of 97 in 1951 to 80 in the 1987 general
election, as the rise in popularity of the Liberal Democrats and their
predecessors has failed to be reflected in the Commons. It is now well below
the range of 87 to 99 for PR systems used in other countries.
However, comparisons between different countries show that some countries
which use first-past-the-post do produce proportional results. In the US,
for example, first-past-the-post elections to the House of Representatives
gave an index of 94 in 1988 - with only two serious parties, there are fewer
'wasted votes'. In Spain and Greece, both of which use list systems, the
index of proportionality is less than 90 because voting is based on regions
and there are rules to exclude small parties.
Whether any PR system is more or less proportional than first-past-the-post,
therefore, could depend on the rules of the game and national party systems.
Coalition government. The chief argument of opponents of electoral reform is
that it militates against 'effective government'. First-past-the-post in the
UK usually gives the party with the most votes a majority of seats in the
Commons.
Under PR, outright parliamentary majorities for a single party are unlikely
because smaller parties are encouraged. That means government by coalition,
in which legislative programmes are assembled by horse-trading after
elections, and where smaller parties can wield undue power by threatening to
withdraw their support.
The economic performance of different European countries, however, suggests
that the identification of effective government with one-party rule is not
convincing. Strong economies have flourished in countries such as Germany
which have entrenched PR systems, while the UK's lack-lustre performance has
been under a series of one-party governments.
But the experience of Germany does illustrate one feature of PR which many
opponents find hard to swallow: it often gives a pivotal role for centre
parties such as the Liberal Democrats in any coalition. Germans joke that
they can vote for any government so long as Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher of the
liberal Free Democrats is foreign minister.
Extremist parties. There is a danger in any system of proportional
representation that being fairer to small parties may end up being less fair
to larger parties - and to the majority of people who have voted for them.
The Israeli list system, for example, provides seats in the Knesset for
religious and extremist parties with 1 or 2 per cent of the popular vote.
They can force the larger parties to implement policies for which there is
no popular support as a condition for coalition.
Elsewhere, extreme right-wing parties, such as Jean-Marie Le Pen's National
Front in France, have achieved parliamentary representation under PR
elections which has been denied to their UK equivalents under
first-past-the-post.
Most PR systems try to exclude small minorities, usually by some form of
threshold which excludes parties which fail to win a minimum share of the
popular vote. In Germany, the figure is 5 per cent, which has excluded small
right-wing parties but allowed the Greens to enter the Bundestag. But such
thresholds do mitigate the proportionality of the final result.
Accountability to the electorate. One feature of the UK's
first-past-the-post system is that there is a one-to-one link between MPs
and their constituencies. Most proportional representation systems break
this direct link to some degree.
The list system does this most radically, by creating regional or even
nationwide multi-member constituencies. It also puts more power in the hands
of the party leaders who select the candidates for the list.
Single transferable vote, the Liberal Democrats' favoured system, also
creates multi-member constituencies - typically with three to five members.
While this breaks the direct one-to-one link between constituency and MP, it
may allow constituents to approach an MP from the party they voted for
(assuming that MPs from more than one party are elected).
Labour's strong desire to retain a direct constituency accountability for
MPs means that the party is most likely to endorse the additional member
system used in Germany. Half or more of the MPs are directly elected by
constituencies, with the rest being allocated to ensure representation which
matches the popular vote.
Representation of minorities. The UK parliament does not fairly reflect the
composition of British society - less than 7 per cent of MPs are women, and
only five are from the black and Asian ethnic minorities. Clearly, this
reflects the choice of candidates by parties, and could be changed if
parties had the will to insist on it. But some PR systems make it easier to
create a more representative legislature.
For example, the list system can be used to promote greater representation
by women and ethnic minorities simply by ensuring that they appear near the
top of the parties' lists. Similarly, women and minority representatives can
be used in the topping-up process which makes Germany's additional member
system proportional.
It would, however, be nave to think that weighing of such issues will
determine the character of a reformed electoral system. At the end of the
day, inter-party haggling will decide the issue - as it always has.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ELECTORAL SYSTEM - THE MAIN OPTIONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
First-past-the-post: The candidate with the highest number of votes in a
  constituency is elected, even if he/she receives a minority of the
  votes cast.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Alternative vote: Voters number candidates in order of preference. If no
  candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the votes, the second choices
  appearing on the ballot for the candidate with the lowest umber of
  votes are re-allocated until one candidate wins a majority of votes
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
List system: Voters vote for party lists of candidates in multi-member
  constituencies. Seats are divided between the parties in proportion to
  the vote gained in the constituency and allocated to candidates from
  the top of the list, working down.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Single transferable vote: Multi-member constituencies, with voters
  numbering candidates in order of preference. Complex formula elects
  candidates receiving more than a set quota of votes. Second and
  subsequent preferences on votes in excess of the quota and those with
  the lowest numbers of first preferences are redistributed until enough
  candidates reach the quota.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional member system: At least half the seats are elected on a
  first-past-the-post basis. The rest are allocated to parties on some
  sort of list basis, so that the number of representatives reflects the
  distribution of the popular vote.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Strengthening the UN's role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCEPTICS have described the summit of the 15-member United Nations Security
Council at the end of last week as no more than a 'photo opportunity',
allowing various world leaders to burnish their images. But that is a very
short-sighted view of an event which, if it did not produce any dramatic
results, nevertheless has important longer-term implications for what some
call the 'new world order'.
The foundations of this new international system were laid by the ending of
the Cold War and the new spirit of collaboration between the US and the
former Soviet Union, which made the UN-backed military operation to oust
Iraq from Kuwait possible. However, with the disintegration of the Soviet
Union and the departure of its leader, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the rosy
international outlook of only a few months ago quickly changed again.
The decision by Mr John Major, in his capacity as current chairman of the
Security Council, to call a members' summit was therefore well-judged. The
replacement of the Soviet Union by Russia as a permanent member, the arrival
on the international scene of Mr Boris Yeltsin as Russia's new president and
the appointment of a new UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Ghali of Egypt,
all justified both a solemn rededication to UN principles and a reappraisal
of the organisation's tasks and functions.
Collective security
The first, though not the second of these objectives was satisfactorily
attained. Mr Yeltsin has enthusiastically committed himself to the principle
of collective security and a stronger UN peace-keeping and peace-enforcement
role. His proposals for sweeping new cuts in nuclear arms and endorsement of
stricter controls over the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction also
augur well for the continuation of the disarmament process. But the 15
leaders have done no more than scratch the surface of how the UN should
fulfil its strengthened peace-keeping and peace-making role.
Mr Boutros Ghali has been given only a very general mandate to prepare by
July 1 recommendations on enhancing the UN's capacity for preventive
diplomacy and peace-keeping. He is known to be a fundamentally cautious man
and it might have been better, at the beginning of his term of office, if he
had been given more detailed guidelines by the Security Council. Indeed, in
view of all that was said about the need for the world organisation to play
a more active role, it was surprising that there was so little enthusiasm
for the proposal of French President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Yeltsin for
a permanent UN standby force. Article 43 of the UN Charter specifically
provides for such a force, and the international climate will never be more
propitious than it is now for setting it up.
'Winning team'
The failure of the summit to have even the most cursory debate about the
composition of the Security Council was also disappointing. 'You don't
change a winning team,' Mr Major is reported to have said. But that, surely,
cannot be the decisive criterion when the permanent members of that team no
longer include some of the strongest players in the world, Germany and
Japan.
The make-up of the Security Council no longer reflects present-day
realities. The defeated powers of the second world war are now among the top
three most powerful economies in the world. Japan alone contributes 12.5 of
the UN's total budget, nearly half the US contribution and larger than the
British and French shares combined.
Their absence from the permanent ranks of the Security Council is nothing
less than an aberration at a time when the UN wants to enhance its role and
can only undermine its authority and credibility. It is true that changing
the composition of the Council could lead to demands from many other nations
for permanent membership or a change in the functioning of the UN
institutions. Yet however complicated the solution might be, that cannot be
considered sufficient reason for permanently ignoring a problem of such
significance for the new international order.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Arts: Goldoni's 'Clever Wife' - Teatro Della Corte, Genoa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last summer, when I visited Genoa's shining new Teatro della Corte for the
first time, there was a not-quite-ready atmosphere about the hall: carpets
not laid, some doors still not hung, the wall-covering not in place, bar not
functioning; on stage, however, all went well, and the rare Victor Hugo
play, Mille francs de recompense, was a deserved success.
Now, a second visit to the theatre, after six months of operation, reveals a
fully operative house in ordered, constant activity, in a position also to
receive guests. This month finds the Teatro Stabile of Umbria in temporary
residence, presenting Carlo Goldoni's seldom-seen play La moglie saggia in a
thought-provoking production that makes us view the atypical work of the
great 18th century dramatist in a new light (or perhaps, given certain
aspects of the staging, it would be more accurate to say in a new darkness).
Goldoni was a tireless worker. He wrote dozens of librettos, tragicomedies,
an extended autobiography and a body of 116 plays, including many undisputed
masterpieces. Though he has never been anything but popular in Italy, there
was for many decades a tendency to concentrate on those masterpieces and
leave the unexplored Goldoni alone.
The interpretation of Goldoni, over the centuries, also became codified,
stylised. Now and then a great artist - like the late Cesco Baseggio - could
breathe life, wit, pathos, intensity into what had seemed stereotypes; but
more often, and to most people, Goldoni meant wigs and buckled pumps,
mincing and moues. Luchino Visconti and Giorgio Strehler discarded all that
excess baggage and, after them, a new generation of producers - including
Luca Ronconi - continued the process, both of reviving unknown Goldoni works
and of presenting them in a fresh visual frame.
A contemporary of Ronconi's, Giuseppe Patroni Griffi - himself a venturesome
playwright - has taken a fresh, clinical look at La moglie saggia and has
emphasised, with justification, its dark, even sinister nature, somewhat at
the expense of the japery of the comic servants, an inescapable ingredient
in Goldoni. The apparent story of the play is simple: a dissolute count has
tired of his bourgeoise wife and is courting the eccentric Marchesa. When
the wife cleverly puts the Marchesa in an intolerable social situation,
forcing her to dismiss the count, he plans - and nearly achieves - his
wife's murder. But the clever wife foils him, he admires her sagacity, and
they are reunited while the Marchesa withdraws from the scene in defeat.
Goldoni, in 1752, apparently considered this a happy ending, which was what
his public demanded. But, as Patroni Griffi stages it, the ending is
positively Strindbergian. The wife tells her feckless husband to love her
'because she is his' - his property - and they apparently settle to continue
an unequal marriage, a pact. The concluding mood is resignation. After a
near-murder alla Hitchcock (the glass of poisoned lemonade glows like the
famous glass of milk in Notorious), in a gloomy, anonymous room, husband and
wife and innamorata speak in passionless voices, as if the precedent,
terribly proximity of death had drained them.
This is a dark play, 'noir' indeed; but the sometimes excessively lugubrious
lighting obscured also the work's meaning, vitiating Patroni Griffi's own
concept. Thus in the splendid confrontation scene between the two women Anna
Maria Guarnieri, the wife, in her black dress practically merged with the
black drapery of the setting, and her facial expressions were, most of the
time, illegible. We were watching a play of shadows. And since Guarnieri's
tone was deliberately subdued (as opposed to the brilliant bravura of Ilaria
Occhini as the mettlesome Marchesa), the confrontations were unequal.
The title role was not the protagonist's. The Marchesa dominated the action.
Goldoni was extremely alert to class distinctions. Characteristically, the
bourgeoise-turned-countess speaks academic Italian, while her father, the
merchant Pantalone, speaks exclusively Venetian dialect. The producer, also
thanks to the appropriate costume by the excellent Gabriella Pescucci,
cleverly gave Pantalone a Balzac appearance. Worried about his daughter's
unhappiness, he also takes care to come to a shrewd financial settlement
with his son-in-law. The daughter, however, rejects the agreement; clearly
remaining a countess is more important than being rid of an unsatisfactory
husband.
The servants are the play's chorus, observantly critical of their employers,
ready to exploit them, but also to imitate them. Thus the count's valet
Brighella occasionally assumes tones echoing his master's arrogance and
sexism. Giovanni Crippa was excellent as the servant, at once sly and
ingenuous, matched by Anna Gualdo as his wife Corallina, devoted to her
maltreated mistress but totally unwilling to follow her submissive example.
Aldo Terlizzi's versatile sets, of agile curtains and columns helped the
producer create a flowing performance, slowed only now and then by the
unnecessary, protracted clowning of the two fawning parasites (the Florindo
of Fabio Rusca was particularly repetitive and, finally, tedious) and the
unfocussed bustle of the servants.
Still, this Moglie saggia is a welcome revival of a difficult, forgotten,
disturbing work by Italy's richest dramatist.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Arts: An artist inspired - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ben Johnson is one of the few practising artists in the world who is
inspired by architecture. This is curious because there was a time when
artists were architects and architects were artists. They spoke the same
language and understood one another.
In his new exhibition, at Fischer Fine Art in London until March 5, the
precise observations of this excellent artist are revealed in two guises.
The smaller half of the show is a group of abstract analyses of geometric
problems; the larger element consists of powerful architectural studies of
recent and much older buildings.
The artist has called his exhibition Paintings and Diverse Objects, with
perhaps the most spectacular object being the remarkable table, which is
both a painting and a sculpture. The other intriguing three-dimensional
object is the maquette for the giant, colourful mobile for the London
headquarters of ITN.
The most rewarding paintings are those recently painted in Italy. Johnson is
best known for his celebration of the geometry of high-tech buildings and
these explorations of classicism represent a newer, calmer phase of work. He
has been working in the Palladian villas in and around the Veneto, and there
is a new, textural quality in paintings like the one in Fischer's window of
the Teatro Olimpico at Vicenza - a stunning picture. His interior views are
always formal and cool, but in these Italian subjects an interest in surface
decoration is now apparent. Coolness returns to the palette in the long
vistas of the corridors at the Cini Foundation in Venice. They suggest both
solid architecture and watery infinity.
In many of the paintings, light draws the eye in to more eternal realms than
those actually painted. Johnson has a sense of universal geometry. It is
something he could one day apply to an exploration of the nude figure which,
if added to his repertoire, would virtually complete his artistic
achievement. As it is, his paintings are resolved, calm and beautiful - and
in the present climate, may it be said, bargains for the serious collector
of contemporary representational works of art.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Arts: The Prince's plan to restore the spirit to our age -
Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who needs a new school of architecture? This must have been the unspoken
question on the lips of all the guests at St.
James's Palace last Thursday when the Prince of Wales moved from criticism
to construction with his announcement of the establishment of his own new
Institute of Architecture. The Prince, standing against the glowing damask
walls of the palace, made a long, sometimes strange, and remarkable speech
as much about his own deepest personal beliefs as about architecture.
This kind of thinking affects different people in different ways. The
president of the Royal Institute of British Architects told me that he was
very moved by it. In fact, he welcomed the idea of a new school as a way of
healing some of the breaches that have grown up, not just between the public
and the profession but also between the various branches of the building and
planning business.
Prince Charles is not shy when it comes to facing up to what he considers to
be the arrogance of some professionals. He has long despised the
separateness of professionals from the realities of life. How many
architects have ever tasted life in one of their tower blocks? How many
architects have enjoyed a journey in a urine stained lift to a flat that is
running with condensation and has no opening windows? How far does this
professional remoteness come about through the weaknesses in architectural
education? It is surely a reflection of many of the beliefs that have been
promulgated for the last 50 years in schools of architecture throughout the
world:the belief that history does not count,the belief that functionalism
is the most important aspect of architectural design, and the certainty that
the architect is always right.
The Prince of Wales would say that it is all symptomatic of the spiritual
malaise of our times. As he said: 'We are told that our contemporary built
environment must reflect the 'spirit of our age'. But what concerns me most
of all is that we are succeeding in creating an 'age without spirit'.' He
was brave enough to expose the fact that what he feels is missing from much
modern architecture has nothing to do with style but much to do with
content. Content, for the Prince and for many others, has to do with
meaning. This is where we get on to sticky ground. Meaning in architecture
does have to do with the shared values of society and these can as easily be
material as spiritual. The problem with materialism is that it is a bit like
Chinese food, it can fill you up and still leave you unsatisfied.
I think this is what the Prince means. The architecture that we like does
fulfil our appetites on more than just a functional level. As the Prince
said, 'the kind of buildings that tend to appeal to the human heart, and
which make us feel at home, are a very specific range of buildings; very
particular in style and organisation and physical character. These are, in
fact, the buildings which we have always loved. They include, of course, all
the great traditional architectures of the past - enormously varied as these
are. But they also include new forms of architecture, based on new
materials, new ways of building, new forms of technology.'
It is perhaps appropriate for princes to initiate widespread and general
discussions - to act as a catalysts to bring together people of a wide range
of disciplines to discover the common ground. This is the task that the
Prince has now handed on to his own institute - and to a richly varied
academic faculty. They will have quite a task and, according to the
newly-appointed director of studies, Dr Brian Hanson, they are taking things
relatively slowly.
The first course to be launched at the Prince's institute, at its premises
in London's Regent's Park, will be a one year foundation course in
architecture and the building arts that starts in October.
This will be an introduction to all aspects of building and architecture for
students with A-levels who feel that they want to pursue a career concerned
with building. It will be both a theoretical and practical course with an
emphasis on crafts, hand skills and community projects. A considerable
amount of the teaching of the foundation course will take place away from
Regent's Park, either in architects' offices or on development sites. This
is to bring students in to immediate contact with the realities of
contemporary building.
In 1993, the institute will be accepting students for postgraduate courses,
which will lead to an equivalent qualification to the RIBA Part II
examinations. In subsequent years, the institute will run the full range of
undergraduate architectural courses to produce fully-fledged architects.
But there is another side to the institute that has nothing to do with
academic or practical training. This is the public role that is planned for
it. The idea is that the London premises will hold exhibitions, lectures and
conferences and in many ways fulfil the long-felt need that London has had
for an architecture centre. In the long term there is a real chance that the
institute will move into Somerset House, where it will be well placed to
serve as a venue for the education and enlightenment of laymen concerned
with architecture and the environment. I think that it is right for such a
school and centre to be very responsive to the layman. In that way it will
be very different from the new Architecture Foundation - a group principally
composed of well known architects and developers - who will be lobbying Mr
Michael Heseltine, the secretary of state for the environment, on February 6
urging him to set up a rival architecture centre in London.
The Prince has himself provided the answer to the question do we need
another school of architecture when he referred in his inaugural speech to
the damaging effects of materialistic dogma and his belief in a great
tradition that should be cherished and handed on to future generations.
These missing elements in much contemporary architecture can be taught and
encouraged to flourish. To achieve this the Prince now has his school. Next
he needs first rate support and, above all, first rate students.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Arts: Identity crisis - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main reasons why companies decide against sponsoring the arts, or
withdraw bruised after just one venture, is the poor media coverage given to
their commitments. Since the money often comes from the marketing budget, a
tangible positive PR return, measured by mentions in the media, is sought
and expected. When this fails to materialise there is disillusionment.
The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts tried to do something
about this by lobbying the editors of the national newspapers. Its gentle
arm twisting seemed to produce results. A survey in December 1990 suggested
that 34 per cent of sponsored arts events that were reviewed in the quality
nationals carried a plug for the sponsor. By March 1991 this had risen to 44
per cent, and in June to a massive 71 per cent. This looked like an
aberration when the September figure was down to 49 per cent, but by January
1992 a very reasonable 61 per cent of reviews of sponsored events mentioned
the backer.
However, the coverage was unpredictable. In particular, the National Theatre
was upset when its production of Murmuring Judges last October garnered only
two mentions for the sponsor (Amerada Hess) out of 26 reviews: and this
after the NT had added a printed slip to the critics' programmes, bringing
the sponsor to their attention.
Stunned by the poor response, the NT conducted a survey of the critics to
discover why they had ignored the sponsor. The replies suggested that no
newspaper has a fixed policy on mentioning sponsors, at least not one that
filtered down to the critic. (It is the FT's policy to record the name of
any significant sponsor - but the best laid plans . . .) Given their
apparent freedom in the matter, most critics attributed 'lack of space' as
the reason for withholding the plug. Only one gave 'hatred' of sponsorship,
but some were opposed to 'free advertising'. Quite a few claimed that they
were unaware of the sponsorship.
The NT is pursuing the matter. It is contacting arts editors to ask them to
produce guidelines for critics, and for Night of the Iguana this week the
critics will be given help on identifying the sponsor when they collect
their tickets
Arts sponsorship needs more justification in a period of declining corporate
profits: media coverage may be a superficial way of measuring its value but
it is one that even the most philistine financial director understands.
*****
These are difficult times for the computer industry, but the leading
companies are showing their sophistication by continuing their links with
the arts, in particular the theatre. Data General is putting Pounds 75,000
behind The Night of the Iguana. It is also giving the NT a new computer
system to handle planning, pay roll, etc.
Meanwhile, IBM is the new sponsor of the English Shakespeare Company. In the
current climate, with labour forces being cut back, companies are reluctant
to publicise the exact size of their generosity, but the IBM backing must be
worth around Pounds 250,000. It will help finance the ESC tour of Macbeth
and Twelfth Night around the UK, and to Japan, Korea, and the US.
*****
The RPO has just completed the most challenging tour in its existence -
concerts in all 12 European Community capitals, plus Strasbourg, and Milan
(and Hastings) in less than three weeks. The trip was made possible partly
by the British Council, which put up Pounds 100,000 (a marked contrast to
the RPO's Arts Council subsidy of Pounds 400,000 for the year) but mainly
thanks to Cellnet, which contributed Pounds 250,000.
This was another imaginative partnership between the arts and international
marketing. Negotiations are well advanced to establish a pan-European
digital cellular radio system: at the moment mobile phones cannot work
across borders. The competition is intense to fix up deals between the many
national participants in this growth business. Cellnet was able to invite
the key executives from every EC country to the concerts.
It was also able to seal its relationship with Motorola, the manufacturer of
its equipment, which came along as a joint sponsor. In effect, the RPO tour
gave Cellnet a sophisticated entree to the continent. In the future it will
support the orchestra in the UK.
*****
The RPO-Cellnet tour was a good example of the new realism between companies
and arts sponsorship. When business was prosperous there was a trumpeting of
the philanthropic aspects of the connection, how companies should put
something worthwhile back into the community. Now the rationale is hard
headed - sponsorship makes good commercial sense.
This was the message that came across strongly at a recent seminar on
sponsorship in a time of recession, held at Nomura's London HQ. Geoff
Shingles, chief executive of Digital, which provides probably the best
sponsorship case study for business schools, related how for less than
Pounds 1m a year invested in sponsorship (and virtually nothing on
advertising) the company had already met and entertained, mainly at dance
events, 75 per cent of the executives in the UK who decide what computer
system their company should buy.
David Charlton relayed how Mobil, medium sized among the oil companies, had
built its corporate advertising, and a big reputation, around an annual
sponsorship budget of Pounds 750,000. Keith Clarke of Nomura mentioned how
his company's arrival in Czechoslovakia was helped by meeting its playwright
president Vaclav Havel at a dinner, only made possible by its sponsorship of
the National Theatre's visit to Prague last year.
*****
The view that any falling away by existing sponsors in 1992 will be made
good by new entrants received encouragement last month when Boddingtons, the
Manchester-based brewery, committed itself to investing Pounds 1.2m over the
next three years in the Manchester Festival of Arts &amp; Television. The
Festival is also supported by the City Council and Granada TV.
*****
Another brewer which constantly backs the arts, Becks, is putting Pounds
60,000 behind a retrospective of the German Expressionist artist Otto Dix,
which opens at the Tate on March 11. To help spread the news, 17m bottles of
Becks Bier will be imported from Bremen carrying information about the show.

Perhaps Wildlife On One (BBC1, 8.30) ought to be re-named 'Nature Red In
Tooth And Claw'. Tonight, as so often, the programme is concerned with
depredation: the annual return of shoals of fish called the eulachon to the
coastal waters of Alaska and their attack by humpback whales, bald eagles,
seals and sea lions.
We are promised that Bye Bye Columbus on BBC2 (9.00) will not be just
another chunk of 500th anniversary idolatry, but a sharp, surreal and
offbeat drama in which Columbus, played by Daniel Massey, reviews his own
achievements in conversation with his parrot. The 50-minute drama is written
by Peter Barnes and the starry cast includes Simon Callow, Jack Shepherd as
the parrot, Harriet Walter and Timothy West.
Channel 4's impressive series documenting The Falklands War reaches its
fourth and last part (9.00). In anticipation of a possible hung parliament,
Panorama turns its attention to 'The Third Man', Paddy Ashdown, who keeps on
talking about people voting for a 'balanced parliament' as though a British
voter was allowed to vote for anything other than one person and
consequently one party.

The building, which will also have an upper floor of over 5,000 sq ft to
accommodate offices and other facilities, is of steel-framed construction
with brick cladding and feature arches. Major items of plant will be
positioned on the roof but concealed by pitched roofs around the perimeter
of the building.
The project is to be completed within a 44-week programme to allow Tesco to
open for trading in autumn 1992.
The company has also been awarded a design and build contract by Gateway
Foodmarkets for a 2,500 sq ft store in Kingsbridge, Devon.
The store, which has been designed to a low profile because of planning
requirements in the residential area, will be steel-framed with a facing
brick exterior and a pitched roof clad with metal sheeting.
External works will include landscaping, car parking and a secure service
yard. The architect for the project is Tektus Architects and the consulting
engineer for the retail outlet's structure is the firm of YRM Anthony Hunt
Associates.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A KIER/LILLEY/KUNZ joint venture has been awarded a Pounds 1.16m contract by
Heathrow Airport to build a trial tunnel beneath Heathrow Airport in
preparation for its new Express rail link.
The purpose of the 100 metre-long test section is to assess the settlement
levels of the new Austrian tunnelling method (NATM) prior to its first use
in London clay. The NATM or Shotcrete method activates the loadbearing
capacity of the soil by a combination of the sequence and pattern of
excavation and support elements.
Support will primarily consist of sprayed concrete (Shotcrete) reinforcement
and steel girders. Subject to successful trial results, NATM will be used on
all the airport station tunnels of the Pounds 235m Paddington to Heathrow
link.
The trial tunnel will eventually become part of the running tunnel between
the airport's central terminals and Terminal 4.
Work began on January 27 with completion scheduled for 20 weeks.
The total tunnel length to Terminal 4 will be 6.6km including a 'cut and
cover' section north of the M4.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Management: Efficiency gains are on the cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every employee at Elida Gibbs, the Unilever subsidiary that produces
bathroom brands such as Timotei, Pears and Signal, carries two cards.
The first lists company goals for growth, customer service, employee
training, and improvements in efficiency. The second card carries the
Freephone number for a confidential helpline. Employees can ring and, if
necessary, arrange counselling on drink, debt, legal or perhaps marital
problems.
There is a connection between the two cards, according to Jon Riches, Elida
Gibbs' personnel director: improving efficiency means cutting down on waste
and that means cutting down on absenteeism.
The expectation is that the counselling service will help to reduce high
absenteeism among the company's 700 blue-collar workers. Riches says a cut
in the current 8 per cent rate to nearer the national average of around 5
per cent, would pay for the counselling service several times over.
The Pounds 25 a head cost of the helpline is made up of a management fee to
an external counselling company, plus a charge for every consultation. The
use of independent counsellors - in this case the Hertfordshire-based group
Focus - is seen by Riches as an essential feature of the scheme.
Line managers have a coaching and counselling role but cannot be expected to
have the specialist skills needed to deal with, say, a drug addiction
problem, he says. In addition, some issues are private - and employees are
bound to believe that revealing their worries to their manager, or even to
someone from the personnel department, will affect job prospects.
When the company rationalised its production sites and opened a
purpose-built factory at Seacroft on the outskirts of Leeds, it drew much of
its workforce from surrounding council estates. Three-quarters of the
workforce is female, some of them single parents. This dual role may mean
they have to decide priorities - dealing with a sick child or going to work,
Riches says.
One of the reasons the factory has attracted a high number of female workers
is because of its 15-hour day, divided into three shifts. Women with
domestic responsibilities find the five-hour shifts fit in better with
childcare than the conventional seven-and-a-half-hour day.
So do women have different reasons for using the helpline than a
predominantly male or mixed workforce? Graham Pitts from Focus says not:
apart from fewer problems related to alcohol, the range of calls is similar
to that found in other client companies.
Frequency of use is also likely to be similar with about 6 per cent of
employees calling the helpline over the year. It is too early to say whether
the scheme will translate into lower absenteeism or - less tangible -
increases in employee 'empowerment', as the company calls it.
For Riches is not only looking at the size of the pile of sick notes, he is
also hoping the scheme will fit in with Total Quality developments and the
gradual introduction of self-managing working groups. As Riches puts it:
'Susie has to have the courage to stop the line when she sees that
something's not right. In the traditional way of working, that would be a
disciplinary offence.' It is hoped that counselling, including advice on
work-related matters, will speed these developments.
Unilever's 20 other companies, covering 35,000 UK employees, are watching
Elida Gibbs' progress closely and could introduce counselling programmes
themselves. Overall, Pitts calculates that perhaps only 50 to 70 companies
in the UK are using independent counsellors - or employee assistance
programmes (EAPs).
EAPs are barely more developed elsewhere in Europe but, if experience in the
US is anything to go by, Elida Gibbs and a handful of other companies could
be pioneering a trend. Focus points to the fact that more than 75 per cent
of the US Fortune top 500 companies now have EAPs. Return on investment in
the US is said to vary from Dollars 2 to Dollars 16 for every Dollars 1
spent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
NEWSAGENT and retailer John Menzies comes out with interims today expected
to show pre-tax profits of about Pounds 3m. This is good or bad, depending
on how you look at it. Last year's Pounds 4.2m profit was depressed by
exceptionals of Pounds 4m due to the losses at Hammicks.
This year, there should be no exceptionals and proof will have to be shown
that Hammicks losses have been stopped. Analysts will also want to hear
about Menzies' Christmas trade after after WH Smith's encouraging news this
past week.
Last but not least, some idea should be given on the fate in the US of the
Early Learning Centres, the supplier of books and toys to young children.
Forecasts for the year ended April 30, bolstered by Christmas turnover, run
between Pounds 27.5m and Pounds 29.5m against Pounds 21.5m a year earlier.
A modest 15 per cent growth in pre-tax profits to around IPounds 30m is
being predicted for Fyffes' year-end results due tomorrow. Market analysts
believe that the Dublin-based fruit and vegetable wholesaling group has had
a reasonable year, despite the recession in the UK market.
Although banana sales may have been down, there has been buoyant growth in
other fresh produce sales.
The market continues to hold expectations of a link-up with a distributor in
continental Europe to expand the group's operations, and the company's share
price has risen substantially in recent months.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Appointments: Greencore adds to youthful team
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods company dogged by scandal last year, is
hoping to distance itself from past events with a new, vigorous - and very
young - management team.
As from the beginning of this month, David Dilger, 35, formerly chief
executive of Food Industries, becomes chief operating officer, under Gerry
Murphy, also 35, the chief executive who joined last October.
Food Industries was acquired by Greencore last August - a takeover battle in
which Dilger and other board members, in recommending the Greencore offer,
took sides against beef baron Larry Goodman, then 68 per cent stakeholder in
Food, who wanted to stick out for a fatter price. Dilger and Goodman have
apparently not spoken since.
When Chris Comerford resigned as chief executive last September following
allegations that he had failed to disclose his personal stake in a Greencore
subsidiary, the high-flying Dilger had been tipped as Comerford's likely
replacement - before Murphy, also an Irishman and friend of Greencore
chairman Bernie Cahill arrived back on the scene in the Republic from
Pillsbury.
Dilger acknowledges the task ahead in restoring the com-pany's reputation
outside as well as staff morale inside.
The company secretary also quit last year. His replacement is Benjamin
Power, 49, who will also join the board. Power was director and company
secretary of W &amp; R Jacob, the Dublin biscuit-maker bought by BSN of France
last year.
*****
Robert Noonan, Irish-born property developer and rugby fanatic, is trying
his hand at office technology, as chairman and chief executive of Office &amp;
Electronic Machines.
Noonan, boss of Essex property group Danbury, and known as one of the more
aggressive operators even in his field, is said to like a challenge. Asked
whether OEM will be a full-time job, he remarks that everything he does is
full time.
Shortly before Douglas Hawkins, the previous chairman and chief executive,
resigned, Noonan had purchased a 14 per cent stake in the languishing OEM,
thinking it was a company 'worthy of a certain amount of effort'.
Hawkins resigned as chief executive at the beginning of January, to return
to the City as an electronics analyst.
At that time, Hawkins had said he was staying on as chairman. 'I don't know
why he hung about,' says Noonan with his usual charm.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having sailed as a first mate with the Clan Line, looked after the computers
at Fylingdales' early warning station, and sold furniture for Times
Furnishing, 55-year-old David Stonehouse is switching jobs one more time.
During a 15-year career at Great Universal Stores, one of Britain's biggest
retailers, Stonehouse has become one of the leading figures in the
specialist field of business information providers. One of the keys to
success in retailing is the maintenance of a low level of bad debts and as
chief executive of GUS's CCN group, Stonehouse was responsible for the
growth of Britain's biggest credit reference bureau, the main competitor to
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and the largest provider of credit scoring. He also
pioneered CCN's overseas expansion.
In the past two years GE Capital Retailer Financial Services - the world's
biggest operator of in-store credit cards and one of Stonehouse's customers
 -has established itself as the main player in the UK store cards market. It
owns and operates credit cards for House of Fraser, Burton Group, Laura
Ashley, Halfords, Dixons, and others.
As chief executive of GE Capital's Retailer Financial Services business in
Europe, one of Stonehouse's jobs will be to help his new employer break into
the continental European market.

FT  03 FEB 92 / BAe seeks orders from RAF for air combat missile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE, which is struggling for new contracts to sustain its
guided weapons business, is trying to persuade the Ministry of Defence to
buy an aircraft missile that has so far been developed as an export-only
product.
It hopes to take advantage of cost-cutting measures in the defence budget
that have prevented the RAF from upgrading its Tornado F3 air-defence
fighters to take the latest US Amraam (advanced medium-range air-to-air
missile) weapons. Fitting Amraam would have required changes to the
aircraft's radar system.
BAe submitted an unsolicited bid on Friday to equip Tornado F3s instead with
the Active Sky Flash, which it has been developing jointly with French
defence electronics group Thomson-CSF. The RAF fighters at present carry an
earlier version of the Sky Flash, which is developed from the US Sparrow
missile.
The new 'fire-and-forget' weapon will have an active radar seeker which
allows the aircraft to make its getaway immediately after firing.
BAe says development of the Active Sky Flash is three-quarters completed.
The weapon, with a range of about 25 miles, would be cheaper than the Amraam
or the French Mica missile and would be available within three years, it
said.
The company is awaiting a government decision on a contract for a
close-range missile expected to be worth some Pounds 750m. BAe's advanced
short-range air-to-air missile (Asraam), in which it is collaborating with
Hughes of the US, is competing against an Anglo-French weapon proposed by
GEC and Matra and an upgrade of the US Sidewinder.

FT  03 FEB 92 / TUC urges Pounds 3.8bn more for jobs in Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress has called on Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the
exchequer, to spend Pounds 3.8bn more on reducing unemployment in his Budget
on March 10.
The TUC's proposals, published today, press for the creation of 500,000 jobs
and extra places on training schemes.
They also call for tax changes to help industry, suggesting that capital
allowances be increased from 25 per cent to between 40 per cent and 50 per
cent. That would be a 'counter-cyclical measure' to be paid for partly by
the abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme (BES).
In its submission, the TUC outlines a spending programme consisting of:
Pounds 2bn for public projects such as housing, schools, hospitals and
transport.
Pounds 1bn for training, education and a temporary work programme aimed at
the long-term jobless.
Pounds 800m for a return to earnings-related unemployment benefits and a
range of incentives for the jobless to take up work, including loans to help
pay for transport and clothing.
Mr Norman Willis, the TUC general secretary, said the country needed a
budget for industry on March 10, not 'election bribery'.
Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, chairman of the TUC's economic committee, urged the
chancellor to listen to what unions and employers were telling him.
He said: 'The country is crying out for more jobs, more investment and
better public services, not quick-fix tax cuts.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LOCAL-AUTHORITY pension funds have become the largest source of venture
capital available in the regions, according to a survey.
Over the past two years to the end of last year they have increased their
investment in venture capital by 51 per cent, according to Pensions
Investment Research Consultants (PIRC).
While the venture capital industry has experienced a general slowdown in
rates of growth, the pension funds increased their investment by Pounds 92m
to Pounds 271m.
PIRC, which advises local authorities on investments, found that a total of
62 local-authority pension funds, 63 per cent of the total, had made venture
capital investments.
Of the pension funds surveyed, 41 per cent said they expected to increase
the sums allocated for venture capital.
Forty-two pension funds had allocated up to 1 per cent of their assets to
venture capital; 10 had allocated up to 2 per cent; five had allocated up to
5 per cent and one had allocated more than 5 per cent. The legal maximum for
pension funds is 10 per cent.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Nalgo's membership increase bucks
trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NALGO, the public-services union, increased its membership by more than
15,000 in the last year against a background of declining member rolls
suffered by most unions.
Membership stands at 759,735, an increase of 15,282 on last year. That is
slightly more than in 1987, since when numbers had declined until this year.
One factor in the latest expansion has been an increase in numbers of
white-collar workers in local government, which represent the bulk of
Nalgo's membership. The Local Government Management Board said councils had
added 13,500 white-collar workers to their staff in the year to September.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said the membership increase was
a vote of confidence in the union and its policies.

FT  03 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Union leaders admit upsetting Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION leaders have for the first time acknowledged that a resolution adopted
last year by the Trades Union Congress on inward investment has caused
widespread concern among the Japanese business community.
In a report about a recent visit to Japan, leaders of Britain's two largest
unions and the TUC deputy general secretary say the resolution featured in
virtually every discussion they had. Concerns were expressed
'uncharacteristically forcefully', they say.
The visit and report, to be discussed by the TUC's international committee
today, followed the TUC's adoption at last September's TUC Congress of a
motion saying that several Japanese projects 'have brought an alien approach
to trade union organisations'.
Words such as 'alien' and 'feudal', used in the debate to describe
Japanese-style beauty contests among unions for single-union deals,
registered widely in Japan, according to the TUC report.
The TUC has until now played down the effect of the resolution on Japanese
thinking, and Japanese businessmen have avoided public criticism of the TUC
stance.
The TUC had sought to assure the Japanese that it welcomed overseas
investment in Britain and that there was no intention of a racist slur.
Privately, many union leaders believe the passing the resolution was a
mistake. At the time, only the AEU engineering union and the GMB general
union opposed it.
Today's report - by Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, Mr John
Edmonds, GMB general secretary, and Mr Bill Morris, general secretary-elect
of the TGWU general union - says the TUC's reservations about the resolution
were widely known in Japan.
That, however, had been 'overshadowed by the fact that a motion with what
appeared to them as crude anti-Japanese sentiments had been carried'.
The report suggests joint work with Nikkeiren, the Japanese equivalent of
the Confederation of British Industry, to ease tensions and difficulties.
In Japan, the three UK union officials told Japanese business and union
leaders of concerns that beauty contests did not normally involve
consultation with workers until after single-union deals were concluded, and
usually contained provisions for avoiding industrial action. That had led to
charges that the agreements were undemocratic.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Environment on directors' agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY BOARDS of directors expect to devote more time to environmental
issues, according to an Institute of Directors survey published yesterday.
Almost half the directors questioned said their boards spent no time at all
on environmental issues. However, 61 per cent believed that over the next
five years environmental issues would become matters for board decisions.
Compliance with legislation was seen by the majority of companies as the
main driving force for their interest in environmental issues, with social
responsibility a close second.
Twenty-two per cent of directors said their company already had a formal
environmental policy.

FT  03 FEB 92 / US bank to advise on HK airport funding
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFICULTIES in attracting a suitable finance director have prompted Hong
Kong's Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) to appoint a US commercial bank
as a surrogate for the initial financing for the HKDollars 43.6bn (Pounds
3.1bn) airport scheme.
The PAA is expected to select J P Morgan to advise on key aspects of the
authority's 'financial operations'.
The PAA declined to say what J P Morgan's brief would entail but it is
understood the bank has signed a short-term contract to provide wide-ranging
financial advice to the authority until a finance director is recruited. The
terms of J P Morgan's contract will be reconsidered after the appointment of
the director.
Mr Richard Allen, PAA's chief executive, flew to London over the weekend to
interview candidates for the job. There is some urgency as construction of
the airport - part of a HKDollars 98.6bn transportation project - is running
to a tight schedule and the authority needs a top financial expert in house.
The authority has to decide by May on the successful candidate for site
reclamation and preparation of the 1,248-hectare airport. 'We have got to
get off running in the next month or so,' said one senior executive.
Until recently Wardley, the merchant banking arm of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, was thought to be the likely winner of the PAA's finance
mandate. But the authority felt that the bank, the Hong Kong government's
overall financial adviser for the airport project, lacked independence.

<TEXT>
MR Fumio Abe, a former government minister accused of taking bribes, has
become the first serving member of the Japanese Diet since the 1970s to be
indicted.
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's office on Saturday charged Mr Abe
with accepting Y80m (Pounds 357,000) in bribes from Kyowa, a steel frame
manufacturing and property investment company, in return for leaking
planning information and lobbying officials on Kyowa's behalf. Mr Goro
Moriguchi, a vice-president of Kyowa, was also charged.
The indictments will put renewed pressure on Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, and the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Mr Miyazawa, who counted
Mr Abe among his close associates, apologised for the incident and pledged
political reform. The prime minister was in New York attending the United
Nations Security Council summit.
Newspaper commentaries published over the weekend mostly assessed Mr
Miyazawa's performance in the US favourably, including his veiled demand for
a permanent Security Council seat for Japan.
But the impact was undercut by the extensive publicity accorded to Mr Abe's
indictment.
The last serving Diet members to be indicted were Mr Kakuei Tanaka, the
former prime minister, and two others who were charged in 1976 for their
roles in the Lockheed scandal.
They were accused of taking money from the US group in return for approving
orders for planes.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S commercial banking system has been dealt another blow with the
arrest this weekend of Mr David Bogatin, a US citizen of Russian origin, who
owns the First Commercial Bank in Lublin. This is one of only seven banks
with foreign capital.
The arrest is in connection with extradiction proceedings initiated by the
American authorities. They are conducting an investigation into Mr Bogatin's
alleged involvement in petroleum tax evasion in the mid-1980s. Mr Bogatin
came to Poland three years ago when he established Sunpol, a successful
fruit processing business, and later the bank in which he holds 97.5 per
cent of the shares. The First Commercial expanded rapidly last year
establishing 14 branches, mainly in eastern Poland.
The bank has attracted Zl846bn (Pounds 41.5m) but depositors scared by
newspaper reports of Mr Bogatin's past difficulties started a run on the
bank. Mr Bogatin then managed to bring the situation temporarily under
control by personally assuring hundreds of worried clients that their
savings were safe.
Last year Poland's banking system was hit by two major banking scandals
which led to the arrest of the head of the NBP, the central bank, and
charges against other senior officials.

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE state-dominated Polish economy declined sharply again last year despite
rapid growth in the private sector.
The annual report from the state statistical office (GUS) showed an
estimated 8-10 per cent decline in gross domestic product (GDP) and an 8 per
cent fall in investment.
It also recorded a near doubling of unemployment to 11.4 per cent of the
labour force and sharply lower inflation of 60.4 per cent.
Industry showed the sharpest decline with an 11.9 per cent drop in sales,
following a 24 per cent collapse in 1990, while construction lagged 6.8 per
cent from a similarly low base and farm output dropped 2 per cent.
In dollar terms, exports grew by 18 per cent from 1990's record level to
Dollars 14.21bn (Pounds 8bn) while imports, boosted partly by higher Soviet
oil prices, rose 72 per cent to Dollars 14.24bn.
Sharply rising imports eliminated the Dollars 3.4bn hard currency surplus
which Poland built up in 1990 following the introduction of its
stabilisation plan and internal zloty convertibility.
The private sector accounted for 20 per cent of total exports but 46 per
cent of imports last year, reflecting the rapid growth in privatised trade
and retailing. At the same time output of privatised industry rose 48.6 per
cent from a low base while output in the state sector declined 19.5 per
cent.
The private sector, outside the already 80 per cent privatised farming area,
now employs 25 per cent of the Polish employed labour force against 62 per
cent in the state sector. Co-operatives employ the balance.
Rising unemployment and a sharp increase in disability and other pensions,
however, reflect a sharp overall contraction in job opportunities. Last year
the number of pensioners rose from 7.55m to 8.31m, a form of disguised
unemployment which has added to budgetary pressures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS about Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner for
the Democratic party's nomination for the US presidency, are surfacing among
party leaders in Congress.
In the wake of adultery allegations against Mr Clinton, Mr Dick Gephardt,
majority leader in the House of Representatives, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas, the party's vice-presidential candidate in 1988, are reported to
be considering entering the campaign if further allegations are made against
Mr Clinton.
Mr George Mitchell, majority leader in the Senate, said on television
yesterday a 'substantial' number of senators had urged him to run. But he
added: 'I do not intend to be a candidate.'
Senator Mitchell said Mr Clinton's chances of winning the Democratic
nomination had been 'hurt' by the charges of marital infidelity which first
surfaced three weeks ago in a supermarket magazine. The tabloid paid the
woman who made the charges, a former Arkansas state employee and cabaret
singer, and the story was repeated in the national press.
Mr Clinton admitted he had been unfaithful to his wife Hillary, a fellow
Yale law graduate, during their 16-year marriage. But he denied the specific
allegations in a nationwide television interview a week ago and called on
the press to show restraint.
Reporters covering the campaign have since been exhorted to 'stick to the
issues' - a tactic supposedly aimed at avoiding a repeat of the trivia-laden
1988 campaign, but one which in fact helps Mr Clinton, who spews out
statistics and five-point plans without missing a beat.
Congressional Democrats, having watched the party lose five of the last six
presidential elections, have been unnerved by the charges. They believe
that, even if Mr Clinton survives the present fracas in the primaries, he
would face a torrid contest against President George Bush's Republicans in
November's presidential elections.
Meanwhile, on the Republican side, the latest CNN/Time magazine poll shows
Mr Bush's popularity slipping nationwide as well as in the state of New
Hampshire, site of the first important primary election for both parties.
The president's approval rating stands at 44 per cent, half the level after
the Gulf war. In New Hampshire, he stands at 52 per cent, with the number of
undecided Republican voters rising.

ADVOCATES of refugee rights fear thousands of Haitian boat people forced to
return from the US will be persecuted in their home towns and villages, AP
reports from Port-au-Prince.
Red Cross officials said the US authorities told them that the Coast Guard
cutter carrying the first 150 returnees was expected to dock today. The
cutter Steadfast left Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba yesterday after a US
Supreme Court ruling on Friday cleared the way for the repatriation.
Earlier returnees appeared to draw little official interest at the bustling
Port-au-Prince seafront, but rights advocates contend that the returnees
become targets when they arrive at their homes. They say the Haitian
security apparatus functions most effectively at local level.
'Many of those who return will die,' said Mr Paul Latortue, a Haitian
economist who teaches at the University of Puerto Rico.
The US military has operated a tent city at Guantanamo Bay since the
September 30 military coup in Haiti and subsequent trade embargo against the
Caribbean nation sent more than 14,000 Haitians fleeing in small boats.
Red Cross workers will give the returnees about Dollars 15 (Pounds 8.20),
some assistance with transport and a food-aid card.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Iraqi ships find Italian home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian navy has bought four frigates originally ordered by Iraq, partly
closing the book on one of the most accident-prone deals in the history of
Italian defence contracting.
The four Lupo (wolf) class frigates were part of a L3,600bn (Pounds 1.7bn)
contract for 12 naval vessels won in 1981 by two Italian defence consortia,
headed by Fincantieri, the state ship-building group and Oto-Melara, the
state guided weapons company.
But only four vessels, worth L300bn, have been handed over to Iraq. Of these
a supply ship and a floating dry dock are blocked in the Egyptian port of
Alexandria and two Assad class corvettes are still at the Italian naval base
of La Spezia, where the other warships are also docked.
The deal fell foul of both the western arms embargo resulting from the
Iran-Iraq war and the allied embargo on Iraq following President Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, the cost of maintaining the four frigates and six corvettes has been
running at L550m a day, over L400m of which has been financial charges.
The first of the frigates was completed in 1985 and the full order with
sophisticated missile armaments was ready by 1987; the completion of the
corvette order was spread between 1986 and 1988. Although Iraq sent crew for
training on two corvettes as early as 1986, the first opportunity to take
delivery came after the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988.
Iraq made payments of L1,800bn in the hope of unblocking the entire
contract. The frigates were 'freed' for delivery in 1989 and eventually the
two least bellicose vessels were released; but just when it seemed the
Italian government would waive its objections to the retention of the
offensive vessels, Mr Saddam invaded Kuwait.
The inability to obtain full payment and the high cost of maintenance has
weighed heavily on every big defence contractor in Italy, all of which were
either directly or indirectly involved in the deal. The Italian navy was
pressed to buy up as much of the order as possible, but was reported to be
reluctant because of lack of funds and because the vessels had been designed
to Iraqi navy and Gulf water specifications.
However, with the Andreotti government in its final days, the defence lobby
was able to exercise sufficient influence for funds to be made available to
the Defence Ministry through 1994 to purchase four frigates.
The remaining eight vessels under Italian control or blocked in Alexandria
have been put out to international tender.

FT  03 FEB 92 / Hopes rise for deal on German tax reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES rose at the weekend for a deal between the German government and
opposition over a deadlocked package of tax reforms, including a one
percentage point rise in value added tax, and a variety of enterprise
taxation cuts, blocked since last December.
One possible compromise put forward by the ruling coalition is for the VAT
rise to be put almost entirely towards financing the German Unity Fund, thus
relieving the financial burden on the federal states in former West Germany.
Another deal proposed by Social Democrats from the state of Lower Saxony is
for the pain of the VAT increase from 14 to 15 per cent to be offset by a
doubling in child allowances to DM100 (Pounds 34.80) a month.
The two houses of the German parliament - the directly-elected Bundestag, in
which the government has the majority, and the upper house, or Bundesrat,
where states ruled by the Social Democrats (SPD) have the upper hand - are
scheduled to resume negotiations on Wednesday. Without a deal the whole tax
reform package for 1992 will fail, including both increased family
allowances and the enterprise tax reforms. The VAT increase is only proposed
for January 1 1993.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, told Die Welt am Sonntag, the Sunday
newspaper, that the ruling coalition was offering a 'fair and financially
bearable new compromise'.
Details which emerged last week include devoting almost all the extra
revenue from the VAT increase - about DM11bn - to the unity fund, thus
allowing the federal states to keep their own structural funds, for
infrastructure spending, intact from 1993. At the same time, the states
would get a slightly higher proportion of VAT - 36.5 instead of the current
36 per cent - paid directly to their own budgets.
That should increase the temptation for some SPD-ruled states, like Lower
Saxony and Brandenburg, to break ranks with their national leadership and
agree on a deal.
Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the SPD deputy leader and chief negotiator, remains
adamant that any VAT increase is out of the question, providing an
unacceptable boost to inflation and stoking the wage demands of trade
unions. He also rejects cuts in company taxation, at a time when the
exchequer is running a record deficit.
On the other hand, Mr Lafontaine admits that a legally-binding deal in
Brussels for all EC states to have a minimum VAT rate of 15 per cent from
1993 - which seems inevitable in the coming weeks - would cut the ground
from under the SPD.
Thus the compromise proposal from Mr Gerhard Schroder, SPD premier of Lower
Saxony, could provide a face-saving way out: the SPD could claim the credit
for the doubling in child allowances to DM100 a month, in exchange for an
inevitable backing down over VAT.
MR Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the German Bundesbank, said at the
weekend he could not indicate when a reduction in German interest rates
would be possible, Ian Rodger writes from Zurich.
'We will continue to hold monetary expansion within the targets we have
set,' Mr Tietmeyer said at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in
Davos.
He said the decision to raise the Lombard and discount rates on December 19
was not made purely on the basis of the current wage negotiations in
Germany.
He noted that the moves had already resulted in a reduction in long-term
interest rates, and claimed this was a consequence of markets believing that
the German authorities were taking inflationary tendencies seriously. 'We
have created credibility,' he said.
Mr Tietmeyer recognised concern abroad about the interest rate increases,
but said Germany was in a special situation. 'German economic development is
not the same as in other countries. Co-ordination does not mean that we must
have the same policies.'

FT  03 FEB 92 / The European Market: New horizons await fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE draft EC directive published last November on the freedom of management
and investment of pension funds could eventually open up great opportunities
for European investment fund managers, writes Barry Riley.
The directive proposes moderating many of the national restrictions which
have often required that funds must be invested in certain ways - for
instance, with heavy weightings in government bonds, and with severe limits
on foreign exposure. It will also make it possible for portfolio managers to
seek pension fund clients freely throughout the EC.
Investment firms are not yet notably excited about the prospect of
deregulation. Fund managers are well aware that although the investment
directive is inching its way through the bureaucratic machinery in Brussels,
a more fundamental directive on cross-border membership of pension schemes
failed to survive the preliminary negotiation process last year. The
conflicts among pension systems in different EC member states have proved
too great to handle in the foreseeable future.
Nevertheless, there are hopes for convergence and harmonisation in the
longer term. Last month the French government, previously an ardent exponent
of unfunded or pay-as-you-go occupational schemes, which are especially
difficult to open up to international membership, unveiled new proposals to
develop a more favourable framework for funded schemes in France. These
would include both corporate and personal arrangements.
Throughout the EC, but especially in France, Italy and Belgium, an impending
demographic crisis is focusing minds. In Italy, for instance, the fertility
rate is only 1.3 babies per woman, compared with the figure of 2.1 required
to maintain the population.
If the future working generation is going to be much smaller than the
retired generation, the prospects for pay-as-you-go pensions - which
effectively are recycled social security contributions - must be poor. So
there are increasing pressures to encourage supplementary occupational
pension funds - the so-called 'second pillar' of old age provision - and to
allow these to be at least partly invested in still expanding economies
overseas.
Although there are already substantial pension funds in the EC, amounting to
more than Ecu700bn (Pounds 500bn), some 86 per cent of the total is
accounted for by the UK and the Netherlands. Funds are insignificant in
France and Italy, although paradoxically, outside the EC, there are large
pension funds in Switzerland.
Germany has its own 'book reserve' method of self-investment backed by state
guarantees against bankruptcy risks. It was developed because, in the
distant past, more conventional funds in Germany were wiped out by
inflation.
The book reserve system served Germany well in the decades immediately after
the war, but it does not allocate capital to where the return is highest in
the way that pension funds can when invested through securities markets. On
a small scale, Germany has some separately invested pension funds too.
Liberalisation of capital movements is a well-established EC theme and is
central to the new pension fund investment directive. At the same time, a
new prudential code has been drawn up to ensure that pension fund assets are
managed in an appropriate way.
At present there is a variety of national restrictions. The big Dutch public
sector fund ABP can only invest 5 per cent abroad, and German funds just 4
per cent - they are subject to life insurance regulations, with in addition
a 20 per cent ceiling on equities. In contrast, in the UK, admittedly with a
much more inflationary recent history, many pension funds have a commitment
of 80 or 90 per cent to equities, and have achieved much better returns.
Government restrictions on investment freedom may have something to do with
prudence, but also with the desire to create a captive market for government
debt. Similarly, limits on cross-border exposure have been justified by
perceived higher risks, for instance of currency fluctuations; but the
hidden agenda may be a simple desire to trap portfolio assets within the
domestic economy, thus holding down the cost of capital. The EC has been
successfully battling against such protectionism for investment by private
individuals, but many institutional restrictions remain.
For the moment the directive's prudential guidelines are fairly vague:
assets shall be invested in a manner 'appropriate to the nature and the
duration of the corresponding liabilities'.
But funds will be able to hold a minimum of 20 per cent of their portfolios
in foreign currency assets, and 40 per cent when their liabilities are
linked to future salary levels. Few British pension funds have actually
reached this 40 per cent level in practice, although since 1979 they have
been free of official restrictions - 25 to 30 per cent is a more common
range.
Moreover, member states will not be able to stop their pension funds being
invested without limit in Ecu-denominated assets because these will be
deemed to match any EC currency. This could provide a boost for Ecu bond
issues.
There is also the possibility that European companies might decide to
denominate their share capital in Ecus. But first they would have to be
permitted by national legislation to draw up their accounts and pay their
taxes in Ecus.
Management of such diversified assets will require new skills, and London's
global managers in particular will hope to gain from the directive's Article
3, which provides that any pension fund must be permitted to choose a
manager established and duly authorised in another member state.
But although City of London investment managers may dream of the days when
they could be offered global mandates by streams of French, German and
Italian pension funds, for a considerable time into the future these
pickings will remain almost non-existent.

FT  03 FEB 92 / War breaks out at opera Olympics: The first battle in
Barcelona is between tenors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE will probably be more of this as Spain's 1992 festivities get under
way, but it has fallen to the country's clutch of famous opera stars to
deliver the first childish spat of the year.
The Canary Island-born tenor Alfredo Kraus has been threatening to take
revenge against his Catalan rival, Jose Carreras, for being left out of the
gathering of opera singers who will open the 1992 summer Olympic Games in
Barcelona in July.
Mr Carreras is the artistic director of the event and has apparently
declined to invite Mr Kraus to join himself, Madrid-born tenor Placido
Domingo and Barcelonan soprano Montserrat Caballe to sing a medley of
popular arias to the opening ceremony.
Mr Kraus claims this is because he criticised Mr Carreras, Mr Domingo and
the Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti for singing at the World Cup soccer
championship in Italy in 1990.
He intimated at the time that the appearance of the stars debased opera.
Mr Carreras, proclaiming great personal affection and respect for Mr Kraus,
has said he left him off the invitation because Mr Kraus had 'repeatedly
argued against the presence of opera at multitudinous events'.
Mr Kraus, never a man to mince words, replied: 'Jose Carreras has done
nothing more than perform a hostile act against (me) which amounts to a
declaration of war.'
Mr Kraus has been able to take an early dig at the Olympic performance by
pointing out that it will be recorded and videoed and will merely be mimed
at the inauguration. 'Play-back has always seemed like fraud to me,' he told
the Spanish press. 'I would obviously ignore Jose Carreras if I am ever
asked to mount anything similar.'
This unartistic exchange speaks volumes for the cosseted world in which
Spain, with vast amounts of public money spent on opera, wraps up and
promotes its operatic treasures. To the general public, who seldom get a
chance to see opera before city, regional and national politicians snap up
shovelfuls of free tickets, the affair must seem almost surreal.
Ms Caballe has already made her own important contribution to the
demystification of local operatic seriousness. While she was sitting with
local dignitaries at a theatrical performance in Extremadura not long ago,
the floor beneath her gave way, miraculously leaving her uninjured. Footage
of the fall was nevertheless played around the country.
Then, earlier this year, she refused to sing at Barcelona's fabulous Liceo
opera house until the building's director apologised for suggesting she was
not a very good singer. But he has stuck to his guns and, having listened to
Ms Caballe's latest record (an adaptation of modern commercial songs), is
unlikely to change his mind.
Mr Domingo, himself not above cashing in on popular collections, has so far
proved far too smart to get involved in the Olympic debate. He tends to
distance himself from the politics of opera in Spain and has, anyway, begun
to mutter recently that he finds orchestral direction more interesting than
singing.
The other smart man in the spat is Spain's minister for culture, Mr Jordi
Sole Tura. Asked what he thought could be done to repair the damage to
operatic harmony, he declined to comment. 'Its all far too sensitive,' he
said.

MORE than 5,000 Romanians shouted for the resignation of President Ion
Iliescu yesterday during an opposition rally for next month's local
elections, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
'Let's stay united and fight against the expiring neo-communists who pushed
this country to the brink of collapse,' Mr Corneliu Coposu, leader of the
opposition National Peasant party, told the indoor rally in Bucharest's
Palace Hall.
'Let's fight against corruption and ensure a decent future for Romania,' Mr
Coposu said, drawing loud cheers and chants of 'unity, unity,' 'down with
Iliescu,' and 'down with communism'.
The gathering was staged by the Democratic Convention (DC), an opposition
bloc uniting 14 parties.
It was the latest event in its campaign against the ruling National
Salvation Front party for the February 9 local polls, Romania's first in
half a century. The DC presented its candidates for the posts of Bucharest
mayor-general and six mayors of the capital's sub-districts.

MR Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the German Bundesbank, said at the
weekend he could not indicate when a reduction in German interest rates
would be possible.
'We will continue to hold monetary expansion within the targets we have
set,' Mr Tietmeyer said at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in
Davos.
He said the decision to raise the Lombard and discount rates on December 19
was not made purely on the basis of the current wage negotiations in
Germany.
He noted that the moves had already resulted in a reduction in long-term
interest rates, and claimed this was a consequence of markets believing that
the German authorities were taking inflationary tendencies seriously. 'We
have created credibility,' he said.
Mr Tietmeyer recognised concern abroad about the interest rate increases,
but said Germany was in a special situation. 'German economic development is
not the same as in other countries. Co-ordination does not mean that we must
have the same policies.'

FT  01 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Arts: Site specific artists - When is an
installation a work of art? Lynn MacRitchie finds out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 4th February 1992) appended to this article.
PEOPLE HAVE trouble with unfamiliar art. Installations, for example: they
have a lot of trouble with them. They have even more trouble when familiar
words like 'site' and 'specific' are dragged in by way of explanation. Put
these together, offer site specific installations - that is, work that might
not be painting or sculpture (although it could be), made for a setting
which does not even offer the comparative security of an art gallery - and
you are asking for at best a 'what does it all mean?' and at worst a 'So
what?' response.
In Rose at Rose Court, Southwark Bridge, until March 14 (Thursday to
Saturday, 12.00-19.00), the Wise Taylor Partnership do all of this, in
collaboration with CE Property Developments (an Ivy Holdings Company), the
BRITEL Fund Trustees and an award from the government Business Sponsorship
Incentive Scheme. So - what does it all mean?
It means that five young artists have the opportunity to work in the unlet
spaces of the office development right across the road from the FT building.
The catch is that they must in some way address the nature of the site in
the work they make for it. The five were carefully selected, invited by
curator Georgie Wise because of her feeling that these artists and this
building could offer each other something.
Rose Court, however, is no romantic setting. A speculative development, like
our own home across the road, it offers little that is distinguished or
inspiring in its design or layout. Its present predicament, as unwanted or
at least unlet office space, and its historic associations - built on the
site of the Elizabethan Rose Theatre - are the themes that the works respond
to.
For the audience, the catch is that, try as we might to cling to art for
art's sake, the setting catches us out. Is the unfinished lift, with 'Mirror
Here' stencilled on its padded canvas walls, an art work? It could be. It is
certainly a successful concept. Is the empty top floor, which offers a
panorama of the city spread beneath our feet, an artwork? It is now part or
one, 'Evidence' by David Griffiths, which by day draws attention to sections
of the view by sticking strips of rose tinted film on the windows. By night,
special lighting installed by Griffiths links the interior space with the
floodlit city outside. The viewer cannot escape what this building is, what
its emptiness implies: the artworks, created with their setting as part of
their conception, heighten our response to the whole.
The piece by American artist Robert Millar demonstrates this process very
clearly. Working on the first floor, his chosen space lies directly above
the Rose Theatre remains. Preparing the piece, in which he originally
intended to use video, he listed all the questions his musings on the site
had raised. Their urgency changed his approach to the work. Now, pushing
open the door to his space, rows of questions confront us, painted straight
on to the floor in a red and white pattern which corresponds to the plan of
the ancient theatre beneath. 'How can we use a site? Who should question?
What is value? Who owns history? . . . ' On and on they go, a field of
conundrums.
'What Robert did was resurrect all the questions we had tried so hard to
bury,' was the candid response of the man from Ivy. Their interest in having
artists work in their building is straightforward. Controversial art is a
talking point, and could stimulate business. Letting the space is their
objective, and if artworks lend tone and attract clients, then art works
they are happy to have. Robert Millar hopes that future tenants might leave
his work in place - under the carpet, of course.
That such challenging art can both survive and grow more meaningful over
time is well demonstrated by the Bruce Nauman exhibition now in its last
week at the ICA (until 2 February). This American artist, who has exhibited
for nearly 30 years, addresses himself to the human condition using just
about every technique both familiar and unfamiliar from drawing, painting,
sculpture, film and video to installations and works involving his own body
or using other performers.
Seeing such a wide range of his work confirms the view formed at large
survey exhibitions such as Metropolis and the Whitney Biennale of last year,
that this is an artist who takes on the big issues, who is neither afraid of
his own humanity nor scornful of that of others. That his works may seem
bleak does not mean that they are uncaring. Their rigorous construction
forces us to contemplate both the grotesqueries of the flesh and the
pitifulness of our attempts at communication, our efforts to make contact
stumbling into violence and horror.
The video pieces are particularly affecting, exploring the nature of the
body and its processes, and of language and communication. Early works
concentrate on simple actions performed by the artist. Later tapes such as
'Clown Torture' or 'Violent Incident' show scenes endlessly repeated, the
performers' words and gestures transformed into metaphors for futility and
violence. Nauman's great strength is that, despite the clinical appearance
of many of his pieces, be uses difficult media such as video and
installation - as well as, and superbly, the traditional tools of drawing
and printmaking - for a very simple purpose. He makes us look at and listen
to ourselves, he makes us see that flesh is weak and that words can hurt.
Bruce Nauman is shown in conjunction with Damien Hirst, an obviously
irresistible combination of the old master and the new boy. Hirst's
installations are impressive, their components well chosen, their
arrangements beautifully realised. I can see what I am supposed to be
thinking about, such as in 'Sometimes I avoid people' with its oxygen
cylinders and glass cases or surgical paraphernalia or 'The acquired
inability to escape' which sets an office chair and work table empty but for
cigarettes, lighter and filled ashtray in another huge glass and iron case.
1 can see it all right, but I cannot feel it. This is work as demonstration
rather than enquiry, showing rather than exploring. Nothing is shared, and
the pieces' perfection forbids further enquiry.

FT  01 FEB 92 / The men who would play God: Unravelling the secrets of the
human gene could transform human life. But, as Clive Cookson reports, the
possibilities for abuse of this power are terrifying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the 20th century's scientific revolutions, the one with the greatest
potential to transform life is the unravelling of the secrets of human
genes.
Within 15 years, scientists expect to have decoded all of the 100,000 genes
which are the blueprint for individual development from the foetus until old
age. This information, encoded chemically in every living cell, is stored in
spiral ribbons of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is analogous to
computer tapes. Decoding them could confer an almost Godlike power to
foresee - and to change - an individual's destiny. The question whether this
power will be used for good or ill raises deep moral issues which will
result in fierce debate as the technology improves.
The practical development of genetics is, however, no more advanced than
electronics was in the transistor age of the 1950s. Very few people have had
direct personal experience of genetic medicine and research efforts in
hundreds of laboratories around the world are dimly understood in the world
outside.
The genetic revolution has therefore made little impact on the public
imagination, says Dr Steve Jones, head of the genetics department at
University College, London, who tried to bring home its implications in his
recent Reith Lectures on BBC Radio. 'But it is going to have a dramatic
effect on many people. You will be able to get a good idea of what you are
going to die from and when - or, to be more positive, to know what diseases
you are at risk from so that you can avoid them.'
Research is coordinated through an international programme, the Human Genome
Mapping Project, with total expenditure estimated at Dollars 3bn (Pounds
1.6bn) over the next 15 years. Since gene mapping started in the early
1970s, the pace has accelerated rapidly. Scientists have now located about
2,700 genes, including those responsible for common inherited diseases such
as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and haemophilia - and the gender gene
which determines whether the embryo becomes a boy or girl.
Practical uses of the new genetic knowledge fall into two broad categories:
testing or screening to discover whether an individual is carrying
particular genes; and therapy to change a person's genes. Both bring the
promise of immense medical benefits, balanced by terrifying possibilities
for abuse.
The embarrassing record of some of their predecessors in the 1920s and
1930s, who were only too willing to advocate eugenics and racial purity, has
increased the reluctance of today's researchers to speak publicly about
human genetic engineering.
'There has been an astonishing shift of attitude over the last 50 years,'
Jones observes. 'In the 1930s, when genetics was a series of prejudices and
our information was effectively zero, the scientific literature was full of
proposals for eugenics. Now that we are gaining the knowledge to 'improve
the human race' people don't want to think about it.'
Pre-natal testing is already available in about the eighth week of pregnancy
for several disorders caused by single genetic defects, including cystic
fibrosis, phenylketonuria, muscular dystrophy and thalassaemia. If the
defective gene is present, the mother is offered an abortion. Extensive
genetic testing for thalassaemia, a severe form of anaemia common in the
Mediterranean region, has greatly reduced the incidence of this disease.
For those opposed to abortion, this form of preventative medicine is
unacceptable. But the medical profession regards it as morally equivalent to
 -and a great practical improvement on - amniocentesis, a cruder and more
limited non-genetic test for foetal abnormalities which is offered to older
mothers.
At the same time, foundations are being laid for genetic screening of the
general population. The UK Medical Research Council is sponsoring five
trials of screening for cystic fibrosis, the UK's most common serious
inherited disease, which clogs the lungs with a thick mucus and kills most
sufferers before the age of 30. Participants simply have to wash out their
mouths to provide enough cells to test for the defective gene.
'We are examining whether we can deliver an acceptable model of mass
screening,' says Dr David Brock, professor of human genetics at Edinburgh
University. 'Any type of screening has the capacity to disturb as well as
reassure. Being told that they are a carrier of a CF gene may be quite
upsetting to some people, however carefully they have been prepared.' Those
taking the tests are told that people carrying one copy of the defective
gene are quite healthy, but if they marry someone with the same defect the
children will have a one in four chance of developing cystic fibrosis. As
more genes are identified such ethical problems will multiply.
The main medical problems of western society - cancer, heart disease and
mental illness - result from a complicated interaction between genetic and
environmental factors. Genetic testing may reveal an unusual susceptibility
to alcoholism or schizophrenia, heart attack or lung cancer, but predictions
may be uncertain.
A pregnant woman told unambiguously that her baby will suffer from cystic
fibrosis is likely to opt for abortion. But what decision will she make if,
for example, she is told there is a one in five chance of the baby growing
up schizophrenic? For adults, genetic testing could throw up disturbing
uncertainties. If we had a full print-out of our genes, all of us would
discover that we carried several potentially lethal recessive genes (which
have no effect unless the other parent has a similar gene).
On the other hand a genetic print-out, properly interpreted, would give
everyone a personal guide as to which activities could be harmful and which
might be safely indulged. You might be told, for example, that you can eat
fatty foods freely, having no disposition to heart disease or bowel cancer,
but must avoid alcohol because you are susceptible to alcoholism. Advice
based on one's own gene pattern could be much more persuasive than today's
generalised do's and don'ts.
But unless social attitudes and the legal framework change, the
disincentives to taking genetic tests could be formidable. Those who turned
out to have bad genes could face discrimination in access to health and life
insurance, education and even employment, if the information were made
available to other people.
It is easy to imagine computer technology, including artificial
intelligence, being combined with genetic screening to draw conclusions
about people's suitability for particular jobs or careers. Large companies
may build up a genetic database of their staff and discover that employees
with certain gene combinations do well and others do badly.
That might sound an alarming echo of Huxley's Brave New World or a route to
better career counselling, depending on the point of view. Even the deepest
personal relationships could be influenced if genetic testing for disease or
compatibility were accepted in some cultures as a precursor of marriage.
Many researchers agree with Sir Walter Bodmer, director of the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund and president of the international Human Genome Mapping
Organisation, that a new legal framework is needed for genetic medicine. But
the interested parties are nowhere near reaching agreement about its
content. Life insurance executives, for example, have already objected to
the idea, proposed by some geneticists, that companies should banned from
discriminating against known carriers of genetic disease.
The need for legislation will become all the greater if genetic screening -
voluntary in today's experimental programmes - eventually becomes
compulsory.
'In the long run,' said Baroness Warnock, the moral philosopher who chaired
the highly influential Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation, 'it
seems to me inevitable that everyone will be obliged to submit to at least
some compulsory screening.'
Genetic testing will become much more appealing as researchers discover how
to correct the defects discovered. Gene therapy, which has been pioneered in
the US, involves introducing non-defective genes into particular cells to
replace the ones carrying the disease.
The first patient was a four-year-old American girl, who had to be kept
apart from other children because one defective gene in her immune system
meant that she had no natural protection against infection. In September
1990 she was given a transfusion of about a billion of her own blood cells,
to which copies of the correct gene had been added. Her immune defences are
now strong enough for her to attend school.
Since then half a dozen other gene therapy studies have got under way in the
US, and European researchers expect to launch their own trials. Last month
the UK government's Committee on the Ethics of Gene Therapy, chaired by Sir
Cecil Clothier, the distinguished lawyer, recommended approval for gene
therapy trials.
Cystic fibrosis is one of the most important targets for gene therapy
research on both sides of the Atlantic, and animal tests of potential
treatments are already under way. Scientists at the US National Institutes
of Health have used a genetically altered virus to carry correctly
functioning copies of the CFTR gene - which is defective in cystic fibrosis
patients - into the lungs of laboratory rats. If the technique works in
monkeys, too, trials of human gene therapy for cystic fibrosis could start
as soon as 1993.
All these experiments involve 'somatic gene therapy.' This corrects the
defect by adding new genes to the cells where they are needed - for example,
in the bone marrow or lungs - but the genetic change is not passed on to the
patient's offspring. 'There is widespread agreement,' said Lady Warnock,
'that such therapy is not open to moral objection.' Indeed, Sir Cecil
Clothier says that none of the religious groups - Christian, Moslem and
Jewish - giving evidence to his committee objected to somatic gene therapy.
But 'germ line gene therapy', which would affect future generations, is
generally regarded today as medically unpredictable and ethically
unacceptable. It is unlikely to be approved anywhere in the world, at least
for a few years.
An experimental procedure equivalent to germ line therapy is used to make
'transgenic' animals - for example, sheep which produce valuable human
proteins in their milk. But the technique, which involves injecting genes
into newly fertilised embryos, is too crude for use in humans. There is no
way of controlling how many copies of the new genes are taken up, nor of
directing where they are incorporated in the embryo's existing genetic
material.
However, if scientists develop a more precise technique for eliminating a
defective gene and replacing it with a correct copy, then germ line gene
therapy will seem irresistible. If, for example, it became possible safely
to eradicate cystic fibrosis for ever, it would seem absurd to screen each
generation for the defective gene.
The question then is whether we would have taken the first step down a
slippery slope, leading eventually from eradication of inherited diseases to
genetic enhancement of sought-after traits such as intelligence, beauty and
athletic prowess. Improving mankind may seem an enticing prospect. But as
Lady Warnock said: 'We all fear, and not without reason, that one day such
power might be exercised not by benevolent doctors but by political tyrants
who would use us for their own ends.'

FT  01 FEB 92 / Brewers' plans thrown into confusion: Brent Walker shocked
by OFT ruling on pub leasing deal with Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by Britain's big brewers to reduce their estates of tied public
houses to comply with government orders were thrown into confusion yesterday
by the Office of Fair Trading.
The OFT said 734 pubs which the brewing group, Allied-Lyons, was planning to
lease to Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group, would still be counted as
belonging to the tied estate.
The OFT, which has been reviewing the complex deal, said the reason was
because Allied supplies beer to Brent Walker pubs under a separate contract.
Allied had hoped the terms of the deal would help it to meet the government
requirement that it should free 2,380 of its pubs from ties or exclusive
beer supply contracts. The OFT's decision came as a shock to Brent Walker,
which had believed there were no obstacles to the deal.
The Department of Trade and Industry had said in the morning that it would
not refer the transaction to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Brent Walker is in the process of trying to persuade its banks to reschedule
and restructure Pounds 1.5bn of debt.
A vital condition of the debt restructuring is the completion of the pub
deal with Allied.
However, Brent Walker's chief executive, Mr Ken Scobie, said he was
confident that the deal with Allied would still go ahead.
'The key condition for us was that there should not be a reference to the
MMC,' he said. He said that there was a fall-back clause in the agreement
with Allied.
This clause would allow the Allied leasing deal to go ahead on different
beer supply terms.
An adviser to Brent Walker said that this might involve changing the lease
terms, but that it would not change the overall financial attractions for
Brent Walker.
For a year, Brent Walker has been perilously poised between rescue and
receivership. Yesterday its banks agreed to a further extension, until the
end of February, of standstill on loan repayments.
A banker said that agreement from all 50 banks was not given until minutes
before yesterday's deadline.
The OFT's view of the pubs deal was supported by Treasury counsel. They felt
that Allied's continuing interest in the pub properties, coupled with an
agreement under which it would supply Brent Walker pubs with an estimated
250,000 barrels of beer a year for seven years, effectively 'tied' the pubs
to the Allied estate.
Allied said last night that it would be seeking clarification of the OFT's
views, but made it clear that it wants to proceed with the deal.
Its legal advice was that the leasing arrangement would free the 734 pubs
from the tie and would not infringe the beer orders, it said.
Apart from the disposal of the pubs, the other main attraction for Allied
was the fact that supplying the enlarged Brent Walker estate of more than
1,800 pubs would lift its share of the UK beer market by up to 1 per cent.
Allied announced last month that it had agreed a similar deal, involving the
lease of 142 pubs and the supply of beers, to Burtonwood Brewery, the
north-west regional brewer.
The turn of events yesterday will also cast further doubt over the
government's response to its proposed merger of Allied's brewing interests
with the UK operations of Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, in a Pounds 510m
joint venture, Carlsberg-Tetley.
That merger would give the combined group an 18-19 per cent share of the
beer market, putting it into third place, closely behind Bass and Courage.
Allied shares rose 18p to 661p but fell back to close at 649, a gain of 6p.
Brent Walker's shares closed 2p higher at 14p.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Sharp brings HDTV equipment within reach of the mass market
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MASS market for high definition television was brought years closer
yesterday when Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, surprised the
industry by introducing an HDTV receiver for about a quarter of the price of
the nearest competing product.
The equipment will put HDTV within the reach of a large number of Japanese
households. It could also be a key to rekindling growth in the consumer
electronics industry, which has been suffering from a lack of new products.
'It is just the type of stimulus that the industry needs,' said Mr Chuck
Goto, electronics analyst at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo. 'Sony and
everybody else will be scrambling to match the product.'
Sharp unveiled a 36-inch HDTV decoder which it will sell for Y1m (Pounds
4,475) beginning in April. The launch is timed to capitalise on the
increased interest in HDTV expected to be generated by the summer Olympics,
which will be broadcast in Japan in HDTV format.
An HDTV product at Y1m had not been expected for at least several years. The
price had been cited by a wide range of analysts and electronics companies
as a threshold. Once reached, they expect HDTV quickly to become a mass
market product in Japan, allowing for greater economies of scale in
manufacturing which will encourage further price reductions.
NHK, Japan's national broadcast company, began broadcasting in HDTV for
eight hours a day in November, but a price of between Y3.6m and Y4m for
receiving equipment has been too high for most. European broadcasts are
expected to begin by the middle of the decade.
Sharp, based in Osaka, said its surveys indicated that up to 16 per cent of
Japanese households may be prepared to buy the product at that price. Some
of its competitors expressed astonishment at the price, and reserved
judgment over its quality until comparison tests could be made.
Mr Masao Tomioka, chief of Sharp's high vision project, said the cost was
brought down in part by reducing the number of integrated circuits used in
the signal decoder to just six semiconductor chips. An HDTV set announced
last week by a consortium consisting of Fujitsu, Hitachi, Sony and Texas
Instruments, still contained 30 chips.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Ashdown spells out coalition deal terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday gave his clearest
exposition to date of his conditions for entering a post-election agreement
in the event of a hung parliament.
His comments were clearly intended to dispel suggestions this week from Sir
David Steel, the party's former leader, that a political pact could be
agreed that postponed or qualified electoral reform for the House of Commons
during the next parliament. Mr Ashdown said any agreement with one of the
big parties would require that the coming general election was the last
under the present first-past-the-post system.
A partnership would also depend on agreement about a five-year programme for
government in which Liberal Democrats would expect to serve.
Mr Ashdown's comments came amid mounting speculation that the Liberal
Democrats could have a decisive roleif no party gains an overall majority at
the election.
He did not rule out a referendum on voting reform, but said that could only
be held once the legislation for a new system had completed its journey
through the House of Commons. His clarification, in a Channel 4 interview
with Sir Robin Day, was clearly aimed at stamping on Sir David's suggestions
this week that the party may be ready to co-operate with a Labour government
that brought in proportional representation for Scotland and a new London
authority.
A Gallup opinion poll in the Daily Telegraph last night gave Labour a 1.5
point lead over the Tories. The results, against last week, were Labour 39.5
per cent (up 1.5), Conservatives 38 per cent (down 2), Liberal Democrats
17.5 per cent (up 1).
A poll in the Glasgow Herald last night confirmed support for the Scottish
National Party at the expense of Labour. The figures, with last month in
brackets, are: Labour 38 per cent (47 per cent); SNP 26 (21); Conservatives
23 (21); and Liberal Democrats 11 (11).

FT  01 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any change in the high street landscape is guaranteed to make headlines. But
yesterday's announcement from Thorn EMI that it is pulling out of UK
electrical retailing is less dramatic than it seems. Thorn never made any
secret of its wish to get rid of Rumbelows, which has been losing money
steadily for five years.
The best solution would have been to find a buyer for the whole business.
Not surprisingly in such an overcrowded sector, there were no takers.
Shutting the operation was ruled out by the length of some of the unexpired
leases and the size of the writedowns involved. In the event, a compromise
has been reached which should result in the sale of 50 out-of-town Atlantis
outlets and the incorporation of perhaps 250 of the remaining 450 Rumbelows
stores into Thorn's existing UK rental activities. There are obvious risks
at this stage in the cycle, not least in the fact that Granada is also
sharpening up its act. But even assuming that concepts like rent-to-buy
prove less appealing than Thorn hopes, the cost of further slimming will be
cheaper with the passage of time.
The issue for investors is not so much when the likely Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m
extraordinary charge for the year soon ending will be recouped above the
line. The question is whether Thorn's new premium rating can be sustained. A
prospective multiple 15 per cent above the market average can perhaps be
defended on the grounds of the company's defensive strengths. The danger is
that the shares, resting on the fortunes of two solid cash generators, will
be eclipsed when the time comes to buy the cyclicals.

Yesterday's statement by the Office of Fair Trading on the contentious
Allied-Lyons/Brent Walker pub deal was so misleading as arguably to create a
false market in both companies' shares. In announcing that the deal was not
to be referred, the OFT omitted to mention that it will be hedged around
with such conditions as to make its implementation very difficult. Both
companies play down the scale of the problem, which is understandable given
that the issue may have to be resolved in court and that the failure of the
deal could finish Brent Walker. But under the conditions required by the
OFT, it is hard to see how Brent Walker can afford to lease 734 Allied pubs
on terms which would make it worth Allied's while.
The wider implication is that the competition authorities are making a fresh
attempt to bring the industry to heel. The Allied/BW deal is a minnow
compared with the otherwise very similar Courage/GrandMet arrangement, which
slipped through before the authorities grasped which way the industry was
headed. It now sounds as if all agreements on the supply of beer will come
under close scrutiny, while the current OFT inquiry into beer pricing may
turn out more than a formality. The OFT ruling on the Allied/Carlsberg
brewing merger, due in a fortnight or so, will also bear close attention.
Given the costs incurred by the brewing industry in conforming to the new
regime, it is possible to feel a twinge of sympathy. But its attempts to
recoup the losses, by price rise or merger, have been so crude as to make
further official measures almost inevitable. From the investor's viewpoint,
the sector looks more risky and turbulent than ever.

FT  01 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The currency market appears unnecessarily confused about the effect of a
German steel strike. Ahead of the ballot result, worry that industrial
unrest would worsen German economic weakness pulled the D-Mark sharply down.
The currency rebounded, apparently on expectations that the Bundesbank will
stay as tough as ever.
There is little logic to the notion that a weak economy implies a weak
currency, unless it also means a relaxation of monetary policy. That is
scarcely Germany's case, since money supply is growing outside its target
range. The bank's preoccupation is not just with steel but the entire wage
round, which means high rates well into the summer.
Currency investors may, however, have misread the trend in interest
differentials. Expectations of a sustained dollar recovery this year rest on
the assumption that the interest differential with Germany will soon narrow.
But high German rates are only one side of the equation. Futures markets may
be projecting tighter US monetary policy once economic recovery sets in
during the spring or summer. But though the Federal Reserve hints that rates
have bottomed, it would take a formidable resurgence of inflationary fears
actually to raise them as the presidential election campaign hots up.
The dollar's peak yesterday at over DM1.62 thus looks overdone. So does City
chatter about lower UK rates. Not only is there too much domestic political
risk; renewed dollar weakness against the DM could also renew strains within
the ERM. Though 10 pfennigs above its D-Mark floor, sterling is not as
secure as it looks.

FT-SE Index: 2,571.2 (+20.4)
Though London's traditional January rally did not amount to much - just 78
points on the FT-SE - the market has now risen 10 per cent from its
Christmas low. This makes up all the ground lost in the preceding six weeks,
when the market realised that its hopes of economic recovery were premature.
After one false start, the latest rally may with luck prove the real thing.
Alternatively, one could point out that the market is still well within the
trading range established in the year since the Gulf war. It would only take
a lurch in sterling or a couple of bad opinion polls to send it smartly down
towards the lower end again. Politics apart, the defensive stocks such as
pharmaceuticals are by general consent fully valued; a further strong rise
would therefore need the cyclicals to join in. Having been wrong-footed
lately in opposite directions by Lonrho and Rank, the market may be slow to
push individual recovery stocks, especially with the results season in the
offing.
On the international front, investors also have to cope with a German steel
strike and fresh suggestions that US interest rates are not falling any
further. For the UK market to keep rising at its recent rate, quite a lot
has to go right.

The Last Post sounded for the old-style London stock market just after 4pm
yesterday when the London Traded Options Market left the Stock Exchange
trading floor for new premises at Cannon Bridge, writes Terry Byland.
Traders celebrated by throwing dealing papers in the air. The market's open
outcry trading system, whereby deals are done in public, had maintained the
tradition of face-to-face dealing which rapidly disappeared from the stock
market after Big Bang in 1986, when electronic trading screens took over.
The final deal was transacted by Bill Leask and John Lee, with 56 years'
floor attendance between them. Their departure left silent a trading floor
once alive with as many as 1,500 share dealers. It faces a less exciting
future as office space.

Wall Street
PROFIT-TAKING and weak leading economic indicators took their toll on share
prices yesterday as US stock markets ended a difficult week on a negative
note, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.47 at 3,223.39.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 2.82 at
408.81, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks finished 1.16
weaker at 620.21.
Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was 199m shares, and declines
outpaced rises by 927 to 734.
Although investors received an early lift from strong gains in overseas
equities markets, the news of a 0.3 per cent decline in leading economic
indicators for December set the tone for the rest of the morning.
The decline was the fifth consecutive month the index has shown virtually no
change - an indication, said analysts, that the economy was unlikely to
recover before mid-year.
There was further bad news in the shape of a 6.6 per cent drop in December
new home sales, and a fall in the January Chicago purchasers index. The
continued weak state of the economy, and the apparent unwillingness of the
Federal Reserve to contemplate further interest rate cuts, have proved a
disincentive to invest in stocks this week, and yesterday profit-taking
again forced stocks into retreat.
Although most defence stocks were hurt by Wednesday's news of planned
defence spending reductions, Raytheon bucked the trend, rising Dollars 1/2
to Dollars 85 1/2 after the company won a Dollars 167m contract to supply
electronic countermeasure pods to the US Air Force.
Polaroid stood out with a gain of Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/2 as more
than 1m shares changed hands in the wake of the company's fourth-quarter
profit of Dollars 1.16 a share, well up on the 90 cents a share earned at
the same stage a year ago.
Airline stocks were in the limelight after TWA filed for the protection of
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with AMR, parent of American Airlines, falling
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 70 3/4 , UAL recouping early losses to end Dollars
1/4 higher at Dollars 144 3/4 , USAir holding steady at Dollars 16 3/8 and
Delta falling Dollars 2 to Dollars 67.
Aetna slumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 41 1/2 amid rising concern about the
insurer's exposure to the troubled real estate market, especially in the
south west. The company also announced yesterday that it would be taking a
Dollars 55m charge in the fourth-quarter to cover its withdrawal from the
Massachusetts auto insurance market.
On the over-the-counter market, Autodesk plummeted Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars
28 1/4 after it warned that fourth quarter net income would come in between
30 cents and 35 cents a share, well below last year's figures and a long way
from market estimates.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed mixed in moderate trading. The TSE-300 fell 9.68
points to close at 3596.12.
Volume was 24,721,000 shares, down from 30,861,000 shares, and trading value
fell to CDollars 296.7m from CDollars 349m.
Cameco fell CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 15 1/2 . The company said one of its
major shareholders, a Canadian government-owned company, will sell 5,990,724
special warrants of Cameco for CDollars 14.60 a warrant.
Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Forest Products fell CDollars  1/4 to
CDollars 25 1/2 after posting a fourth-quarter loss from continuing
operations of CDollars 464.4m, including a charge of CDollars 368.1m.

FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: TWA files for Chapter 11 revamp
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS WORLD Airlines, the heavily-indebted US carrier controlled by Mr Carl
Icahn, announced yesterday it had reached an agreement with its creditors
which could allow it to rapidly restructure its finances under the
protection of the US bankruptcy court.
However, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a Government watchdog,
last night cast doubt over Mr Icahn's proposal when it estimated that TWA's
pension fund was underfunded by Dollars 933m and said: 'If this filing is an
attempt to escape the pension responsibility, it will not succeed.'
The company's plan, which involves Mr Icahn relinquishing majority ownership
of the business, yesterday prompted TWA to file a 'pre-planned' Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganisation.
This is a subtle variant on a 'pre-packaged' bankruptcy, which involves a
company entering Chapter 11 after first obtaining the agreement of most of
its creditors for a debt-restructuring plan. This plan is then imposed on
other creditors, allowing a company to emerge rapidly from bankruptcy,
rather than spending years under court control TWA hoped to emerge in six
months or less.
TWA, the seventh largest US carrier, announced a comprehensive restructuring
plan last July. It said then it intended to file a pre-packaged Chapter 11,
probably early this year.
Mr Icahn said yesterday's filing had the support of all secured and
unsecured bondholders. TWA had also reached agreement in principle with the
machinists' union, representing about half its employees, on a new
pay-for-productivity labour contract.
TWA's debt problems stem from 1988, when Mr Icahn, who acquired control of
the business in the mid-1980s, borrowed heavily to take the business
private. It is the sixth of America's 12 largest airlines to file for
Chapter 11 protection over the past year or so as a weak economy, high fuel
prices, and a battle for market share have forced consolidation on the
sector. Three of those six - Eastern, Midway and Pan Am - are now defunct.
Yesterday's plan envisages the elimination of Dollars 1bn of TWA's Dollars
1.6-Dollars 1.7bn of debt, with control of its equity passing to creditors.
Mr Icahn would end up with between 15 and 40 per cent of the equity against
90 per cent now.
TWA said it had about Dollars 500m in cash and was also arranging Dollars
200m of debtor-in-possession financing - loans to bankrupt companies which
rank first in the queue for repayment.
Mr Icahn said having these funds would be 'more than adequate to enable us
to continue to conduct our normal operations and should ensure the
successful completion of our reorganisation'. TWA stressed that the filing
would not affect its normal business.
But the filing still leaves a question mark over the long-term future of
TWA, which had an operating deficit of Dollars 257.7m in the first nine
months of 1991, and faces stiff competition from the better-capitalised
American, United and Delta airlines.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: New technology, rights issues and
acquisitions fuel the rapid growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Clegg's departure throws a spotlight on the past eight years of Wace
Group's extraordinary expansion, one of the most dramatic corporate
transformations of the 1980s - and on the last three years, when its
glittering record began to falter.
Under Mr Clegg's direction Wace swelled through some 40 acquisitions to
become the world's largest pre-press printer, repeatedly treading a path
from its north London headquarters to the Stock Exchange to raise more
money.
But shareholders, at first dazzled by the young managing director's
transformation of the profits, gradually became more worried that it was
simply a one-man band, and after the near disastrous 1990 rights issue they
began to ask whether the magic had gone.
Clegg saved Wace from near bankruptcy in 1983 when he chose it as the
vehicle for his entry into the business world. It had lost about Pounds 1m
in the three years before his arrival, but in his eyes it was an ideal shell
company: it had a stock market quote, and needed the injection of only a
small amount of capital to recover.
He joined Wace's board together with his friend Mr Michael Berry, who was
owner of a small printing company.
Mr Clegg had no experience of printing but he did have capital - his cousin,
Miss Jayne Wright, had left her small inheritance in his hands when she
emigrated to South Africa.
Miss Wright, who is now married and living in South Africa, took a 24 per
cent stake in 1983, then underwrote a Pounds 610,000 rights issue in May
1984 giving her a third of the company.
Two years of text-book cost-cutting followed before Wace made its first
acquisition, of a rival printer, for Pounds 330,000.
Mr Clegg's argument was that pre-press, which prepares text and photographs
for publication, was the most fundamental stage of printing but had been
commercially neglected.
New technology was transforming the techniques, by enabling images to be
captured digitally and so allowed photographs and page lay-outs to be
altered by computers.
But the traditional family 'corner-shops' which made up most of the
highly-fragmented pre-press market could often not afford to keep up with
the changes.
Mr Clegg argued that Wace should keep investing in the latest equipment and
keep mopping up its tiny competitors, so that it could rapidly become the
biggest player as the market consolidated and became more sophisticated.
If additional encouragement were needed for his masterplan it came in the
form of an advertising and magazine boom, which stimulated the demand for
pre-press.
In 1983 Wace's turnover was Pounds 4.5m; it had soared to Pounds 235.2m in
1990 by swallowing one competitor every two to three months.
The fuel for that rocket was capital. In four years Wace had four large
rights issues, all of which had a poor reception in the City.
The first, for Pounds 16m in September 1987, fell foul of the October stock
market crash.
In October 1988 the company raised Pounds 34.4m for the acquisition of
Techtron, the largest colour pre-press services group in the US. But only 20
per cent was taken up by institutions and the rest was left with
underwriters, because the stock market suddenly slumped again.
Shortly afterwards, on November 17 1988, Miss Wright sold 2m shares at 295p,
the bulk of her total holding of 2.866m shares, and sold the rest shortly
after. For an initial investment of around Pounds 1m, she made an estimated
Pounds 8.5m on selling the stake.
It is not known whether her cousin who effected the transformation received
any of this. Mr Clegg's own holding has always been small; at the end of
1990 he held just under 100,000 shares.
Wace waited scarcely a year before calling, in September 1989, for Pounds
44.6m. But again the market fell precipitously during the rights period and
again only 20 per cent of the offer was taken up.
The pattern led to City jokes that Wace's cash calls were the best way of
forecasting a market plunge. But many institutions were still enthusiastic
supporters of the company and the shares eventually recovered and rose above
the rights issue prices, helped by several sets of excellent profits from
the company.
However, in August 1990 the company went back to the market for Pounds 37m
in convertible shares, partly to finance the takeover of its
financially-troubled rival, Parkway, for Pounds 12m. This time less than 4
per cent was taken up - it was issued just before the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
Institutions had also begun to tire of the constant calls for cash, and
advertising had begun to deteriorate. Some had also become wary about the
vulnerability of 'one-man bands'.
Last year Wace unveiled the first serious blemish in its growth with a 34
per cent fall in interim profits to June 1991, blaming the recession-hit
advertising market and a sharp increase in interest charges. Parkway, as
Wace's shareholders had feared, had continued to have problems, particularly
in its US subsidiaries.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 8.11m even though turnover
rose from Pounds 104.2m to Pounds 148.3m.
Mr Clegg was nevertheless upbeat, estimating that a quarter of his
competitors had shut down: 'I would say that in two years' time we will look
back on this recession and say it was probably the best thing that ever
happened to us.'
Despite recent disappointments, there were still many investors,
particularly in the US, who were happy to share his optimism.
They are now trying to assess the prospects for the company without its most
charismatic director.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: Anglo-Irish distances itself from
Clegg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO-IRISH Bank Corporation was at pains to distance itself from Mr John
Clegg, who resigned as a non-executive director of the Dublin-based banking
group yesterday following market speculation that his UK company, Wace, has
been involved in money-laundering for the IRA.
Mr Sean Fitzpatrick, Anglo-Irish's chief executive, said there had been no
pressure on Mr Clegg to resign, but that 'he took the honourable decision'
after a series of meetings earlier this week.
Both Mr Clegg and Anglo-Irish had concluded that 'while the allegations are
around, it is right and proper that he should resign'. Mr Fitzpatrick said:
'As a bank we must have directors who are above and beyond suspicion.'
Mr Fitzpatrick added: 'I can confirm that we had no banking relationship
with John, his family or with Wace. No loans were made to them, nor were
there any deposits from them, or banking transactions.' He said he was
'dumbfounded' by the allegations against Mr Clegg.
Mr Clegg's family holds 15 per cent of the shares of Anglo-Irish, which in
its 1990 annual report recorded trading assets of IPounds 759m (Pounds 704m)
and a pre-tax profit of IPounds 6.5m. The shares are believed to be held
through a family trust controlled by Mr Clegg and several nominees.
The Clegg family first took a stake in Anglo-Irish in 1986 and have
consistently followed the rights issues since, maintaining its holding at
the present level.
Mr Clegg was brought on to the board in 1988 as a non-executive director
because 'the bank needed young, bright blood to know what was going on in
the UK', said Mr Fitzpatrick. He was considered a good director, although
more recently his contribution has apparently declined as he had dedicated
more time to the development of Wace's activities in the US. Wace holds just
under 1 per cent of Anglo-Irish shares directly.
Mr Clegg has been under pressure from the board for several years to reduce
his combined family and Wace holding - something which Mr Fitzpatrick has
made no secret of, as Anglo-Irish is seeking to increase institutional
shareholdings.
However, Mr Clegg has resisted the pressure, arguing that Anglo-Irish shares
have been undervalued and are good value, according to one Dublin-based
market analyst.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Anglia Secure almost doubles loss to Pounds
17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES continued to mount at Anglia Secure Homes, the retirement housing and
care services company. The deficit for the year ended September 30 was
Pounds 16.9m, almost double the previous year's Pounds 8.89m.
Exceptional charges on the value of landbank and developments, its joint
venture with Balfour Beatty, and a write-off of capitalised interest
accounted for Pounds 9.5m of the loss. Last year, Anglia took a provision of
Pounds 6.5m, mostly for the decline in property values.
Mr Peter Edmondson, chairman, blamed the 'appalling malaise in the housing
market' for the result. Sales fell by 35 per cent to Pounds 23.1m.
During the year, Anglia sold 293 units, compared with 443 last year, partly
reflecting the group's move away from development. Average house prices fell
from Pounds 71,000 to Pounds 67,200.
Mr Richard Clough, managing director, said the actual decline was probably
greater as most of Anglia's units were sold in the south-east.
The care services division, in which UK insurer Commercial Union holds a
49.9 per cent stake following a financial rescue package in 1990, returned
sales of Pounds 3m and had been profitable, Mr Clough said. The division was
expected to account for Pounds 6m of turnover by the end of the current
year.
The group intends increasingly to focus on this division, which manages
retirement and sheltered housing units, and builds nursing homes for health
authorities.
Mr Clough expected the group to break even or return a small profit in
1992-93 as it decreased its dependence on development business.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 4.9m and debt was reduced
from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 29.5m. Gearing was 185 per cent of shareholders
funds.
Loss per share rose from 35.6p to 49.3p.

Shares in Owen &amp; Robinson tumbled 60 per cent to 10p as the jewellery chain
and footwear retailer warned it would report a loss for the year and would
not be able to pay the preference dividend which was due yesterday.
Mr Tom Forsyth, finance director, blamed the 'Ratner factor' for the group's
exceptionally bad Christmas. December sales were Pounds 2m down on
expectations of Pounds 10m.
The price-cutting campaign launched by Ratner, the high street jeweller,
which introduced reductions of up to 25 per cent, had decimated margins, Mr
Forsyth said.
'He (Gerald Ratner) shot himself in the foot and the ricochet hit us,' he
said.
Owen &amp; Robinson is now likely to report losses of less than Pounds 1.2m for
the year to January 31. The second half had produced profits, although far
less than expected.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: IBM's UK subsidiary tumbles Pounds 544m
into losses of Pounds 124m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' UK subsidiary, last year produced results
which, although broadly anticipated, bear grim witness to the recession in
the UK, the effects of fiercely increasing competition and the slowdown in
the computer business worldwide.
IBM United Kingdom Holdings made an operating profit of only Pounds 60m in
the year to December 31 1991 compared with Pounds 420m in 1990.
Restructuring costs of Pounds 184m, moreover, resulted in a group loss
before tax of Pounds 124m.
The UK company is following the pattern set by its parent which last month
announced its first annual loss and first fall in revenues since the Second
World War.
IBM UK's overall revenues fell 8 per cent from Pounds 4.32bn to Pounds
3.98bn. Its UK sales were 14 per cent down, from Pounds 1.98bn to Pounds
1.7bn while revenues from the export of goods and services declined by 3 per
cent from Pounds 2.35bn to Pounds 2.28bn.
The restructuring costs of Pounds 184m were largely accounted for in the
loss of more than 2,600 jobs during the year through a mixture of natural
wastage and voluntary redundancy.
IBM is not alone in producing poor results. Major computer manufacturers
have been hit hard by a combination of factors which have depressed revenues
and profits including recession, a shift to industry standard products which
command lower profit margins and market saturation.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, IBM UK chairman, said the company's performance in the
fourth quarter of 1991 showed some improvement over the same period in 1990,
indicating that business was beginning to pick up.
Pay had been frozen for part of the year and expenses cut by 10 per cent.
The results underscore the rapid change in fortunes at IBM.
Long the leader in the UK's two horse computer race, IBM is losing market
share. ICL, the straggler, is, since its takeover by Fujitsu of Japan,
looking increasingly impressive.
Mr John Gardner, ICL UK managing director said yesterday that the company
sales grew during 1991 and it maintained profitability.
IBM must be envying ICL's competence in standard systems, its early move
into software and services and its lean operations.
All of these are now part of IBM's plan for a return to profitability.

A US COURT last night approved an interim financing arrangement that will
allow Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) to pay its bills until
February 21.
The agreement, which was supported by the UK court-appointed administrators
and the New York lawyer responsible for the company's filing for protection
from creditors under US bankruptcy law, will allow payments to be made for
administration, overheads and salaries.
The funds will be drawn from a Pounds 15m credit facility in addition to a
Pounds 3.6m the court approved earlier this month.
The interim funds would be used to pay 75 per cent of expenses incurred in
the administration and could include over Pounds 800,000 of payroll,
overhead and other miscellaneous expenses due in February.

GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the aircraft leasing company, is considering raising
about Dollars 700m (Pounds 386m) of new money in its flotation, which it
plans to bring forward to April.
However, shares with a value of up to Dollars 1.5bn are likely to be on
offer, the precise amount depending on how many of its existing shareholders
wish to sell.
The flotation, aimed primarily at investment institutions, will be one of
the most ambitious attempts to market shares in the big share markets of the
world.
Air Canada and Aer Lingus own substantial blocks of shares, each worth about
Dollars 200m, and are expected to sell part of their holdings. Air Canada
said the company would sell its holding if the price was right believed to
be about Dollars 20 a share.
Advisers to the group, are understood to have recommended prices ranging
from Dollars 17 to Dollars 23.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Cracks widen in the United Kingdom: James Buxton analyses
the effect on electoral prospects of the Scots' desire for independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sensational vision will have flashed through some people's minds on
Tuesday night. It was the image of Mr Alex Salmond, the ever-smiling leader
of the Scottish National Party (SNP), winning a majority of the Scottish
seats at the general election and claiming a mandate to negotiate Scotland's
independence from the United Kingdom.
That night, News at Ten revealed the findings of an ICM opinion poll showing
that 50 per cent of Scots now want independence. Never before has a poll
shown such a high level of support for Scotland leaving the UK.
It was also a reversal of the established pattern of Scottish opinion polls,
which for the past four years have shown that about 45 per cent of Scots
want a devolved Scottish parliament and about 35 per cent want full
independence, with the status quo being supported by only 20 per cent.
The poll does not mean that Scotland is about to secede. The only party
offering Scotland independence is the SNP and, although backing for the
party has jumped to 26 per cent, its highest level since 1989, that does not
match the the level of support for independence revealed by the recent poll.
But it does mean that Scotland is set for a rumbustious election campaign
centred on its constitutional future. The parliamentary seats at stake north
of the border could be crucial to the chances of Labour or the Conservatives
winning a close-run general election.
Furthermore the result, whatever it is, is likely to lead to some kind of
constitutional change in Scotland. Labour is promising a devolved parliament
in Edinburgh, based on a blueprint drawn up by the Scottish Constitutional
Convention, in which the Liberal Democrats are the other key players.
So far, the Tories have doggedly upheld the status quo, but they are
expected to offer some new constitutional formula if they win the election,
especially if, as seems probable, they lose some of the nine Scottish seats
(out of 72) which they now hold.
'Independence has become more credible as a realistic option for Scotland in
the last few months,' says Mr John Curtice of the politics department of
Strathclyde University.
The momentum, he believes, began with the Kincardine and Deeside by-election
in November, where the Tories lost the seat to the Liberal Democrats by
nearly 8,000 votes, and became the third party in Scotland  - a reminder to
Scots that Scotland is ruled by a party which most Scots did not vote for in
1987.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, responded by attacking Labour's plans
for a Scottish parliament as unworkable and likely to lead down the slippery
slope to independence. By so doing, he gave the impression that the only
choice was between the status quo and independence, and may have boosted the
case for the latter option.
British Steel's decision early this month to close the Ravenscraig steel
plant was seen as a further wound inflicted on Scotland by the English.
Two weeks ago, the four Scottish party leaders thrashed out the
constitutional issue before a vast audience in Edinburgh. In the debate,
which was later televised, Mr Salmond of the SNP came off best against Mr
Lang and Mr Donald Dewar, the Labour shadow Scottish secretary.
Last week the Scottish edition of The Sun, once a backer of the Tories,
achieved wide publicity when it said it was backing independence. Yesterday
it began handing out car stickers with the words 'Arise now and be a nation
again'.
'If Lang thought that by attacking devolution he could scare people into
supporting the status quo he has failed,' says Mr Curtice. But he believes
that this week's opinion poll is rather less clear-cut than it looks. Many
Labour supporters also appear to back independence. Other questions asked
suggest that many Scots are happy with either devolution or independence.
'What the majority wants is change,' he says.
But Mr Lang and the Scottish Tories go towards the election without offering
change. Although some Conservatives say the party should be promising to set
up a Scottish parliament if they win the election, ministers seem to have
decided that it is now too late to present a credible scheme of their own,
while a hard core within the Scottish Conservative party opposes any form of
devolution.
The most Mr Lang would say this week was that the Tories 'would take stock
of the situation after the election in the light of the result both north
and south of the border'. He has repeatedly said that the British
constitution is not 'set in concrete' but has given no hint as to how it
might change.
It is not a stirring basis for an election campaign. The Conservatives are
seen as the English party in Scotland, partly because of their refusal
dating back to 1979 to give Scotland its own assembly and partly because
they used their English majority to impose their policies on Scotland.
The election in Scotland will be a four-party fight, but as things stand
Labour's block of 48 seats, vital to its chances of winning the election,
should survive intact. The SNP's latest opinion poll level of 26 per cent is
not enough to bring them big gains in terms of seats. In virtually all of
the Labour-held seats the gap the SNP must make up is too great.
Most Conservatives, by contrast, have narrow majorities. By giving
credibility to the SNP with their anti-devolution campaign, they may hope
that the Nationalists will take votes from Labour and so weaken the
anti-Tory vote.
The best prospects for this strategy lie in seats like Stirling, where
Labour is hoping to unseat Mr Michael Forsyth, the Thatcherite minister of
state at the Scottish Office, and possibly in Ayr, where the Tories only
have a majority of 182 and where Mr George Younger, the former defence
secretary, is standing down.
There is a danger, however that this strategy could backfire. The stronger
the SNP becomes, the better its chances of winning rural seats where it is
the main challenger to the Tories: the most vulnerable is Galloway in the
south-west, held with a majority of only 3,600 by Mr Lang. Next come Perth
and Kinross, held by Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, and Tayside North, held by Mr
Bill Walker.
With gains by the Tories from the Liberal Democrats possible but unlikely,
the Tories could, in the worst case scenario, lose five seats in the general
election, leaving them with four.
If, in spite of such a poor showing in Scotland, they were still the overall
winners, there would be too few Scottish Conservative MPs to man the
Scottish Office effectively. A victorious Mr John Major would at last have
to confront the constitutional issue which the Tories have ignored for the
past 13 years.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Royal catalyst for social change: The Prince of Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prince of Wales seemed until recently to have become rather quiet.
Perhaps it was just the grey winter season when all that disturbed the flat
landscape around Sandringham was the sound of royal guns and the dull thud
of falling pheasants. But it would be unwise to think that because His Royal
Highness is not always in the public eye nothing is happening.
Now the spotlight of publicity is on the Prince of Wales again with the
announcement at a reception at St James's Palace on Thursday of his own new
Institute of Architecture. And there is a full programme of tours and
speeches to come in 1992.
Next week he will speak to heads of government at the World Economic Forum
in Davos. Later this month, he and the Princess of Wales will travel to
India on an official visit. The Prince will also continue his programme of
exploratory visits to European cities during the year, including a special
one to Expo '92 in Seville.
No-one can accuse the Prince of Wales of being afraid to speak his mind. His
speech on Thursday was a remarkable and heartfelt sermon. In fact, it was
really a manifesto of his personal philosophy. It takes a brave man to
discuss the state of the soul of the western world over champagne and
canapes.
What he has been accused of is overly-romantic attachments to the past.
Others see him as a crank who is reputed to indulge in such unwholesome
practices as dendrological conversation, not to mention the anatomically
inexact science of contemplating one's own navel.
There is some truth in these charges. He believes an important part of his
role is to represent history. He has also held on to some 'alternative' or
'hippy' values which many of his generation experienced and have grown out
of.
But on Thursday he delivered a ruminative soul searching that very few
public figures could get away with easily. The Prince's sincerity is not in
doubt, but he and his staff take the risk that such personal pronouncements
could be misinterpreted. It is often said that a constitutional monarchy
should be a silent presence in the face of a complex political world.
The Prince of Wales may share that view when he ascends the throne, but, in
what will be a long interim period, he feels that there are useful areas
where a royal word can help to further public debate.
The fact that royal interventions in public affairs are comparatively rare
does not deter him. The discreet silence of many of his forbears does not
persuade him that he should necessarily follow their example. He sees his
role clearly now as an informed catalyst, bringing people of all parties
together for comprehensive discussion and shared learning.
His Institute of Architecture inaugural speech reveals a great deal about
his philosophy and his concerns for the future of the world. As he has grown
older, it is clear that the Prince worries about the condition of men's
souls.
He is unhappy about how, historically, 'we were persuaded to see the cosmos
as a gigantic machine which could be examined, experimented with, and
manipulated by Man for his own exclusive use. Everything was explainable by
science and anything that couldn't be explained simply didn't exist.
'In this scenario, Man himself becomes a mere mechanical object and any
notion of a metaphysical reality disappears altogether. The sense of
humanity's uniqueness as a microcosm of the whole Universe is thrown out of
the window, to be replaced by an egocentric world view which denies that
all-encompas-sing sense of the sacred and stresses the purely rational'.
This is thoughtful and difficult stuff. But behind it lies more than just
contemplative hours on the Scottish hills. There are solid and serious
events that take place that often do not reach the pages of the newspapers.
A recent Sandringham seminar on agriculture and the environment was not
headline news. During the seminar, the European Commissioners for
agriculture and the environment spent 24 hours in Norfolk with their
officials. The European teams were matched by the presence of the UK
secretaries of state for the environment and agriculture and their permanent
secretaries.
The Prince is an interventionist host who makes sure that discussions are
positive and useful. He sees the danger of political megaphone diplomacy and
feels that a shirtsleeve picnic around the log cabin on the Sandringham
estate can initiate and reinforce personal contacts.
Europe is an important area of concern for the future monarch and the Prince
of Wales has made it clear that he recognises that the future of the UK lies
firmly in Europe, despite the possible decline of UK sovereignty that that
implies. On two recent visits to Hungary and Czechoslovakia, he celebrated
the death of communism with speeches that showed that he feels Britain has a
central role in reinforcing the common cultural ties that unite eastern and
western Europe. Behind the scenes, the Prince has helped with scholarships
for Polish doctors to visit Britain for study and research.
The Prince and his advisers have been increasingly active in Europe. And the
royal 'away days' now include as many European as British cities. In Paris,
Madrid, Brussels and several German towns, groups of officials, businessmen
and local authority officers have taken part in brief brainstorming sessions
over meals.
The pattern is for the Prince to take groups with him to indulge in what he
calls his 'seeing is believing' tours. Besides architecture, subjects close
to his heart include town planning, inner cities, waste management and
environmental problems.
There are few public figures able to charter the Royal Yacht and take it
half way up the Amazon as a floating base for a conference of world business
leaders on environmental and development problems. Last year's trip there
was but a preparatory journey for some of the participants in the UN world
conference on environment and development to be held in Rio de Janeiro in
June.
Although the Prince will not attend that gathering, he will be the keynote
speaker at a meeting of the Brundtland Commission (the World Commission on
Environment and Development named after the Norwegian prime minister, who
inspired it) to be held in London in April.
The Prince is in for a busy year. But his energies and programme are now
focused on a few, specific, areas. He is learning how to define his role.
After all, he could just play polo . . .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOLE case for the policies that have driven the economy into a deep
recession is that the UK may thereby gain the long-term benefits of low and
stable inflation. The job begun at the beginning of the Thatcher era can now
be completed.
What has given force to the theoretical arguments for a zero-inflation
economy is the UK's membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS at
what even enthusiastic proponents would agree was a demanding (if not
overvalued) rate. If ERM membership is not to end up as just another in the
series of half-hearted expedients that pass for British economic policy, its
implications for economic policy are still not thoroughly digested. The main
implication is that inflation must fall below the lowest level of any
leading country within the ERM and must fall to that level as soon as
possible.
It must fall below the levels of other countries because of the UK's poor
initial competitiveness. Notwithstanding the deep recession, the volume of
exports, excluding erratic items, between the three months to December 1990
and the same three months in 1991 grew by only 4 per cent. The current
account deficit is over 1 per cent of gross domestic product at the moment
and is likely to grow rapidly in any recovery. Lost competitiveness must be
regained.
The case for lowering inflation as quickly as possible is that the target
for the UK must be not just a comparable rate of cost inflation, but a
comparable level of costs. It would do little good to achieve the same rate
of inflation as in France from, say, 1996 if in the intervening period there
had been progressive erosion of competitiveness from what was already the
demanding base set in October 1990. The quicker convergence of inflation is
achieved, therefore, the shorter the period during which UK cost inflation
will have to be lower than in competitor countries.
Sole route
A recession is, unfortunately, the sole route to the required disinflation.
It may impose a high price, but it is also a unique opportunity. If the UK
has not achieved full convergence by the time recovery is well under way,
the whole process will simply have to be repeated.
The objective has not yet been achieved. The consensus of forecasters, for
example, is for about 4 per cent retail price inflation in the year to the
fourth quarter of 1992, above levels in several European countries. Over the
past year, earnings have risen by 7 1/2 per cent in the UK, still above the
German increase of 6.7 per cent, viewed by the Bundesbank as a disaster. To
be safe, British annual pay inflation must fall to about 3 per cent. It is
only against this demanding disinflationary objective, therefore, that the
chancellor's fiscal stance can be judged.
In its estimable Green Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies argues that
the chancellor might introduce a net tax cut of Pounds 1-2bn in the
forthcoming budget. It also argues that such a cut can be justified by the
need for fiscal reflation.
Since the budget has swung from a public sector debt repayment (excluding
privatisation receipts) of Pounds 7.4bn (1 1/2 per cent of GDP) in 1988-89
to the IFS forecast borrowing requirement of nearly Pounds 28bn (4.3 per
cent of GDP) in 1992-93, nobody can argue that tax cuts of Pounds 1-2bn
would make all that much difference. Macroeconomically speaking, the budget
is an over-rated event, even though a discretionary tax cut now would make
the government's promise to 'balance the budget over the cycle' still less
credible than it already is.
Fiscal fine-tuning
Nevertheless, the return to fiscal fine-tuning, with incomes policy in the
wings perhaps, brings back unpleasant memories. Fiscal fine-tuning has big
disadvantages. It is always more pleasant to make discretionary tax cuts
than discretionary increases, which is why such cuts are the fastest
possible route from cyclical to structural deficits. Such cuts have, in the
past, nearly always been mistimed. Fine-tuning also undermines the ability
of the fiscal system to provide a stable structure of incentives. And, quite
apart from these permanent disadvantages of fine-tuning, there is the
immediate difficulty that the present recession has not yet done its work.
Yet cuts in taxes can be defended. The best approach, however, would be to
focus them on the aim of limiting the long-term costs imposed by the
disinflationary recession. The objective should be to maintain investment,
perhaps through temporary investment allowances.
The case for cuts in the basic rate of income tax is political. But that
policy might not even buy the election. It would certainly be irrelevant to
the UK's principal macroeconomic task: that of lowering inflation to below
Europe's best level. The UK has a chance of achieving this aim right now. It
is unlikely to get another one for a long time.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is intentionally jeopardising the ability of local
authorities to collect unpaid poll tax for short-term political advantage,
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, said yesterday.
In a fierce attack on Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, he
said the government's refusal to negotiate swift legislation to close the
legal loophole over computer-based evidence on those who had not paid poll
tax was a 'dereliction of duty'.
Labour has offered to help through a short bill to remedy the legal
difficulty. Yesterday Mr Gould received a letter from Mr Heseltine rejecting
the offer and saying the matter would be resolved in a new clause in the
council tax bill.
Mr Gould said Mr Heseltine, the 'most ruthless and unprincipled' politician,
had made his decision in order to blame Labour for surcharges that were
certain to be added to poll tax bills for the additional costs incurred by
non-payment or delayed payments. He said figures released recently by the
Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy confirmed Labour's
claims that final poll tax bills for 1992-93 would near Pounds 300 and not
the Pounds 257 originally claimed by the government.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Mortgage applications rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE applications to Halifax Building Society jumped 50 per cent in the
seven days after its mortgage-rate reduction last week, the society said
yesterday. Halifax said the increased buyer activity had been sustained this
week, but added: 'We are cautious because this is a very short run for us to
be able to predict that the housing market is on the turn.'
Barclays, the largest UK bank, yesterday cut its mortgage interest rate by
0.56 percentage points to 10.99 per cent (11.6 APR) with immediate effect
for new applicants. Existing customers will have their rates reviewed after
the Budget on March 10.
The cut brings Barclays level with the large building societies, and other
banks such as Abbey National, National Westminster and TSB which have
already reduced their mortgage rates. Barclays is also offering mortgages at
10.6 per cent, fixed for three or five years.
The cut in mortgage rates is seen as the final factor - combined with
discounts for first-time buyers, falling house prices and the ending of
stamp duty on house purchases under Pounds 250,000 until August - which may
have stimulated the market.
Mortgage applications are running at January 1990 levels, higher than the
brief upturn seen last January.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Croydon goes from boom to blackspot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROYDON, the south London area that reaped the rewards of the 1980s boom
years, has become the national blackspot for house repossessions, according
to statistics issued by the Lord Chancellor's Department this week.
Croydon County Court issued 2,306 repossession orders last year, the highest
figure in England and a rise of more than 1,000 on 1990.
Direct comparisons with other areas are distorted because Croydon County
Court has a larger area under its jurisdiction than many county courts,
extending beyond the borough boundaries. Housing professionals in the area,
however, acknowledge that Croydon has a particular difficulty.
In the mid 1980s it was a magnet for businesses relocating outside central
London and for first-time home buyers seeking affordable homes within
commuting distance of the City. In 1988 a local chamber of commerce survey
discovered that businesses in Croydon needed 35,000 people to fill planned
or actual job vacancies.
Now the borough has an unemployment rate of 8 per cent. Last year the
borough council registered 1,400 homeless families as in priority need of
local-authority housing. Of those families, 610 were made homeless through
repossession, compared with 80 in 1988.
Three main factors may explain why Croydon has been worse affected than the
rest of the south-east: comparatively low property prices; local employment
biased towards the depressed financial and retail sectors; and many small
businesses set up with loans secured on property.
Mr Dave Brown, Croydon council's assistant director of housing, said: 'I
suspect it is to do with the fact that house prices are relatively low and
therefore it was an area where people who were able to get into
owner-occupation bought.' When mortgage payments became too much, first-time
buyers were unable to sell and trade down because they had already bought
the cheapest available property, he said.
Mr Peter Broderick, chief executive of Croydon chamber of commerce and
industry, said: 'Almost every company in Croydon has looked again at its
manpower levels and has shed staff. We don't expect all the jobs which have
gone to be replaced when things get better.'

NISSAN UK chairman Mr Octav Botnar, for whom the Inland Revenue issued an
arrest warrant earlier this week, intends to 'return to the UK shortly',
according to the company.
It said Mr Botnar had been away on holiday in Switzerland since before
Christmas.
Nissan UK, the former importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles in
Britain, said it denied 'absolutely' that the company or its directors had
at any time defrauded the Inland Revenue.
It said that its record as a payer of tax over many years was 'there for
anyone to see'.
Mr Botnar was named at Teesside magistrates court on Thursday in charges
brought against Mr Tore Arne Thorsen, manager of Scansiris AS, a Norwegian
freight transport company, alleging a corporation tax fraud in which Nissan
UK pre-tax profits had been understated by Pounds 100m.
Mr Michael Hunt, Nissan UK assistant managing director and a large
shareholder in the company, and Mr Frank Shannon, a former Nissan UK finance
director, appeared at Worthing magistrates' court on Thursday, also charged
with alleged corporation tax fraud.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Prestwick airport sale nears agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the former British Airports Authority, is close to reaching an
agreement with British Aerospace on the sale of Prestwick airport in western
Scotland.
A purchase by BAe would secure the future of the runway, which it needs for
aircraft-manufacturing operations at the airport.
The Ayrshire Community Airport Project (Acap), a consortium representing
Ayrshire businesses and local authorities, is also involved in the
negotiations. It is understood that BAe would hand over the running of the
airport to Acap, which is chaired by Mr George Younger, Tory MP for Ayr.
A third bidder for the airport, AAP, appears to be out of the running.
Earlier this month the company, headed by Mr Peter Kaye, a businessman with
aviation interests based in Scotland, made a cash offer of Pounds 4.75m for
the airport.
Prestwick has suffered a sharp fall in traffic since March 1990, when the
government ended its monopoly on long-haul flights from Scotland and
airlines switched operations to Glasgow. The airport made an operating loss
of Pounds 4.8m in the year to March 1991 and BAA last year said it was
willing to dispose of Prestwick. An article in the FT of January 15 entitled
'BAA is urged to accept bid for Prestwick' ended with the words: 'BAA said
it had received the AAP bid, adding that they had failed to reach agreement
last August because AAP could not meet guarantees.'
Both BAA and AAP wish to make clear that this statement is incorrect and at
no time has AAP failed to meet a guarantee in connection with the Prestwick
negotiations. BAA had no intention to impugn the financial standing of AAP
or its directors, Mr Peter M. Kaye and Dr Gordon Watson.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Gourmands go on short rations: Andrew Bolger finds that when
the City has to tighten its belt restaurateurs feel the pinch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION is threatening one of the City of London's most hallowed
traditions - the expensive expense-account lunch.
A decline in demand for upmarket business lunches has forced the Pelican
Group to change the format of its restaurant in Hays Galleria, between
London Bridge and Tower Bridge.
Pelican said: 'The days of spending Pounds 30 to Pounds 40 a head on lunch -
or even Pounds 25 to Pounds 30 - may not have gone away forever, but they
will certainly not return for some time.
'Our trade is dependent on the business climate on the south side of the
river, and two or three large corporate clients in this area are
experiencing difficulties.
Pelican will convert the Hays Galleria restaurant into a brasserie, where
customers can opt for just a coffee or a drink. Its other brasserie outlets
in London are enjoying sales 17 per cent higher than last year, as customers
trade down from more expensive restaurants.
Things are less gloomy at the top end of the market. The Savoy Hotel said
business remained brisk in its River Room and Grill Room restaurants -
favoured venues for power lunches.
Even there, the impact of recession has not gone un-noticed. The Savoy said:
'People are much less likely to have three glasses of armagnac after lunch,
as they might have done two or three years ago. They are drinking less
anyway, but customers are more inclined to order house wine than they used
to be.'
Trade is 'noticeably down on last year' at Sweetings, a privately owned City
institution famous for its fish - and puddings like cook never used to make
them at prep school.
Sweetings said: 'We are surviving - a lot of people aren't. We are seeing
both fewer people and regular customers less often. People we used to see
twice a week now just come in once, or once a fortnight.
'Others who do come in are spending less. Expense accounts are being cut
back. People are not drinking as much - a lot of people come in and just
have a soft drink.'
Direct marketing methods have been adopted by Corney &amp; Barrow, which owns a
chain of restaurants and champagne bars across the City. Its Cannon Street
branch (set menu Pounds 14.95 a head) has recently been emblazoned with a
poster reading: 'Steak sandwich only Pounds 2.95 - for a limited period
only.'
Balls Brothers, which also owns a chain of City wine bars, eschews such
tactics: 'We decided not go to down the Ratners route of trying to be the
cheapest in the high street. We are very conscious of our prices, but we
have not been trying 'happy hours' or special offers.'
Mr Richard Balls, managing director, said: 'The luxury end of trade has died
out. People are no longer drinking Krug champagne and eating salmon
sandwiches, as they were two years ago.'
The company was still seeing good, steady trade in its wine bars, with
average spending of Pounds 8 to Pounds 12 a head. 'Customers are not trading
right down to the most basic house wines, but are definitely tending to
choose bottles from the bottom end of the list.'
Fixed-price menus have proved a lifeline for some restaurants. The Cotillion
in Walbrook started offering a three-course lunch for Pounds 19.95 last
summer, and this month reduces that to Pounds 17.50 in an effort to increase
trade.
Mr Pierre le Fur, manager of the Cotillion, said: 'Most people choose the
set-price menu. Even big brokers like BZW and Smith New Court do not like to
be presented with a big bill.'
Le Poulbot, the Roux brothers' establishment on Cheapside, has always
offered a three-course set menu, which currently costs Pounds 31.50 a head.
It is being kept 'fairly busy, apart from Mondays'.
Le Poulbot said: 'On the whole we are filling up, but with parties of two or
three, not fours and fives. People tend to limit themselves to one bottle of
wine, whether there are two or four.'
Novelty can also be a draw. Sir Terence Conran's restaurant at Butler's
Wharf, Le Pont de la Tour, opened in September and is fully booked for
lunch, with a set menu at Pounds 21.50 a head.
Sandwiches are a cheaper alternative to eating out, but even here the
recession has bitten deep. Mr Robin Birley, who runs a chain of six sandwich
shops in the City, said trade was down 15 per cent to 20 per cent on last
year.
The amount spent remained about Pounds 3.50 a head but the number of
customers was markedly down. 'Banks have moved from the area served by our
Cannon Street shop into developments like Broadgate,' Mr Birley said. 'We
have moved into Canary Wharf, which has been a big success.'
The group's delivery service to companies is down by about 25 per cent and
Mr Birley believes the City has suffered even more than the West End.
He said: 'There was such a colossal boom that the scaling back will go on
for some time. The City has sobered up. We will probably never see a return
to the go-go days of a few years ago, when buildings were packed with
incredibly well-paid traders and brokers.'
The whole notion of belt-tightening in the City is relative, however.
Sweetings, where lunch averages Pounds 20 to Pounds 25 a head, said: 'It's
still pretty reasonable. We don't do vintage champagne - the dearest is
Pounds 30 a bottle.'

FT  01 FEB 92 / North-west pit closure will cost 620 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal announced the loss of 620 jobs yesterday with the closure of
its 115-year old Bickershaw colliery in Lancashire, which has been losing
money for the past six years.
The announcement came as Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, and Mr Michael
Howard, the employment secretary, both used speeches in Manchester to give
radically different perspectives on the outlook for the economy and jobs.
Mr Kinnock told prospective Labour candidates that employment in the
north-west of England had fallen by 200,000 since 1979 - the worst drop for
any region in Britain.
His attack was backed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, and Mr
Henry Macleish, the shadow employment minister, who said 2.4m manufacturing
jobs had been lost since June 1979.
Mr Howard, at a business lunch at Manchester airport, warned that Labour's
minimum wage policy, payroll tax and backing for the European Community's
Social Action programme would cost 240,000 jobs in the north-west region
alone.
'The north-west will say no to Labour's jobs destruction package,' he
claimed.
Meanwhile at British Coal, Mr Terry Wheatley, group director, said: 'In view
of the continuing failure to achieve production targets, potential
geological problems affecting one of the coal faces and limited reserves
remaining in seams of proven saleable quality, I see no viable future for
the complex.'
The move follows the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in the Yorkshire area last
week, with four pit closures, and the announcement of 200 redundancies at
the Trentham colliery in Staffordshire on Thursday.
British Coal said its Hatfield colliery in Doncaster, which employs 437
people and has been under review since October, would stay open after it
increased output.
Critics say the spate of redundancies at British Coal is being announced
ahead of a March deadline for employees opting for voluntary redundancy to
receive a top-up payment of Pounds 10,000.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said: 'When this top-up payment
was announced, we said it would lead to 10 pit closures and we've had four
up to now.'
The Bickershaw colliery has lost Pounds 35m in the past six years, including
Pounds 11m since April. Mr Wheatley said the pit needed to produce 12,000 to
15,000 tonnes of coal a week if it was to meet targets, but had not reached
them. He said there would be no compulsory redundancies.
The Hatfield colliery was reprieved after it reduced losses of Pounds 8m to
less than Pounds 5m. Granada Television is to cut as many as 100 jobs
because of rising costs. Between 50 and 60 redundancies are expected, with
temporary contracts not being renewed. The company successfully bid Pounds
9m a year for its north-west of England franchise, but also has to pay 11
per cent of its net advertising revenue to the Treasury.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Strikers picket British Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exhibition of solidarity: strikers picketed the British Museum yesterday as
civil servants in London stopped work for a day, Michael Smith writes. The
museum and the Tate Gallery were closed to the public, and a picket was
mounted outside Downing Street.
The two largest Civil Service unions claimed that at least half of their
members in the capital staged a one-day strike in a dispute over London
weighting allowances. Government departments dismissed the claim, saying
most offices were open, although some provided restricted services. The
Department of Employment said less than a quarter of its 7,200 London staff
obeyed the strike call by the NUCPS and CPSA unions. Sixteen out of 167 of
its offices were closed to the public. The closures included two Jobcentres.
Customs and Excise said 1,357 of its London staff, representing 18 per cent
of the full complement, went on strike. It had to put an 'honesty box' for
passengers at Heathrow airport's terminal 4, but most passengers elsewhere
were subjected to normal checks.
The unions said they would seek a meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, to begin 'serious negotiations' on the Treasury's refusal to
raise weighting allowances. The allowances, last raised four years ago, are
Pounds 1,750 for working in central London, Pounds 1,000 for five miles to
10 miles from the centre and Pounds 725 for 10 miles to 18 miles out. They
are lower than for most other workers, but the Treasury says it has improved
basic pay substantially for many staff and has introduced local pay
additions for jobs with recruitment and retention difficulties.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Labour moves to head-off 'smears'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR last night moved to confront alleged attempts to undermine Mr Neil
Kinnock, the party leader, and its election campaign by pro-Conservative
newspapers.
In a highly unusual step Mr David Hill, the party's communications director,
held an on-the-record briefing to disparage an as yet unpublished Sunday
Times report on Mr Kinnock's connections with the Soviet embassy in the
early 1980s.
He said he had taken the action to head-off a growing campaign of attacks.
Mr Hill claimed that the report, to be published tomorrow, was the latest in
a series of attempts to 'smear Neil Kinnock and destabilise the Labour
party'.
Inquiries by Labour officials concluded that the report centres on documents
sent by the Soviet embassy to the Communist party Central Committee in
Moscow dealing with meetings between diplomats and the Labour leadership.
Mr Hill said he wanted to draw advance attention to the story and efforts by
Sun reporters to investigate Mr Kinnock's early life in Wales.
He said it had been decided that in the period up to the general election
attempts at character assassination would not pass unchallenged.
Mr Hill went on to say that nothing had occurred in meetings between Mr
Kinnock or other Labour leaders with Soviet ambassadors dating back to the
1970s that could damage the party.
'I do not believe there is anything that Neil Kinnock can have said that
will be of embarrassment,' he said.
Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, said that this story was 'more
fascinating than damaging', refuting that there was any element of a smear.
He said that the story centred on comprehensive diplomatic traffic from
Soviet ambassadors in London to Moscow on conversations held with Labour
leaders including Mr Kinnock and Mr Michael Foot. It also contained Mr
Kinnock's views on Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of
Mineworkers, during the year-long miners' strike, and those of Mr Scargill
on Mr Kinnock.

<TEXT>
A BILL to establish a powerful disablement commission failed in the Commons
yesterday, in spite of support from MPs of all parties.
The Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, piloted by Mr Alf Morris, MP for
Wythenshawe and a former Labour minister for the disabled, failed to win a
second reading when the debate ran out of time after an hour and 55 minutes
when the House finished for business.
A closure vote, necessary to move the bill on, was turned down as the debate
had lasted less than two hours. A vote on whether to give the bill a second
reading could not be taken automatically as an MP - Mr Robert Hayward, Tory
member for Kingswood - was still speaking.
Furious opposition MPs rounded on Mr Hayward, charging him with
dishonourable conduct. He had said he would not talk the bill out. The
bill's effective death knell had been sounded earlier when Mr Nicholas
Scott, social security minister, withheld government backing, saying he
remained 'benevolently neutral'.
Mr Paul Boateng, Labour MP for Brent South, said the government's neutrality
amounted to 'the kiss of death'. A bill permitting nurses, midwives and
health visitors to prescribe certain drugs without doctors' approval won a
second reading yesterday.

THE High Court yesterday rejected an appeal against the government's
approval of the conversion of London's County Hall into a hotel, residential
and conference complex.
Lambeth Borough Council's appeal opposed the change of use of County Hall,
which housed the now abolished Greater London Council. It said that Mr
Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, had a duty to preserve the Grade
II listed building in its historic local-government role.
Mr Justice Pill said there was nothing unreasonable about Mr Heseltine's
standpoint. He ordered Lambeth to pay the costs of Mr Heseltine; the London
Residuary Body, which proposed the development; and the County Hall
Development Group, an Anglo-Japanese consortium which is in liquidation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL privatisation may lead to higher government grants as long as the
service is improved, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, said last
night. Lines and services, far from being axed by private enterprise, would
be expanded to attract traffic from overcrowded roads.
Mr Rifkind said on BBC2's Newsnight: 'I frankly don't mind if at the end of
the day it costs us more money, if it also means that we get a better
quality of service for those who use our railways.'
The whole purpose of government policy was not to maintain the railway lines
but to increase the number of railway services available.
Mr Rifkind's comments came in spite of the Treasury's long-standing
opposition to spending more on the railways and after a long period of open
disagreement between cabinet ministers about how the privatisation should be
handled.
A white paper on the BR sale, which is set to be a central part of the
Conservative party's election manifesto, has been repeatedly delayed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday hailed the future role of the United Nations in
preventive diplomacy, as the security council approved new commitments on
non-proliferation.
The British prime minister also stepped up the pressure for help for the
Russian economy, making it clear that in his view significant financial
assistance would be needed.
Mr Major said the UK and the US believed that Russian membership of the
International Monetary Fund should come about as soon as possible,
preferably before April, as the necessary preliminary to giving the Russians
access to advice and financial assistance.
He highlighted the need for a tougher stance on preventing the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, as he announced that the UK would strengthen
its own controls on materials that could be exported and used in biological
warfare.
The change, which will require legislation, will recast in specific terms of

The UK team expressed particular satisfaction that the commitment in the
security council declaration to members working to prevent the spread of
technology related to nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
They also welcomed the commitment to take action if notified that
non-proliferation safeguards had been violated, and a renewed emphasis on
human rights, including the ending of apartheid.
Speaking after the meeting, Mr Major emphasised that while the declaration
was couched in diplomatic language it contained 'a hard cutting edge', which
would enable it to be used effectively against those who failed in their
obligations.
'We need to be more active in crisis prevention,' Mr Major said. 'That is
just as important - if not more so - than perfecting our skills at crisis
management.'
In his closing speech, Mr Major warned that the world should not forget 'we
need economic development and prosperity in order to achieve lasting peace
and stability'.

THE Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) said one man was killed outside the
Attaquwa mosque, near Bab El-Oued mosque yesterday after security forces
sealed off the area on the chief weekly prayer day, agencies report from
Algiers.
At least eight people were wounded, including three by the mosque of Algiers
university.
The security force action marked a further crackdown on the Islamic movement
that three weeks ago was on the brink of winning power.
Ambulance sirens could be heard in the streets of the Bab El-Oued
neighbourhood, which is a bastion of support for the (FIS). The Front has
been defying a crackdown on its demands for an Islamic state.
Police also reported that a home-made bomb was thrown into the garden of the
US embassy on Thursday, causing minor damage but no injuries. There was no
indication who staged the attack.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Habash detention causes political crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE hospitalisation in Paris of Mr George Habash, leader of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), has precipitated a political
crisis almost bound to inflict grave domestic political damage on France's
socialist government.
Last night, doctors appointed by a French judge ruled Mr Habash was
medically unfit to be questioned on terrorism investigations.
A justice ministry official said earlier that an aircraft was standing by to
fly Mr Habash out of France early today in the event of such a ruling.
The Palestinian leader's presence created serious diplomatic embarrassment
for France, between the indignant protests from Israel and the Jewish
community in France, that he should ever have been admitted, and the
swelling chorus of Arab demands that Mr Habash should be freely allowed to
leave.
The Damascus-based PFLP yesterday demanded the release of its ailing leader,
while Tunisia and Algeria both offered to receive him.
On Thursday night, immediately on his return from a official visit to Oman,
President Mitterrand moved rapidly to pre-empt the emerging wave of
protests, by securing the resignation of a close adviser and three very
senior officials in the foreign and interior ministries, who were implicitly
held responsible for admitting Mr Habash without political authority. In
addition, Mr Habash was placed under arrest in his hospital room at the
request of the French counter-intelligence service.
He had been expected to be interviewed by Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere,
France's leading anti-terrorist investigating magistrate, once his medical
examination was completed.
Mr Habash, 64, was refusing to co-operate with police at the Red Cross
hospital. His wife, Helda, said she had refused to allow medical professors
appointed by the judge to examine her husband. She denied PLO reports that
he had suffered a stroke and said he had come to Paris for a routine
check-up.
According to Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, social affairs minister, no-one at a
senior level of government was informed of the arrival of Mr Habash until
his aircraft was about to land. But the curious fact is that the French Red
Cross claims to have requested authorisation for the admission of Mr Habash
on Monday, before Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister departed with
President Mitterrand for Oman.
Conservative opposition parties have refused to be satisfied by the
resignations of the officials, whom they describe as scapegoats, and have
demanded instead the resignations of Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, and
Mr Philippe Marchand, interior minister.
Dr Habash, the 64-year-old PFLP veteran is a member of the PLO's leadership,
and is respected throughout the organisation. A founder of the Arab
nationalist movement, Dr Habash has assumed the role of leader of the 'loyal
opposition' to Mr Yassir Arafat within the PLO.
Until the early 1970s, Mr Habash was closely associated with the late Mr
Wadi Haddad, who was the mastermind of a series of spectacular terrorist
coups, including plane hijackings. Mr Habash broke with Mr Haddad over
indiscriminate terrorism against western targets after a rash of hijackings
to Jordan in September 1970 helped fuel the civil war.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Tees &amp; Hartlepool port chief leaves job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN HACKNEY, chief executive of Tees &amp; Hartlepool port, yesterday
cleared his desk after accepting defeat in the acrimonious battle over the
port's privatisation.
In a letter to the authority's workforce, Mr Hackney said that he and the
rest of the management-employee buy-out team had abandoned their plan to
seek a judicial review of the government's decision to sell the port to a
consortium called Teesside Holdings.
'Having analysed the situation carefully, my colleagues and I, together with
our financial backers, have concluded that a challenge is no longer a
practical proposition,' he said.
Mr Hackney's departure - along with that of Mr Charles Wellington, company
secretary - came as Teesside Holdings formally completed the purchase of the
port and sent in its own chief executive, Mr John Holloway. The company
refused to discuss on what terms Mr Hackney had left.
Teesside Holdings is a three-way venture between Powell Duffryn, the quoted
industrial group; Humberside Holdings, an unquoted associate of Powell
Duffryn; and 3i, the venture capital group.
The selection of the consortium brought strong protests because it was
neither the highest bidder nor the one offering the greatest degree of
employee participation.
Maritime Transport Services, the Thamesport container terminal operator that
bid for the port, said the outcome had led it to question its involvement in
bidding for any of the other 14 trust ports due for privatisation.
Mr Stuart Bell, Labour MP for Middlesbrough and an outspoken critic of the
result, has won an adjournment debate on the issue for Wednesday.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Passengers wave goodbye to many ferry destinations / A look
at services facing closure because of the Channel tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITY THE people down the road who did the trendy thing and bought a weekend
retreat in Normandy. By now, they must be wondering how they are ever going
to reach it.
It was bad enough when, at the end of last month, Sealink Stena Line axed
the ferry service that had linked Folkestone with Boulogne for 148 years.
Then, in the course of the last fortnight, two further blows have rained
down on cross-Channel ferry users. Societe Nouvelle d'Armement Transmanche
(Snat), Sealink's French partner, has said it plans to axe all services
between Newhaven and Dieppe, and P&amp;O has asked the Office of Fair Trading to
permit a rationalisation of services on the remaining short sea routes.
One implication of the P&amp;O announcement is that there might be a limited
future for its Dover-Boulogne route. But the big ferry operators doubt the
long-term viability of Sally Line's operations between Ramsgate and Dunkirk,
although the ferry company believes it has a niche market for people
preferring a relaxed 2 1/2 -hour crossing over the rushed 1 1/4 -hour
Dover-Calais one.
Ferry users are therefore confronted with the possibility of a sharp
diminution in the range of French destinations. Unless someone comes forward
to save the Newhaven-Dieppe route, the only surviving car ferry route east
of Portsmouth-Le Havre may eventually be Dover-Calais.
There is a simple three-word explanation for this gloomy prognosis: the
Channel tunnel.
It had always been likely that the tunnel would have a drastic effect on
cross-Channel ferries. Now, with less than a year and a half to the tunnel's
planned opening, the effects have suddenly begun to show.
The greatest threat is to the services closest to the tunnel's
Folkestone-Calais alignment. Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, reckons it
will take 90 per cent of the foot passengers, 70 per cent of the cars and 40
per cent of the lorries from the ferries' nearby routes.
The ferry operators disagree. Even by their estimates, though, they stand to
lose 80 per cent of foot passengers, 50 per cent of cars and 25 per cent of
lorries. Rationalisation is clearly inevitable.
The big operators, Sealink and P&amp;O, believe their best hope of surviving is
to concentrate resources on the shortest and busiest sea route -
Dover-Calais. That way they should be able to retain enough traffic to fill
about half a dozen jumbo ferries going to and fro. That will give them a
cost base low enough to match the tunnel on price.
To do so, they also need to merge their operations. If the Office of Fair
Trading agrees - and it probably will - the result will be a single ferry
service operating at, say, 30-minute intervals between Dover and Calais,
with motorists simply turning up and boarding the next vessel in much the
same way as they will with the Channel tunnel rail shuttles.
The Folkestone-Boulogne route has already closed in anticipation of that
process. So too, with less fuss, has P&amp;O's Dover-Zeebrugge service.
One wild card in the pack is Hoverspeed, with its fleet of hovercraft and
SeaCat catamarans. It has announced plans to resume a Folkestone-Boulogne
service in April alongside its existing Dover-Calais and Dover-Boulogne
operations.
Doubts remain over whether those will long survive the tunnel either. The
ageing hovercraft are expensive to run and the new SeaCats have shown
themselves to be embarrassingly susceptible to poor weather. With neither
the speed of the tunnel nor the comfort and amenities of the ferries, they
look in danger of being squeezed between the two.
On a more positive note, the longer crossings on the western Channel routes
from Plymouth, Poole, Southampton and Portsmouth look relatively secure. Far
enough away from the tunnel to escape the worst of the competition, they are
benefiting from the growth in popularity of independent motoring holidays.
Then there is the tunnel itself. Even if travellers do not take advantage of
a method of crossing the Channel that is speedier and less prone to bad
weather, will they be able to look forward to the effect of competition on
price?
Probably not. So great are Eurotunnel's debts that it cannot afford to
embark on a price war; and in the event that it did, it is unlikely that the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission would stand by and see the tunnel's only
competitors put out of business. Conversely, the ferries dare not drive the
tunnel into bankruptcy for fear that someone would pick it up debt-free from
the receivers.
Ominously, the ferry companies are saying they will charge the same as
Eurotunnel, while Eurotunnel says it will charge the same as the ferries.
As the ferries are unlikely to charge less than they do already, a crossing
of the Channel - whether under or over - seems destined to remain one of the
world's more costly adventures.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Public services spending hits record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID rise of Mr John Major to prime minister has coincided with
government spending on services jumping to record levels, according to
Treasury figures published yesterday.
The statistical supplement to November's Autumn Statement shows that
combined spending by central and local government on health, education and
science, social security and transport is running at record levels, adjusted
for inflation, in this financial year.
The figures - presented as 'general government spending by function' for the
first time - also show that real spending on law and order, environmental
services and arts and libraries will reach new highs in 1991-92.
Overall spending on services by central and local government last fell in
real terms in 1988-89, when it declined by 2.3 per cent compared with
1987-88.
At that time Mr Major was chief secretary to the Treasury in charge of
public spending. His subsequent career - with a short spell as foreign
secretary, followed by his time as chancellor and prime minister - has been
accompanied by a 9.3 per cent inflation-adjusted jump in spending on
services by central and local government to an estimated Pounds 218.6bn in
this financial year.
The statistical supplement confirms that spending on social security will
jump sharply this year to Pounds 69.3bn in nominal terms, from Pounds 58.8bn
in 1990-91. That is largely because the recession has pushed up unemployment
and income-support payments.
By combining the data for spending by central government and local
authorities, the supplement gives the first clear picture of overall
spending on education and science. It will total Pounds 31bn in 1991-92  -
nearly as much as the Pounds 31.4bn allocated to health.
The Treasury's figures show that residents of Northern Ireland, Scotland and
Wales receive more in public spending than those in England. General
government expenditure per head in Northern Ireland was Pounds 3,842 in
1990-91, against Pounds 2,964 in Wales, Pounds 2,586 in England and the UK
average of Pounds 2,694.
In Scotland, where a recent opinion poll showed 50 per cent of voters
favouring independence, government expenditure was Pounds 3,196 a head.
Scotland accounted for 11 per cent of government spending while its share of
gross domestic product was 8.2 per cent.
The report also illustrates how government spending priorities have changed
since Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first government took office in 1979.
The Pounds 5.59bn spent on housing this year will be 55 per cent less in
real terms than in 1979-80. Perhaps more surprising, the Pounds 2.8bn
allocated for public spending on employment and training this year will be
42 per cent less in real terms than in 1986-87, when expenditure on such
items peaked.
The government has made only very small revisions to the public spending
totals fixed for 1991-92 and subsequent years in the Autumn Statement.
This year's general government expenditure (GGE) total is now estimated at
Pounds 236.4bn, up Pounds 300m on November's figure, while Pounds 100m has
been added to GGE estimates for each of the following three financial years.

JAPAN yesterday called for changes in the functions and composition of the
UN Security Council to reflect 'the realities of the new era'.
However, in a speech to the Council's summit session, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the Japanese prime minister, stopped short of formally pressing for a
permanent seat for Japan.
He said it was necessary for the UN to evolve, while adapting to a changing
world, and get away from concepts that pre-dated even the Cold War and were
based on the world of 1945 when the organisation was founded.
Mr Miyazawa promised he would do his utmost to ensure the the approval of
legislation on constitutional change necessary to permit Japanese troops to
join international peace-keeping operations.
Japan is expected to be asked to provide at least 20 per cent of an
estimated Dollars 1bn budget for planned UN operations in Cambodia.
Mr Masamichi Hamabusa, the prime minister's spokesman, told reporters
outside the council chamber that Japan aimed to obtain permanent membership
by 1995, the UN's 50th anniversary.
It became a two-year member this year for the seventh time - a record for an
elected state.
The spokesman noted that Japan's 12.5 per cent assessed share of the UN
budget was more than the combined total for Britain and France, which are
among the present five permanent veto-holding members.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS Yeltsin made all the right noises on his international debut
yesterday.
He spoke of making democracy irreversible; he promised a new Russian
diplomacy; and he unveiled an ambitious if vague proposal for a new global
space-based anti-missile system conditional on co-operation with the US.
'We do not want to be mere partners, we want to be allies,' he said.
The Russian president has been speaking this language all week, starting
with his visit to London. But in the forum of the United Nations Security
Council, his words took on special significance.
Just 30 years ago, Nikita Khrushchev banged his shoe on a rostrum at the UN,
an enduring image of the cold war rivalry between the US and the (then)
super power, the Soviet Union.
The UN Security Council meeting yesterday marked a turning point. An attempt
by the great powers to begin creating a new world order from communism's
collapse.
Mr Yeltsin pledged that a new democratic Russia would play a full role in
this joint effort, based on collective security. He pointedly drew a
difference between pre- and post-communist Russia and the totalitarian
Soviet Union. This was his best effort to date at convincing an audience of
world leaders of his country's (and his own) democratic credentials.
The script was flawless. He pledged to enshrine human rights protection in
law, to respect the primacy of democracy and to create new political and
legal institutions to make the process irreversible. 'There is now a real
chance to put an end to despotism,' he said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LI PENG, China's hard-line premier largely blamed for the bloody 1989
crackdown on the democracy movement, insisted in the UN last night that
human rights were a national matter not subject to external criteria.
Addressing the Security Council at its summit meeting, he said China valued
human rights and was ready to discuss them and co-operate with other states,
'while reserving differences'. China opposed interference in internal
affairs 'using human rights as an excuse'.
President George Bush arranged a meeting with Li in New York last night,
ignoring sharp criticism by members of the Congress and others who said he
ought first to have demanded Chinese concessions on human rights and other
issues.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, had said earlier that the US intended
to press China to fulfill commitments to curb exports of missile technology.
Mr Bush would be seeking a letter confirming China's pledge to sign the
non-proliferation treaty and observe the guidelines of the missile
technology control regime (MCTR).
Chinese officials have said they will abide by provision of the MTCR but
only if the Bush administration lifts sanctions on the sale of American
satellite parts and high speed computers. These sanctions were imposed last
spring after the US learned that China had secretly delivered launchers for
M-11 missiles to Pakistan.

Passenger load factor - how full the aircraft were on international

On Thursday, the Association of European Airlines said that its members had

FT  01 FEB 92 / Quayle ushers in freeze on regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration has launched its 90-day freeze on new federal
regulations by calling on business groups to denounce the rules they find
particularly burdensome.
Vice-president Dan Quayle, who heads the Competitiveness Council - the
administration's deregulation task force - said government agencies would
use the 90-day moratorium to get rid of burdensome rules and set up
'pro-growth' rules.
Federal regulations have grown rapidly under President George Bush, drawing
complaints from business and from the right-wing of Mr Bush's own Republican
party.
The administration is now trying to use its executive powers to roll back
regulations in areas where it cannot win new legislation from the
Democrat-controlled Congress.
'I'm not going to test the courts too far, but we are trying to figure out
ways of doing as much as we can administratively,' said Mr Boyden Gray, the
White House general counsel.
Administration lawyers are even examining whether it would be legal to order
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to index capital gains to inflation, thus
circumventing Congress's reluctance to vote a cut in the capital gains tax
rate.
A recent study by Mr Thomas Hopkins of Rochester Institute of Technology
estimates the aggregate cost of existing federal regulations at between
Dollars 430bn (Pounds 237.5bn) and Dollars 562bn in 1990. Mr Hopkins says
this could rise to between Dollars 542bn and Dollars 688bn by the end of the
century.
Major regulations now under study include acid rain emission controls,
estimated to cost business Dollars 3bn a year while reducing sulphur dioxide
emissions by 10m tons; requirements for pollution monitoring devices on
light trucks, costing an estimated Dollars 1.6bn a year while cutting
176,000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 1.9m tons of carbon monoxide; and
tighter standards for clinical laboratories, producing more accurate medical
testing at an estimated cost of Dollars 1.6bn.
Mr Quayle said the administration would focus on banking, biotechnology,
energy and the environment, transport and property rights.
In the banking area, for example, the Treasury is examining adjusting the
capital adequacy rules to allow banks to count goodwill on mortgage
servicing rights and credit card relationships as capital.
The Internal Revenue Service, meanwhile, plans an overhaul of the federal
tax deposit system which it expects to save businesses up to Dollars 6bn a
year in compliance costs.

THE net outflow of capital from Japan, which flooded world financial markets
in the 1980s, last year turned into a net inflow for the first time since
1980, writes Stefan Wagstyl from Tokyo.
The current account surplus was also heavily in credit, according to
combined figures published yesterday by the Ministry of Finance.
Taken together the two surpluses could put upward pressure on the yen on
foreign currency markets. Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at the Tokyo
office of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, forecast the yen would
move towards Y110 against the US dollar against Y125 yesterday.
According to the ministry's report, a net Dollars 36.6bn (Pounds 20bn) in
long-term capital flowed into Japan in 1991, compared with a net outflow of
Dollars 43.6bn in 1990 and Dollars 136bn in 1987, the peak year.
Foreign investment by Japanese rose slightly form Dollars 120.8bn to Dollars
121.9bn, as Japanese portfolio fund managers, wary of the weakness in
Tokyo's financial markets, bought foreign bonds. Direct investment overseas
fell sharply from Dollars 48.0bn to Dollars 31.2bn, as industrial companies
cut their expansion plans.
Meanwhile, foreign investment in Japan soared to a record Dollars 158.5bn,
more than double the previous year's Dollars 77.2bn, as foreign fund
managers judged it was time to hunt bargains in the depressed Japanese stock
and bond markets.
Japan's current account surplus, bugbear of its international relations,
doubled last year to Dollars 72.6bn, due to a sharp increase in the trade
surplus.
Japan's exports rose 9.4 per cent last year to Dollars 306.6bn and imports
fell 6.2 per cent to Dollars 203.3bn. Housing starts for December, announced
by the construction ministry, fell 19.7 per cent from a year ago, declining
for the 14th consecutive month and reflecting sluggish demand, writes Emiko
Terazono.
These figures released yesterday indicated a further deceleration in
economic growth. Overall housing starts for 1991 totalled 1,370,126 units,
down 19.7 per cent year-on-year. The figure was the lowest since 1986, when
1,365,000 units were started.

FT  01 FEB 92 / CSCE adopts greater role in resolving conflicts

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S main security forum, the 48-nation Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe, yesterday agreed to give itself a more active and
effective role in preventing and resolving conflicts between member states.
After two days of talks here, CSCE foreign ministers, including 10 newcomers
from the independent states of the former Soviet Union, approved a document
providing for the despatch of more fact-finding, monitoring and conciliation
missions to flashpoint areas.
The CSCE's first action under this heading will be to send a fact-finding
mission to the disputed Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, claimed both
by Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The ministers also agreed to send fact-finding and monitoring missions to
newly democratised members in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to
ensure that these states were respecting human rights commitments.
A proposal by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, to
create CSCE peace-keeping units was backed by Italy and Czechoslovakia. But
it was opposed by the US, Britain and France, who expressed strong
reservations about any move to duplicate tasks which they considered were
the preserve of the United Nations.
However, the German proposal, together with another idea to create special
environmental defence forces - so-called 'green helmets' - will be given
another airing at the CSCE's Helsinki follow-up conference in March.
One of the most significant decisions was to amend the organisation's
consensus rule, which has been the biggest obstacle to effective action in
cases such as the Yugoslav conflict. In case of 'clear, gross and
uncorrected violations of CSCE commitments', a majority of member states
could take 'appropriate action ...if necessary in the absence of the state
concerned.'
The ministers also agreed to bolster its Vienna-based Conflict Prevention
Centre by increasing its rapporteur missions to flashpoints.
At a closing news conference, Mr Jiri Dienstbier, Czechoslovak foreign
minister, said the CSCE, to be effective, must move towards legally binding
mechanisms. 'Interference is essential if we wish to enhance human rights.'
For Mr Douglas Hogg, Britain's junior foreign minister, the ministers had
achieved 'some modest improvement' in the CSCE's effectiveness. But Mr
Genscher painted a much brighter picture: 'We will extend the CSCE process.
We will give it greater possibilities.'
The Serb-dominated Yugoslav state presidency yesterday summoned Serb leaders
from Croatia to Belgrade to try to get them to accept a United Nations plan
to deploy 10,000 peacekeepers, Laura Silber writes from Belgrade. At the
same time, Mr Borisav Jovic, Serbia's representative to the state
presidency, accused Croatia of blocking the UN initiative.

FT  01 FEB 92 / BCCI deal on claims may be signed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL under which the majority shareholders of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International would contribute up to Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) to
creditors of the failed bank could be signed within a week. This follows six
months of negotiation between Touche Ross, the failed bank's court-appointed
administrators, and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders.
Under the deal, all claims and counter-claims between the two sides would be
dropped, according to a draft of the agreement produced recently. This would
include the liquidators agreeing not to pursue Dollars 4bn of claims against
Abu Dhabi relating to promissory notes given last spring.
Other main terms are:
The remaining assets of all parts of the BCCI group would be pooled, and all
creditors would receive the same pay-out. This would prevent protracted
legal actions between liquidators of different parts of the group.
The liquidators and majority shareholders would co-operate to pursue claims
against any third parties, such as the group's auditors, and would share the
proceeds of any actions.
The deal would only come into effect if creditors owed at least Dollars 7bn
between them accepted the terms.
Meanwhile, the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders in BCCI have issued a
strenuous rebuttal of statements from Hong Kong suggesting that the
sheikhdom had not yet provided a promised guarantee against unrecorded
liabilities in the sale negotiations for BCC Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
SIR LEON Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, yesterday called for
the break-up of national telephone monopolies with the aim of reducing the
prices of ordinary calls in Europe to US levels.
The European Commission is due to review its telecommunications policy this
year. 'In my view, this will have to include giving serious consideration as
to whether there is still a justification in Community terms for continuing
to permit monopolies in the provision of voice telephony services,' Sir Leon
said, in a speech to the Spanish Employers' Confederation in Madrid.
Any move to break up monopolies in the basic call service would meet with
fierce resistance from most telecoms companies and EC member states,
especially if Sir Leon and Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the telecoms
commissioner, were to use special legal powers to force through reforms
without member states' approval.
Citing research published in the Financial Times last year, Sir Leon pointed
out that a three-minute long-distance call in Europe could cost four times
as much as a call over the same distance in the US.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Schlesinger calls for anti-inflationstance in EC: Warning
against high pay deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, called yesterday for
a tougher approach to inflation in all EC countries and warned that high pay
deals in Germany would endanger monetary stability, growth, and jobs.
Speaking in Stockholm on the day German steelworkers voted to strike for
higher pay, he said the strength of domestic demand in low-inflation
countries like Germany had led to 'intolerable inflationary trends'.
Inflation is now 4 per cent in Germany and the Bundesbank has said it wants
a return to 2 per cent, a goal which Mr Schlesinger yesterday said should be
adopted by all EC countries. The IG Metall union has claimed a 10.5 per cent
increase for steelworkers and set a 9.5 per cent ceiling for demands in the
more important engineering pay round.
Mr Schlesinger expressed concern over the inflationary risks caused by
German wage demands. 'Vigilance seems to us to be imperative in this
context'. The central bank lifted interest rates by half a point in December
as a reaction against the recent acceleration in money supply growth,
inflation, and the high pay claims.
Recent statements by Mr Schlesinger have made clear the Bundesbank will not
lower rates until it is certain that inflationary dangers have receded.
Yesterday he said: 'The Bundesbank must stick to its objective of stopping
inflationary trends.'
Noting that yields on long-term bonds had fallen to just under 8 per cent
compared with 9 per cent in mid-1990, before German currency union was
announced, he added: 'I think it is true to say that the Bundesbank has been
able to convince the markets of its determination to achieve monetary
stability.'
But he said it was important, especially after the Maastricht agreements on
economic and monetary union, that EC countries made more progress in
harmonising their economies to the standards of the best performers.
While the Bundesbank bore a particular responsibility for this, 'the joint
efforts of all the central banks of member states should, in my view, be
geared to limiting price rises in the longer run to about 2 per cent per
annum or less'. This goal, which is stricter than the Maastricht criterion,
was reached by a number of countries in the 1950s and 1980s - 'it is not
Utopian'.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Indicators fall raises US budget doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARPER than expected fall in the US index of leading indicators and lower
home sales yesterday raised fresh doubts about the Bush administration's
budget forecast of an early economic recovery.
The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators fell 0.3 per
cent last month. This followed a similar fall in November and three previous
months of stagnation. The index is regarded as a reliable guide to future
developments in the economy.
Analysts had hoped for a rise last month, partly because of a recovery in
share prices. However, the index was pulled down by falling orders for
plant, equipment and consumer goods, lack of monetary growth and rock-bottom
consumer confidence.
Sales of new homes fell 6.6 per cent last month to an annual rate of
522,000. However, the fall was less severe than it looked because figures
for November were revised up sharply. The latest estimates indicate that
home sales have been flat since last August when last summer's brief
economic recovery sputtered out.
Yesterday's figures follow reports this week of a 5 per cent drop in durable
goods orders last month and meagre economic growth at an annual rate of only
0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.
The budget predicted a sustained economic upturn starting this spring. The
latest statistics, however, are prompting growing scepticism about economic
prospects.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Thorn EMI quits electricalretailing and cuts 800 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORN EMI, the UK music and rentals group, is quitting electrical retailing,
which has lost the company about Pounds 50m over the past three years.
Its chain of about 450 Rumbelows shops, which has not made a profit since
1986-87, will be converted to rental outlets for consumer electrical goods.
About 800 head office, service and distribution jobs will go.
The shops are expected to break even once operating alongside the group's
1,000-plus other rental outlets, trading as Radio Rentals, Multibroadcast
and DER. There will then be a review of the division which could lead to 200
store closures.
The estimated cost of the changes is between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m,
which Thorn will take as an extraordinary item in its accounts for the year
to March.
Thorn had been trying to sell Rumbelows for about three years. The
electrical retail market contracted by 8 per cent in 1990-91 alone and is
one of the high street areas worst affected by the recession. Rumbelows'
market share of 6 per cent puts it behind Dixons, which includes Currys;
electricity board shops and Comet, owned by Kingfisher.
Mr Charles Nichols, stores analyst at stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said
Rumbelows' departure represented the first big shake-out in a sector
suffering from over-capacity after strong expansion in the 1980s.
Thorn said it was possible that Rumbelows' sister chain, Atlantis, would be
sold. The 45 out-of-town stores have a turnover of about Pounds 80m.
Yesterday's announcement added to the interest already being shown by
potential buyers.
Last year the rentals division, with 53 per cent of its Pounds 1.01bn sales
overseas, made a Pounds 138m operating profit. This was, however, 26 per
cent down on the previous year and Thorn admits that the UK rental market -
which it claims to lead with a 55 per cent share - is declining.
To counteract this, it said: 'We will test out in the Rumbelows shops the
sort of options offered overseas. On the Continent and in the US, we give
customers the option to buy during the rental period.'
Ms Jane Anscombe, leisure analyst at stockbroker Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
said Thorn was 'making the best of a bad job' with Rumbelows. The
elimination of losses led her to revise her group pre-tax profit forecast
for 1992-93 upwards from Pounds 300m to Pounds 310m.
Thorn's balance sheet will be little affected. Last March, the ratio of net
debt to net assets stood at 44 per cent on borrowings of Pounds 394.2m. By
this March, gearing is expected to fall below 40 per cent.
To allay the fears of football fans, the group has promised to continue its
sponsorship of the Rumbelows League Cup.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Wace chief blames IRA rumours for decision to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN CLEGG, the young businessman who built Wace Group into the world's
largest pre-press printing specialist, resigned yesterday as chief
executive, blaming rumours which continued to link the UK-based company with
the Irish Republican Army.
Security sources said the alleged links between Mr Clegg and the IRA were
the subject of an investigation by the Royal Ulster Constabulary last year.
No evidence was uncovered of any such links, however, and no investigation
into such links is pending.
The original investigation is understood to have followed a high-level
meeting last June which was attended by a senior officer from the RUC's C13
anti-racketeering unit and officials from the Bank of England, the Stock
Exchange and the Serious Fraud Office.
The secret meeting at the Stock Exchange was held to discuss suspicions that
individuals connected with Wace had links to the IRA. A large dossier on
share transactions is understood to have been presented but enthusiasm for
an investigation is believed to have been muted.
The SFO declined to take on the investigation which had involved scrutiny of
millions of pounds of unusual share transactions. Police in Sheffield and
the RUC did pursue the matter but it was later shelved when no evidence of
connections to the IRA could be found.
Mr Clegg, 33, stepped down even although Wace had denied on Monday that it
was the unnamed listed UK company which The Sunday Telegraph said this week
was under investigation for laundering funds for the terrorist organisation.
Wace's shares fell from 168p to 104p after yesterday's announcement.
Mr Brian Dudley, Wace's managing director, said Mr Clegg had left because he
was aware potential future press speculation would focus on his family.
Although Mr Clegg would deny such allegations, he felt they would be a
continuing source of embarrassment to Wace, and he should therefore step
down, he said.
Mr Clegg, whose mother is Irish, also resigned yesterday as a non-executive
director of Anglo-Irish Bank. Mr Clegg's family holds 15 per cent of
Anglo-Irish shares.
Wace said: 'The directors wish to reiterate that they are not aware that the
company, its investors or its directors (including Mr Clegg) have ever had
any links of any sort with the IRA.'
One institutional shareholder said: 'We are not satisfied with that
statement and I don't know any shareholder who is . . . . It wasn't pressure
from shareholders that caused him to leave.'

FT  01 FEB 92 / German steel strike looms after 'yes' vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY braced itself yes-terday for a long and disruptive steel strike
after a five-day union ballot resulted in an 87 per cent majority in favour
of industrial action over pay.
Despite weak public support, according to opinion polls, and solid
resistance from employers, the IG Metall union is expected to announce the
industry's first official stoppage since 1978 after a meeting of the union
leadership in Frankfurt on Tuesday.
There seemed little chance yesterday of early compromise or mediation.
Announcing the ballot result, union officials said they would not talk again
to the employers without a fresh offer. Mr Peter Schmithals, the employers'
negotiator, said yesterday morning he had no plans to make one.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall president, said he hoped the vote had
destroyed what he described as the employers' last illusions that they could
get a 'cheap' result.
Negotiations started last October with a 10.5 per cent demand and broke down
on January 22 with employers offering about 5.5 per cent and unions holding
out for about 6.5 per cent.
The decisive vote, in which 96 per cent of the 95,000 eligible union members
took part, could set the scene for a similar result from a current strike
ballot among banking workers.
It reinforced the hard line adopted by IG Metall, which starts negotiations
on behalf of its 3m-plus engineering industry members in March, and by 3.6m
public service union workers, whose wage demands will be put formally to
employers on February 7.
Steel strikes could legally start immediately after next week's Frankfurt
meeting. However, Mr Harald Schartau, of the union's steel section, said it
would take 'some days' to organise action. The effects of stoppages are
likely to be quick and wide-reaching.
Motor manufacturers, who keep little steel in stock, would be among the
first to be hit. Mercedes-Benz managers say they would feel the effects in
three or four days, and most car companies have laid plans for short-time
working.
Knock-on economic effects will spread quickly to the engineering sector,
where many of the country's 10,000-plus companies will be affected.
In the longer term, if em-ployers are forced to give too much ground and pay
inflationary increases, there is international concern that the Bundesbank
will not feel able to reduce interest rates from their current record
levels.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said in Stockholm yesterday
that inflation, currently 4 per cent, was far above his 2 per cent target.
After last year's high wage rises (averaging 6.7 per cent), the underlying
rate of inflation had gone up distinctly, he said. Union claims posted so
far this year on behalf of about 10m German workers call for average
increases of 10 per cent.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Yeltsin calls for global nuclear defence system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE UNITED NATIONS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin made his debut on the international stage
yesterday with a call at a special United Nations Security Council summit
for a global defence system against nuclear missiles.
Urging the US and the west generally to join a democratic Russia in the
quest for greater collective security, Mr Yeltsin invited other nuclear
powers to take part in common research to develop a space-based anti-missile
shield. He said Russian scientists had been working on developing such a
system.
Mr Yeltsin suggested that 3,000 nuclear scientists and specialists could use
their skills in this programme. The west has expressed fears that aspirant
nuclear powers, such as Libya, Iraq and Iran, could lure these scientists
into developing their own programmes.
He also proposed that the UN set up a permanent rapid response force under
Security Council control to deal with international crises.
President George Bush avoided a direct response to the Russian proposal for
a nuclear defence system, which is conditional on what Mr Yeltsin called 'a
reorientation' of the US Strategic Defence Initiative, the programme to
build a space-based anti-missile shield. Instead, Mr Bush welcomed earlier
proposals by Mr Yeltsin to make deep cuts in nuclear weapons.
Mr Ronald Reagan, when US president, offered to share SDI technology with
the former Soviet Union to try to overcome Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's opposition
to proposed deployment by the US of an anti-missile system. The Bush
administration has been more cautious.
The White House later announced that all Mr Yeltsin's defence proposals
would be examined today during the five hours of talks to be held by the two
leaders at the presidential retreat at Camp David. It will be their first
bilateral meeting since the abortive August 'putsch' in Moscow.
The Russians are also expected to offer to dismantle nuclear warheads as the
next step of arms reduction, in return for US money and expertise.
The summit meeting of Security Council member leaders, the first of its
kind, was called by Mr John Major to chart a new course for the UN in the
post-cold war era.
Opening the first session, Mr Major said the new partners had to take
advantage of the end of superpower rivalry to reinforce collective security.
'The world now has the best chance for peace, security and development since
the founding of the United Nations.'
Mr Major called on his fellow permanent members of the Security Council  -
Russia, which has taken over the former Soviet seat, France, China, and the
US - to strengthen the UN capacity for 'preventive diplomacy, peacemaking
and peacekeeping'.
President Francois Mitterrand of France offered to make available a
1,000-strong peacekeeping force at short notice.
The special summit was also designed to bolster the prestige of the new
secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
The temporary and permanent members of the Security Council asked Mr
Boutros-Ghali to report by July 1 on ways to strengthen collective security
and peace keeping. The declaration also suggested the UN examine the
possible role of 'identifying potential crises and areas of instability'.
Mr Bush condemned the 'outlaw regime' of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
and said there could be no normalisation of relations as long he remained in
power. He called for sanctions to remain in place.
The US yesterday signalled that it might press for further UN resolutions to
persuade Libya to hand over two men suspected of being involved in the
Lockerbie bombing and the sabotage of a French civil airliner.
Libya's offer to hand over the two men to the UN was dismissed by Mr James
Baker, US secretary of state, as unsatisfactory.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: On the road to Fes - Morocco combines startling

loafer and the honeymooner. Loafer Michael Thompson-Noel travelled elegantly
and stayed in the best hotels

PERHAPS YOU are familiar with Morocco and its pleasures: its size and
variety and intense physical beauty; its culture, which is deep, and its
relaxed conviviality; its friendliness, food and the ease with which
visitors can move around.
If not, writes Michael Thompson-Noel, you are as lucky as the man who has
never read Raymond Chandler. A surprise awaits you: an exceedingly pleasant
one.
My most eye-opening visit to Morocco happened some weeks ago in the company
of a man who knows Morocco well and whose enthusiasm for it serves the
country well. This was Chris Lawrence, managing director (and owner) of The
Best of Morocco, the specialist UK holiday company. Lawrence has been
visiting and running holidays to Morocco for 25 years, so there is not a lot
he doesn't know.
From London we flew to Ouarzazate via Casablanca. The next morning we drove
along the Valley of a Thousand Kasbahs to Erfoud via Tineghir and the Todra
gorge. This is wonderful countryside, as is the area around Rissani, from
where we ventured into the desert, to Merzouga, and rode camels across the
dunes - touristy, but why not? Then we continued to Fes via the modern ski
resort of Ifrane. And then, by air, to Marrakech.
In short, we covered a lot of ground, encountered excellent food and hotels,
and enjoyed plenty of R&amp;R in cities like Fes and Marrakech that everyone
ought to visit at least once.
Morocco's hotels are one of its biggest pluses for travellers who like
comfort. The ones we stayed in were: Karam Palace, Ouarzazate; Hotel Salam
Erfoud; Palais Jamai, Fes, and Es Saadi Hotel, Marrakech. All were
excellent. And we visited one exceptional restaurant: Yacout in Marrakech
(advance booking essential), which is located in the back streets (you
wouldn't find it on foot) and serves fine food in a dream-like setting.
(Your hotel will book you in, and order a Merc to drop you at the door).
These hotels, and more, feature in The Best of Morocco's current brochure
(to October 31) whose inclusive holidays range from weekend breaks to long
stays. As well as Agadir, Fes, Tangier and Marrakech, the brochure includes
Ouarzazate, Taroudant, Zagora and Essaouira.
There are seven-night Land Rover Saharan safaris with full board (four-star
hotels) from Pounds 513; two, three or four-night weekends in most big
cities (half-board in a five-star hotel) from Pounds 289; golf holidays
(there are excellent courses in Marrakech, Agadir, Rabat and Mohammedia,
with very low green fees and no waiting); skiing (lift-pass: Pounds 2.80 per
day); horse or mule trekking (various one-week programmes from Pounds 699);
fishing (there is outstanding fishing in the lakes of the Atlas mountains,
50 miles from Marrakech), and fly-drive (pick-up and drop-off at any
Moroccan airport), from Pounds 243 for flights and car for a week.
Chris Lawrence also organises six different escorted tours with weekly
departures: The Great South (two itineraries, one week from Pounds 473),
Imperial Cities (two itineraries, one week from Pounds 463), Grand Tour of
Morocco (two weeks from Pounds 683) and Medinas and Kasbahs (one week from
Pounds 499).
The Best of Morocco is at Seend Park, Seend, Wiltshire SN12 6NZ. Tel:
0380-828533, fax: 0380-828630.
Michael Thompson-Noel flew c/o Royal Air Maroc, which has six flights a week
from London to Morocco and is at 205 Regent St, London W1.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: A perfect choice - Morocco combines startling
physical beauty with cultured sangfroid. It is ideal for the trekker, the
loafer and the honeymooner. Honeymooner Antonia Sharpe booked herself into
La Gazelle d'Or at Taroudannt, where things got off to a generally fine
start

THE SWARTHY waiter in a long white robe politely approached the plump
English woman eying the lavish buffet, writes Antonia Sharpe. She dismissed
his attempts to explain each dish with an almost regal wave. 'Don't worry,
I'll work my way down,' she said, her plummy voice echoing across the
pristine swimming pool.
'Obviously a practised hand,' murmured my husband of less than seven days,
without taking his eyes from his fourth book of our honeymoon. I stifled a
laugh, not wanting to shatter the sunny peace for our fellow guests at La
Gazelle d'Or.
Looking around, I saw that their noses were also buried in books. I sighed,
and settled back into my sunbed. Yes, I had made the perfect choice for our
honeymoon.
The five-hour journey had not been too bad, though the flight from London to
Casablanca had been ruined by Royal Air Maroc's easy-going attitude towards
smokers. But that was forgotten once we touched down in Agadir and were met
by the hotel chauffeur who drove us the 60 km to Taroudannt with consummate
despatch.
Our spirits rose further on our arrival at La Gazelle d'Or at midnight. We
listened to the chorus of cicadas, looked at the stars in the inky sky, and
breathed in the clear mountain air sweetened by the smell of oranges. We
were shown to our bungalow, where the soft lighting set the peach-coloured
walls aglow. There was a big fireplace in one corner, carpets on the stone
floor and, beneath a large wall carving, a king-size bed.
To steal a line from Truman Capote, we soon got the feeling that nothing bad
would happen to us at La Gazelle d'Or. After breakfast we often took a
stroll through the hotel's gardens. There was a profusion of bougainvillaea,
frangipani, orange and lemon trees, cotton trees, hibiscus and oleander
bushes and waist-high geraniums. The sight of gleaming Arab horses grazing
on the lawns, with the snow-capped Atlas mountains in the background, seemed
unreal when the Sahara was only 200 km away.
We only ran into the other residents at mealtimes or at the swimming pool.
Since the hotel has only 30 bungalows, it seemed as if we had the place to
ourselves. During our stay most of the residents were English, though there
were a few continentals. We thought that one French lady was mad because she
kept talking to her Louis Vuitton handbag, but we later realised that she
carried her tiny terrier around in it.
We usually took a light lunch at the swimming pool, and spent the afternoon
sunbathing. A five-course dinner, brought by a platoon of waiters under the
command of a Peter Sellers lookalike, was served in the hotel's dining room.
The menu was pred- ominantly Franco-Moroccan. We particularly liked the
briouattes, deep-fried pastry stuffed with veal and vegetables, though the
tajines, or stews, might have become monotonous had we stayed longer than a
week.
We only ventured from the hotel once, when we visited the medina in
Taroudannt to buy a Berber carpet. So the nearest we got to a camel was the
earthenware figurine laden with salt and pepper on the dining room tables.
However, the hotel does organise excursions on request.
Hotel La Gazelle d'Or, Taroudannt, Morocco, tel: (8)-852048 and 852039; fax:
(8)-852737. The hotel charges a daily rate of Dh2,300 (about Pounds 154) per
couple for room and half-board, inclusive of local taxes. Transfers to and
from the airport cost Dh500 (Pounds 34) per room each way.
Apex economy return flights from London to Agadir via Casablanca with Royal
Air Maroc start from Pounds 250. It is advisable to book your stay directly
with the hotel because some travel agents in the UK who advertise holidays
at the Gazelle d'Or appear to charge excessively.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: Walking tall through Berber territory - Morocco
combines startling physical beauty with cultured sangfroid. It is ideal for
the trekker, the loafer and the honeymooner. Trekker Michael J. Woods
sweated in the High Atlas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A PETRIFIED white stream gushed forever silently from under the overhang,
its course marked by pebbles, each one crystal-covered and gleaming,
slightly spiky like coconut ice and coated with a delicate shell of salt
from which it could be shaken free, writes Michael J. Woods.
As valuable as gold in times past, this saline river now lay forgotten and
ignored in a narrow valley high in the Atlas mountains of Morocco. I found
it quite by chance when I wandered away from our camp site and scrambled
over scree while trying to follow the trails of nimble goats.
Once away from the tents, the sense of isolation was complete. Only the
occasional bird call and the distant rush of water broke the silence. The
air was so clean that I could easily detect the scent of lamb grilling on
hot coals; it wafted to me on the breeze, and I hurried back for dinner.
The High Atlas is probably the closest area of real wilderness to Europe,
less than four hours' flight from London's Heathrow and a dusty five-hour
drive from Marrakesh, but the mountains are hardly untouched by man. They
are inhabited by the Berbers - barbarians, so-called to distinguish them
from Arabs, a good-looking people with dark, well-defined features who eke
out a living against severe odds among the Atlas peaks.
Water here is both friend and foe. When the snow melts at the end of winter,
it rushes down from the mountains tearing away and demolishing roads, paths
and dams carefully built the previous year, so that the whole village has to
set to and carry out repairs.
Dry stone walls jammed with logs support teetering cliff-side tracks while
similar walls, their cracks jammed with leaves and moss, channel water from
way upstream to ensure that the irrigation canals are at the right level
when they reach the terraced fields. Above the water line the hillsides are
arid; below, green and lush. Crops of barley and wheat wave in the breeze
and tall old walnut trees spread shady branches in whose coolness we
frequently took our long lunch stop.
The margins are grazed by cattle, mules and donkeys, tended in groups of two
and three by women and children who control their charges with cries, sticks
and the occasional well-aimed stone. Older lads take the sheep and goats at
dawn to the mountainsides, only returning at dusk when it is almost too dark
to see.
Around the villages, people are busy everywhere. Women and girls wash
clothes in the streams, beating the material with sticks and hanging it over
bushes to dry while men and mules till the soil with a primitive
single-furrow plough whose only metal component is the shoe, polished to a
fine shine by its passage through the earth.
At first our trek took us through villages beside a vehicular track served
by a daily lorry. Wells supplied their water, whereas higher up water was
taken from the streams. The flat roofs of the mud houses were adorned with
TV aerials, not fixed to the building in any way but simply jammed into a
bucket of stones.
The houses themselves are built from cast mud which is tamped down with such
vigour that it almost achieves the hardness of concrete. It certainly takes
on the starkness of that material, and the insides of the rooms are rough,
bare and rather forbidding as a result. Outside, though, the buildings match
precisely the background colour of the soil of the neighbourhood and appear
as one with the landscape.
In the sandstone valleys the houses were deep red in colour, whereas in the
more fertile limestone valleys they took on a grey hue. Our shoes did much
the same as we strode through dust, ground to talc by so many feet. Sherlock
Holmes would have had a field day.
The road was busy that evening, as it had been market day on the far side of
the mountain. First a police jeep came past, driven by a black
leather-jacketed flic, followed at irregular intervals by groups of men on
mules. Finally, just as darkness was falling, a brand new Landrover
Discovery bumped past to remind us that, in spite of the strangeness of our
surroundings, we had escaped from nothing.
Our daily routine varied little. We set off at about 8 am after tea or
coffee in bed, hot washing water brought to our tents, and breakfast. We
walked for about three hours to a shady spot and during that time the mules,
carrying all the equipment and food, overtook us so that, when we turned up,
cool drinks were waiting for us.
Lunch was served, often after we had swum in the river, and then we read and
dozed until about 3 pm when we left for another couple of hours' walking. By
the time we reached our evening camp-site the tents were already up,
including a shower tent, and dinner was being prepared.
The food was always very fresh, beautifully cooked and served with great
attention to cleanliness so that no-one suffered from an excited stomach
during the trek.
At one site a small, serious girl of about six brought a dozen eggs to the
cook. He took them from her and paid for them. Clutching the precious notes
in her fist, the girl walked purposefully through the camp and back to her
house. A couple of days later a well-grown lamb was obtained from a local
shepherd, carried bleating from its mother, despatched and later served for
dinner accompanied by surprisingly good Moroccan wine.
For me, the best days were away from the villages. In the wild hills the new
spring flowers were superb. Sheets of purple orchids, white asphodel and
yellow vetches graced damp meadows while the bare hillsides were cushioned
by domes of yellow and blue 'hedgehogs'; I presume they were a sort of
gorse, although no-one seemed to know, but their spines were wicked.
We walked almost to 10,000 ft, but there were mules always on hand if the
climbing became too much. Super fitness is certainly not necessary and I
managed the whole trek with a cracked rib, damaged before I arrived.
Without exception, all the people we met were friendly but, tempting as it
was, I found it hard to photograph them.
Instead, I felt in danger of appearing to take pictures of these people
purely for their curiousity value. But then the Berbers must have thought us
mad, for we possess wealth beyond their wildest dreams and yet choose to
leave our luxurious homes to walk along their tracks and sleep in tents.
And we do it, apparently, for fun.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Friends on the Right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I ENJOYED myself this week. I attended the morning editorial conferences at
three of Britain's finest national newspapers: Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph
and Sun. I do this occasionally. It keeps me in touch with right-wing
opinion. The reason I am welcome at editorial conferences is that I am
related to, or acquainted with, all the top editors. What is more, I have a
VIP card that speeds me past the security guards and sniffer dogs that now
patrol the corridors of all our great newspapers, to protect journalists
from readers.
On Wednesday I visited the Mail. The editor of the Mail is a grand and
knighted person, terrifically shrewd and witty, who works unceasingly to
keep the Conservatives in power and the red hordes at bay. What a super
paper.
The conference was hushed and reverent, and started with the editor
analysing that morning's issue. 'Not bad,' he said, pointing to the front
page. ''LABOUR SCARES LOW-PAID VOTERS - Many of the poorest families fear
they will pay more tax under a Labour government, it is revealed today. An
astonishing 44 per cent of the lowest-paid workers . . . believe they will
be worse off . . .'
'I think I like that. It has all the ingredients that I am constantly on
about. Neil Kinnock. Pensioners. Taxes. Frightening. Mr Major twice as
popular. Dustmen and road repairers. Socialists. Frightening. Taxes.
Frightening.
'I also liked this other story: 'Trident safe with us says Major.' And there
is good material inside. I particularly like the Comment column for
explaining why it is that for every three voters who would trust Labour to
handle the nation's finances, five place their faith in the Tories. And
there is a remarkably good letters page which hits home hard against the
homosexual lobby in the British film and theatre industry, and spotlights
the appalling cost to the NHS of removing tattoos.
'But I want more variety. I'm tired of the tax story and so are the readers.
There must be thousands of reasons why people shouldn't vote Labour yet all
we have done is scratch the surface. I want blood, guts and toil. This is a
newspaper I'm running, not some holiday camp.'
On Thursday I dropped in at the Telegraph. What a super paper. The
Telegraph's editor is a tremendously imposing figure, erect and
bespectacled, with a penchant for military history. He brings his morning
conferences to order by banging his desk with his swagger-stick and
shouting: 'Gunners]'
He had mixed views about Thursday's Telegraph. 'A wholesome front page,' he
said. ''Wedding at Windsor for Lady Helen.' That's the ticket. And there are
stories inside that do not displease me. Page 3 is excellent: 'Judge spares
husband who strangled nagging wife.'
'And I am expressly pleased with this Page 5 headline: 'How sausages save
the Queen when rat is on the menu.' Perfectly barking. Precision gunnery.
'Fashion is OK. Ditto obituaries. Business limps. Sport looks tired. What
really vexes me, though, is the leader-page spread. We've got Claudia
FitzHerbert babbling on about Book Aid for Russia when we all know that our
distinguished visitor this morning, fellow from the FT' - he waved in my
direction - 'did that last Saturday with considerably greater poise. And
we've got this piece about racial discrimination in working men's clubs.
'But where is the election? We seem to have forgotten it. Mislaid it.
Overlooked it. Not good, gunners. Not good at all. I suggest we recommence
the heavy pounding. Then bring up the cavalry. I take it they've been
primed. This election will be tight. We don't want Neil Kinnock and Clare
Short trampling all over us. What? What?'
Yesterday I called at the Sun. What a super paper. Naturally, the editor was
delighted with yesterday's performance on the kidnapping of pretty estate
agency salesgirl Stephanie Slater, 25 - page after page of super copy, pics
and maps.
And he drooled over the topless lovely on Page 11: 'Sexy Amanda Jayne Forbes
is always an uplifting experience' (nudge, nudge). He also liked the
pictures with the Sun's continuing 'News Special' (ho-ho-ho) on superthug
Mike Tyson: 'Tyson stripped me with one hand and said: We will have a baby.'
But he was infuriated by another limp Nigel Mansell story on Page 35.
'What's Mansell ever done?' roared the editor. 'He was born a runner-up.' (I
have deleted all expletives and sarff London terminology).
And he demanded a progress report on Operation Bimbo. 'The American
presidential election's got smoking bimbos coming out of its ears, so what
about our election? Find some. I don't care how but get me bimbos.'

FT  01 FEB 92 / Kidnapping, a respectable job: Who would own up to being a
journalist or a policeman? Asks Dominic Lawson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE introduction and 'How do you do?' the next question always seems
to be 'What do you do?'. I've always thought this routine of the first
meeting rather depressing, suggesting as it does that work is the most
interesting aspect of a person's life and character.
Why, just for once, can't the follow-up to the already trite 'How do you
do?' (no one except Jewish women of a certain age ever gives a truthful
answer to this inquiry) be 'What is your favourite novel?' or 'What is your
favourite piece of music?' or 'If you could murder anyone and get away with
it, who would be your first victim?' It would make life so much more
interesting and unpredictable.
I suppose my insecurity over this matter of identification by career stems
partly from the fact that I am a journalist and therefore a member of a
profession universally held in lower esteem. Well, not universally -
journalists hold themselves in the highest esteem.
But I am often tempted when asked 'what do you do?' to reply 'writer', or
more riskly, 'editor', or sometimes, evasively, that 'I run a small
organisation in the publishing business.' Anything to avoid being
pigeon-holed as nosey and untrustworthy.
But unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that, in a free society, it
may actually be that what one does for a living does genuinely reveal more
about one than any other piece of information.
This in turn suggests that the common prejudices about certain professions
may be absolutely accurate.
For example, one is brought up to believe that, while on the whole good
sorts, policemen, alas, are stupid. Every child is familiar with PC Plod,
and goes on to read detective books in which one amateur sleuth of less than
supernatural intelligence runs rings around the entire Metropolitan Police
Force.
And I am afraid that recent events bear out these childhood prejudices. The
many recent cases of false arrest and imprisonment are as much a story of
stupidity as they are of corruption, although the Left will always favour
the latter interpretation.
And now we have the bizarre case of the kidnap for ransom of the Birmingham
estate agency girl, Stephanie Slater. It seems scarcely credible that 1,000
plainclothes policemen in 500 unmarked cars could fail to apprehend the
villain, who was kind enough to drop Stephanie Slater barely 200 yards from
her home.
The Sun newspaper - which seems to have gleaned the following 'facts' about
the villain: 'Age: 40s. Height: 5 ft 7 inches. Brains: above average.
Character: he's Mr Cool' - speculates that the officers lost the kidnapper
in fog when he picked up the Pounds 175,000 provided by Miss Slater's
employers, Royal Life Insurance. Perhaps, in the style made famous by
British Rail, we may later be told by the police that it was 'the wrong sort
of fog.'
But I rather enjoyed the comment of the officer in control of the operation
that the escape of both the villain and his booty was 'the only negative
side at this time.' Unless the police do speedily arrest the criminal, I
fear that another 'negative' will be a
large number of imitative
kidnaps.
Perhaps it is just unfortunate that on the same day as the police lost 'Mr
Cool' in the fog, it was revealed that two men who broke a window to burgle
a newsagent's shop in Barnstaple, escaped by smashing open a replacement
window speedily installed by glaziers who had been called by the police on
the spot.
According to yesterday's Daily Telegraph, 'The burglars laid low while
officers investigated the smashed window, and then they made off with Pounds
200-worth of cigarettes when they found the coast was clear.'
To be consistent we must allow that other professions are equally
susceptible to accurate stereotyping.
We may assume that most theatre designers and many vicars are homosexual,
that most financiers are greedy, that most politicians are power-crazed,
that most professional chess players are paranoid, that most nurses are
angels, that most actors are egotists, that most lawyers are heartless, and,
yes, that most journalists are nosey and untrustworthy.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Private View: A poet who found his place in the world -
Herbert Lomas believes we are born into caste not class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO BE a poet in the land of Shakespeare can these days be rather
embarrassing.
So when he goes to parties, Herbert Lomas prefers to conceal his real
profession. He introduces himself as a critic or retired lecturer (which he
is), or as a translator of Finnish literature (for which Finland knighted
him in December).
'People think poetry has nothing to do with what life is about,' he said,
'having houses and consuming and making money and watching the television.
What they'd really like to know is how you make money out of it.'
When they learn the truth about him, they feel awkward. ''What kind of
poetry do you write,' they ask. It's an almost unanswerable question. They
hope you're going to reply 'Oh, well, I write erotic poetry. It's all about
getting into bed with people.''
In his case, some of it is. But that is not the reason he does it. He is a
poet because he cannot help it.
'One writes poetry because one writes it. It's part of one's
self-definition. I tend to believe in Sartre's view that you make a kind of
choice of yourself, you know. You make it at a very early age and having
made this choice of yourself you're stuck with it.'
Yet it is not simply a matter of choice, either. During a long, whisky-fired
conversation at his house on the seafront at Aldeburgh in Suffolk, I learned
that Lomas has a more metaphysical explanation of why he is a poet and not,
say, a merchant banker.
He is a Yorkshireman born in a pub in the Pennines, the Black Swan at
Todmorden. His stern mother was the daughter of a bankrupt mill-owner, his
gifted but uneducated father was the son of a master dyer.
'I think a lot of poets are people with very articulate parents, especially
working class people because their creativity comes out in their language
and their conversation.
'People like Shakespeare and Dylan Thomas come from those environments. I
mean, Shakespeare's father was a butcher. People tried to say he couldn't be
a butcher's son, he must be an aristocrat's son. It's much more likely he
was a butcher's son because of the way he uses words.'
But it is caste, rather than class, that Lomas thinks defined him.
He believes he was born a Brahmin. 'I don't say it with any pride. I just
think it's a fact.'
Indeed, like the Hindus, he believes that we are all type-cast: whether as
Brahmins, the intellectuals and contemplatives; as Kshatriyas, the
administrators and soldiers; as Banyas (or Vaishyas), the businessmen; or as
Shudras, the ones who do the work.
'The trouble is, they're not always in the right place. For example, I think
Mrs Thatcher is a Banya, a grocer. And when you get the grocers doing the
jobs of the Brahmins and Kshatriyas, things go wrong.' He described his
wife, Mary, as a model Kshatriya.
Poetry, then, is a typically Brahmin activity which in Britain and America
happens to have been shoved aside by our preoccupation with business and
money.
Lomas once wrote a book called Who Needs Money? in which he argued - he says
in the spirit of authentic Marxism - that with the proper use of modern
technology we could solve all our economic problems in 20 years' time. If we
really wished, we could abolish obsolescence and increase the supply of
goods to the point where prices fell to nothing and the stuff could be given
away.
It was a Utopian book, he said, but one day it would be proved correct.
And what is the poet's message to the Banyas then? I asked.
'Know your place.'
Lomas laughed. He has a repertoire of laughs and it is not always easy to
tell what they convey. They can be prompted by a happy phrase, by an awkward
admission, by modesty, and by dislike as well as by a sense of fun or the
absurd.
'You shouldn't ask doctors to behave like grocers,' Lomas added. 'Don't try
to introduce buying and selling into universities, into hospitals.'
Does the poet look down on the Banyas?
'No, the poet admires their economic skills. What he does not admire is when
they interfere in things they don't understand.'
Does he feel sorry for them that they don't have a broader aim in life?
'I'm an egalitarian. I think everybody is of equal value; but they lose
their value when they start trying to do something that doesn't belong to
their particular skills.'
Herbert Lomas has strong opinions, about God, sex and economics, but their
expression is modestly ironical rather than aggressive. He is stimulating
and sociable in his seclusion.
'I like people - and I like people more than most people like people, I
think. I need social things. But even more I need solitude. And I haven't
had enough of it in my life.'
Although he has had five volumes of poetry published and has been praised by
WH Auden, Lomas has one great regret: that he did not give up his lecturing
job in London sooner. 'I used to get drained at the end of term like an
accumulator that's spent all its energy. I used to come here, often alone,
and I would open out like one of those Japanese flowers in a shell.'
Does being here by the sea help you?
'Oh, that helps enormously. The sea gives you that cosmic feeling. You
realise you're on a planet when you look at it. And then there is just the
amazing fact of all that water - just as the eye makes you realise about
God.'
When I asked whether poetry had become irrelevant, Lomas replied that a lot
more people wrote it than read it, but would not admit to doing so. 'There's
a kind of spectrum. The poet is the man next door at one end and Lord Byron
at the other.'
In his case, the conviction that he was a poet came at about the age of
seven. He described an early classroom trial:
'We had to write a poem and were given the first line, which was pretty
boring: 'I like the trees with leaves of green.' And I thought now, if I'm a
poet, I've got to do the best of the class.
'I thought of it rather like a crossword puzzle. So I asked a little girl
what she thought the second line was and she said: 'The stately form, just
like a queen' and she posed like something between a tree and a queen. That
really inspired me. And I was away. I can still remember the poem, or bits
of it. And I was picked out as the best.'
Poetry involved two things, he said. One was expression, finding a way of
saying things about which you feel strongly and which you cannot say in
ordinary conversation. The other was craft, achieving a satisfying form like
a carpenter a cabinet.
I asked Lomas about religion, a subject he takes extremely seriously. Was it
always so?
'It was always important. But I've been an atheist - which is part of being
religious, in my opinion. I was nearly a Hindu for a long time.' (This was
the influence of Isherwood and others, not connected with his wartime
experience under fire as an army officer on India's North-West frontier).
'I lost my faith during the war because I couldn't reconcile Christianity
with war and I thought the war was necessary. It took me a long time to get
over that. Then I had a kind of crack-up or religious conversion, whichever
word you like to use.' He laughed.
How did that happen?
'I was about 30. It was a complete change of direction I just knew that I
was immortal, you know. And that was a big crisis. I had a kind of
enlightenment. It knocked me completely for six.
'If you don't have this religious dimension to your life you're living on
the surface of yourself. And I had got out of touch with my own depths and
my own depths suddenly said Wake up, Lomas.'
'I think I went through that experience that Jung talks about: when you pass
over from your ego to yourself. The ego is a kind of invention and the self
says 'I'm eternal and I am the real self: the ego is just the glitter on the
water.' Jung had the same crisis. It looks like schizophrenia.'
Lomas had a nervous breakdown and doctors tried to label him schizophrenic.
'I was sent to see this bastard and he was one of the most stupid people
I've ever met. He started talking about shock treatment. I said I'd had
enough shocks already. He told me to go and see the nurses. So I thought:
'Nurses, great] And they were these bloody great sergeant-major types, male.
I was absolutely terrified.'
At the time he was on holiday from his teaching job at the University of
Helsinki. He decided to stay in Finland, and was there another ten years.
Lomas talks about religion, economics and sex. I 'I am fascinated by sex,'
he said. 'Always have been, from the very earliest age. I'm amazed that
people can reach their teens without ever having an orgasm.'
Is it because you are highly sexed, or just extremely inquisitive?
'I don't know how one would measure it. I would think I was not particularly
highly sexed, really. But I do regard it as of supreme importance.'
You have written about sex as an expedition into the interior of another
country, trading with the hinterland. If I was a feminist critic I'd say you
had an exploitative attitude.
'I think I'm actually criticising the attitude. These words are always used
slightly ironically. No, I think I am really interested in women, and sex
for me is a form, not of exploitation but exploration.
Some feminist demands make you angry, don't they?
'That's because I love women. I think a lot of damage is being done to
relationships between men and women. To that extent they are harmful to
women. Actually, I'm an early feminist. I was one of the first readers of
The Second Sex and was convinced by it.
'Now a lot of women have had second thoughts. I'm an egalitarian where women
are concerned and any woman who has lived with me knows that: they always
get more freedom from me - perhaps more than they actually want.'
Who are you writing your poetry for, I asked. Is it yourself?
'I think most writers are writing for an ideal reader,' he said.
Who is the ideal reader?
'It's probably God. I've never thought of that before, but in fact that's
probably it . . . the perfect person to write a poem for.' Lomas gave
another great laugh. This laugh meant he really means it.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Heaven and Hell: Teeth will be provided - Nigel Spivey bares
his tormented soul in the first article of a new series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE WAS thundering from the pulpit, as only he can thunder: on the
destination of sinners, and the beating of breasts, the tearing of hair, the
gnashing of teeth.
An old lady in the front pew had the spirit to pipe up: 'Reverend Paisley -
I don't have any teeth]' Other preachers might have faltered, but not he.
'Teeth,' he roared, 'will be provided]'
The provision of teeth is an essential detail of the picture of Hell that I
owe to my Non-conformist upbringing. No one could say that my father
delivers hellfire every Sunday; and I remember nothing but mellow homilies
from my grandfather; but I perfectly understand Ian Paisley's fierce
pedantry with regard to teeth.
Church-goers, and cathedral-goers, may hold out for some last-minute
mitigation: chapel-goers know that there is none, and have been properly
trained in the exercise of gnawing their own innards. The Hell that is
yielded by the culture of hard seats and soft drinks can be mapped out
largely in terms of guilt, remorse, and self-loathing.
Those of us who spent thousands of hours of our youth being instructed in
the cultivation of guilt will need no issue of teeth. We have, so to speak,
our own jaws of Hell. We looked closely at that oak-framed print depicting
the Straight and Narrow path to Heaven, and the broad, meandering highway to
Hell; examined the pious industry of those who were on the one road, and the
drunken, brutish, carnal physiognomies of those reeling along on the other.
We know very well what Hell will be like: here, for those who have never
wriggled on chapel pews, are its salient features.
The Non-conformist Hell involves a revision of the stock tortures of
damnation. After all, Sisyphus, rolling his stone up the hill, up the hill,
and up the hill again, is no punishment; rather, an exemplar of work for the
sake of work, which to some Non-conformists is perfect Heaven. And Tantalus,
ever stretching out for the ever close but ever mobile banquet - to be thus
tantalised is not the height of pain for a Nonconformist. No: Hell for us
will be forcible attendance at an absolutely slap-up meal, being obliged to
partake of a prodigal spread, with the costliest, daintiest foods, and the
rarest of wines. We shall be gorging ourselves: and at our elbows, all
around the table, not getting a scrap, will be starving children, with the
elephant eyes and corrugated ribs of utter impoverishment. We diners will
watch helpless as what we fail to eat is swept away, to be thrown into bins
of sheer wastage; while the children silently, incredulously, watch us.
There will not be a tea-urn in sight; nor even the simplest slice of
bread-and-butter. We shall be tormented to the extremes of torment.
Needless to say, this Hell will be packed with the blaggards, the wastrels,
the hustlers and the sots we saw on the low road. Their punishment consists
in the endowment of a conscience, a Non-conformist conscience. And
everything about this Hell will stink of moral shoddiness. From the
prohibitions imposed upon my television viewing when I was a boy, I would
expect to be entertained round-the-clock in this Hell by Monty Python and
Benny Hill; as an older man, I think I shall be less astringent than my
father, and allow those lewd comics some indulgence. Nevertheless, Hell will
be awful. It will have a library whose catalogue index begins and ends with
Cooper, Jilly. It will accommodate all those experiences that leave one with
a residue of feeling done down, sold short, or self-demeaned. The only
newspaper will be the Sunday Sport. Sex will be terrible: the gratification
of lust with a brief fritter of cash, every act a betrayal of loved ones and
family togetherness. Not a single opportunity for martyrdom or
self-improvement will ever arise. Each Sunday morning will be spent in
polishing a massive, highly-polished limousine; while from very far away
drift snatches of those hymns that stand for comfort, generosity and
cleanliness of spirit. In short, there will be no grace to one's existence.
I could go on. But it is enough to say that in this Hell, no vultures will
come to peck at your bowels. You will do it alone. And if you have none,
then teeth will be provided.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: A Brechtian Macbeth - The Schiller Theatre's visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCHILLER Theater's version of Macbeth opened to a packed house at the
Mermaid on Thursday and departs after today - a lamentably short stay for
such a pyrotechnic performance. If you can't get in this evening, try to
catch up with it in Berlin or wherever, for Die Tragodie des Macbeth, as it
is called in full, really ought to have been given a run of several weeks at
the National or the Barbican.
Still, the Mermaid is not a bad place for it: a dilapidated, open stage that
reminds one of the old Brecht shows in East Berlin. Forget about Schiller:
this production has Brecht and the Berliner Ensemble written all over it.
The director, Katharina Thalbach, grew up and trained under the Brecht
influence. She moved to the Schiller Theater in West Berlin in 1976 to keep
the flag flying, and how right she was. Perhaps only the West Germans have
the resources to do Brecht in full style.
The Brechtian approach relies heavily on stunning stage effects. In Macbeth,
we see this most sharply with the witches. They are not only tarts and punks
 -you would expect that from the German cabaret of the 1930s. They also
suspend themselves acrobatically from a huge spider's web (made out of rope)
strung on the roof. When they prepare themselves for the equivalent of the
cauldron scene, all three of them simultaneously use a chamber pot and throw
the contents against a wall which is already daubed with symbols of German
anarchism and the graffito 'Fair is Foul and Foul is Fair'.
When the blood flows in this Macbeth, it does not look like tomato sauce,
but more like a substance from one of the German chemical companies. Some of
the actors seem to be dripping living blood and sweat throughout. When
Macbeth is finally, viciously stabbed, the spurt of blood form his mouth
brings a horrified gasp from the audience.
Yet the show is not all intense. Just before Macbeth is killed, his final
battle with Macduff is played as a parody - two men shielding themselves
with dustbin lids and whacking each other with sticks. Some of the
interpretations have been seen in previous English productions. For example,
when Duncan arrives to stay with Macbeths, he makes a direct pass at the
lady and expects to have her: the diversion is that she has other things on
her mind.
The banqueting scene, too, has elements that could come in an English
performance. Lady Macbeth lays the huge white table cloth herself. When
Macbeth is disturbed by the recurrent appearances of Banquo, he wraps
himself up in it as if it were a sheet and lies down on the table with his
wife. The brilliance of the scene is to have such a large table, but only
dinner for four (five, including Banquo).
The Germans again have great fun with differences between England and
Scotland. In Scotland, it appears, the men really don't wear pants under
their kilts. In England, by contrast, the men are effeminate. They listen to
madrigals, cleverly taken from other bits of Shakespeare, and drink tea.
One or two points are perverse and must be put down to the Brechtian,
Marxist influence. Duncan is presented as an unattractive figure simply
because he is a king, and Macbeth turns ridiculously obese and gross once he
has assumed the crown. Not only does that destroy some of the Shakespearean
drama; it means that this Macbeth is a play without feeling and the
development of character. That's Brecht: all symbols and no individuals.
In the end, however, there's much more to this version than Brecht. There is
a marvellous moment at the start when a movie-star looking Lady Macbeth
calls out of a window for her husband. At first she says his name in a
dominant way, then in a strain of despair as if she knows that she has lost
him as a result of her own ambition. That is is the story of Lady Macbeth.
Some of the most dramatic verse (like 'tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow')
is faithfully kept and comes out beautifully in German. So does Macduff's
reaction on hearing of the murder of his wife and children. What you get
overall is a different mix from (say) an RSC production. There must be some
way of having productions like this in London more often.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Barbaric times - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B. A. YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO 4's Monday evening play, Don Taylor's When the Barbarians Came, covers
the Roman reaction to the Goths' entry of the city in AD 376. Wealthy, idle
Marcus (Norman Rodway) and his mistress Julia (Frances Barber) see the
plebs' welcome on their television. Theatre director Adrian (Peter
Woodthorpe) gradually accedes to new demands until, under a Goth assistant,
he has a hit with an Oedipus genuinely blinded, a Richard III actually put
to the sword. Antony (Colin MacFarlane), a captain in Intelligence, appears
to take sides with anti-barbarian students, though continuing his
intelligence work; and Augustus, a quasi-Emperor, pulls out, selling his
property to the Goths.
The political reactions are shown only among the middle and upper classes.
It would have been interesting to hear a voice from the plebs, to know for
instance, how the common people, so free from revolt, felt about the
slave-camps set up for the unemployed and homeless, and later about National
Sacrifice Day, with five citizens killed to music. ('I'd rather watch it on
television,' Marcus says.) Antony comes nearest to a public opinion. Why
accept barbarians? There's been no uprising. Our society is based on
barbarism, it's the people's hearts that must change. Neither Rome nor the
Goths is specifically mentioned, and the play seems as much concerned with
the historic association of Romans and Visigoths as with any analogy with
our own day. I found it a fascinating piece, and stayed awake half the night
thinking about Germany, Northern Ireland, the Caribbean and elsewhere.
Jeremy Howe was the director.
On Sunday Radio 3 gave us Louis MacNeice's Christopher Columbus, with the
Walton music. There is excitement in Columbus's first voyage (in the play's
second hour), but we wait a long time while he argues with this duke and
that bishop, achieving merely a charge of heresy. Only victory over the
Moors persuades Queen Isabella to give him a ship; then he demands to be
Viceroy and Governor-General over the places he finds, with one-tenth of the
treasure and one-eighth of the lands and revenues. If I had been the Queen
I'd have handed him over to the Inquisition.
MacNeice's lines are not alluring, and Walton's music, recorded by the BBC
Singers and Symphony Orchestra under Simon Joly, seemed to me useful but
little more. Alan Howard's playing of Columbus matched the occasional
vividness of the words, and indeed the company, directed by Ian Cotterell,
truly suggested the consciously aristocratic Spanish nobles Columbus had to
persuade.
(Tomorrow morning on Radio 4, you can hear What if . . . ?, in which
American academics discuss with Dr Christopher Andrew the differences, on
each side of the Atlantic, we should see if Queen Isabella hadn't changed
her mind.)
Drama of another kind came on Radio 5 on Monday, with the first part of
Groosham Grange by Anthony Horowitz, adapted by Stephen Sheridan. It is a
farce for teenagers about a schoolboy, sacked from Beaton, and sent to the
weird eponymous academy. The headmaster was playing Verdi's Requiem when we
joined. 'Yes, it's something you can really dance to,' said the hideously
deformed caretaker. So you see where we are. At least this won't be as
middle-class as boys' school-stories tend to be. There are two more
instalments to come, no matter what the Radio Times says.
Saturday night was Burns Night, and Radio 2 gave us A Tribute to Robert
Burns, with songs by Kenneth McKellar and readings by Tom Fleming. McKellar
is a favourite Scottish singer; and Fleming gave a reading of 'The cotter's
Saturday night' that - speaking as a Sassenach - I thought splendid. Radio 3
competed with 20 minutes from Jamie McGee, the legendary (sic) one-armed
blues bagpiper, something you don't hear every day.

<DATELINE>
   SNARLING Beasties have two themes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
showbiz and sexual politics, the former exemplified by their biopic
Valentino, the latter by a trilogy culminating in the provocatively titled
The Woman Who Cooked her Husband. They have one style, a gutsy physical
theatre, strongly influenced by film and punctuated with recordings of
popular song. Their latest show combines the lot in what I wish I could
report as a ground-breaking venture. But this talented young company, led by
writer, director and sometime performer Debbie Isitt, has developed a patter
as repetitive in its way as the jokes of a down-beat stand-up.
You Never Know Who's Out There, which is being premiered at London's Drill
Hall Arts Centre by the Other Theatre of Comedy, follows a group of club
performers from scratch to scratch, using their work as a mirror for their
lives. Bobby Vincent, the king of comedy, sublimates a deep streak of
misogyny in an act based on sexist jibes, to which his wife, 'the lovely
Faye", responds by getting sozzled. Manager Sonny plays each off against the
other, while tolerating his tatty ventriloquist brother, and running in
terror from his guest artiste, a dumpy drag queen who 'does Cher'.
Isitt's big problem is structure. She writes pithily and funnily, but
increasingly I feel she uses her trademark style as a shield against the
demands of developing a fully satisfying play. She certainly has a knack of
assembling fine performers (James Gaddas and Beverley Klein stand out
alongside a rather subdued Mark Kilmurry), but her plot merely serves to
illustrate the scenario of second-rate people living second-rate lives.
There is nothing second rate about Medea, the original snarling beastie, who
is dragged kicking and screaming to to the Lilian Baylis Theatre by the
veteran women's ensemble Monstrous Regiment. Clare Venables, the company's
new artistic director, has modernised Euripedes' tragedy into a feminist
stock-taking exercise which dispenses with higher wisdoms to represent Jason
(Martin Gower) as a patronising opportunist who, notwithstanding that he has
ostensibly walked out on his wife for no very good reason, would seem
entitled to sue for divorce on grounds of unreasonable behaviour.
Ishia Bennison's thoroughly modern Medea hurls books and crocks, scribbles
on walls and finally kills her two strapping sons in what one can only
regard as a tantrum. Oh, how one longs to offer her a coffee and a Kleenex -
as indeed Sue Holland's pained Chorus does at one point. This is the third
adaptation of Medea to hit the stage in the last few months and it is the
least convincing, because it gives no sense of a divine or historic
injustice bearing down on an individual. Women do pick the wrong men, and
husbands do walk out on their wives, but a crisis is not the same as a
tragedy.
The crisis of David Mamet's short 1985 play The Shawl is not of faith but of
agnosticism. Is it possible, he asks, that a charlatan faith healer could
have some sort of psychic powers? If so, could he find the language to
express what he sees, when his act is so entirely geared to duping people.
This is a virtuoso piece of linguistic juggling which is very adequately
served by a young cast at Camden Town's Etcetera Theatre under the direction
of Bryce Pedersen. They could, however, take a lesson from the Snarling
Beasties and find themselves a better name. Uneasy in my Easy Chair Theatre
Company hardly promises a pleasurable evening's fringe-going.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: A fierce, adult fairytale - The Coliseum's new
production of Konigskinder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENGLISH National Opera production of Humperdinck's Konigskinder is a
brave, powerful, imaginative, and rather worrying achievement. It approaches
a late-Romantic operatic masterpiece long and unjustly neglected - for
reasons which I attempted to outline in Thursday's newspaper - with the
'interventionist' seriousness that has come to characterise this company's
artistic policy.
It is visually bold, often brilliantly vivid in detail, and musically
impressive: anyone who cares about inventive opera-theatre would be mad to
miss it. But on Thursday it seemed less than the hoped-for vindicatory
triumph: an investigation of the opera's prominent themes that in its later
stages clutters the already complex story-line, concentrating hard on
specifics at the expense of the all-important overall continuity.
The third act, one of the most piercingly beautiful and finely sustained
elegies in all of Romantic opera, summarises the achievement. The emotional
climax of the opera comes with the death in the winter snow of the young
lovers, Goose Girl and King's Son, outsiders of 'royal' lineage (in the
spiritual as well as genealogical sense) who have been driven out by the
local town populace.
Their long 'Liebestod' duet, which refreshes the plangent influence of both
Tristan and Parsifal with a limpid sweetness of vocal and instrumental sound
all Humperdinck's own, is staged with sympathy and tenderness by David
Pountney (who also provided the lively rhymed translation), conducted with
steady mastery by Mark Elder, and sung and acted by Cathryn Pope and Joseph
Evans (a handsome American heard earlier in the season as Rodolfo) with
deeply affecting simplicity.
Earlier in the evening - during the forest-in-spring and town-in-summer acts
of this extraordinary adult fairy tale - one has had cause to wonder whether
either soprano or tenor voice is quite substantial enough - Humperdinck
wrote the parts for the 'youthful heroic' category, for singers of, say,
Elsa and Lohengrin rather than Melisande and Lensky. One has also longed for
Mr Elder and the ENO orchestra to throw first-night caution, however
understandable, to the winds and adopt a far headier approach to the
dramatic unfolding of Humperdinck's musical structure.
But these are minor qualms, which will no doubt be confidently addressed
later in the run. It is when the lame Fiddler (Alan Opie) returns with his
attendant troupe of children - outsiders too, and in their own way no less
maimed by local-community xenophobia - to provide the opera with its
celebrated scene of mourning and farewell that the difficulties caused by Mr
Pountney's production focus reach crunch-point.
The children are dressed as concentration-camp victims; instead of marching
off in dignified procession as the libretto requires, carolling their
refrains of 'Royal martyrs]', they drop melodramatically dead one by one. A
work whose tragic pessimism about human nature should be tempered in closing
moments with a warming ray of hope for the future has its warmth brutally
snuffed out - and this is in spite of Mr Opie's eloquently mellifluous
singing of the opera's most wonderful music.
The full force of this fierce production stance builds up only gradually
during the evening. Mr Pountney and his designer, Sue Blane, give us a first
act of enchanting Disney-like wit, fantasy, and theatrical acumen. Sally
Burgess's Witch, sung with the punch and clarity of her recent Fricka, is
sultry, weirdly glamorous, a tour de force.
But then in Act 2 the doings down in the town of Hellabrun prompt a
sustained send-up of Bavarian coarseness. I laughed a lot at the
shorts-wearing, thigh-slapping, goose-stepping routines while starting to
fret about their rib-nudging effects and, with them, the reduction of such
important minor parts as Broom-maker and Woodcutter to cartoon dolts.
As always, there is a sharp point to Mr Pountney's purpose. The opera is,
among many other things, an early 20th-century warning against specific
German tendencies; we all know where those led (the opera's librettist, Elsa
Bernstein-Porges, survived internment in Theresienstadt). It is also a
profoundly compassionate fable about the interdependence of man and nature,
society and the individual, parents and children. I'd rather have these
themes too forcefully examined than not at all. In the end, though, Mr
Pountney's way of doing so threatens to get in the way of fullest
Konigskinder appreciation.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Romeo in Bristol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRISTOL Old Vic's Romeo and Juliet puts Renaissance Italy in a recreated
Georgian Theatre and subjects it to a 20th-century interpretation. The
result is a pacey, open performance of one of Shakespeare's most
claustrophobic plays.
For their first season at the Old Vic, director Andrew Hay and designer Mick
Bearwish have followed the theatre's 1766 seating layout. This places some
spectators to the sides and rear of the stage. This moves a lyrical play,
already near the inwardness of Venus and Adonis and the Sonnets, towards
closet drama: quiet, intimate and complex.
The set and design are simple and integrated. Verona's brawling families are
colour-coded by faction, the young bloods in vivid reds or yellows, their
elders in mellowed autumnals. An arched courtyard and balcony give on to an
open courtyard. The lighting is static, establishing either the bright
'public haunt of men' or the gloomy horrors of the Capulet monument. There
are no props. Sword fights are effected by mime and a meticulously-timed
soundtrack.
The most distinctive aspect of the characterisation is the prominence which
Hay rightly gives to the Nurse (Caroline Bliss) and Friar Lawrence (Dave
Bond); the former is a gap-toothed West-Country woman who deserves Juliet's
curse 'ancient damnation', and the latter is an unpredictable meddler. Hay
presents them as consistent entities, and this helps explain Juliet's
scepticism about them both.
Romeo (Clarence Smith) starts 'in likeness of a sigh' and finds enough
stamina in the part to turn 'drivelling love' into firm arguments when he
meets resistance from Friar Lawrence. Juliet is superbly played by Geraldine
Somerville; she controls the disparate emotions brought together in Juliet
and made manifest by the plot. She is by turns bold, shy, feckless and
deliberate. She speaks her soliloquies frankly; and the balcony scenes with
Romeo are a tender and witty delight. Elsewhere, Nigel Betts is an ursine
Montague and Stewart Porter an irascible Capulet. Between them, Simon Day
plays both Tybalt and Paris. Suzanne Packer as Mercutio is all energy.
This uncluttered production, along with the two recent RSC stagings (Terry
Hands in 1989 and David Leveaux in 1991) witnesses the welcome view of Romeo
and Juliet as a tense, pared-down drama which needs no trappings if the
director trusts the author. Perhaps a new Shakespearean minimalism is afoot.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Virility rules - Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS

<TEXT>
THE NEW Man, as we all know, is gentle, caring and Politically Correct. He
helps with the washing up and changes baby's nappies. He makes sure the
goldfish has fresh water, the dog has a good book and the cat is on a
high-fibre vegetarian diet. He croons his wife to sleep and then spends all
night studying Dr Spock.
We have to ask at this point: Where is the New Man in modern cinema? The
film heroes on video this month include Arnold Schwarzenegger stomping
around futuristic Los Angeles smashing everything and everyone in sight in
Terminator 2 (Guild); Bruce Willis brawling and ladykilling across New York
and Europe in Hudson Hawk (20: 20); a whole lot of gun-toting blacks
blasting us out of our sofas in New Jack City (Warner); and Gerard Depardieu
battering Isabelle Huppert into romantic submission in the French film
Loulou (Artificial Eye).
Popular ideology likes the New Man. Popular entertainment loathes him. And
video culture may be part of the reason. With its stress on
short-attention-span storytelling, where every scene must pack a punch to
keep the home viewer's finger off the fast-forward button and his mind off
the rival TV channels, video demands high-definition heroes with no-nonsense
virility.
The world sometimes makes penance for this by throwing charity money at a
film like Dances With Wolves (Guild). But there is a deep and essential
Jekyll-and-Hyde duality in the simultaneous rise of the caring male in
modern sociological fashion and the Cro-Magnon super-hero in modern
cinematic fashion.
Indeed in today's movies the sensitive male must be surreal to be believed.
He must be the crazed, poetic, topiarising youth created by a mad scientist
in Edward Scissorhands (Fox), where he is played by Johnny Depp in
all-Gothic leather as if he were Harpo Marx mugged by Kenneth Anger. Tim
Burton's fantasia in small-town America comes to us from the same
writer-director who gave us Batman (Warners). In this, you recall, the hero
is a masked avenger by night (all-male superhero) and a home-loving fellow
by day (New Man), played by a Michael Keaton best-known previously for
man-with-apron roles like Mr Mom.
In Edward Scissorhands the New Man is a gentle, adorable freak. In period
guise he is much the same in Peter Medak's film of the Craig-Bentley case
Let Him Have It (1st Independent), where Bentley is a sweetnatured fellow of
deprived IQ driven towards violence by his evil twin Craig. Medak builds a
stylish, moody picture of 1950s Britain in this true-life tale of travestied
justice - Bentley was hanged for a policeman's murder he neither committed
nor probably abetted - and he sharpens without caricaturing the contrast
between the gangling, slow-witted hero and his pintsize Mephistopheles pal.
As the sum of these films shows, the cinema has a wonderful counterbalancing
instinct. Every ideological posture that a new age brings provokes an equal
and opposite counter-posture. For every gentle chap brought shyly towards
the centre of action from screen left, his opposite is sent stomping in from
screen right.
Which brings us back to the Stone Age superheroes we started with. I have
tried to dislike Terminator 2, with its preposterous superhunk throwing his
weight around post-nuclear LA But dear me, I would rather have Arnold
Schwarzenegger in this mad, mythopoeic, metamorphic form than Kevin Costner
tending the winsome Indians in Dances With Revisionism.
I cannot so keenly recommend Hudson Hawk or New Jack City: sometimes
thick-eared machismo is just thick-eared machismo. But you should try the
European thinking man's answer to Mr Schwarzenegger, namely Monsieur
Depardieu. In Maurice Pialat's Loulou our Gerard is not so much a New Man,
more an ageing hippie driven by Bachanialian demons. He sweeps a
stunned-looking Isabelle Huppert off her feet, pushes aside her maturer
boyfriend (Guy Marchand) and generally behaves as if he would not recognise
Political Correctness between the sexes if it fell down from the sky and
beaned him.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Potter with a Modernist eye - Susan Moore admires the
work of Lucy Rie at the Crafts Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCIE RIE is Britain's greatest living potter, a Dame of the British Empire,
and 90 in March. She has been making pots for 65 years. In 1938 she fled
Vienna and settled in London, bringing with her the Modernist aesthetic of
the avant-garde designers and craftsmen of the Wiener Werkstatte. It could
not have been in greater contrast to the traditions informing the studio
pottery movement burgeoning in Britain under the aegis of Bernard Leach.
Rie set up a studio in a London mews rather than at an idyllic rural
retreat, even installing the state-of-the-art fittings designed for her
Viennese apartment by the architect Ernest Plischke. While Leach and his
school looked to the workaday fat-bellied jugs of the medieval English
potters and to weighty Japanese stonewares, Rie produced vessels of a
striking refinement and formal purity. Her thinly potted wares were more in
keeping with the metropolitan dining room than the rustic kitchen table.
Moreover, they belonged to the present.
The 180 or so pieces gathered together for the 90th birthday retrospective
at the Crafts Council Gallery have an unexpectedly powerful presence.
Together they reveal a rigorous intelligence at work. Rie's self-imposed
parameters have allowed for perhaps a dozen simple bowl and vase forms, all
made on the wheel. For six decades they have been honed and constantly
adapted, and been the vehicle for exhaustive experimentation with a range of
complex glazes. Decoration is almost confined to these rich glazes, which
are applied with a broad brush to the unfired clay. Only rarely are there
patterns to distract the eye from her sweeping clean-cut lines.
Rie is aesthetically as well as technically a classical potter, and her
Modernist's eye took in the purest and most pared down ceramic traditions of
past and present. We find echoes of prehistoric pots, early Islamic
fritwares and Chinese porcelains, and of contemporary Scandinavian design
and the sculptural forms of her friend and one-time assistant Hans Coper.
The best of her work seems at once timeless and firmly rooted in its age.
This exhibition traces the evolution of forms, and of glazes. Its strength -
and novelty - is the extent to which it concentrates on materials and
techniques rather than on aesthetics alone, aspects crucial to the
understanding of an artist as subtlely experimental as Lucie Rie. Curator
Margot Coatts has engaged the services of ceramic technologist Nigel Woods,
whose lucid catalogue essay benefits both layman and potter.
From the first, Rie was innovative, producing in Vienna unusual mottled
glazes that prefigure later work. These were earthenwares with stoneware
glazes; when she took up stoneware in 1948-49 she kept to her electric kiln
and produced effects quite different from those achieved in the traditional
flame-fired kilns. Rie obviously liked the minimalist simplicity of pots
that were made in a single firing, and decorative effects that were integral
to the process of manufacture. She began with dry glazing and sgraffito,
moving on to mixing reactive colouring oxides into the clay, and tocombining
different coloured clays. The results of these marblings are spectacular,
where bold zebra stripes spiral up the long necks of tall vases.
Characteristically, decorative effects depend on taking away rather than on
adding ornament. The elegant coffee-bean colour cups of the 1950s, for
instance, are articulated by finely hatched lines scratched through the
manganese glaze to the clay body. Textures also bring interest to a surface
without recourse to additional colours. The glazes of unusually monumental
and coarse stonewaresare bubbled and pitted like pebbles, or carved with
deep furrows and burred as if knitted with Shetland wool.
Especially pleasing are the infinitely varied surfaces of white porcelains
that are reminiscent of Chinese Liao wares. Combinations of glazes juxtapose
whites that are opaque and matt, gleaming or slightly frosted. Surfaces may
be smooth or crazed, left unglazed or decorated with raised dots. One tall
bowl takes aboard three rings of inlaid mauve pigment.
The range of colours is surprisingly broad. Rie can introduce colour with
great subtlety, whether in a single band in a single vessel or in, say, the
ochres and olives used inside an elegant breakfast set of 1949-50. Boldness
is rewarded too in glazes of brilliant uranium yellow or deep turquoise.
Least successful, even deeply unpleasant, are the exploding 'volcanic'
surfaces of bubblegum pink and blue.
The show ends with a case of the utilitarian pottery buttons, buckles and
hair pins, and a mirror frame, that Rie was obliged to produce in the years
immediately following the war. It would have been fitting to have added the
couture buttons Rie made for the Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake in
1989.
Lucie Rie continues at the Crafts Council Gallery, 44a Pentonville Road,
Islington, until April 5.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Madonna runs with the pack - Antony Thorncroft
discusses trends in the art market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE'VE HAD Madonna the slut; can we now expect Madonna the Saint? The rock
shocker has long been a serious collector of art - she employs a personal
curator - but one of predictably garish taste. Typical of her acquisitions
was a self portrait by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo seen emerging from her
mother's womb, which hangs alongside Picasso nudes and the camp beauties of
the 1930s artist Tamara.
But at the recent New York auctions of Old Masters Madonna dramatically
changed tack, paying Dollars 814,000 at Sotheby's for a panel ascribed to
the Master of 1310 and depicting scenes from the life of a female saint,
probably Margaret of Antioch. Perhaps Madonna identified with the tableau of
the saint being consumed by serpents - obviously critics.
If Madonna is now buying Madonnas she is running with the pack. The New York
Old Master auctions gave the strongest proof yet that buyers are returning
to the art market. With US interest rates below 4 per cent there is little
point in keeping your money in the bank. Why not pick up some envy by
hanging a decorative 18th century French pastorale, or a Dutch still life,
on your appartment wall. Estimates at the sales had been cunningly reduced
to attract bids, and everyone seemed happy.
There is no desire to have another flutter in the speculative area of
Impressionist and 20th century art - too many Japanese owned paintings are
waiting to be absorbed before that market improves - but the prices of Old
Masters have always been underpinned by museum and connoisseur buying, and
although some dealers are forbidden by their banks to acquire fresh stock,
private demand for the more picturesque paintings was most encouraging.
The December Old Master sales in London did not show the same depth of
interest (the domestic demand for such works is pitiful) but the exceptional
lots did well, notably a Venus and Adonis, now firmly attributed to the
brush of Titian, which sold for Pounds 7.4m to a duo of dealers Hazlitt,
Gooden and Fox, and Herman Sickman. If an export licence is forthcoming -
and since the sum involved almost equals the total annual purchasing grants
of all the national museums and galleries there is little point in delay -
the Titian is destined for the Getty in Malibu, where it will eventually
join the portrait of Pope Clement VII by Sebastiano del Piombo, currently on
show at Agnew's in Bond Street while awaiting its export licence.
With Sotheby's and Christie's in London quieter than for decades, now is the
time for the dealers to tempt buyers. Agnew's is currently offering the pick
of its vaults, including works by Tintoretto, Fra Angelico, Turner, etc, in
a show to celebrate its 175th anniversary (and it is already poised to sell
four paintings) while across the road Leger will shortly celebrate its
centenary with a good show of English landscapes.
There was a welcome outbreak of spots at the Royal Academy this week, each
marking yet another print sold at the Original Print Fair, which ends
tomorrow. The rash virtually covered the stand of the Californian dealer Ray
Lewis. He had brought along a group of prints by Hokusai, the Japanese
master.
It was a shrewd move. A few yards away the RA is holding a major Hokusai
exhibition, which contains at least four of the prints on the Lewis stand.
Rich enthusiasts could suddenly pop down and buy, for up to Dollars 75,000,
what previously they could only admire. Such serendipity was pushed further.
Flowers Graphics was selling prints by Michael Rothenstein a week before a
display of his boxes opens at the RA and the New York dealer Hill-Stone was
planning to offer for sale a print by Mantegna. The print is actually at the
RA but as part of the great Mantegna exhibition: the National Gallery in
Washington bought it from Hill-Stone last autumn and has loaned it to the
show.
Print dealers have ridden the recession better than most. Expensive American
contemporary prints by Johns, Hockney, Warhol, etc, and prints once bought
by the Japanese - by Picasso, Chagall, etc, have been hammered, but Old
Master print dealers have hardly noticed a downturn and connoisseur demand
for good 19th and early 20th century prints has also held up well.
At the Fair you can still buy a Gillray lampoon of the Prince Regent for
less than Pounds 300, (Andrew Edmunds sold 30 of them on the first day), or
a Cotman landscape for the same sum. Or a Matisse for Pounds 14,000; an
Augustus John self portrait for Pounds 10,000; a Victor Passmore for Pounds
500; a Piranesi view of Rome for Pounds 1,500; a Rembrandt for Dollars
48,000; and a Munch for Dollars 100,000. The most expensive item marks the
moment when prints officially became art. It is the cover created by
Toulouse-Lautrec for 'L'estampe originale', the book of prints published in
Paris in 1893. Across it T-L scrawled 'passe'. It costs Dollars 150,000.
Unlike most dealers traders in prints seem more interested in their stock
than in money. Last week's specialist art fairs in London - of watercolours
and contemporary art - hinted tentatively at a revival in the market. The
Print Fair, with attendances up on 1991, is drawing attention to the fact.
Do you fancy Eros as a garden ornament? A copy, one of nine made in 1986
from Alfred Gilbert's original cast, is on offer at the Silver &amp; Jewellery
Fair which opens at the Park Lane Hotel next Friday. It is part of the loan
exhibition on The Triumph of Love 1530-1930 but its owners, the Fine Art
Society, will sell it for around Pounds 190,000.
The FAS has already sold seven of its copies and is permitted to cast one
more , the tenth. After that the original plaster is to be locked away for
25 years. Eros was made from aluminium, so original in the 1890s, so
vulnerable now. Since the Piccadilly Circus Eros seems ill fated - it is
currently boarded up again awaiting more repairs - it would be a smart idea
to find it a safe retirement home in the V&amp;A next year, when it reaches its
centenary. Then an Eros fashioned from the uncast plaster, with appropriate
metallic strengthening of the vulnerable legs, could bestride the Circus.
The Art Newspaper has absorbed the New York based Journal of Art , acquiring
its 11,000 subscribers and its title. Thus ends four years of internecine
strife. The two papers, both dedicated to news and well informed art world
gossip, had begun within weeks of each other in late 1990. They respectively
by Umberto Allemandi and Barbara Rose who had been previously been
publishing partners before a spectacular fall out. Given the recession, and
the dearth of advertising, it was unlikely that both would survive. The
Journal of Art ran up a loss of Dollars 2.5m and has waved the white flag.
Bloomsbury Book Auctions is bringing back to London sales devoted to Hebrew
books and Judaica, a flourishing market until Sotheby's and Christie's
switched their specialist auctions to Jerusalem and New York. Bloomsbury
thinks its time to cultivate the market again.
At the same auction house on February 13 one of the largest art reference
libraries for years is for sale. It was owned by the late Denys Sutton, the
long time art critic of the FT. These are not just pretty books with lots of
pictures. dealers can't operate without the catalogues raisonnes of leading
artists, and rare editions can cost more than Pounds 10,000. On offer here
are the standard works on Degas, Cezanne, Renoir and Pissarro, all priced at
around Pounds 1,500 each.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: A look at the Pop era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1960s, it seems, are always with us, at once so ambiguous and so
positive, so hopeful and so meretricious, so stylish and so vulgar. How we
believed then, in that false dawn, when we would throw off the shackles of
the stuffy, academic past, reform the art schools and so move forward into
that brave new world.
Up to a point we did, forgetting that it was precisely that old formal
academic grounding, with its emphasis on observation, understanding and
technique, that allowed us the luxury of our precocious posturings. If last
autumn's Pop Art Show at the Royal Academy taught us anything, it was that
the British variety was so much the better made than the American, richer
and more complex in its references and associations, for all the superficial
gloss.
For Ready Steady Go at the Royal Festival Hall (until February 23, then on
an extensive tour well into 1993), the South Bank Centre draws upon the Arts
Council's own collection of work of the 1960s, bought at the time, cheap and
cheerful. The title may naturally evoke the generality of Pop, but it does
so with a gentle, perhaps unconscious irony. What it offers is another look
at those supposed Pop artists in company with those of their contemporaries
similarly engaged with the currency of American art, albeit the nouvelle
vague of hard-edge and post-painterly abstraction.
There on the one hand are Blake, Hockney, Kiff, Hodgkin, Caulfield, on the
other Hoyland, Huxley, Ayres, Riley, Moon, Denny, Irwin and Sedgely; and
somewhere in between come Tilson and Smith. What comes through is a sense of
a well-mannered and thoughtful engagement, responsive to what was going on
in the world but still its own creature, an authentic national school,
distinct in its sensibility from any other, and certainly no worse. As such
it was the staple of our official representation in major shows and
festivals at home and abroad throughout the period.
But it was never the whole story, and the absence here of such artists as
Auerbach, Freud and Kossoff, to say nothing of that far larger group of
older figurative artists centred upon the Academy, the Royal College and the
Slade - Weight, de Grey, Coker, Middleditch, Symons, George, Buhler,
Greenham, Coldstream, Gowing and the rest - is conspicuous. Perhaps other
shows are mooted to put the record straight, but serious questions remain
about the nature of our public patronage, that at every period would seem to
celebrate quite arbitrarily work of a certain kind above all others, a
matter not of merit at all, though that may be high enough, but of pure
luck.
Figurative painters were by no means the only ones to suffer, then or later.
A positive response to American abstract expressionism in the late 1950s was
all very well, but the fashion soon changed. The awkward fact is that some
of our very best painters suffered long neglect in consequence. The Pomeroy
Purdy Gallery (at Jacob Street Film Studios, Mill Street SE1, until February
22) is showing the work of four of them, dating not from the 1960s but from
the years either side of 1980.
Two are in Ready Steady Go, but then John Hoyland had yet to evolve from the
colour-field towards actual expressionism, and Gillian Ayres was to be all
but ignored for the next 15 years. Here her paintings are at their most
mysterious and atmospheric, the surfaces dense and impacted, the colour rich
and deep, the spaces unspecific. They are neither better nor worse than her
more recent work, that is more open, graphic, more particular in its
suggestion of landscape: only different, and very beautiful.
Basil Beattie, who has lately emerged as among our most authoritative
painters, seemed then to be painting the paintings one might almost hope
Hoyland would paint now, for being freer in the gesture, less dry and flat
in the paint itself, and more open in imagery and surface. Here Hoyland's
prints are so much the more confident, integrated and expansive in the
handling.
And there is Brian Fielding, who died in 1987. He showed seldom, and so
slipped through the net, but to his peers and students he was a constant
standard and abiding influence and example. His paintings here are in the
true character of his work, the sensibility at once oriental and occidental,
the surfaces flat yet deep, the statement painterly yet calligraphic. He
held such contradictions in perfect balance, with deceptive ease and true
conviction.

THE GREAT RECKONING by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg Sidgwick &amp;
Jackson Pounds 20, 531 pages
'If you enjoyed reading this book, you may enjoy reading Strategic
Investment, the private financial advisory service edited by James Dale
Davidson and Lord Rees-Mogg.'
If? If you enjoy reading this book, you ought to see a psychiatrist. It is
not a bad book, but it is hard to see how any sane or sensitive reader could
enjoy it. After all, the authors claim a high rate of verification for their
previous oracles, and here they forecast some perfectly appalling events,
whose realisation would leave few of us unhurt.
The message is that our present decade is, and will be, dominated by a
Depression. Not a Recession: a Depression. The Great Reckoning is with Debt,
which is here monstered into a global Babylonian Captivity. But the book's
compass collects enough social observations to deject even those readers
with no great investments at stake. If the authors were a couple of marginal
quack seers cashing in on some fin de siecle doom, those observations might
be comfortably ignored: but when it is the former editor of The Times
telling us that the media are worthless for understanding world events; when
it is the current Chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council pointing
out that television distributes violence into society, then it is serious.
Generally, the message makes sense. Its principal thrust - that America's
power is waning, and Japan's ascendant - was rehearsed by Oswald Spengler.
(The main difference is that what used to be known as the 'yellow peril' is
now known as 'Pacific hegemony'.) We know that Islam has supplanted Marxism
as the terror of the West. We can imagine that the lesson of the Gulf War,
for the losing side, is to persevere with terrorism and aim to possess
nuclear weapons. And most of us must be able to testify to an increased
impingement of violence upon our lives. So there is nothing grossly new
here: but give world analysis a new name ('megapolitics') and put it in the
hands of two lively writers, and you have a powerful synthesis.
Apart from prudent hedging in the markets - the book closes with some terse
financial advice - how are we supposed to respond?
British readers may take some consolation. The socio-political upholstery of
the book is mostly American, and America is not an invariable prototype of
Britain. Moreover, the logic of gloomy statistics is not always sound. The
homicide figures for some parts of the US seem horrifyingly high: but when
you consider that in some parts of the US buying a gun is as easy as buying
a pound of butter (some shops sell both), you might argue that the homicide
figures are surprisingly low.
Some of the evidence for American decline is very impressionistic (eg the
anecdotal 'fact' that Lord Rees-Mogg was kept waiting for his tea at the
Waldorf Hotel in New York) and the referencing of American decline to the
decline of the Roman Empire (also done recently by Alistair Cooke) fails to
make a completely cogent metaphor. After all, as Gibbon himself saw, the
'fall' of the Roman Empire is intricately tangled with the 'rise' of
Christianity. Without some positive force for change, it is hard to see how
Attila the Creditor or Attila the Crack-Dealer can single-handedly ruin a
country as resourceful as the US.
There is an enviable range in the authors' historical models, and the
arrangement of arguments within a farrago of sub-headings works well.
Academic jargon is liberally used, accompanied by steady sniping at academic
targets, particularly modern historians. On one page there is a 'glut' of
historians; on another, historians have 'emptied their classrooms' by
abandoning 'the old-fashioned notion that history has lessons'. Lord
Rees-Mogg's great-grandfather (1815-1908) is reckoned to have lived in
stable times: we are told that 'if anyone was entitled to believe in
continuity, he was'. Perhaps; but some of his contemporaries (eg Matthew
Arnold) were deeply convinced of decline.
And there, I suppose, is a possible key to response. If history is a branch
of rhetoric, calculating the future on the basis of historical patterns is
an extension of that rhetoric. The rhetoric of pessimism is here displayed
as well as I have ever seen it, complete with epigraph from Jeremiah: it
would be a fine extended sermon if it did not so candidly eschew any kind of
morality other than profit equals good and loss equals bad.
How seriously you take the predictions then depends on how far you share the
authors' view of human nature. Their grim citations of ghetto rap 'lyrics'
combine with stockbroking bullishness ('The ultimate law is the law of the
jungle') to test a philanthropic spirit. It is worth remembering that their
previous book was entitled Blood in the Streets. A text peppered with
oracular substantives ('Armageddon', 'Time-Bomb', etc.) either demeans those
terms, or else seeks to shock. It may be that, like the Fat Boy in Pickwick,
Davidson and Rees-Mogg simply want to make our flesh creep. I, like others,
would want to replace Jeremiah 8:20 ('The harvest is past, the summer is
ended, and we are not saved') with Jeremiah 32:15 ('. . . Houses and fields
and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land'). But pain and terror
and cruelty have visited the 20th century too often for anyone to shrug
their shoulders at a book like this.

WRITERS ON WORLD WAR II: AN ANTHOLOGY edited by Mordecai Richler Chatto &amp;
Windus Pounds 18.99, 727 pages
THE ESSENTIAL experience of the first world war was epitomised in
comparatively few books, by writers who were also soldiers - prose-books by
Edmund Blunden, Robert Graves, Guy Chapman, Frederic Manning, David Jones,
poetry by Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Isaac Rosenberg among others. A
good anthology like (say) Ian Parsons' Men Who March Away, even though
restricted to poetry, sums up what it felt like to have fought in that war.
With the second world war, the job of putting within the covers of a single
book a selection that can stand for the war-experience as a whole seems like
an impossible task. Yet this is what the Canadian novelist Mordecai Richler
has just done and he has included writing relating to the period between
1939 to 1945 by poets, novelists and journalists from anywhere and
everywhere. Some of the extracts were penned while the crucial events of the
war were actually unfolding, like the American war correspondent William L.
Shirer's account, from his Berlin Diary, of the impact in Germany of
Hitler's invasion of Poland. Other pieces, like the poet George Macbeth's
description of how as a small boy he woke up on the cellar floor with his
hair full of grit after the family home had been destroyed in 1940 by blast
from an air-raid, were set down as recently as 1989.
Richler's aim was to make a mosaic. It is in the event a wonderfully rich
mosaic but one from which no single pattern or overall impression emerges.
There is only the feeling throughout that war concentrates the mind
wonderfully and causes people to write well, that war encourages heroism and
brutality, self-sacrifice and sadism, in equal measure.
We begin on the first of September, 1939 with Auden sitting, 'in one of the
dives/ On Fifty-second Street/ Uncertain and afraid/ as the clever hopes
expire/ Of a low dishonest decade.' We conclude on the second of September
1945 with General MacArthur aboard the battleship Missouri flanked by
Admirals Nimitz and Halsey, greeting Yoshijiro Umezu, chief of Japan's
imperial general staff and his naval operations officer, as they climb
aboard to sign the document of capitulation.
William Manchester, author of that extract, served with the US Marines
during the war. Earlier in the book, in the 1942 section, he gives an
equally vivid account of his training period at the 'boot' (recruit) camp on
Parris Island, South Carolina. The process of indoctrination - he confesses
he loved it - included such joys as getting concussed on the forehead by a
rifle-butt.
This eloquent piece is mirrored on the other side of the Atlantic in J.
Maclaren-Ross's recollection of the Infantry Training Camp at Blandford,
Essex. During his time there Private Ross J observed a demonstration of the
strength of a tin-helmet. A recruit was instructed to strike the corporal
with the butt of his rifle as hard as he could on the head. Unfortunately
under the impact of the blow a loose screw inside the helmet caused the poor
corporal to slump instantly to the ground, spurting blood, followed by the
recruit fainting in horror.
The hazardous violence of training is as nothing beside the violence of the
fighting and bombing and the cruelties of captivity and conquest with which
the book is full - the fall of Singapore (JG Farrell); repercussions in
Prague after Heydrich was assassinated (Joseph Skvorecky); Southern GIs from
Kentucky taken prisoner in Manila (Studs Terkel); the Jewish Council
rounding up boys to send to the labour camps after the annihilation of the
Warsaw ghetto (Chaim Kaplan); aircrew in the New Hebrides making lethal
sorties during the battle of Guadalcanal (James Michener) - and much, much
more.
As one extract follows another the degree of suffering meted out by the war
changes in ferocity in the most arbitrary fashion. On the one hand there are
heart-rending holocaust memories by Elie Weisel and Primo Levi, on the other
the mood of irritation reflected in diary extracts by Noel Coward ('Dined at
Ivy. Conversation with Bobbie Helpmann about how difficult it is to keep the
Ballet going with people being called up all the time.')
I was disappointed not to find some of my favourite descriptions of the war
as it affected people in Britain. Plenty of Orwell and pieces from the
obvious names, Pritchett, Connolly, Woolf, Bowen, Waugh, MacNeice and Dylan
Thomas, but the fireman writers who described the blitz so well like Henry
Green and William Sansom are notable for their absence. Lots from Richard
Hillary, but nothing from Rattigan's Flare Path.
But Richler says he assembled three times as much material as he had room
for. And even when so much was discarded what remains is a big book in every
sense, global in scope, and illuminating people's ability to make a truthful
record of their experience after they have been stretched to the limits of
their endurance.

A LONG COLD FALL by Sam Reaves Serpent's Tail Pounds 7.99
TWILIGHT AT MAC'S PLACE by Ross Thomas Scribner's Pounds 12.95, 304 pages
PASTIME by Robert B Parker Viking Pounds 14.99, 224 pages
THE SONG DOG by James McClure Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 13.99, 281 pages
A FRIEND came to stay in Washington some years ago. He spent a week pounding
the streets, checking the walking distance from the White House to the State
Department, the menu at Jean-Pierre, the ratio of Ethiopian to Ghanaian taxi
drivers. He was writing a thriller. It was not bad either, and not only
because I could not detect a single mistake in his description and use of
location.
Obviously lots of things go into making a good suspense novel and several of
them need to come together for it to come off well. They include the ability
to write dialogue, describe sex and violence, build characters and plot. But
all this can be undermined if the feel for location, and the people who
inhabit it, is wrong. Equally, location alone cannot compensate for
deficiencies in the other vital ingredients.
These four books get it pretty much right. Three are set in the US, in
Boston, Chicago and Washington, and the fourth in South Africa, black and
white. Three are by old hands and one by a newcomer.
Sam Reaves, the ingenue of the quartet, can write. A Long Cold Fall has a
great first sentence and does not subsequently let go. Cooper, the Vietnam
veteran and Chicago taxi driver, does not really invite trouble, but in
trying to find out who killed a woman he had once loved and who is trying to
kill her teenage son - who turns out to be his own - he does not avoid it
either. This book contains the most explicit and unpleasant violent scenes
of the four, but they are handled with accuracy, dispatch and some style.
And Chicago comes out as a mean town. There are cops and waitresses with
hearts of gold, naturally, but tough exteriors. There is a lot of low life
and some on the high side and in high rises. It is not a book the city
council would promote, though most of them would probably find it hard to
put down.
Ross Thomas's Twilight at Mac's Place deals in ex-spies and is set where
most of them hang out - in Washington. The milieu is softer but no less
accurate. If Mac's Place itself, the restaurant bar run by two former CIA
men, does not exist, there are a number like it where the trade is
Scotch-and-conspiracy, past and present. The plot - the search for the
memoirs of the late CIA agent Steadfast Haynes - is deftly handled and, if
the denouement is guessable three quarters of the way through, readability
does not flag.
Robert B Parker, who is fulsome in praise of the first two authors on their
dust jackets, is now like an old shoe and Spenser, his Boston private eye, a
familiar figure. Perhaps because he does not need to parade location any
more, the city itself is never more than a backdrop.
In Pastime Parker handles his big set pieces as well as ever, be it the
finale in the Public Gardens or the hunting of the wounded Spenser in the
Massachusetts woods. But that is not really what makes Spenser books
beguiling: it is because literate cynics make good heroes.
The Song Dog, by James McClure, returns his two well- established
detectives, Tromp Kramer the white Afrikaner and Mickey Zondi the black, to
the beginning of their collaboration, solving a nasty double murder in
backwoods northern Zululand. Kramer investigates the white community and
Zondi the black in ways that turn out to be complementary. From initial
mistrust the relationship evolves, perhaps predictably but not
sentimentally, into one of respect (though it is not hard to guess who, in
the end, saves whose life).
Not having read the earlier books and not really knowing the respective
cultures means I was taking a lot on trust, but there is a ring of
authenticity to the locale and enough intrinsic interest in a complex plot
to make it worthwhile checking out the predecessors. The very last page,
however, has a chilling hint suggesting that the South African equivalent of
the Reichenbach Falls is around the corner.
That is something that Robert Parker is obviously not yet contemplating for
Spenser. Sam Reaves's Cooper could be a one-off creation, but Chicago as a
location certainly is not. Mind you, it never was.

NEW WRITING edited by Malcolm Bradbury and Judy Cooke Minerva, with the
British Council Pounds 6.99, 389 pages
ONE OF Britain's most intangible yet important exports is itself - its
cultural richness, its history, its language. No-one can accurately say how
much British culture is worth in foreign earnings per annum; a precise
financial figure would in any case be irrelevant to the fact that, once
Britain has finally settled into its economic place as an ordinary European
power, it may nevertheless still deserve recognition as a centre for
artistic excellence.
If such recognition is forthcoming it will largely be thanks to the
evangelising success of the British Council, the government-funded agency
which seeks to foster better international understanding of British culture
in all its manifestations. The publication of a new anthology of British
writing by the Council is thus an occasion for celebration, even though the
anthology itself is a peculiar bouillabaisse. Full of succulent spicy
extracts, it is also unfortunately laced with some purple, pulpy,
scarcely-digestible chunks.
The anthology is an entirely new venture for the Council. Previously its
literature department was best known for a fine series of pamphlets  - no
longer published - under the generic title Writers and Their Work. 'The
'writer and his work' idea is now rather discredited, and we are aware of an
overseas demand for up-to-date, contemporary literature,' explains Harriet
Harvey Wood, head of literature at the Council's London headquarters.
The idea behind the new anthology is to 'get overseas countries to
understand the younger writers coming up, those who may one day become the
new Iris Murdochs. It's organised on what I call Beecham lollipop principle;
the conductor Thomas Beecham would introduce unfamiliar works in amongst the
popular classics, or lollipops, and that's just what we are trying to do
here, sprinkle some new writers in amongst the famous and familiar names.'
The anthology is being sponsored by Whitbread and Booker, the two companies
which also provide the biggest annual UK prizes for fiction, and
Waterstone's, the bookstore chain. Without their support it would probably
not have got off the ground. The Arts Council is providing funding which
will go into next year's edition.
The only real comparison in the UK is the quarterly magazine Granta, though
as Harriet Harvey Wood argues, Granta is more a forum for up-market
journalism now than a purely literary magazine. As Malcolm Bradbury says in
his editorial, the death of Encounter has left a gap in the market; New
Writing hopes to go towards occupying it.
Bradbury, novelist and redoubtable supporter of many a British Council
venture, and Judy Cooke, a former editor of the now defunct Fiction
magazine, will also edit next year's edition before handing over the reins.
The aim over the years is to build a changing perspective of developments in
British literature.
The first volume of New Writing is heavily weighted towards fiction and
critical essays. There is no drama, little poetry, and genres which have
been undergoing a revival in the UK, such as crime fiction, are
unrepresented.
One of the problems with the anthology is that it has two readerships.
British readers may find the selection of material by such established
writers as AS Byatt, Angela Carter, David Lodge, Doris Lessing and Martin
Amis a little over-familiar. But such contributors provide a reassuring
familiarity for overseas readers, who know what they are getting; solid
reliable stuff it is too. The editors hope that the large sample of fresh
writing from writers little-known in the UK will entice British readers
without discouraging those from overseas.
Among the strongest contributions are those by David Lodge, who absorbingly
updates his earlier influential essay on the novelist at the crossroads; a
new writer, Geoff Dyer, forcefully reflects on Britain's class structure as
it impinges on its literary prejudices; and AS Byatt contributes a wrily
witty story. There is a handful of good poems, though the principle behind
their selection is obscure.
But there are also some bad pieces, including a dreadful adolescent rant
about the Gulf war from Lucy Ellman, a disappointingly portentous piece from
last year's Booker prize winner, Ben Okri, a peculiarly limp short story
from Doris Lessing, and an astonishingly predictable story about a piranha
fish by a new novelist, Lesley Glaister.
Some pieces - such as Michael Ignatieff's essay on the intellectual being of
post cold-War Europe - are likely to date very quickly. Moreover, budget
constraints have made themselves felt in the book's design; why have the
drawings of the Council's London base, Spring Gardens, all lumped together
rather than more decoratively spread throughout? In the end, for a little
more cash, foreign readers could have been so much more impressed both by
the writing and the printing.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Books: De Beauvoir, still a centre of industry

<BYLINE>
   By A. C. GRAYLING

<TEXT>
SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR: THE WOMAN AND HER WORK by Margaret Crosland Heinemann
Pounds 20, 463 pages
IN THE last years of her life Simone de Beauvoir was the centre of an
industry. Admirers flocked to her rue Schoelcher studio in Montparnasse to
pay court, among them journalists and academics intent on writing about her
thoughts, her life, or both. She had become, qua subject of study, highly
marketable in publishing terms. Much of the interest was undoubtedly
prompted by her relationship to Sartre. After his death she became keeper of
the keys to his memory; no-one came to him but by her. But some of the
interest was legitimately her own, partly because a later generation of
feminists wished to applaud her contribution to their cause, and partly
because her literary merits were coming to be properly appreciated: for, by
any standards, de Beauvoir has to count among the outstanding writers of
20th-century France.
Among the products of this industry are three large biographies. In addition
to the third and latest by Margaret Crosland, under review here, are those
by Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier, published in 1985, and Deirdre Bair
published in 1991. No doubt Bair and Crosland are dismayed to find
themselves flooding the market, a sentiment which will deepen when critical
opinion comes to agree, as it will, that the earliest of the three
biographies - the Francis and Gontier - is anyway best.
But controversy promises to come to the rescue; Sartre and de Beauvoir are
news again both in France and among interested parties abroad, as a result
of the publication last year of Une si douce occupation by the historian
Gilbert Joseph. In it the couple's claim to active roles in the Resistance
are devastatingly challenged. The Paris literary papers have divided over
the issue, and few are content to dismiss the matter, as one new year
reveller in a Boul' Mich' cafe did, with a Gallic shrug: 'After the war
everyone claimed to be in the Resistance; perhaps one should believe them
and leave it at that.' Controversy breeds interest, or revives it when it
has flagged; either way, it sells books. On the back of Joseph's
nerve-touching attack, the French translation of Bair's biography is selling
briskly in Paris.
Any biographer of de Beauvoir has, in one way, an easy task because of the
copiousness of the materials available, for one of the chief aims of de
Beauvoir's intellectual efforts seems to have been the construction, with a
eye to posterity, of a carefully managed self-portrait. All her work is
autobiographical in the richest sense. Her five volumes of memoirs and
several more of letters, her novels and most of her other non-fiction works,
all in one way or another elaborate her preferred vision of her life. It is
a commonplace that writers plunder themselves for materials, but de Beauvoir
did much more: she indulged in self-justifying self-recreation, motivated by
a powerful vanity. In the late 1970s de Beauvoir arranged to be the subject
of a television documentary, saying that she wished to 'present the truth'
about herself. Francis and Gontier show how avidly de Beauvoir sought to
massage that truth; to their credit they resist temptations to abet her.
Margaret Crosland is less critical, more often content to accept de
Beauvoir's version. One example concerns de Beauvoir's Parisian childhood.
The de Beauvoirs were impoverished bourgeois, obliged to make do in a small
apartment above an unfashionable street. From a rear window could be seen a
boulevard inhabited by rich people. In her autobiography de Beauvoir so
paints matters that one would think her family lived there. Francis and
Gontier expose the manoeuvre and its many implications for de Beauvoir's
account of her early life. Crosland simply repeats de Beauvoir's words.
Nor does Crosland give the nasty side of Sartre and de Beauvoir its due
emphasis. Their recently published wartime correspondence reveals devouring
egos in which third parties were first swallowed up and then spat out in
sexually exploitative tangles of Byzantine complexity.
But if Crosland is insufficiently challenging, her account has the virtue of
this vice: with little distraction from analysis or criticism the reader is
taken through a story which, however plainly told, cannot fail to fascinate,
for it is woven into important aspects of literature and politics in the
central decades of France's 20th-century history, above all with the often
tumultuous post-war resettlement of French society.
People might wish to read about de Beauvoir's life for this reason, or
because they are interested in the light it throws on Sartre. Or they might
recognise that this vain, unlikeable, highly gifted woman could prove to be
a more important literary figure, in the long view of history, than Sartre
himself; and for that reason alone she merits our attention.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Books: Egypt in the raw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT

<TEXT>
DOWN TO THE SEA by Gamil Atia Ibrahim Quartet Books Pounds 14.95, 220 pages
NEAR THE limestone Muqattam hills in the south east of Cairo lies the City
of the Dead. This complex of mausolea, small houses and tombs now houses a
million inhabitants. They first started coming to Cairo from the countryside
in the 1960s lured by the hopes of work generated by Nasser's socialist
policies. But they found no housing and turned this area into a city of the
living which has been as good as legalised by the state.
These inhabitants - the 'sea' - are the main players. Dr Sabir, one of the
main characters, describes where they live: 'The sea of Cairo. The sea of
the cemetery. This is the real sea. Hell. The poor. The hungry. Thieves.
Rich men. Traders. Prostitutes. Perverts. Drugs. A strange, mad world, full
of good people.'
They are the raw material of the Egyptian nation and strive through
education and hard work to break free of this 'sea' and cross to the better
life they believe can be had on the west bank of the Nile. There is no one
hero to this book but several, whose lives and aspirations move in circles
which from time to time touch each other. This is described in the style of
the realist school of the Egyptian novel, of which Neguib Mahfouz, the Nobel
prize winner, was the pioneer. Ibrahim resembles Mahfouz in that his focus
is on the struggles of the poorer classes, but his style is more abrupt and
elliptical.
One central character is Sayyid, a son of the cemetery, who lies in a
hospital, itself a metaphor for Egypt's decay, after losing a foot in a
train accident. He has experienced most of the events of Egypt's modern
history, from Nasser's revolution in 1952 to Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in
1977. He has time, sometimes in a half-drugged state, to review his life and
disillusionment with politics. He flirts sensuously with Lawahiz, an upper
class woman, a former love, and Zaynab, a laboratory technician. For Girgis
the Copt, who looks after the hospital archives, her face becomes that of
the Virgin Mary. The narratives are deliberately complex.
Some of the characters, such as Lawahiz, have never been down to the sea,
but recognise that they should go there. Not all escape the sea. Shatara, a
wily, illiterate odd-job man, inspired by hashish only manages to dream of
making his fortune from selling the hospital's archives. Umm Ismail, a
professional wailing woman, briefly glimpses another life through a bit part
trilling at a TV wedding. Throughout their varied experiences, there run
humour and scenes of sexuality which ring true but would be rejected by
Moslem puritans.
Dr Sabir, from a cemetery family, is deliberately presented as a Nasser-like
figure. He left the 'sea' to become a doctor and make money , but he
returned to set up a clinic for its inmates. Like Nasser, he dies in his
fifties from overwork and his funeral is similar in the depth of his
mourners' grief.
Ibrahim has contrived tales of frustration and of resources either untapped
or exhausted. He has portrayed deftly the manners and customs of this
special class of Egyptians and the translator, Frances Liardet, has
succeeded in making it an English book without sacrificing its Arabness.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Press Review: All roses in Garden City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS an old Hungarian joke: 'This will be an average year. Worse than
1991 but better than 1993.' Sitting in the wings of the Group of Seven
finance ministers meeting at the Garden City Hotel, Garden City, Long
Island, a week ago, I pondered that line as I heard the Seven reverse it.
Everything was getting better. The French minister, Pierre Beregevoy, said:
'1992 will be better than 1991.'
It all made Le Monde very cross. 'A meeting for nothing?' it asked. 'Will it
prove to be totally useless?' The paper concluded by noting that the word
'confidence' had been used five times in the communique but added: 'In
highlighting their differences, if not their divergence, the great money men
contribute hardly anything to its rebirth.'
The Germans took the meeting much more personally. They worry about their
high interest rates, which have helped to plunge everybody into recession.
Handelsblatt noted with relief: 'Bonn's interest rate policy not in the
dock.' Which must have come as a surprise since the Germans had gone into
the meeting prepared to square-up to all-comers over this issue.
The Bundesbank boss, Helmut Schlesinger, had us reeling at a press
conference when he said that high German interest rates were good for
everybody. He singled out the little European countries which had followed
the German drive for dear money. It was interesting to discover that these
countries agreed.
Borsen, of Copenhagen, wrote: 'The pressure on Germany to cut interest rates
runs like water off a duck's back. This must generate ambivalent feelings
among Germany's neighbours, which include Denmark. On the one hand, the weak
business climate in Europe screams out for lower interest rates. On the
other, no-one wants to risk the newly-won monetary stability. We have to
make the best of living with Germany in circumstances we cannot change.'
The spectre of industrial unrest and exorbitant wage demands in Germany is
not one that most of us can credit. But Bonn is so worried that it lectures
the German working class regularly in a manner reminiscent of past British
governments.
The Sunday edition of the tabloid Bild-Zeitung took up the challenge to the
proletariat which constitutes the base of its huge circulation. 'It is time
to come to the defence of Germany's workers in the face of ill-targeted
criticism . . . to blame high wages alone for the fact that Germany has lost
its number one slot in the list of the world's business addresses is simply
wrong. In Japan, wages are now almost as high as here. Why, then, have the
Japanese overtaken us? Because they are quicker and more flexible and have
the courage to take chances.'
Where does that leave the rest of us?
Garden City was picked for unexpected reasons. The previous meeting in New
York State had been at the luxurious Plaza Hotel, by Central Park. So Garden
City, an anonymous but wealthy suburb, seemed a bit of a come-down. But it
is a mere half an hour from Kennedy airport.
There are hotels nearer to Kennedy - airport hotels for example, but David
Mulford, of the US Treasury, told me they had names like Howard Johnson or
Holiday Inn; and as agreements at such meetings are known by the location
(the Plaza and Louvre, for example), none was deemed suitable. Especially as
Howard Johnson's is known as HoJo in the vernacular. So far the plan has not
worked. None of the papers I have read has written about the Garden City
Agreement. It might catch on but, if places now are chosen in order to give
a pleasant veneer to the bodged deals at which the Group of Seven normally
arrives at, why was Munich chosen for the summit in July?

FT  01 FEB 92 / Property: There is life beyond Chiantishire / A look at the
current state of the Italian housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU CAN buy a house in Italy for Pounds 7,000 although, admittedly, it needs
a little patching-up - like needing a roof. Or you can find splendid villas
costing millions of pounds, with a wide choice in between. Yet Italy's
housing market does not receive much publicity in the UK, where agents
handling it have become even fewer in the past couple of years.
It tends to have spells in the spotlight, as when the Aga Khan's involvement
in the Costa Smeralda development brought gossip-column names thronging to
Sardinia. More recently, the focus has been on Tuscany and the British
couples busy restoring old farmhouses in 'Chiantishire' (although, with
rising prices, that interest has waned.
Perhaps, though, it now is time for a ramble around today's Italian
offerings.
Going up the scale from those roofless 'opportunities' (try Brian A. French,
tel: 0423-865 892, if you must have one) there is much else for restoration,
although it is not necessarily cheap - you are told to accept that the
Italian market is still buoyant, even if people are a little ambitious in
their asking prices.
For instance, there is a Tuscany property - without electricity and to which
'water is at present brought by tanker' - for Pounds 147,000. True, this is
a farmhouse with three barns and 80 acres.
Another property ('not quite falling to bits but needs work done on it
soon') is Pounds 163,000. There is no piped water or electricity but again,
to be fair, it has 15 acres and is 50 minutes from Florence.
Possible buyers who fight shy of anything 'campable once a bathroom is
installed,' or 'with convertible pigsty at rear,' might find more appealing
a refurbished country house in the Chianti region, boasting vineyards and
olives, swimming pool and guest cottage. With drawing room, dining room,
library and two en-suite bedrooms, the asking price is Pounds 565,000.
For the professional developer, perhaps, is a site below the walls of the
Etruscan city of Volterra, south-west of Florence. It is an hour from the
sea and Pisa airport. There is permission for a 40-bedroom hotel,
restaurant, swimming pool, tennis courts and eight self-contained
apartments. Offers: about Pounds 434,000.
The same professional (but surely no one else) might be interested in a
70-room former convent in four acres near Siena. The rooms are being
renovated to create 14 apartments and more than Pounds 1m is sought for the
reconstructed shell.
A hillside hamlet of farm buildings with 180 acres, in the Chianti region,
has permission to become a holiday development with swimming pool. Work has
started on 13 apartments. This property is registered as a company and, if
bought as such, a loan of Pounds 500,000 is available at 1 per cent. A
neighbouring farm pays Pounds 8,000 a year for the produce of a vineyard
which is part of the land. Price: Pounds 1,195,000.
On a private estate in the same area, 18 detached houses are being restored.
Each will have its own pool and prices range from Pounds 304,000 to Pounds
434,000. It is intended to organise the group as a condominium, with an
annual charge to cover maintenance and security. These properties and
projects are available through Babet (tel: 0460-762-123).
If all else fails, the agency can offer a quaint, end-of-row cottage which
needs work, 20 minutes from the sea in north Tuscany. Stone-built, with
outside steps and wrought ironwork leading to the upper floor, it has a
terrace and cellar. Price: about Pounds 11,000.
So, what of Sardinia's Costa Smeralda estate today?
Re-sales come up from time to time. Peter Fea, of Costa Smeralda Holidays in
London, says the average price of villas there 15 years ago was Pounds
80,000. Now, it is Pounds 400,000 upwards.
Ten came on the market last year and he knows of two that are available now.
One comes with about 100 yards of coastline (these days, you cannot build
within about 200 yards of the sea). It has a living room on several levels
with terraces, dining area, five en-suite bedrooms, an office with fax and
telex, courtyard with patio and fountain, and guest cottage. There is also a
swimming pool in the grounds and steps down to a natural harbour. Price:
Pounds 2.5m.
The other villa has a British owner - Tim Rootes, bloodstock breeder cousin
of the late (second) Lord Rootes. He had the property built in the hills
back from the coastline but looking towards Corsica.
There is a drawing room and terrace, dining area and an outside summer
dining area. Two of the three bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms. There are
guest and staff cottages and a swimming pool in the 15-acre grounds, while a
berth and garage at the marina go with the property. Price: around Pounds
1m.
Details of these villas from Costa Smeralda Holidays (tel: 071-493 8303).
The Woolwich building society, as Woolwich Spa, has an office in Milan and
lends through 500 branches of 15 banks, aiming at Italian first-time buyers.
In a recent survey, it noted that Italy was the most expensive of the EC
countries in which to rent or buy property.
A Confederation of British Industry report last year put the average rent of
an unfurnished three-bedroom flat with central heating, in a good area of
Italy, at Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 1,800 a month. The average purchase price

FT  01 FEB 92 / Gardening: Swimming against the tide - A nursery that kept
faith with private clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the 1970s, the British nursery trade has been acting out a
horticultural version of Big Bang. Trading now takes place all round the
calendar, thanks to the rise of the garden centre and the growing of plants
in containers of black polythene. Dual capacity is all the rage. Big
retailers have become bigger wholesalers with many fewer private clients.
In the old days, you might have bought roses from Mattocks, shrubs from
Waterers, and sent away by post for rarities from Hilliers, Bressingham and
Notcutts. Mattocks and Waterers have gone up the water spout; Hilliers,
Bressingham and Notcutts have developed vast wholesale businesses for garden
centres and institutions. All their retail lists now carry fewer varieties
of the specialities which their fathers' generation used to sell. It would
be a brave gardener who ordered a rare shrub by post for Pounds 20 or more.
It might well arrive as a hopeful twig.
Shopping by post has given way to shopping by car. Garden centres have
proved that urban punters will pay unimagined prices for plants which can be
shovelled straight into their vehicle's boot. These changes make me
fascinated by growers who dragged their feet at the time and decided to go
against the tide. If I had been in business, I like to think that I would
have done the same and decided that private clients would not disappear
simply because the shopping trade had come up with centres in new locations.
As the bigger nurseries have become centres or wholesalers, smaller private
nurseries have indeed multiplied, supplying unusual plants to those who do
not want to pay Pounds 4 for an overgrown bush of lavender. Among older
names, one or two have continued to prize their casual business by post and
not impose a minimum charge. My sympathies lie with them.
In this class, I doubt if there is an older name than Scotts of Merriott,
Somerset. Its roots go back into the 18th century, perhaps as far as the
1730s and certainly into the 1790s where a recent find of papers has shown
that one Lord Digby was already buying plants at the Merriott nursery. The
last John Scott left the business in the late-Victorian period, not without
financial problems. The enterprise was bought by the Wallises in 1923; since
then, it has passed through only two generations although there are
prospects now of a third.
Scotts employs 50 people, one for each acre of intensely-cultivated ground.
Some stock, but not much, is bought-in from Holland and suppliers lower down
the chain. Most of it is then grown-on to standard at Merriott before being
loosed on the public. This year, the nursery sees two new landmarks: Mark
Wallis, who runs it, has reached the age of 65 and, for the first time in 60
years, it will be exhibiting at the Chelsea flower show. This venture has
been encouraged by a third-generation Wallis to see if Scotts can add to its
large stock of private clients.
Scotts always has had a strong brand loyalty, not least because its
catalogues are illustrated so handsomely with line drawings and filled with
worthwhile shrubs; I know nowhere else where you can still buy the charming
rose Ashwednesday, which has ashen-grey flowers early in the season. Like
the other big names, Scotts has a wholesale business, but it amounts to only
50 per cent of total sales around Pounds 1m. The rest largely involves
orders by post, delivered by Scotts' vans across the south of England.
Most of the wholesale stock goes to garden centres although, this year,
orders from them are being delayed until the last possible moment for fear
of economic collapse. At Scotts, however, the retail trade has actually been
stronger than before and Wallis foresees a serious rush for stock this
March.
One of the nursery's famous strengths is its fruit list, still under the
care of Wallis's 75-year-old brother. Its range of cider apples is unique;
it is a haven for refugees from Golden Delicious, and serious planners of an
orchard ought to consult the yearly list.
In 1877, the consultation would have been bewildering. Wallis showed me a
bound copy of Scotts' list for 1877 which he had acquired via his wife's
vicar. It contained more than 1,500 varieties of apple, 1,500 pears and 200
varieties of soft fruit. The descriptions were rather stylish. 'Mulberry:
ever-bearing, but how truly, it would be difficult to say: only none of the
sorts on this side of the water is endowed with the faculty.'
Border plants are Wallis's first love, though. As a grower, not a gardener,
he claims to like them all in different ways. He did agree that Scotts has
some unique lupins, propagated continuously from the original Russell
hybrids. Anemones, he also thought, were particularly appealing (it must
have been telepathy because I was thinking the same). No, he did not think
that any one white was exceptional, but he had been impressed by the
deep-red Hadspen Abundance on a recent visit to Devon. He denied that plants
grown in Somerset were less likely to survive northern weather than plants
grown in Yorkshire.
The biggest problem, he thought, was incorrect naming of stock in the trade.
When last he sat on a panel, he found that only three out of 18 plants of
something as common as double-flowered Philadelphus Virginal were being
labelled correctly. As for rosemary, Miss Jessup's upright form was a
constant problem. Did I realise that the leaves on the true variety lay
close to the main stem, whereas many nurserymen sold upright officinalis
instead?
Although Wallis is 65 this year, he has no intention of taking his knowledge
into retirement. I thought that he had referred rather wistfully to a lost
opportunity when Waterers collapsed: early in the 1970s, he could have
bought the entire place for about Pounds 600,000 and would be a
multi-millionaire nowadays, not least because of the property. Would it all
be so different, then, if he had pulled off this deal?
Not really, he reflected. People who were used to a 12-hour day did not
bother with interest. He would continue growing plants because he enjoyed
it, although he might be rid of the paperwork if he had a million in the
bank. He did not think that he wanted to take up golf. I believed him; but,
as one of Scotts' long-standing private clients, I suppose it was what I
wanted to hear.
Catalogues are available from Scotts, Merriott, Crewkern, Somerset, for
Pounds 1.50 each.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Gardening: Royal Kew goes the American way - Guides will
take individuals or parties around London's botanic gardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AMERICA, it is customary for botanic gardens to have well-trained guides
to conduct those visitors who want to make more than a superficial visit. In
Britain, though, this is a rarity; and even so great an establishment as the
Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, in south-west London, has only one guide. It
is no wonder that her engagement book is filled for many months ahead. But,
thanks very largely to the enthusiasm of the director, Professor Ghillian
Prance, this is about to change.
Last June, it was decided to appoint an expert in this kind of work, and
Catherine Rosborough was selected. The idea was to train voluntary guides
who, while being paid only travelling expenses, would get certain privileges
at Kew. In return, they would give a fairly small amount of their time to
taking individuals or small parties for tours lasting about an hour. The
duration would either be left to the guide's discretion or be tailored to
meet the special requirements of the visitors.
These voluntary guides do not need to have botanical expertise since no one
can have intimate knowledge of more than a small fraction of the plants in a
great garden such as this. What is required is a good general knowledge of
gardening, an enthusiasm for Kew, an ability to communicate easily, and a
pleasant personality.
When word got around that volunteers were needed, hundreds responded. Most
were women, no doubt because more women than men are free to work part-time
albeit for no financial reward. Eighty-five of the applicants were
interviewed and 24 - 20 women and four men - were selected. After training,
they will start their duties from March 19 and some applications for their
services have been received already.
To publicise the scheme, mail-shots have been sent to all tour operators who
take parties to Kew and also Women's Institutes, horticultural societies and
other organisations likely to be interested. An application form is
available which gives full particulars and has space to detail any special
interests of vistors.
March 19 was set as the start date because that is the day the fine new
visitors' centre, near the Victoria Gate on Kew Road, is due to open. It
will have a large shop and a great deal of information about the garden. The
guides will be based there, although that does not mean that all their tours
will start from there. They can be engaged to meet a person or a party at
any point in the garden of special interest to them.
All this makes welcome news, and my own view is that it will not be long
before another batch of guides is undergoing training.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
These greenhouse plants are now known botanically as Senecio hybridus but
seed catalogues still use the old name. They are all bushy perennials that
are grown as biennials, the seed being sown between May and July without
extra heat for flowering in winter and spring. There are several different
types, varying in size of flower and in habit, but the large-flowered,
compact varieties such as Spring Glory and Venus are the most popular. The
large, single, daisy-type flowers come in a wide range of colours, often
with a white zone around the central disc. Plants are nearly hardy and can
be grown in an unheated frame or greenhouse during the summer. In autumn and
winter, they should be kept in a greenhouse or sunny room at a minimum
temperatures of 13`C (55`F) and be watered moderately directly to the soil,
keeping the leaves dry.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: The gates are open wide - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHY ARE you leaning so far forward ?' asks Pierre Raison, the new head of
the official Les Arcs ski school. 'It has taken man 5m years to learn to
stand up. Why are you crouching like a monkey?'
Here we go again. Just as I thought I had got skiing down to a rough-hewn
art, here was someone else trying to change my style. Will I ever get it
right, or am I doomed to find that just as I have struggled to get used to
one idea, someone has moved the slalom gates?
Les Arcs has a bewildering number of ski schools which seem to change names
each year. Raison, a likeable eccentric and a stunningly good mono-skier,
has just taken over the local ESF, the red-suited Ecole de Ski Francais.
There are two or three others - more if you count the ubiquitous Club Med
instructors who are technically ESF, too, but have their own uniforms.
Alternative ski schools have been springing up all over the French Alps to
give ski fanatics a more exotic diet. But it is a bit confusing for would-be
clients. Many of the schools have put themselves under the umbrella title of
Ski Ecole International. These days even the word 'skiing' is far too banal
for the likes of Les Arcs. What we have now is la glisse, which encompasses
all forms of sliding on snow, including a strong emphasis on mono-skiing,
snow-boarding, ski extreme, powder and couloir skiing, even skiing with the
aid of parachutes, up-ski and parapenting.
In Les Arcs, the International ski school (green uniforms) is called Arc
Aventures, which also takes skiers on surf and mono courses. The ESF runs
ski decouverte, which organises Poudreuse Circus day trips in which you can
join outings to the neighbouring resorts of La Plagne, Val d'Isere and even
across the Italian border into La Thuile.
Then there is Virage, an a la carte ski school with just 10 instructors
(blue uniforms), and Tip Top Ski for snowboarders, based at nearby Bourg St
Maurice.
But I digress. Raison is still going on about my posture. 'Hold your head up
 -look where you're going. Enjoy your skiing.' Oh dear. I thought I was
enjoying it. So did Conrad Brunner, my companion and a former ski instructor
himself. He takes Raison's criticism on the chin and does not let on about
his past. As for leaning forward, that is what instructors have been telling
me to do for years.
But Les Arcs is like that - at the forefront of any new skiing idea. What is
smart today is often passee tomorrow, although ski evolutif, the graduated
short-ski teaching method pioneered here, is still taught. My first skiing
article for the FT, 10 years ago, was about various concepts of 'ski le new
way,' another Les Arcs innovation.
One, ski bird, called for plastic wings which halved your weight and enabled
you to half-float and half-cruise down the mountain. Just as I got the hang
of it, I recall, they dropped it from the adult itinerary and made it a
children's feature.
Les Arcs - divided by altitude into three areas: 1,600, 1,800 and 2,000
metres - is swashbuckling but friendly, with excellent skiing for every type
of skier both on and off-piste.
It is the archetypal first-generation, purpose-built, self-catering French
resort. With more than 100 miles of skiing and some 75 lifts, the resort
offers almost every possible skiing permutation.
For off-piste enthusiasts with a guide there are endless possibilities,
including the famous run from the Aiguille rouge all the way down to Le Pre,
near Villaroger. The Aiguille rouge which dominates Les Arcs provides much
of the more testing off-piste. The Couloir Arandelieres is a particular
favourite but involves a vertiginous climb along a narrow ridge with
disturbing drops on both sides. Once into the couloir, however, you can
breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy a steep but wide gully which should
present few problems to seasoned deep-snow skiers.
The North Face of the Aiguille rouge is a sublime powder run in good
conditions but - as so often happens when you are seeking out the best
off-piste - getting there is more unsettling than the descent itself.
To reach the glorious powderfields of the Aiguille rouge you must first
negotiate an extremely steep top section which tends to be rocky even in
good conditions, because the slope is too sheer for the snow to stick in any
great depth. About halfway down the face, however, the gradient eases and
you can let yourself go in what you hope will be perfect powder. The
Aiguille rouge is also the setting for one of the more spectacular Olympic
events, the kilometre lancee, in which participants clad in skin-tight suits
and Darth Vader visors reach speeds of around 135 mph on huge skis.
Recreational skiers can try a shortened version. Even they can reach speeds
in excess of 60 mph. Once you have committed yourself, there is no turning
back - nor any means of braking.
At least during the Flying K you can safely ignore Pierre Raison's entreaty
to stand up and enjoy your skiing. If you do not crouch during the Flying K
you are liable to be jettisoned in the maelstrom of your own slipstream.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: Sicily's spring eruption - Beauty on the surface
disguises underworld violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VULCANO is extinct. Yet puffs of smoke still drift about its summit like the
last wisps from a dying bonfire. The smell of sulphur wafts across the water
long before the ferry from Milazzo can tie up at the island jetty.
Porto Levante, at Vulcano's base, in the Aeolian islands, off Sicily, is an
ill-favoured place. Even as the season begins, its straggle of holiday
villas, newly dilapidated, have a desperate, end-of-season look about them.
Further on is the health spa, a chain of noisome sulphur pools filled with
milky-white water. Beyond them again is the coal-black beach, decorated with
squashed plastic bottles and other detritus.
But even in this dead place the Sicilian springtime has covered the ground,
erupting in vivid rashes of red and yellow wildflowers. The whole of Sicily
is carpeted with them: they spill on to motorways, spread across rubbish
dumps, crawl up ruins and sprinkle the valleys of the island's interior like
a pointilliste painting. A botanist could have a field day. For the
non-botanical it is still a revelation.
From the edge of Porto Levante a path winds up the side of the old volcano
through yellow broom and pale blue thistles. About two-thirds of the way up
the vegetation gives out. The path traverses dangerous screes of
strange-coloured rock, the twisted remains of the last eruption. As it nears
the bare summit it passes a row of smoking vents, their lips smeared
greenish-yellow with sulphur; you can lean down and inhale the acrid breath
of the dragon. To gaze into the mouth of Hades itself, you must climb on up
to the rim of the crater.
Sicily's volcanoes, living and dead, are the most extreme features of a
harsh landscape. They are also an irresistible metaphor for the underground
violence for which the island is notorious.
The mafiosi no longer operate as village Robin Hoods, filling the vacuum
left by absentee, foreign landlords. Driven underground by Mussolini and
re-emerging to ingratiate themselves with the allied army at the end of the
Second World War, they have grown up into real city hoods, engaged in local
politics, property speculation and building contracts as well as the heroin
trade. Most have reportedly left Palermo for a more lucrative life in the
eastern cities of Catania and Gela.
Ask a restaurateur in a small town whether the Mafia are active there and he
will agree vigorously: but by 'mafia' he means political patronage and
municipal corruption generally, a way of life that is endemic not just to
Sicily but to Italy as a whole. So, stumbling one day into a plenary meeting
of the Sicilian Rotary Club - squat, black-suited men dwarfed by their
leggy, mink-coated wives - it was hard not to see a re-enactment of a scene
from Godfather II.
For much of its complicated history the island was culturally divided:
Carthaginian and Arab in the west, Greek and Byzantine in the east. The
tourist can slice Sicily in other ways, too.
The coast with its rampant development, ancient monuments, beaches and bars
is one kind of holiday. Those who like to feel they have missed nothing can
even take a week-long guided tour round the perimeter. (According to one
grey-faced customer descending from a coach, it is no picnic).
The interior is quite another experience. Its scenery is magnificent rather
than beautiful. Although the land is still cultivated, post-war migration to
the towns has left it denuded of people. You can see it the easy way,
sailing along the empty Catania-Palermo motorway. More interesting is to
branch off at Enna, the first of a chain of spectacular hill-towns that
stand like sentries around the base of Mount Etna.
The road south from Enna leads to Piazza Armerina, site of a large Roman
villa with well-preserved mosaic floors, and eventually to Agrigento, where
the Greek temples stand on their ridge below the city. (They can be seen
best in the evening).
In the wild country to the north lie the hill towns of Leonforte, Nicosia,
Troina and Randazzo. Some were Norman garrisons, and a medieval atmosphere
still clings to them. Here the foreigner can still feel that uncomfortable
shiver between the shoulder-blades as he crosses the piazza eyed by hostile
stares. Urban Sicilians, with their yuppie phones and fat EC grants, disown
the antique life of the hills. Out here, they claim, the shepherds still
carry guns and regularly murder one another.
Sicily's spring is not all sunshine.
When the clouds roll down from Etna's snowcapped summit, the world goes
black. On Etna's northern side, where the best grapes are said to grow, the
road cuts through rivers of lava, grey-black boulders left frozen on the
hillside like herds of slaughtered elephants. The streets and houses of
Linguaglossa (some of them left abandoned after the last eruption) are
coated in greasy black and the air smells as thickly of burning coal as any
mining town.
Because springtime is too early for most sunseekers, popular resorts like
the cliff-top town of Taormina are at their best. Last year was
exceptionally quiet. The manager of the San Domenico Palace, a hotel of
old-fashioned splendour and luxury built out of a Dominican monastery,
blamed the unseasonal weather. A waiter had another explanation: the
Americans had been frightened off by the Gulf war, he said, and the rich
Italians had spent all their savings in the supermarkets stocking up in the
event of a Libyan counter-attack.
Apart from the chattering gangs of local teenagers, the night-cries of car
burglar alarms and the buzz of Sicilian Vespas, the town was only just
beginning to wake. Few restaurants were open and the river of humanity that
floods the Corso Umberto in high season was still a trickle.
The dining room of the San Domenico was empty on most nights but for the
occasional honeymooners or middle-aged couples from Japan, Germany or
Britain. The 80-year-old hotel pianist, a marathon walker and winemaker,
played to an empty saloon. The sea was just audible, hundreds of feet below.
From the hotel's superb terraced garden, Etna was occasionally visible above
the clouds, smoking incessantly: alive, beautiful and dangerous.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: Dollars 400 per day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST time I exited St Lucia, writes Michael Thompson-Noel, the Travel
editor of The Guardian was in the process of missing his London connection.
The airline was concerned, and asked if my colleague would fly into a rage
if he was declared a no-show.
'Chuck his bag off,' I said. 'That man is an adventurer, a highly
experienced traveller. Nothing would please him more than to be delayed 24
hours in as fine a spot as St Lucia.' And so, of course, it proved.
St Lucia figures highly on experienced travellers' score-cards. It is part
of the Windward islands, just south of Martinique. It is sleepy, friendly,
and outstandingly beautiful.
But not so sleepy that Big Money hasn't noticed it. In June, the Dollars 40m
Jalousie Plantation, backed by Middle Eastern funds, is due to open, managed
by the Miami-based Premier Resorts and Hotels, which runs other fine hotels
in the US, Caribbean and Europe.
Premier says that the June opening will mark a rare event: the debut of an
entirely new hotel beside one of the Caribbean's acknowledged beauty spots.
Jalousie Plantation is framed between the Petit Piton and Gros Piton
mountains which are St Lucia's symbol.
Jalousie has its own secluded beach and 109 guest cottages, including 12
suites. Standard features include verandahs with private plunge pools,
custom-size beds, air-conditioning, cable TV, etcetera. There are various
restaurants, plus the usual attributes of a modern luxury island resort:
golf, tennis, watersports, aerobic classes, hydrotherapy, saunas.
And Jalousie is all-inclusive. Charges until December 18 1992 range from
Dollars 400 (Pounds 220.90) to Dollars 500 per couple per day, though two
couples sharing a two-bedroom deluxe cottage would get away with Dollars 960
per day.
The single rate is Dollars 300 per day. There are various child deals
available. Cheap it is not, but the rates include everything except
air-flights: accommodation, all food and drink, sports, spar programme,
transfers, taxes and service charge.
Jalousie must be hoping to match the standards found at Four Seasons' luxury
resort on Nevis, opened last year.
There are direct flights between London and St Lucia. Various UK tour
operators list Jalousie, including Caribbean Connection, Elite Vacations,
Harlequin Holidays and Happiness Islands.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Wine: Sending wines to France - Jancis Robinson uncovers a
plot to get the French drinking Napa and Coonawarra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY IS the fine wine market like the M25 on a Friday night? Because, as one
merchant put it last week: 'It's just completely blocked.' There may be some
takers for the oceans of good red bordeaux available at the moment, but the
red burgundy market has always been almost too complicated to contemplate,
and never more so than now with negociants (merchants) such as Louis Latour
and Drouhin discounting while others dither on the sidelines. Only futures
in 1990s seem to be eliciting much interest, perhaps mainly from those who
know they will not be buying futures in 1991 bordeaux.
London's burgundy specialists are reacting in very different ways to this
impasse. Anthony Hanson, of Haynes Hanson &amp; Clark, SW6, is taking time off
selling to write a second edition of his controversial and much-needed book
Burgundy. Jasper Morris, of Morris &amp; Verdin, SW1, has bought a house in
Burgundy, the better to observe the machinations of what has been, until the
market standstill finally persuaded them otherwise, France's most introvert
wine region. Graham Chidgey, of Laytons, NW1, has diverted his energies more
radically by finding mature Moldavian bargains for his new Russian Wine
Company in W1. While Howard Ripley, of N21, always had his dental practice
to keep him busy.
But perhaps the most interesting diversion from the fruitless business of
selling top quality burgundy to the British is what Simon Taylor-Gill of
Domaine Direct, WC1, is up to: trying to sell top quality New World wines to
the French.
Certainly, it will not be easy. The French market has its own blocage
problems, with fine wine bought cheaply flooding in to the supermarkets. But
if anyone manages the impossible task of persuading the country that
invented chauvinism to at least list the odd bottle from Australia,
California and New Zealand, it may well be Taylor-Gill.
Although he could not sound more Oxford to the English - in fact he always
gives the impression of being in a great hurry to go and give a lecture - he
was born in Australia and was taught French at the university between 1975
and 1978.
He has spent much of his subsequent working life in France. Often calling
himself plain Simon Taylor - 'as a teacher I find it easier not to present
stuff you know they won't get right' - he has divided his French time
between setting up tertiary education programmes in Paris and sniffing out
the best wines in Burgundy, where he spends a week a month.
He and his partner, Hilary Gibbs, founded Domaine Direct in 1981 to ship
wine from small domaines in Burgundy to Britain because this
negociant-busting activity seemed to fit in well with his trans-Channel
life. 'I never set out to be a wine merchant - in fact if challenged it
would be quite difficult to get that information out of me at a party,' he
says defensively.
But his donnish manner, intimate acquaintance with the wines he sells and
insistence on such frills as refrigerated transport from Beaune to London
for these particularly fragile wines, has steadily built them an enviable
list of clients. Restaurants account for about three-quarters of their
business and the Domaine Direct laser printer is now responsible for the
layout, if not total content, of an impressive geographical spread of
restaurant wine lists around Britain.
There is a small problem, however. Even Taylor-Gill admits that he only
drinks these lovely red burgundies on special occasions ('God, I do hope you
don't quote me too closely on this') an economy measure reflected up and
down the land. 'We would probably have been much better off just sitting in
Jersey broking the stuff,' he admits. 'No we haven't made money - but we do
know lots of nice restaurateurs.'
Hence the emergence of Domaine Direct Distribution. Its immediate task is to
persuade the better restaurants in France, and eventually beyond, that their
wine lists are incomplete without some representation from the best New
World upstarts.
A first tryout in Lorraine in northern France was a wow, except that, blind,
the assembled French company preferred Domaine Direct's Western Australian
Chardonnay from Leeuwin Estate to some of their own white burgundies. The
new company's Paris debut was a much more severe test - no French wines for
comparison - with 50 top tasters from the Association des Sommeliers de
Paris, including representatives from the Grand Vefour, Hediard and Fauchon.
It is typical of Taylor-Gill that what really excited him about this event
was not whether his wines went down well, but that from various members of
the assembled French wine experts he heard 'four near-perfect tasting notes
 -England doesn't prepare you for people who can give you a perfect food and
wine match on the hoof either.'
Jean Frambourt, association president, said politely that these ten alien
bottles clearly contained wines of quality that had been made with a
'different approach' to the French one. Taylor-Gill admits that they found
the whites in particular too sweet and too heavily stylised to suit the
(anglophone) market instead of being, as a French wine is, made to express
their appellation, their exact provenance.
It is clearly going to be an uphill struggle. Tim Johnston and Mark
Williamson of the famous Willi's Wine Bar have sold two bottles of their
Rutherford Hill Cabernet Sauvignon 1986 in two years. The most energetic
California exporter Robert Mondavi may have listings in France but they tend
to be of the Hilton at Orly Sud variety.
There are signs of some success already, however, even if they are probably
the result of Taylor-Gill's brand of intellectual bullying on those he knows
best in French restauration: you can now find the great Australian, Penfolds
Grange, at two restaurants in Burgundy, and other New World wines via DDD at
establishments in Alsace-Lorraine and St Etienne. After Paris, Lyon and Nice
are Taylor-Gill's next targets, but he knows that this coals to Newcastle
exercise has its limits. He is not even going to invest the air fare on a
sales trip to Bordeaux.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Food and Wine: Bangers and burgundy - Nicholas Lander meets
the man behind London's top dining clubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARK BIRLEY would have been a very successful restaurateur. Instead, he
became the king of clubs. The success of Annabel's, London's smartest night
club, which he opened in 1963, was followed by three other private clubs,
Mark's Club, Harry's Bar and the Bath and Racquets Club.
Restaurateurs view clubs with envy, coveting the membership and the annual
income it brings. At Birley's clubs the annual membership fee is Pounds 500
plus a Pounds 250 entrance fee - overseas membership is Dollars 250 (Pounds
138). The size of the clubs' membership is secret but each must have several
hundred members with more at Annabel's. Any restaurateur would be thrilled
to start the financial year with rent and rates paid for.
Clubs have other advantages. Competition is less intense, they can be
extremely discreet (Mark's Club does not even have a sign on its door), they
do not have to post their menus outside and there is no need to curry favour
with guidebooks, court restaurant reviewers or follow the whims of
gastronomic fashion.
The licensing advantage which clubs used to hold has almost disappeared, but
private clubs are less prone to police scrutiny.
However, there are disadvantages too. Clubs have to maintain a much higher
staffing level and fill more administrative jobs, such as membership
secretary. As meeting places they must stay open longer and cater for the
unprofitable country member who wants coffee and the newspapers at 10am.
As one restaurateur who also owns a club put it: 'In my club the staff are
all ready at 9am - in the restaurant they are just putting their bow-ties on
at 11.45am.'
There are commercial limitations, too. Once ensconced there is no guarantee
that a member will spend. Clubs also have to be more flexible in their menu
content: at Mark's Club grilled tuna with garlic butter sits alongside
bangers and mash. And clubs cannot advertise themselves out of a recession.
On a Saturday night, when the West End is full nearly all London clubs are
either at their quietest or closed.
Into this delicate financial equation Birley has introduced the convictions
that would have made him a successful restaurateur. The dining room must
satisfy the eye as well as the stomach; it must be comfortable and not a
hushed temple to gastronomy. Above all, it must be spotlessly clean.
Birley justifies his clubs' membership fees quite simply. It allows him to
close each club for three weeks every year so that it can be entirely
refurbished - a luxury no restaurant can afford. It also allows staff a
complete break which minimises staff turnover and permits a quality of
crockery, cutlery and glassware that would last no more than a week in a
normal restaurant.
The clubs' interiors exude his own vision of comfortable good taste. Mark's
Club, with the bar on the first floor above the dining room, still gives the
feeling of being a much-loved private house. At Harry's Bar great attention
has been paid to the fixtures and fittings - the chandelier is Venetian, the
tables and chairs were especially commissioned but it was the artistic touch
to the food which thrilled me. A gleaming silver glass-topped carving
trolley proudly bore an enormous parmesan. Near the entrance were a large
basket of wild mushrooms and a silver wine cooler containing bottles of
their own raspberry, juniper and camomile grappas.
Birley's has strong views on food and wine. Over a lunch of Morecambe Bay
potted shrimps, grilled plaice, spinach and new potatoes, he expounded the
virtues of simple, well-cooked food. He has an exceptional talent in Michael
Hasler, who has been chef for the past 20 years at Mark's Club. The black
mushroom soup which I tasted there would grace any top French restaurant.
The wine lists contain some of the most sought-after wines produced in
France. At Harry's Bar Italian wines are a speciality.
At Harry's Bar, Birley may have lost the battle for simplicity to Alberico
Penatti, the chef described by one supplier as one of the best judges of
fresh produce in London. As you sit down a wooden tray of excellent salami
and ham is placed before you; home baked grissini and bread follow as does a
tray of small pizzas. After the main course come bowls of chocolate coffee
beans and top quality 'chocolate flake'. The Pounds 3 cover charge is high
but you could easily make a profit.
Dinner costs Pounds 50-Pounds 60 per head without wine. It is expensive but
was impeccable - spaghetti with fresh sardines, a classic rendition of
ribollita, the Tuscan vegetable soup, a ragout of snails, fillet of beef and
polenta and the extras that make Italian food so exciting - liberally grated
fresh parmesan and lashings of superlative extra virgin olive oil. There are
many dishes I would happily return for: a warm salad of carp; scampi and
watercress; and turbot with artichokes and black truffles.
A big compliment to Harry's Bar came from an Italian businessman
entertaining an American at the next table. Without bothering to look at the
menu he told the waiter: 'I know what I want and I will order for us both.'
He obviously thought he was back in Italy.
Membership details for all the four clubs are available from 46 Charles
Street, London W1X 7PB. Tel: 071-491-1478.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Cookery: Luscious lamb for lean times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSPICUOUS consumption, so they say, is out in the caring 1990s. Cheap is
in. Comfort food also is in - in fact, I would say it is essential when
winter is at its wintriest, as now. So, you will understand just why bony,
gelatinous cuts are centre stage on the culinary scene with tails, ankles
and shins seemingly the most desirable meats of the moment.
Butchers report a sudden, greedy surge of demand for such things as pigs'
trotters, marrow bones, shin of beef and ossobuco (shin of veal). Three
butchers in my area sold out of oxtail last week; delicatessens were doing a
roaring trade in zampone (pigs' trotters stuffed with sausage meat); and
there were mini-scrums in the supermarket around cabinets housing packets of
chicken wings and lamb shanks.
When you buy a leg of lamb, usually it comes complete with shank - for the
shank is, of course, the tip of the knuckle end, the part that is more bone
than meat and often is half-cut through so it remains attached to the main
part of the leg by a hinge of flesh.
When the joint is roasted, even if that is done only until rosy pink through
the centre of the leg, the meat of the shank invariably is cooked very
thoroughly - rich brown and scrunchy. Many regard it as the prize titbit. In
some households it has become the cook's perk, severed quickly from the
joint and nibbled greedily while making the gravy before anyone else can lay
claim to it. In others, it is demanded as the carver's reward.
I had not realised until quite recently that I could buy lamb shanks on
their own, without the rest of the leg attached. The ones I get come in
frozen pairs from New Zealand. Much larger, more meaty and less fatty than
the mini-shank on a home-produced leg of lamb joint, these shanks are, I
suppose, the trimmings produced when the thick parts of legs of lamb are cut
across the bone to make leg steaks.
Weighing 6-8 oz each and costing about 85p a pound, one lamb shank makes a
meaty feast for one person. If this is poor man's leg of lamb, then I am
happy to be a pauper.
LAMB SHANKS ON A BED OF BEANS AND CELERY (serves 4)
Lamb shanks can be open-roasted, just as you would cook them when attached
to whole legs of lamb. Very good they are, too, when cooked this way,
particularly if the skin is rubbed with salt and a fine sliver or two of
garlic is slipped between flesh and bone. I reckon, though, that
pot-roasting is preferable as it prevents the meat from becoming slightly
dried out and chewy - no need for toothpicks.
I rate butter beans as bland and boring generally, but this way of cooking
them is very good. In fact, I like it so much that I am inclined to make a
double quantity and use the leftovers, thinned with stock and freckled with
parsley, as soup.
Dried broad beans are more flavoursome and mealy than butter beans, and I
recommend using them instead if you can find an Italian deli or wholefood
shop that stocks them.
The coarse, outer parts of celery will do well for this recipe provided they
are scraped to remove any strings that might tangle with the tonsils. Save
the leafy, tender celery hearts for braising or munching with cheese.
Ingredients: 4 lamb shanks weighing 6-8 oz each; 4 thin slices of onion; a
dribble of olive oil; 6-8 fl oz stock (or a few tablespoons of wine plus
stock or water); 8 oz dried butter beans or broad beans, soaked overnight;
8-10 celery stalks; 1 garlic clove (optional); 1 pt or more of milk (if
using semi-skimmed, you might like to consider adding a few tablespoons of
cream at the end of cooking); freshly-grated nutmeg; a few spoonfuls of
chopped parsley.
Method: Choose a heavy, flameproof casserole or pot-roaster and heat it.
Film the base with a dribble of oil. Add the lamb shanks and cook for five
minutes over medium-high heat to colour them well all over.
Lift out the lamb and pour off and reserve any fat yielded in the process of
browning the meat. Put the onion slices into the casserole, placing them
side by side, and lay a lamb shank on top of each.
Pour on the stock or wine and water. Let the liquids bubble up and sizzle
for a few seconds. Then, cover the pot and put it into an oven heated to 180
C/350 F (gas mark 4). Cook for about 75 minutes, basting or turning the lamb
shanks occasionally, until the meat is tender and succulent. Meanwhile,
prepare the bed of vegetables.
Swirl the beans in their soaking water and some of the skins will float to
the top like the discarded chrysalids of newly-emerged butterflies. The rest
will slip off readily if the beans are pinched or rubbed between fingers and
thumbs. Drain the naked beans (discarding the spent skins), rinse, and drain
again.
Put the beans into a heavy-based saucepan. Cut the garlic into slivers and
add it. Pour on the milk and bring to simmering point. Season with plenty of
nutmeg and black pepper but no salt. Simmer over a very low flame (with the
lid just askew lest the milk try to foam overboard) until the beans are very
tender - say, 45-60 minutes.
Stir the beans occasionally, particularly towards the end, to prevent
sticking. Add more milk or a little cream if the mixture looks dry and needs
enriching, or remove the lid completely at the end to drive off surplus
liquid if it is very sloppy.
Season the cooked beans with salt and crush them lightly into their sauce,
using a fork. Aim for a rough, knobbled puree - not, repeat not, a smooth
baby-food pap.
When the lamb is nearly done, skim surface fat from the casserole. Use a
tablespoon or so of this (or lamb fat yielded when browning the shanks, or a
knob of unsalted butter if preferred) to fry the crescent-moon slices of
celery. Cook the celery until it is thoroughly hot and beginning to soften a
little, but let it retain some bite to contrast nicely with the creamy
tenderness of the beans.
Stir the celery and beans together, adding a little finely-chopped parsley.
Lay the lamb shanks on the bed of vegetables and sprinkle with a little more
parsley for colour. Serve with the lamb 'gravy' in a sauce boat.
In my steamed chocolate pudding recipe of January 11 the method should have
read: 'Cream the butter in a warmed mixing bowl. Add the sugar and beat
again until fluffy and light. Grate the chocolate and beat it in. Add the
cocoa mixture etc . . .'

FT  01 FEB 92 / Motoring: Motor trade heads for a crash course in change - A
new report predicts a shake-up in the way cars are sold and serviced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S CARS may be crammed with high technology but the way in which they
are sold and serviced has changed little in half a century. The motor trade,
reeling from the recession, is due for a shake-up from which the customer
will emerge as king (or, presumably, queen).
This is the gist of a controversial paper* from a London-based marketing
consultancy which, among other things, forecasts:
Lower new car prices as other makers follow the trend set by Vauxhall, which
cut dealer profit margins when launching the latest Astra model.
New kinds of dealer. They will not stock full, runabout-to-luxury-car ranges
from single makers but one type (say, city cars, small family cars, prestige
saloons or 4x4s) from a variety of manufacturers.
A decline in sales of costly prestige cars, partly from environmental
pressures but also because 'there are few practical reasons for spending
more than around Pounds 10,000 on mobility.'
The separation of car selling and servicing.
The authors of the report think that customers get a rotten deal from
today's dealers. Salesman 'hover with price on their minds' in outlets
which, although often large and luxurious, are run on out-of-date lines.
Dealers take their title too literally and over-concentrate on closing
deals. There is too much emphasis on prices and discounts. Test drives - 'a
natural part of the product evaluation process' - are not always offered
when asked for. When they are, the right model is often not available. Even
when given, test drives are often too short and customers are made to feel
under an obligation to buy.
Because most potential buyers suspect that practically the only thing the
salesman will talk about is price, they find out about the cars in which
they are interested from other sources. Then, they draw up a short-list and
visit three or four franchised dealers they hope will have them in stock.
'On a wet Saturday afternoon . . . with a young family in the back, this is
a far from convenient or uplifting experience,' says the report. It
concludes that customers see most car showrooms as distinctly hostile places
because too much has been spent on tarting them up and not enough on
training the staff. 'It is not furnishings which make for a friendly and
informative experience, but people with the right training and attitudes.'
Continental dealers, especially German and French, are held to be much
better at initiating sales rather than merely taking orders and haggling
about prices. Britons often complain that, once they have bought cars,
salesmen rarely have the courtesy to follow up to ensure they are satisfied.
They are made to feel that servicing dealerships put their own convenience
before that of the customer. It was hardly surprising that, as soon as their
cars were out of warranty, customers went to more responsive or cheaper
service points.
The authors do not say what they think will happen to car servicing - which
is to be the subject of their next report. But there is a straw in the wind.
A leading Japanese manufacturer is said to admit that its cars really need
servicing only every 25,000 miles (40,000 kms). Oil companies confirm that
their latest products will last that long, as will brakes and spark plugs if
made to the right specifications.
The motor trade will, of course, have none of all this. It is waiting
anxiously to hear what the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report (due in
a few weeks) has to say about the way it conducts its business. In the
meantime, it keeps a stiff upper lip.
Does Death of a Car Salesman?, the title of the report, over-state the case
against the motor trade? I take no sides. When I was young, I was made to
feel very small by car salesmen with regimental ties who emerged from behind
potted palms in wood-panelled showrooms. It is different now that I know
more about the cars they are selling (and much more about their competitors)
than they do.
Some years ago, I changed the make of our family car mainly because the girl
receptionist at the local servicing dealer went out of her way to irritate
mature women customers, my wife included. She must have cost that franchised
dealer a lot of business.
One former customer switched to Honda. Two days after taking delivery of her
Civic, a bouquet and a 'call us any time you need us' letter arrived from
the dealer. She will never buy anything but a Honda again.
In my experience, the treatment a car-owner receives from a franchised
dealer can range from excellent to appalling. The best defence against the
wrong 'uns is to vote with your feet.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Sport: Harlequin's last bow - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF SIMON Halliday has as good a game against Ireland at Twickenham this
afternoon as he had against Scotland two weeks ago, then the Irish had
better look out. At Murrayfield, Halliday was not just the dominant back nor
the dominant Englishman but arguably the dominant figure on the field. He
gave a performance of all-round play the like of which I have not seen for
many years.
Let us count the individual touches of England's right wing. They began with
Halliday catching the ball deep in his own half and near the right
touchline. Not much room to work with here. Boom] Halliday right-footed the
ball 40 yards down the touchline and into touch, a distance and accuracy
that a stand-off or full back would have been pleased with. It was a
reminder that he was good enough to kick two penalties for Oxford in the
1980 Varsity match.
This was followed by some mazy running. Halliday is 6 ft tall and strong
with it and on occasion is used to burst on to a flat pass at full speed.
Then he is about as easy to stop as a runaway car. Against Scotland he more
often demonstrated the art of elusive running, easily and light-footedly
shimmying past tacklers in a way that belied his 14-stone plus. One
remarkable run when he linked with Jeremy Guscott led to the try by Dewi
Morris.
In between this was some stout tackling in defence. 'Yes' said Halliday last
week when he cast his mind back to the Calcutta Cup match. 'In terms of
doing things right or wrong it probably was my best game in the
five-nations' championship. It was very satisfying, that game. I have played
at Murrayfield five times for England. The first time, 1986, was a record
loss - 33-6. The last was a record victory - 25-7. Since it was the last
time I shall play an international there it was nice to finish like that.'
Then Halliday was wearing the white of England. Now he was dressed in a
dark, double-breasted suit, the uniform of the City. Then he was intent on
doing his bit for England. Now he spoke quietly and seriously over lunch in
a City restaurant, a drop kick from his office at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
His open face was marked by the hint of a scar running down the side of his
right eye and blobs of bloodiness in the eye itself. The stitches, he
explained, were the relic of a collision with his Harlequins' team-mate and
England captain Will Carling. Halliday ran a finger tenderly down the fading
scar. 'A pure accident, of course,' he said.
He attacked his fillet steak. 'But that was not the best game I have played
for England,' he said. 'My best game was against Romania in Bucharest. I
laid the ball off well. For a centre that is the first responsibility. And I
helped to operate a smooth back line. That is another of a centre's
responsibilities.'
Alongside him that day was a young Englishman making his debut, Guscott.
Thanks in part to the service he received from his mentor, Guscott scored
three tries. Halliday, laying the ball off well, scored none.
There is a school of thought that says that the precocious Guscott has lost
his cutting edge in games for Bath since Halliday moved to Harlequins for
the start of the 1990/91 season. Not until Bath beat Leicester in December
did Guscott look as though he had recovered from the departure of his old
team-mate.
Halliday the Harlequin. There is a touch of the gilded youth about him, an
all-rounder on and off the pitch, one to whom things come easily. A graduate
of Oxford where he got a third in modern languages and classics ('you can
say I got an honours degree if you like') he speaks French well enough to
have acted as England's interpreter after the tense game against France in
the quarter-final of the World Cup.
He also represented Oxford at cricket and got close to a blue for squash. He
is, says a friend, devastatingly quick at crosswords, as is Rory Underwood,
the other England wing. Halliday's rugby career has been hampered by
injuries and selectoral quirks such as not picking him. Paradoxically his
ability to play both centre and wing at the highest level counted against
him.
Perhaps life mirrors sport after all. A strength of Halliday's is that he is
good at teamwork, doing what is best for a team without more than the odd
cheep of disapproval. It began at Downside School when he had one year as a
wing and two as a full back. It has continued for England  - 15 caps as a
centre, five as a wing. It is true at his job. As a salesman handling equity
funds on behalf of clients he works closely with five colleagues. 'You need
an ability to work in a structure and though others must say whether I am a
team man I think I have an ability to work in a team. I hope so.'
Halliday will be 32 in July. This is his last season for England. It is a
good time to finish. The World Cup is over. An England B team will tour New
Zealand this summer and he has no desire to be in it. He began his club
rugby with Harlequins and will end it there this season. Life turns full
circle. It is time for a change.

have four valves per cylinder and develop 140, 150 and 192 horsepower
respectively. The coupes look (but, in fact, are not) longer than the
saloons because they are slightly lower and wider. Power-operated windows

<TEXT>
NEIL LANHAM does not look like Dr Frankenstein. He is short, with tidy grey
hair and a clipped moustache. He dresses conservatively, and looks like a
country auctioneer up in town on business - which is precisely what he is.
His other business, as it is every Saturday afternoon, is 'soccer
performance analyst' for Cambridge United.
Only the glint in his eye when he talks about football suggests he has a
mission. Like the fictional Dr Frankenstein he has tried to shine the light
of science and reason into a world of tradition and superstition. And like
the poor doctor, his reward is to see the teams he has helped build reviled
as monstrosities. Critics of his methods say they destroy the artistry of
soccer.
Lanham qualified as a chartered surveyor 'which is all about measurement.'
He now works as an auctioneer in Suffolk and lives in a village that was
also home to Wing Commander Charles Reep, who brought a statists to soccer
and advised Stan Cullis, manager of the successful Wolverhampton Wanderers
side of the 1950s. Lanham caught the bug from Reep; he still has all the
Wing Commander's statistics, and has built on the work.
Reep believed that 'soccer is dominated by chance' - which does not mean
that games are random. It means that every pass, shot, or tackle has an
unpredictable result. A team can shoot 20 times in one game and not score,
and shoot twice the next week and score both times. However, over the
season, the ratio of shots to goals will be fairly constant. There are, says
Lanham, 'patterns that occur and occur again. They apply to all teams, at
all times.'
One of his many mottoes is that 'figures do not cease to exist because they
are not counted'. However, most teams do not count them, which means they
will be at a disadvantage to those who do. That is where Lanham comes in. He
watches games with pencil and paper in hand. He has, he says, 400
statistical categories to measure the game, but is reluctant to discuss most
of them in case the competition works out what Cambridge are doing.
Lanham started by watching soccer matches on his own. Then he wrote to clubs
offering his analysis. Many did not reply, but Dave Basset, then manager of
Wimbledon, phoned at once. In Lanham's spell at Wimbledon the team won
promotion twice. He worked with Bassett again at Sheffield United, and won
promotion twice. Under Steve Coppell, he helped Crystal Palace to win
promotion, again twice. Finally, he joined John Beck at Cambridge. The club
has since climbed from the fourth division to the upper reaches of the
second and is challenging for a place in the Premier League.
Coppell, Bassett and Beck are hardly Lanham's puppets. They built teams from
richer club's unwanted parts, from rough diamonds and hard nuts dug up from
non-league clubs. All coached teams fit enough, smart enough and committed
enough to stick to a plan; a plan drawn, unmistakeably, to Lanham's
blueprint.
Those figures that Lanham is prepared to discuss reveal an overall view of
how teams win games. He says figures show that most goals are scored from
moves involving three passes or fewer - although, strangely, he includes
goals from penalties, as 'no pass' goals - there is little point in trying
to pass more often. The more often you pass, the more chance of an
interception.
This leads to a second theory: that it takes on average 182 possessions to
score a goal. Lanham says this is a 'near constant figure' for all four
divisions of the English league and the World Cup. His next point is a
surprise: teams which manage to score on fewer possessions also concede
goals less frequently, so the average in their games stays roughly the same.
'We attack to win and we attack to win the ball back,' says Lanham. 'Two
thirds of goals come from possessions won in the final third of the field.'
Teams which press in the last third of the field all the time are more
likely to benefit from opponents' errors and less likely to suffer from
their own. The cardinal soccer sin, says Lanham, is being tackled in
possession. This often leads to goals because a team is caught shifting into
attacking positions. That is why Lanham is not keen on players
'self-indulgently expressing themselves at the expense of team.'
The products of his theories are teams which move the ball directly and
quickly into the opposing half at the first opportunity: a tactic known
disparagingly as 'route one'. Teams which has tenacious rather than skilful
midfield players and, above all, teams which plays as a team.
Lanham insists that it is entertaining. 'We take great risks to keep the
ball with our attackers at all times. We believe that that is exciting
football.' It is often exciting but rarely pretty. - But Lanham teams get
results. They may be painting by numbers, their work may appear ugly beside
the artistry of the games' old masters, but the trophy cabinet looks good at
the end of the year.
Not everyone is a Lanham fan. A glance at last Sunday's papers reveals the
hatred many feel towards his methods. Last Saturday, Cambridge lost 3-0 to
Swindown Town in the FA Cup. Swindon have become model of artistic football
under two former international midfielders, first Osvaldo Ardiles and,
latterly, Glenn Hoddle.
'Swindon slay the Cambridge beast,' gloated the headline in one of the
quality papers. 'Long-ball bores cut down to size,' crowed a tabloid. 'Even
better, Cambridge were thrashed . . . their sterile strategy discredited,'
it continued. 'The kind of mindless, boring drivel produced by Cambridge and
kindred spirits is a curse on the game.'
There was similar bile in other papers. This weekly treatment makes the
ability of Beck and his players to stick to their strategy all the more
admirable.
Lanham reads such reports. The jibe that irritates him is that Cambridge are
mindless. 'That is one thing we are not, everything we do is thought out.'
On the other hand, he knows that chance will average out over the whole
season: Cambridge have already beaten Swindon twice in the league.
Lanham says he knows why his approach is so unpopular. This is where his
theory of soccer and his theory of life overlap. Football fans are not
interested in facts or teams, they care about individuals and 'unfounded
opinion.'
'As Howard Hughes said, 'I am interested in why the sun comes up tomorrow
morning'. Most people are interested in their fellow men. Most people are
interested in individuals, not teams.
'There is this thing called 'hype', man can only see individuals, not the
team. Why do people watch Coronation Street, rather than, say, a factual
programme on Mussolini?'
Lanham says soccer attracts the opinionated. 'If I hear my mates talking
football in the pub I can't join in. That would deny them their right to an
opinion.' But then another of his mottoes, a quote from Lord Montgomery,
runs: 'Unfounded opinion is valueless.'
Lanham believes his analysis could be harnessed to different teams. He
could, he says, work for a club such as Tottenham and help them get better
results without abandoning their style.
For all his 400 categories, his computer and his banks of files, the
statistic that counts is the one on his letterhead: eight promotions. The
press and many fans may think the team he has helped create is a monster,
but if Beck and his players do not decide they want to be loved, Cambridge
will continue to enjoy success beyond its modest means.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Sport: Lured by wild Irish trout - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE way out of Cahir, in the green and glorious county of Tipperary, I
spotted a fine mansion standing in rolling parkland. It was, I was told, a
place of refuge for priests to fight the grip of the demon drink.
Innocently, I asked if it was full. 'They say they're building an
extension,' my informant said with a laugh.
Doubtless this was no more than just another impious calumny against the
Roman Catholic church. But it occurred to me that if I needed to flee the
noisome world to grapple with temptation, a grand house overlooking the
finest trout river in Ireland would be no bad place for it.
The river is the Suir, which rises in the Devilsbit mountains north of
Thurles, flows south to the feet of the Knockmealdown mountains (what
wonderful names the Irish give their gentle hills), then forges east to
Waterford and the sea. Although I have fished no more than four or five of
its 115 miles - with precious little to show for it - it fascinates me more
than any river I have known.
This is partly on account of its scale. It is, for the most part, wide, deep
and powerful: it is essential to wear chest waders to fish it properly. Even
more potent is the Suir's wonderful vitality, its abundance of life, which
has survived innumerable atrocious incidents of pollution. It is thick with
weed, bursting with insects, teeming with incredible numbers of trout.
It took a master angler of a bygone era, Sir Edward Grey, to discover the
Suir's fabulous potential as a dry fly river. Grey had learned the art on
the exacting waters of the Itchen at Winchester, but he found the trout of
the Suir almost uncatchable, even though they had at that time (around 1880)
never seen a dry fly.
Being a master, he kept at them.
He found that if he kept low in the water and delivered the fly over the
fish without drag or showing the cast, they would take. On his best day he
caught 11, the two biggest each over 2 3/4 lbs.
Now, I will never be a master. When I first went to the Suir, seven or eight
years ago, I was mindful of Sir Edward's words, and kept at it. The
difference was that in two days of the most intensive effort I did not rise
a fish, let alone catch one. They fed all around me, continuously, and I
cast at them. But they were contemptuous of my hamfisted pretences, and I
left much subdued.
A humiliation like that lingers in a chap's mind. Wherever else I caught
trout, I remembered how the Suir had trounced me. Last summer I went back. I
am older and wiser, I told myself, whereas the trout cannot grow wiser. This
time it would be different.
They were two wild days. On the first, we were at Suir Mount, downstream
from Ardfinnan, where the record Irish salmon of 57 lbs was caught a long
time ago. A furious wind howled upriver, making casting a dangerous farce.
It quietened in the evening, giving promise of a compensatory evening rise.
The promise was illusory.
Next morning we went to Swiss Cottage, a magnificent stretch below the town
of Cahir which is controlled by the local angling club. Here the wind was
roaring upstream, unleashing frequent icy downpours and making life very
unpleasant. But as we cowered in the lea of some shuddering willows, we
witnessed a marvellous sight: great clouds of olive flies hatching and being
hurled this way and that by the gale.
The trout began feasting, and we rushed forth. Casting was a soul-destroying
business, as the wind kept whipping the fly off the water or lashing the
cast down on the surface like a snapped hawser. Yet every now and then
providence permitted a fish to be covered properly, and then it might take.
I duped two, my friend Niall three.
A couple of hours of this buffeting was as much as we could stand. Local
opinion suggested that shelter from the blast might be found at Ballycarron,
upstream from Cahir.
So it proved, and there was enough fly still hatching to keep the trout
interested. I found a queue of them rising in an even-flowing run between
high banks. I slithered down, balanced on a tree stump, and attacked them in
a calculated, level-headed, panic-free manner. Two hours passed in a flash
before the hatch petered out. By then I had caught two.
If you wish to test yourself as a fly fisher, try the Suir. It and its
tributaries offer an inexhaustible amount of fishing, most of which is
available to the visitor at extremely modest cost.
The Southern regional fisheries board has published a guide with enough
information to enrich several lifetimes. There are innumerable places to
stay: as good as any is Mrs Ryan's at Clonanav Farmhouse, Ballymacarbry,
Clonmel, which specialises in fishing.
But a word to the wise. Those who normally fish for the fat, pellet-fed,
half-witted stocked trout of over-manicured English chalkstreams should be
prepared for a shock. One wild Suir one-pounder will demand more of you than
any of your flabby four-pounders from the Test.
This fishing is more difficult than anything you have imagined. Be prepared
to eat of the pie of humility.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAX Wilkinson, editor of the Weekend FT, has been an accomplished skier for
more than 20 years. But while his skiing technique rarely lets him down, his
ski clothing - also of some years' standing - has left rather a lot to be
desired.
With his old-fashioned, shapeless, quilted grey jacket, skimpy little woolly
hat, army-surplus cotton shirt (Pounds 11:99) and trousers tucked into his
ski boots, he was (dare one say it) one of those Brits you can spot a mile
off on the slopes.
This might be all very well in resorts such as Soll, Sauze d'Oulx or Sol y
Nieve, but when Max and I headed for Aspen, haunt of Colorado's skiing
glitterati, some sartorial adjustments became essential.
So, I took my life into his hands - not by leading him over a cliff but by
dragging him into one of Aspen's leading outfitters. The conversation went
something like this . . .
'Max, you're a snappy dresser in the office so why let yourself down on the
slopes? You really CAN'T wear that dreadful jacket and that frightful hat in
Aspen. I feel I really must protect your image. What on earth would Melanie
and Don or Chrissie and Andy say if they saw you like this? That jacket's
got to go, for a start]'
'Must it? I'm rather fond of it. I picked it up for Dollars 10 at a stall in
Beijing six years ago. It's real duck down - made specially for China's
export market.'
'I'm sorry, Max, but you just can't ski in that in Aspen. It's completely
out of fashion (never in, I suspect) and far too long. You'll be a laughing
stock.
'As for those gloves, you might as well chuck them straight in the bin.
You'd get more warmth out of a couple of old socks.'
'But they're my cycling gloves from Tesco. What's wrong with them? They are
supposed to be skiing-type gloves.'
'Your fingers will fall off if you ski with those on Aspen Mountain. It's
about 11,000 feet] Keep them for cycling - or just dump them. And those
awful trousers. Do you use those for cycling, too ?'
'No, I don't. They're perfectly good skiing trousers. I've had them for only
11 years. They're still perfectly serviceable.'
'Get rid of them, Max. And that silly hat. It doesn't even cover your ears.'
'What's wrong with it? If you think this is bad, you should see one I left
behind in London. It's also woolly but it's shrunk into a funny shape. But,
honestly, I don't know why you're being so critical. When I took up skiing
in the '60s, nobody thought of it in terms of fashion.'
'So I see, Max.'
'My family have never been great ones for fashion. My great-uncle Ernest
used to ski in the Austrian Tirol in an old tweed jacket. Why would you want
to wear anything fashionable or smart outside, where no-one is looking at
you?
'Besides, all my ski gear is still perfectly serviceable and, what's more,
extremely comfortable.'
Fortunately, fate took a hand. The hat fell off during a testing run through
the trees and, happily, a search for it was unsuccessful. If ever it was
located, we shall never know. Certainly, it was never handed in to
lost-and-found where fur coats and jewellery, rather than old woolly hats,
tend to find their way.
Then there was another bit of luck. His trousers were ripped - more
power-skiing to blame. Warmth and modesty gave me an excuse to drag him,
although not without considerable protest, to Bill McDonough's emporium, the
Crystal City of the Rockies, where a new man could be made of him.
What did McDonough think should be changed? 'Everything]' he said candidly,
with a wry smile. Out went the jacket. And the trousers, gloves and hat. And
out went the blue shirt.
On went the Meister turtleneck (Dollars 24), the magnificent Bognor
one-piece (Dollars 688) - 'not a cheap suit,' Wilkinson remarked, grimly -
the beautifully-soft kid gloves (Dollars 75) and the slightly-touristy Aspen
hat. There was even a pretty Aspenite draped admiringly around his shoulder
to help along the new image.
And, hey presto: a Wilkinson to admire and be proud-of was ready to hit Spar
Gulch, Copper Bowl, Ruthie's and all the other glamorous trails on Aspen
Mountain. Even he admitted (grudgingly) that there had been a slight
improvement.
But after a day skiing in the footsteps of Jack Nicholson, Donald Trump,
Robert Wagner et al, he couldn't help sneaking a final glimpse at that
Chinese jacket he was persuaded to chuck in the dumpster in the Aspen Mall
just to see if it was still there. It was.
Nobody in Aspen, it seemed, was prepared to give it house room. And, even
then, he was tempted to retrieve it. It was, after all, still perfectly
serviceable.
No, Max. Leave it where it is. Once you have been re-made, there is no going
back.

<TEXT>
ANYBODY wondering how to use tartan in their home should hurry along to Anta
at 141 Portland Road, London W11, where the shop seems to be devoted to
nothing but the hundred-and-one things you can do with it. Annie Stewart,
commissioned by Hunters of Brora to design a new range of floor coverings
and furnishing fabrics, has been experimenting with the Scottish material
for years, re-colouring and re-working the ancient theme.
At the moment, there is a serious flirtation with tartan in interior design
circles. Any decorating magazine worth its glossy paper devoted pages at
Christmas to bedecking candles, tables and mantelpieces with dark, rich
tartans; while Ralph Lauren has for some time been showing us the posh
American way with tartan, using it on everything from plates and
candle-holders to bed linen and rugs. But tartan is much, much more than a
temporary decorative phase. Those sumptuous colours with their rigorous
purity of lines, , and the satisfyingly geometric patterns - all stand the
test of time, and both Hunters and Annie Stewart see it as an enduring
classic to be updated and freshened in keeping with modern life.
Anybody who visits Anta will soon see that Annie and her architect husband,
Lachlan, really have found new and contemporary ways of building on the
traditional elements, lifting tartan right out of the world of the tawdry
instant tourist cliche of toffee tins and plastic-coated luggage. Besides
producing one-off special designs for people such as Katharine Hamnett,
Jasper Conran and Paul Smith, there has been a range of furnishing fabrics
and floor coverings for the interior designer Nina Campbell - used in the
Duke and Duchess of Yorks' new house at Windsor.
Annie has re-introduced the flat-weave floor coverings that were used widely
in the 18th century. All woven for her by Hunters from 100 per cent wool,
these coverings once were known as Scots carpet but fell out of favour when
tufted carpeting came in during the 1930s. Now, though, people are
re-discovering them.
They are far more hard-wearing than their plusher, softer, newer relations:
for example, the Stewarts are busy organising a replacement for a carpet
that has been down for 55 years in a Scottish ancestral home. Over at
Balmoral, there is a similar request to replace a tartan floor covering that
has been down since Queen Victoria's time. Anta has 12 different
floor-covering designs, all at Pounds 35 a square metre, but will also make
to special order.
For the Hunters' collection, Annie will draw on the mill's authentic
tradition - re-colouring the tweeds for furnishing fabrics and using tartan
themes for the floor coverings. Hunters is selling four different
colourways, among them a specially-attractive soft grey, blue and greenish
tartan.
Anybody wondering how to use tartan will find Anta a fund of inspiration.
Those in Scotland (and it always seems extraordinary to southerners that
Scottish houses make so little use of their own wonderful decorative
heritage) might like to look at the watercolours in the exhibition 'Royal
Residences of the Victorian Era,' now on display at Holyroodhouse,
Edinburgh. They feature tartan-clad rooms at Balmoral. Part of the secret is
not to be too timid, and to balance the bold tartans with gentler ones,
keeping to the same tones. If you do not have the courage to go the whole
hog, you could start experimenting with some tartan ceramics, a cushion, or
the odd rug or two to fling over a sofa. Or you could don a dressing-gown,
fill a duffel bag or sling on a coat - all in one or other of the Stewarts'
new tartans.

FT  01 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: A fine madness at t'mill - Lucia van der
Post describes how a part of Scotland's heritage was rescued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU MUST be mad,' said Annabel Stapleton when husband David told her of his
latest notion - he had discovered that Hunters of Brora, an old-established
Scottish mill, was in receivership and he was proposing to rescue it.
You can see her point of view. They lived in Cumbria, north-west England;
the mill was in Brora, a remote corner of eastern Sutherland about halfway
between Inverness and John o' Groats. Besides which, he was not in need of
employment.
In Hong Kong, he had launched - and guided to great success - WI Carr
Overseas, a stockbroking company. In the 1970s he had bought Pinneys, a
small smoked-fish business, for about Pounds 20,000 and turned it into a
multi-million pound concern which he sold to Hillsdown Holdings in the '80s.
In Cumbria, he was running a small partnership looking after the wealth of
private individuals as well as helping to tend Annabel's family's
loss-making estate. David Stapleton could be said to have done his bit in
life. But, as he puts it: Hunters of Brora was special. It is the last
fully-integrated woollen mill in the Highlands. If it goes, a whole
tradition and way of life goes with it as well as the the livelihoods of
most of the village.
'To anybody in the hunting, fishing and shooting world, Hunters' tweeds and
cloths are legendary. Old man Hunter, who started it in 1901, used to buy
something like 80 per cent of the Shetland wool crop which he spun into yarn
and then sold back to the crofters who, in the long, dark days of winter,
turned the yarn into jumpers and the like. The tweeds and cloths are known
throughout the world and used by people as different as Daks-Simpson,
Burberrys, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Junko Shimada in Japan.
'I discovered it was in receivership by chance when I went there to buy some
of our estate tweed. I couldn't resist the temptation to try to save it. I
put together a consortium of five shareholders, all with different interests
and abilities, and, after a lot of horse-trading and appeals to the
Highlands &amp; Islands Development Board, the Highland Regional Council and
anybody else with a 'soft-touch' cheque-book, we eventually bought
everything for Pounds 89,000. It was a bargain and meant we could put almost
all the money we had raised (about Pounds 900,000) into developing the
business. '
Hunters' strength is its range of colours. It is a designers' paradise.
Piled high in the sheds are some 1,600 colours, often up to seven colours in
a single yarn, and an historic archive of literally hundreds of different
designs and patterns. 'Above all,' as Stapleton puts it, 'we have a story
and a history and people respond to that. But Brora is a little village
nearer to Reykjavik than London. Few people come to it. We had to take Brora
to the people.'
So, they started a mail-order catalogue and, at the same time, improved
their little shop in Brora, widening the product range to add things like
Fair Isle and cashmere jumpers, rugs, country jackets, scarves and gloves as
well as the yarn and tweed the business used to sell. Profits from the shop
and mail-order side went up five times - from Pounds 42,000 in 1990 to
Pounds 217,000 in 1991.
More expansion is going to come from a range of furnishing fabrics and floor
coverings which they have asked Annie Stewart of Anta (see story below) to
develop for them. The mood of the day is with them; in interior design
circles, tartans, plaids and the Scottish look are all the rage - besides
which, the sturdy floor coverings at between Pounds 19 and Pounds 25 a metre
are a bargain in today's world.
At the moment, Hunters also is looking for agents in every county to sell
things like the country jackets, the rugs and the furnishing fabrics from
their own homes. And it has just had the largest order in the mill's
history: 7 1/2 miles (12 km) of plaid fabrics for curtains, floor and wall
coverings for the new Sheraton Hotel in Edinburgh. Everyone is excited about
that. 'We've got through our first year,' says Stapleton. 'We have broken
even. If we can get Pounds 3m worth of sales - which the mill used to do
easily between 1980 and 1988 - then we have a viable business on our hands.
But if this mill closes, there is hardly a family in Brora that won't be
affected.
'People say to me, are we going to do another Pinneys? We are not. This
company will never be for sale. We are going to cherish it and make it
work.'
The mail-order catalogue is available free from Hunters of Brora, Brora,
Sutherland KW9 6NA, Scotland (tel: 0408-621-366). Cashmere jumpers (in six
colours, V-necked, round-necked and cardigans) are all Pounds 99. Tartan
rugs, 5 ft by 6 ft in the Big Seven tartans and muted colours, are all
Pounds 39 each. Country jackets are Pounds 325 each. Shooting or country
stockings are Pounds 29.50 a pair.
Estate tweeds (Hunters weaves well over 100 different estate tweeds already)
can be made to special order; the minimum order is 60 metres.
Samples can be sent of the four different flat-weave plaid floor coverings
(36, 48 and 60 ins wide at Pounds 19, Pounds 21 and Pounds 25 a metre
respectively) as well as the range of furnishing fabrics.

TWO WEEKS ago I looked at the recently released Quattro Pro Special Edition
from Borland. Priced at Pounds 49.95 and interchangeable with Lotus 1-2-3,
we found it 'by far the best value for money spreadsheet on the market
today.' But in its prior guise as Quattro Pro 2 the same product won top
industry awards only a few months earlier. How does a market leader
retailing at Pounds 395 in April 1991 manage to turn up as a modest Pounds
49 package for the home and small business user in August?
To understand selling prices you must first look at cost prices. The cost
price of one copy of any software package is around Pounds 5 - the box, a
handful of floppy disks, and a manual. Selling a product at Pounds 395 when
it cost Pounds 5 to make looks promising, but of course there are other
costs, primarily the cost of developing the product. However, spreadsheet
and word processing packages have been around for a long time. They are
simple in structure and an experienced development team can write new ones
in their sleep. With sales of the top products now in their millions, the
big companies have long since recovered their development costs for DOS
packages, although new Windows applications are different.
Therefore, one might expect prices to fall from their Pounds 395 levels. In
any normal market they would, but the software market is different -
corporate buyers will not let them.
By far the biggest purchasers of software packages are the 'corporates'  -
big companies and institutions which buy dozens or hundreds of copies at one
go. The big companies have the big money and their desire to pay absurdly
high prices is legendary. They will pay Pounds 100,000 for a mainframe
package when a package which does exactly the same thing running on a PC
costs Pounds 1,000. They take on outside IT consultants at Pounds 600 to
Pounds 800 per day without batting an eyelid. Corporate buyers are happier
paying Pounds 395 for a computer package: Pounds 49 is too low - it makes
them uncomfortable.
If paying fancy prices makes the big companies feel better, it is the duty
of the software companies to keep prices high and relieve them of their
money. So successful companies such as Borland, Lotus (whose 1-2-3 sells for
Pounds 475 and has sold 14m copies), and WordPerfect (whose WordPerfect
costs Pounds 399 and has sold 7m copies) have kept up price levels long
after development costs have been covered, and made mouthwatering profits.
While the cash was rolling in, a nagging question remained. There was a mass
market of newcomers to computing who could not afford these prices and would
learn their spreadsheets on other, cheaper packages. It is not just
computers which get programed; users get programmed too. Once a package has
become second-nature people are reluctant to change. This high-price
strategy might ultimately prove a blind alley. In spite of all evidence, the
gullibility of the corporate buyer cannot be inexhaustible. Surely one day
the penny will drop? Profits from the corporate sector would plummet and in
the mass market the big companies would be nowhere.
To the companies the need was obvious - to grab potential users as early as
possible by developing the mass market. But if they came out with a product
at a mass market price they risked compromising the image of their premier
product. The conundrum seemed insoluble. The big suppliers wrung their
hands, but, terrified of what would happen to their existing market if they
reduced prices, did nothing.
Then, in November 1990 one of the companies broke ranks. Computer Associates
dropped the price of Supercalc, close behind Lotus worldwide, by 80 per
cent. In the UK that meant a fall from Pounds 395 to Pounds 79. The software
suppliers held their breath - was this the beginning of meltdown? Now that a
leading supplier had broken ranks so spectacularly, would the corporates
wake up and ask awkward questions?
Several months later, at their offices in Scott Valley, California, Borland
boss Philippe Kahn and his lieutenants anxiously surveyed the industry sales
figures. To their surprise, market shares continued about the same. Fewer
sales had been lost to Supercalc than expected. Although Supercalc's high
street sales had risen, its share of corporate sales had not changed.
Emboldened by the Supercalc example, Borland decided it could move into the
mass market.
By reducing the price so drastically Computer Associates had achieved higher
volume sales, but in the process had downgraded Supercalc's image from a
quality to a budget product. Borland would not make this mistake. They would
offer two versions of Quattro Pro, which would be virtually identical in
function but drastically different in pricing and brand image. For 'high-end
corporate and power users' Borland would introduce a new version of Quattro
Pro with a few extra features; then it would quietly repackage the existing
version for the 'home and small business' market.
Quattro Pro 3 was announced in July, recommended retail price Pounds 295. It
offered interactive WYSIWYG (pronounced whizz-ee-wig), sideways printing,
and 'Sound F/X technology to add fanfares, applause and more' to graphics
slideshows. (Kahn and his team are not marketing smoothies but enthusiasts
who come up with OTT features such as 'Turbodrive' and 'VROOMM' - Virtual
Runtime Object-Oriented Memory Manager). A month later Quattro Pro Special
Edition was announced at just under Pounds 50.
So what will happen? We know, Borland knows, and corporate buyers know, that
99 per cent of users currently running Lotus 1-2-3 (Pounds 295-Pounds 475)
or Quattro Pro 3 (Pounds 295) would find that Quattro Pro SE (Pounds 49)
provides all the functions they will ever need. So will sales of 1-2-3 and
Quattro Pro 3 collapse? Of course not. By selling through the high street,
downgrading the packaging, and by the simple expedient of setting the price
so low, Borland has ensured that the corporate buyer simply will not dare to
buy Quattro Pro SE.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO YOUNG fashion entrepreneurs are making a profit from an unusual clothing
company that has managed to overcome serious setbacks during the recession.
Paul Walker and Frances Slater's modest success is founded on two unusual
decisions. They have established their headquarters in the Scottish
Highlands, well away from London's ailing fashion industry. And they have
brought in a chemist specialising in synthetic yarns and inks to put them in
touch with futuristic developments.
They produce under two different labels. Out for Lunch, currently 70 per
cent of the business, consists of sweatshirts and T-shirts sold through
winter sports shops. Slater is a more up-market label, not as profitable,
but, Frances and Paul believe, with greater scope for international growth.
It includes black shirts and dresses that change colour as you wear them,
soft knitted silks and linens.
The Out to Lunch range wholesale for an average of Pounds 15 and the Slaters
range for Pounds 29-Pounds 35, giving a 35-40 per cent profit. It began
haphazardly.
In 1988, Paul, newly graduated from Dundee University, was selling sporty
sweatshirts in the Alps and on European beaches. He enlisted the skills of
Frances, a designer who had also studied in Dundee.
With an initial outlay of Pounds 3,500, they bought 500 basic dyed garments
from a manufacturer. Frances printed a range of designs in her home and Paul
sold them at a 50 per cent mark-up. It was a money-making hobby. Paul had a
full-time job selling office equipment and Frances was doing an MA at
Birmingham.
In February 1989, the two were given the chance by a friend in the business
to display a few of their more adventurously printed sweatshirts at a trade
show in Harrogate. They received advance orders worth around Pounds 7,000
for delivery in September, and on the strength of that, Paul toured winter
sports shops in the north of England and Scotland until he had netted orders
totalling Pounds 25,000.
'We did a balancing act over the next few months,' explains Paul, now
managing director of the company. 'We needed a unit in which to print our
designs, and we had to get capital. We chose Laggan Bridge in Scotland
because we liked the area and because the Highlands and Islands Development
Board gave us a grant of Pounds 6,000 towards the cost of our capital
equipment.
'We then needed another Pounds 9,000 for equipment, and provision for
initial running costs. We took our business plan to a couple of banks
without much success, but then, on the strength of our orders, we managed to
borrow Pounds 25,000 on overdraft from NatWest in Worcester.'
The two rented a farmhouse with outlying buildings, taking on a 25-year
lease with rent of Pounds 200 a month, fixed for 10 years.
'In six weeks flat we had to pull out the cow pens, totally strip the place
and install printing machinery,' says Paul. 'We did it all ourselves, and it
was very hard work. But we had a September deadline for our first orders.'
The design and printing aspects flourished from the start, as did the
selling.
'We have the space and air to think here,' says Paul. 'It's important from
the design point of view; we don't get dragged into a London way of
thinking, but keep a distinct identity.'
In the first year they had a turnover of Pounds 56,000, and managed to pay
off a large part of their overdraft. In their second year, though, the
company nearly foundered on problems that lay outside their immediate
control: the manufacturing and dying of the clothes.
Their first manufacturer provided garments with cheap dyes that ran. 'We
didn't know enough to specify the correct dyes,' admits Paul.
Reacting perhaps too quickly, Walker Slater then turned to a Tunisian
factory through the recommendation of a friend. It was an even greater
disaster, compounded by the fact it coincided with a foray into the US
market.
'The trouble was bad quality control. Each time they mixed dyes they came
out slightly differently, and tops and trousers that were supposed to match
didn't.
'We knew there was a problem almost from the start, and Frances went there
for eight weeks to try and sort it out. But while she got on with the
workers themselves, the management just didn't believe a woman held any
authority, and they kept cutting corners to the detriment of the quality.'
Unfortunately much of this production run was for valuable new US orders. In
spite of employing an agent in New York, the company failed miserably. US
buyers cancelled orders on seeing the bad colour matching; those who did
have decent colour matches were slow with payments. Altogether, Paul
calculates the episode cost them Pounds 12,000-Pounds 17,000, and created a
slight loss that year of Pounds 3,000.
'Having two dodgy manufacturers could have brought us down,' says Paul. At
any rate, it brought their overdraft up to its original level. But the US
experiment had one beneficial result. In October 1990 the two won a British
Airways award for export potential to the US. Through this, Walker was able
to make some useful contacts and establish a good working relationship with
Shapiro, a garment-manufacturing company in London whose other clients
include Arabella Pollen and Katherine Hamnett.
In October 1990 Walker Slater made an unusual hiring: chemist Michael Just.
The futuristic element, backed by top quality, gives the company a high
profile with buyers, leading to an estimated turnover in the current
financial year of Pounds 180,000. Orders totalling Pounds 15,000 were due
over Christmas, with a further Pounds 30,000 due in the spring. The company
has appointed an agent in London, enabling Paul, who has spent much of his
time selling, to concentrate on two largely ignored areas: marketing policy
and advertising.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When can I count my losses?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HOLD a block of Maxwell Communication shares and worked for Pergamon
Press. From what date will the Inland Revenue recognise this block as a
total loss with respect to my ability to write off capital gains against it?
If, by the end of March, you have made capital gains for the year exceeding
Pounds 5,500 (and you consider the Maxwell shares of negligible value) you
should write to your tax inspector (the letter should reach the tax office
by Sunday April 5):
'In accordance with section 22(2) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, I claim
that the value of my holding of . . . Maxwell Communication Corporation
ordinary shares has become negligible, namely . . . ,and that I should
therefore be treated as if I had sold that holding today, April . . . 1992,
for that sum and had had immediately reacquired it for that same sum, in
circumstances falling outside section 66(1) of that Act'.
If your 1991-92 capital gains are only slightly over Pounds 5,500, you will
have to weigh up the pros and cons of making a claim this April (rather than
in April 1993 or later).
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14: Capital gains tax - an
introduction.
I HAVE had a number of BES investments which went into receivership. I have
deliberately not so far filed negligible value claims because I have no
immediate utilisation losses, although it is possible that they could be of
use in later years. You have implied that a negligible value claim should
only be filed when you can use the loss. I have no allowable loss on the
original investment as they are BES investments, but indexation relief is
available. If I wait until I have a taxable CGT gain, after allowing for the
exemption relief, can I claim indexation CGT losses right up to the date of
my election or only to the date of the receivership?
Indexation relief (on the incidental expenses of acquisition) will run up to
the month in which you make your negligible-value claim, unless the company
is struck off. On the day the company is struck off, there will be an
automatic deemed disposal under section 22(l) of the CGT Act, making any
subsequent section 22(2) claim void.
Although, for practical purposes, the deemed sale-and-reacquisition under a
section 22(2) claim can be regarded as taking place on the day on which the
claim is made (as indicated in the preamble to extrastatutory concession D28
in the free booklet of concessions, IRI), section 22(2) actually says that
when the claim is allowed by the inspector the deemed sale-and-reacquisition
shall be treated as taking place 'thereupon', viz on the day the inspector
allows the claim. It may be worth insisting on the strict letter of the law
where, for example, the inspector takes a year or two to make a decision and
the enhanced loss can be used in the year in which he or she finally gets
around to allowing the claim.
We take it that your questions do not relate to section 574 of the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 - income tax relief on certain allowable
losses accruing to subscribers in unlisted companies.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cash in on your bricks and mortar -
How to . . . get income from your home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE YOU sitting at home in retirement, wishing you could get some more
income from somewhere?
Chances are that the source for that income is close to home - in fact it is
your home.
Bricks and mortar are precious assets. But converting the value which has
accrued in your house into a viable income can carry risks, so think
carefully before acting.
If you still have a sizeable lump sum salted away you could buy an annuity
with it, or possibly, if you want to protect your estate, a selection of
income unit trusts.
If that is not an option, the simplest way to increase income is to sell
your house and buy somewhere cheaper. This may be attractive if you are
unfortunate enough to be widowed.
However, if you do not want to move, schemes exist which allow you to take
income from your house while continuing to live in it. But they are
complicated.
Consider your heirs. If you have no children, or are happy with the amount
you have already given them while bringing them up, you may not mind a
scheme which destroys the value of your inheritance. If you are keen to
leave your heirs a nest egg you need to be more careful.
For those with no spare capital and who cannot countenance leaving the home
of all their memories, there are two ways to extract income from your house:
Annuity-linked Home Income Plans
This is the simplest scheme. You re-mortgage your house, or a portion of it,
and buy an annuity with the proceeds. The sums should work out so that the
annuity pays the mortgage and leaves a worthwhile increase to your income.
Usually, both the mortgage rate and the annuity payment are fixed. The rate
you receive on the annuity, which repays a fixed income until your death,
depends on your age. The longer you wait before starting one of these
schemes, the better value you will receive. As a rule, you cannot
effectively benefit from such an arrangement unless you are at least 70
years old, the minimum for many schemes.
Most will not allow you to borrow more than Pounds 30,000, as this is the
limit for receiving mortgage interest relief at source. Loans are not
economic above this level. On a loan of Pounds 30,000, a woman of 75 can
currently receive an annual income of Pounds 1,525 from Allchurches, and
Pounds 1,649 from Carlyle Life, according to the Consumer's Association.
This may not sound particularly exciting, but it could be a useful
supplement to your pension. Separate rates are available for couples.
You can put together one of these plans yourself by shopping around, but it
is easier to use one of the established schemes.
Home Reversion Schemes
Reversions generally produce greater income, but are less kind to your
heirs.
Typically, the plans work as follows: you sell your house to a life office,
which only has the right to use it once you have died. In return for taking
the risk that you live for a long time, the life office pays only a fraction
 -usually around a half - of the value of your home.
Variants on this include cash reversions, where you receive a cash sum up
front and invest it for income as you wish, and schemes where you pay a
nominal rent for the house, while the money from the reversion is put into
an annuity. Stalwart Life offers a scheme which effectively allows you to
make a straight swap of a reversion for an annuity.
While you are alive, a reversion costs you nothing. But if you have heirs,
they may not thank you for using one of these schemes. With a standard home
income plan, the heirs are left a house, and an outstanding loan. This gives
them a worthwhile inheritance.
With a reversion scheme, they are left nothing as the house reverts to
someone else. You can buy a 'capital-protected' annuity - which might
guarantee to repay capital to your estate within three years, for example -
but again this will not help if you only just survive the period of capital
protection.
Reversions do, however, tend to provide greater slices of income - according
to the Consumers' Association a 75-year-old woman, using the same
assumptions as above, would receive Pounds 2,924 from Carlyle Life, Pounds
3,180 from Cavendish Property, and Pounds 2,595 from Stalwart Assurance.
You do not have to sell your entire house. Reversions can involve pledging
fractions of the value of your house to the insurers, which lessens the
difficulties for your descendants. Carlyle Life also has a 'renewable' plan,
which allows you to sell successive slices of your house.
Depending on your circumstances, either reversions or home income plans
could make sense. However, the following should not be touched with a barge
pole:
Variable-Interest Mortgages
With any luck, no ill will come of using a variable mortgage. Maybe interest
rates will continue to fall. But 'safety first' is a good motto in this
situation.
Roll-Up Loans
These are re-mortgages, but you do not repay the interest. Instead, it
'rolls up', to be retrieved from your estate.
These schemes could make sense before retirement, as you try to boost your
standard of living before pension and endowment policies mature, but they
are too risky for the elderly. If the loan builds up to 75 per cent of the
value of the house, you may be required to repay some of it. If that is not
possible, you could lose the house. Steer clear.
Investment Bond Schemes
These have been more or less outlawed, and if you are offered such a scheme,
you should report it to the regulators. The concept is the same as for the
standard home income plan, but money is invested in an investment bond, not
an annuity.
There are many circumstances where an investment bond, which fluctuates with
the market rather than offering a fixed return, makes sense. This is not one
of them. With your house at stake, the risk that the value of the bond will
go down is simply not worth taking. Many pensioners were thrust into these
schemes just as mortgage interest rates began to rise, and equity markets
fell. In many cases, they have been forced to sell their homes. Do not
touch.
Before taking professional advice, which is essential before taking any
steps towards financial packages as complex as this, two publications will
be useful to you.
Age Concern England publishes the standard text on the subject, written by
Cecil Hinton, an independent financial adviser who specialises in home
equity-release plans for the elderly.
Also, an up-to-date and comprehensive consumer survey of the products on
offer comes in the current issue of Which? magazine, published by the
Consumers' Association.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pension claims 'to be toned down'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU find yourself confused by claims about the performance record of
competing investments, you are in good company, writes Norma Cohen.
It has emerged that even professionals, such as pension fund trustees, need
help in reading the fine print of fund managers' advertising. The National
Association of Pension Funds, which includes the UK's largest pension plans,
has published an advertising code intended to prevent fund managers from
making misleading claims about their own performance. Although the code is
voluntary, the NAPF is urging trustees to ignore any unsolicited advertising
that does not conform to the code.
'People will inevitably show the best information that is in their
commercial interest to show. And for perfectly good commercial reasons,'
said David Adams, a trustee of the British Rail Pension Trust Company and
chairman of the NAPF working party which drafted the code.
The group's concern, he said, is not that fund managers are necessarily
lying about their track records, but that they are presenting only parts of
the whole picture and doing so in a misleading manner. For example, he said,
a fund manager who topped the performance league tables in a single year is
likely to tout that.
But if professionals need a code to protect them, what of the hapless retail
investor? While agreeing that personal pension plans are often sold to
individuals based on the producers' performance record, Adams said the NAPF
had been unwilling to ask that it be extended to retail products.
John Clamp, executive director of Combined Actuarial Performance Services,
which ranks pension fund performance, said: 'I've seen worse breaches of
ethics in the retail market than anywhere else. It is ironic that the more
sophisticated wholesale sector has chosen to regulate itself while the
government has chosen to do nothing to regulate the retail sector.'
Among misleading statistics that he had seen presented was a fund manager
comparing the returns of a Far Eastern equities investment fund to those of
a building society savings account. 'The most basic rule is that you must
compare apples with apples, not with oranges,' he said.
Jean Eaglesham, money policy director at the Consumers Association, said
that while her group had not actively been campaigning for an advertising
code of conduct in retail products, it had been pressing for the
presentation of inflation-adjusted figures. It is easy to impress someone by
saying that a Pounds 10,000 investment can grow to Pounds 200,000 in 25
years. But would they be as impressed if they knew that if inflation
averages 5 per cent a year, that figure would be worth Pounds 59,000 in
today's money?

HALIFAX and Nationwide building societies have cut interest rates on savings
and chequebook current accounts from 1 February.
Halifax has cut only particular tiers on certain accounts: on 90-Day Extra,
for example, it will pay 10.95 per cent, down from 11.0 per cent on accounts
over Pounds 50,000.
Nationwide Anglia has cut its savings rates by an average of 0.53 percentage
points, but has increased rates for Asset Reserve, its small business and
club account, by between 1.1 per cent and 0.1 per cent. The biggest
reduction comes on the Nationwide Tessa accounts where rates fall by 0.6
percentage points.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fleming joins the rush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 64 investing days remain before April 5, the end of the tax year, and
the financial service industry is pulling out all the marketing stops. The
latest investment trust on offer is Fleming Income &amp; Capital. Like many
recent issues, it has a split capital structure and is linked to the
personal equity plan (Pep) market.
The offer is timed so that investors can place their full Pounds 6,000 Pep
allowance into the trust for each of the tax years 1991-92 and 1992-93. A
married couple could thus put Pounds 24,000, in Pep form, into this issue.
There are two classes of share: zero coupon and ordinary income. The former
are being issued at 30p and should be repaid at 85.2p in 2002, a yield of 11
per cent a year. Security is provided by the fact that the initial assets of
the trust will cover 112 per cent of the zero's ultimate repayment value.
Private investors cannot apply directly for the zeroes, though. They can be
bought either in the after-market (when the price might have risen and the
yield fallen) or packaged in a 100p unit with the ordinary income shares.
The ordinary income shares will receive all the income of the trust and
will, at 70p each, offer a dividend yield of 9 per cent. For a top-rate
taxpayer holding the shares in a Pep, the equivalent gross yield is 15 per
cent. The risk, as with other shares in this category, is of loss of
capital. The ordinary income shares will be repaid only after the zeroes.
The trust's assets will need to grow at 5.2 per cent a year for the shares
to be repaid at the issue price.
This growth rate is not as fast as that needed by some other ordinary
shares, but potential investors should remember that it might not happen.
An alternative would be to buy the unit at 100p, which would yield 6.3 per
cent. In such a case, an investor could almost ignore the split structure
(although, on past experience, it should prevent the shares from falling to
a discount). Fleming Income &amp; Capital could then be judged simply as a
high-yield UK equity investment trust.
Because Fleming is paying 3 per cent to IFAs, the charges on the trust are
near traditional unit-trust levels. Money can be saved by buying the shares
through a discount service.
Another option is provided by Halifax Standard's new Income Advantage unit
trust although, owing to the government's rules, only Pounds 3,000 can be
placed in this trust in Pep form. The trust will invest internationally and
will have a yield of 5.5 per cent. The initial charge is 5.5 per cent and
the annual charge is 1.5.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Care for over-50s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIFE insurance has always addressed itself to two issues
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
dying too soon, and living too long.
Now, according to Howard Hodgson, chairman of Hodgson Integrity, which
launches a new range of products for the over-50s next month, the industry
needs to take a much more creative approach.
The great risk now is that people survive their 'third age' of retirement,
and live long enough to lapse into dependence again. Hodgson's ambitious
package of products for the over-50s is due to be launched next month.
This week Private Patients Plan, a medical insurer, launched arguably the
most ambitious long-term care (LTC) package to date.
LTC insurance involves paying regular premiums, usually starting in middle
age. Should you need long-term care at the end of your life, it pays fees.
PPP's 'Independence' plan, like those of Aetna Life and Commercial Union,
relies on the concept of the 'activity of daily living' (ADL). Payment is
made for care once the policyholder is unable to perform a certain number of
ADLs.
The small print is discomfiting. PPP lists six ADLs: Mobility (the ability
to get in and out of chair or bed), washing, dressing, feeding, toileting,
and continence.
Once you are unable to perform two of these, or once you fail a mental
awareness test, you become eligible to receive what PPP calls 'progressive'
cover. This provides assisting devices for use in the home.
Once you fail three ADLs, claim payments double, allowing you to pay for
residential nursing home fees.
PPP will take a 'hands on' approach, and pay fees direct to nursing homes.
It will also vet them closely, establishing a list of 'approved' care
providers. If the care is cheaper than your total eligibility, PPP pockets
the difference.
The new 'twist' which PPP has added, is to link long-term care insurance to
a critical illness or 'dread disease' policy, which pays out a fixed lump
sum if you are diagnosed as suffering from a life-threatening condition -
heart diseases, strokes, cancers and a few other serious conditions.
There is less need for critical illness cover once you have retired, but the
potential need for long-term care is greater. PPP thus offers the right to
convert from critical illness to LTC cover at the age of 60. The maximum
total LTC benefit you could then receive would be the critical illness sum
assured. The maximum weekly benefit would be the sum assured divided by 156.
You can also buy income replacement or 'permanent health insurance' in the
same package. This is potentially attractive. But is it cheap?
These policies are complex, and comparisons are awkward. Also, beware of
buying insurance you do not need.
But the PPP plan might be good value. For cover of Pounds 50,000, and the
right to convert at the age of 60, a 39-year-old woman needs to pay Pounds
35.25 per month, and a man Pounds 35.70.
Abbey Life, a pioneer of Critical Illness cover, charges Pounds 34.39 and
Pounds 43.87 respectively, for cover lasting until age 60. For a
'whole-of-life' plan, which would offer a lump sum on death or critical
illness, Abbey would charge Pounds 34.41 and Pounds 44.66 respectively. The
lump sum payment could help cover long-term care.
This suggests that PPP's premiums are not far out of line with the market.

NEWSAGENT and retailer John Menzies comes out with interims on Monday
expected to show pre-tax profits of about Pounds 3m. This is good or bad -
depending on how you look at it. Last year's Pounds 4.2m profit was
depressed by exceptionals of Pounds 4m due to losses at Hammicks. Forecasts
for the year ended April 30, bolstered by Christmas turnover, run between
Pounds 27.5m and Pounds 29.5m against Pounds 21.5m a year earlier.
A modest 15 per cent growth in pre-tax profits to around IPounds 30m is
being predicted for Fyffes' year-end results due on Tuesday. Analysts
believe that the Dublin-based fruit and vegetable wholesaling group has had
a reasonable year, despite the recession in the UK market. Although banana
sales may have been down, there has been buoyant growth in other fresh
produce sales.
The market continues to hold expectations of a link-up with a distributor in
continental Europe to expand the group's operations. The share price has
risen substantially in recent months.

LOLA Baker remembers November 22, 1991, very clearly. That was the day she
and a group of other employees of Robert Maxwell's AGB Group were told they
were being made redundant. In fact, it was the start of a chain of events
that, in the words of one Maxwell company pensioner, could leave Lola Baker
'on the precipice of poverty.'
After 31 1/2 years of loyal service, her severance terms entitled her to
nearly Pounds 20,000 as a lump sum payment and, of course, her pension. But,
by December, the company was in the hands of an administrator.
On December 10, Baker and about 25 others were called in to see the
administrator, Arthur Anderson, which had more bad news. It told the group
it had no legal obligation to make redundancy payments and would not be
doing so.
'I could quickly see what was happening but some of the other employees
couldn't take it in. One of them said, 'But Christmas is coming. What are we
to do?' The administrator told him, 'Well, if I were you, I'd go and sign on
(for the dole) first thing in the morning'.'
Baker is divorced and the mother of a handicapped adult son who depends
wholly on her. Immediately, she set about getting another job, believing
that her pension, at least, was intact. But the worst was to come.
Late last week the pension funds were wound up, with administrators saying
it was uncertain how much, if any, of the assets remained. Through all the
turmoil at AGB, this was the one eventuality that had never occurred to
Baker. 'I always thought a pension was sacrosanct. It's not like you're
investing and taking a risk - not like unit trusts or something. It's
supposed to be the one cast-iron guarantee.'
Perhaps her position is even worse than most. She has been told she is not
even eligible for a government pension because she had not paid enough
National Insurance contributions. She had relied on her husband to make
those on her behalf. When they divorced, he, not she, became the legal owner
of the government pension.
Ken Jarrett, who administered the AGB pension scheme before the Maxwell
family acquired the company, concedes that, at least for the foreseeable
future, his position is better than some. The administrators have said that
current pensioners will have priority over assets. Unlike Baker, who had not
yet retired officially, Jarrett took early retirement last November, aged
62, after 36 years of service.
'The day I got the news that the AGB fund might have been stripped was the
day after my retirement party. It was my wife and I and 20 or 30 of our
closest friends,' Jarrett recalls. 'My wife left Hanger Lane (the AGB
offices in west London) with a great big bouquet. The next thing I knew, I
had no pension. I'm extremely angry.'
Jarrett says he is, at least, still getting pension benefits, although it is
unclear if they will go on. He has some savings and his mortgage is paid
off. But after having contributed to a pension fund for 36 years, believing
his old age would be secure, Jarrett is bitter. While he had planned to
devote his retirement to voluntary work for local charities, he is spending
his time working with a group of other pension fund members trying to obtain
redress from someone.
If nothing else, the Maxwell collapse has highlighted the vulnerable legal
position of all pensioners. Unlike investors, savers or insurance
policy-holders, there is no such thing as a safety net to catch those whose
pension funds collapse. Moreover, the plight of the Maxwell pensioners shows
how little control fund members have over how their money is invested or
disbursed.
Tony Boram is head of a group of Mirror Group Newspaper (MGN) pension fund
members who retained a solicitor to help them learn more about where their
money went. As part of their effort to persuade the trustees to give more
information, Boram had to promise Maxwell's solicitors that he would not
make public comments about the funds.
Part of the reason the group did not pursue Maxwell further in the courts
was, quite simply, 'that we knew he would pursue the case to the High Court
and it would be tied up for six years. And all those legal costs could be
charged to the pension fund.' The sad truth is that fund members who wish to
challenge trustees on anything must pay for their efforts themselves, while
the full resources of the scheme are available for the defence of the
trustees.
Some recent legislation has helped pensioners. In particular, disclosure
rules now require pension funds to give members an annual financial report.
And those reports bear careful reading.
Malcolm Albutt, a market research executive at an AGB-run company, decided
to ask for the AGB scheme's annual report after hearing about problems at
the MGN pension fund. After viewing the investments, he and a group of
colleagues immediately requested a block transfer out of the AGB scheme into
a private one.
Unfortunately, the scheme collapsed before the transfer could be made and
their pensions - or what remains of them - are frozen inside.
Albutt said it did not take much for him to realise something was wrong. The
annual report for the period ended April 5, 1990, showed that not one of the
fund's 20 largest investments were in FTSE-100 companies. Most were
connected in some way to Maxwell's private interests. In fact, those 20
largest investments, many in foreign companies, accounted for 65.6 per cent
of total investments - a concentration that defies general principles of
diversification.
The Maxwell private company pension scheme members say the best for which
they can hope is that the government will concede that its self-regulatory
bodies failed to oversee the funds' investment managers properly. Otherwise,
some are facing the loss of more than 30 years of savings.

THREE months ago Chillington Corporation appeared in this column because
four directors had bought significant amounts of stock. This week they
feature because the chairman, Konrad Legg, has sold 200,000 shares at 33p.
At the same time he bought 200,000 warrants at just over 4p.
Dr Jim Maxmin, chief executive of Laura Ashley, has made a further purchase
of ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) lifting his holding by more than
30,000 shares. Fresh senior appointments have strengthened the board.
Two weeks ago Southern Business Group, the photocopier supplier based in
south east England, reported better than expected final results, together
with a 15 per cent increase in the dividend. A week after the announcement,
Roger Limpenny, the finance director, bought 17,500 shares at 86p taking his
total holding to 50,500 shares.
After merger discussions between Stanhope Properties and Rosehaugh were
abandoned, seven directors of Stanhope bought a total of 350,000 shares at
24p.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: My cheque is in the post . . . - . . .
But is it safe? Ways to beat the fraudsters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLANDIA DEVENUE is not a French actress nor an exotic Scandinavian. The
name is just one of many aliases used by fraudsters who salt away cheques
made out to the Inland Revenue.
One of the commonest ways in which money is lost is when cheques are
intercepted in the post and paid into a third party account. The Revenue
estimates that cheques worth Pounds 8m have been intercepted on their way to
the Revenue since 1989, although many were not cashed subsequently.
Credit card fraud is also increasing. In 1990, the UK banks lost about
Pounds 122m between them on plastic card fraud. This year it will probably
be at least Pounds 180m.
Fraud is so commonplace that consumers must despair of finding a safe way of
transferring money. The Weekend FT examines the pros and cons of different
methods of payment and discusses the measures you can take to protect
yourself against fraud.
Cheque in the post:
Posting a cheque may be convenient but it is one of the riskiest ways of
transferring money. Thieves can intercept the cheque, tamper with the
payee's name, open an account in that name and pay the cheque into that
account with a signature on the back.
Finlandia Devenue would have found it possible to open an account simply by
showing headed notepaper as proof of identity; now it should not be so easy.
Banks and building societies have tightened their procedures for opening
accounts since September 1990, after publication of Bank of England
guidelines.
However, the procedure for endorsing cheques is still a licence for
fraudsters. There is little to stop someone from intercepting a cheque,
endorsing it with their own version of the payee's signature on the back,
and then paying it into their own account. They do not even have to be good
forgers; if the payee is not a customer of that bank or society, no attempt
will be made to check the signature.
If you must send a cheque through the post, you can make it less easy for
fraudsters to tamper with it. The Banking Ombudsman recommends writing
'only' after the payee's name' (write the name in capitals), crossing out
the word 'or order', initialling the deletion and crossing the cheque with
the words 'not transferable.' The Revenue also suggests writing your
reference number immediately after 'Inland Revenue' on the payee line and
drawing a line up to 'Or Order'.
However, these measures are not foolproof. Many people suppose that by
writing a/c payee only on a crossed cheque, they can stop it being paid
anywhere except into the account it is intended to reach. Banking law is
blurred on this point: such cheques can still be transferred to another bank
account.
All this may change if a private member's bill going through parliament,
sponsored by Conal Gregory, MP for York, becomes law. It aims to pin
responsibility firmly on the bank which accepts the payment.
For the time being, however, remember that your bank is not responsible for
the loss and you may find yourself obliged to pay up again. Do not give up
without a fight. It is always worth talking to the bank and if they are
unhelpful and you feel the bank was negligent, try taking your case to the
Banking Ombudsman.
If you do post a cheque you can ask the post office for a certificate of
posting, which is a free receipt. However, the maximum compensation that the
post office will pay is Pounds 24 unless you use registered post. The Post
Office will compensate you for amounts up to Pounds 950 at a cost of Pounds
1.90 plus the cost of first class post through registered post. It will cost
Pounds 2.10 for amounts up to Pounds 1,850 and Pounds 2.30 plus first class
post for amounts up to Pounds 2,200.
Bank giro:
Payment from one bank account into another through the inter-bank giro
system is the safest method of transferring money, according to the British
Banker's Association. You fill in a credit slip which goes through the
clearing system where it can be traced if it goes astray. You are given a
stamped receipt as proof of the deposit. If you are sending money out of
your account, you will need to know the bank account number of the payee and
their branch sorting code. It will take up to four working days for the
money to reach its destination.
Girobank transfer:
This has nothing to do with the bank giro system. Girobank is a bank which
used to belong to the post office until it was acquired by the Alliance and
Leicester building society in 1990. You can transfer money, at a cost of
70p, if either you or the person you are sending it to, is an accountholder.
Postal orders:
Bought over the Post Office counter, postal orders can be easily traced and
the purchaser retains a counterfoil to prove they have been sent. These are
excellent for sending small amounts of money but become expensive if large
amounts are involved. The maximum postal order issue is worth Pounds 20 at a
cost of 80p. So, sending Pounds 100 will cost Pounds 4 but sending Pounds
1,000 would cost Pounds 40.
Credit cards:
Using plastic payment cards is one of your areas of greatest vulnerability.
All a fraudster has to do is to catch a cardholder off-guard and steal his
or her wallet. But this is not the only method.
When you make a transaction using a paper voucher rather than an electronic
terminal, the information contained on each voucher can be used to make
purchases by telephone: which is why in the US it is common for card holders
to insist that the carbon slips are destroyed on the spot.
You could also find that counterfeiters make a replica of your card and use
it in foreign countries, while your card remains in your possession. This is
now quite common in the Far East and the Mediterranean. Holders of gold
cards are most at risk.
If your card is stolen or if you notice money taken out of your account, you
must notify your bank immediately.
Under the Consumer Credit Act of 1974, credit card issuers are technically
liable for unauthorised purchases on a credit card - so long as you let the
bank or building society know your card is missing as soon as possible. Your
liability will be limited to Pounds 50.
Companies that are allowed to take your credit card details either over the
telephone or by post are thoroughly vetted by a Merchant Acquirer - one of
the big four banks which issue credit cards - and the banks will bear
responsibility if your card details have been abused and if they have no
reason to suspect you of trying to con them.
ATMs and debit cards:
Automated Teller Machines are more commonly known as hole-in-the-wall or
even cosh points, because of the danger of being mugged immediately after
using one. The most easily avoidable risk of using a cashpoint comes when
someone else gets hold of your Personal Identification Number (PIN).
A PIN can be used to unlock and remove all your cash. Thieves will look
straight for a PIN when they steal a card: so it is most unwise to write
down your number and positively foolish to carry it close to your cards.
Many cheque guarantee cards can be used as a debit card through Switch and
other systems. Money is debited from your account without your having to
write out a cheque. This added facility also brings added risk. Your cheque
guarantee card is usually sent to you through the post and if it is
intercepted a thief can sign it and use it to buy goods which will be paid
for from your account.
Unless you can prove negligence on the bank's part, you are at their mercy
regarding compensation if your card is stolen and used. If the bank is
satisfied that you did not make the purchases, it will usually compensate
you. This is set to change from March 16 , when the Consumer Credit Act will
be extended to all plastic cards under the Code of Banking Practice and you
will only be liable for the first Pounds 50 loss unless you have been
'grossly negligent.'
CHAPS:
Personal customers can also make same day payments through the Clearing
House Automated Payments System (CHAPS), which is one of the electronic
inter-bank payment systems normally used by businesses. Requests to use
CHAPS may surprise staff in small branches. The cost will vary but may be as
low as Pounds 15.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Capel wakes up its ideas - The Fund
Managers / Profile of a flourishing 'newcomer'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE USED to be a rumour in the City of London that the in-house unit trust
departments run by stockbrokers for their private clients were a good place
for an afternoon nap. Protected by client loyalty and the firm's reputation,
the managers were under less pressure to perform than their independent
rivals.
Times have changed, and in-house groups have also come under the competitive
spotlight. One group which realised this some years ago, and made an effort
to compete, was James Capel unit trust management, which appears to be
flourishing as a newly-independent management group.
James Capel, the stockbroker, set up its first unit trusts for private
clients in 1975. Early in 1988, though, the unit trust operation was still a
comparative minnow, with only Pounds 43m under management. An American index
and four additional trusts were launched in an effort to bring in new
clients. By 1989, assets under management had risen to Pounds 269m; the
present figure is around Pounds 450m. Capel also has established itself as
one of the leading fund managers of index-linked unit trusts.
Capel's parent, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, decided last
year to merge the fund management operations with the European and British
asset management division of one of its other subsidiaries, Wardley unit
trust management. An independent company, James Capel Asset Management, was
set up.
Perhaps the subsequent move to Docklands, in London's East End, away from
the rest of James Capel, was an invigorating change for the 15 fund
managers. However, one of Capel's best performers, Gold and General (along
with Julian Baring, its idiosyncratic manager), was lost to Mercury Asset
Management in December.
Performance has certainly improved over the past couple of years. Seven of
the ten funds with a three year record have an above average performance in
their sectors.
Capel's managers call their approach 'low value or low p/e investing.' The
idea is to buy shares on a low price/earning ratio - the number obtained by
dividing the share price by earnings per share. The lower the p/e, the
cheaper, in theory, the share. Capel will not buy any share with a p/e
higher than the market's, and it sells any stock if its p/e reaches that of
the market.
It is not a unique approach, and it works better in some markets than
others. Investment manager Richard Bisson says it usually is suited better
to under-developed stock markets in south-east Asia and much of Europe.
Indeed, the performance of the European Growth trust bears this out
(although being relatively under-invested in Germany helped, too). Capel
limits how much of the fund can be invested in each country; in Germany it
is 13 to 37 per cent, and in Norway 0 to 6 per cent. This means the fund
never takes huge bets on one country and is always well diversified. So, it
is unlikely to be at the very top or very bottom of its sector.
Low-value investing also has paid off for Japan Growth, Hong Kong and Far
Eastern Growth trusts. The more specialist Singapore and Malaysia fund,
inherited from Wardley, has been hit by the weakness of those two markets.
Bisson attributes the underperformance of the American growth fund to what
has happened since the 1987 crash. 'Investors are less willing to take risks
and are buying steady growers like Procter and Gamble,' he says. But he
believes the tide has begun to turn in favour of value stocks.
Capel's largest fund, Income, is the fourth best performing of all unit
trusts over 10 years, with a 600 per cent return and is also eighth in its
sector (out of 106) over three years.
In recent years, however, it has been the index funds which have helped
Capel to make a name for itself, with around Pounds 150m invested of its
total assets under management.
Last October, Capel launched its fifth index fund, called Trixie, to track
James Capel (the broker's) Trixie index. This consists of the 382 smallest
companies on the FTA All-Share index, excluding illiquid stocks and
investment trusts. The fund is, however, holding just 250 stocks.
As with its other index funds, Capel has partially recreated the index,
matching each sector in the fund as closely as possible to the index and
choosing a selection of stocks from big, medium and small companies. The
index funds are run from Edinburgh by a team of ten at James Capel
Quantative Research under an Iranian mathematician, Dr Namdar Mossaheb.
Why should investors want to buy index-linked funds? Well, few fund managers
out-perform the various indices consistently. Indexation makes it possible
to match the performance of those indices, offering investors the available
investment opportunities in a particular market with little risk.
Index-linked funds also cost less; annual management charges on the Trixie
index fund are 1 per cent a year and on the UK Index fund 0.5 per cent,
compared with 1.5 per cent on Capel's conventional funds.
Some say this is too high. Capel replies that there is a skill in designing
an index fund and that it is quite costly to adjust it often for changes in
cash flow, the underlying index, rights issues, takeovers and mergers.
So far, Capel's index funds have tracked their underlying indices well. This
raises the question of whether traditional 'active' fund managers are
strictly necessary.
Capel clearly is committed to both kinds of funds. This year promises to be
one of its better ones, with the low p/e approach vindicated in a number of
markets. It deserves to be taken seriously, even though some funds are still
relatively small.
No afternoon naps are going on here.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tax shelters on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WELTER of tax shelters hit the market this week. Full tax relief at the
top marginal rate is available on investments in Enterprise Zone properties,
and in Business Expansion Scheme companies.
If you have a large tax bill and wish to reduce it, these are the most
effective, and in many cases the safest, ways to do so. However, few of them
make much sense as investments in their own right - you should think of them
solely as tax-planning tools.
The BES is the more accessible. The maximum you can invest in BES companies
during any tax year is Pounds 40,000, and you have to maintain that
investment for five years to gain the tax benefits.
For many people, 'buy back' companies make most sense, because they limit
risk. A BES company buys accommodation on behalf of a third party  - usually
a college or a housing association - and receives in return a covenant to
buy back the property at a fixed price after five years.
Provided the third party does not go bankrupt in the meantime, and can raise
the money, risk is minimised. However, housing associations and colleges are
not big financial institutions, and sponsors are now attempting to arrange
financing for the 'buy-back' in advance.
The latest BES offers are:
BESSA UKC (II), sponsored by Close Brothers, will buy property for the
University of Kent at Canterbury. The buy-back price will be Pounds 1.35 for
every Pounds 1 spent now. BESSA LSE, to be launched next week, will buy
property for the London School of Economics.
Govett BES Assetbuilder 2 is one of the most ingenious schemes. Sponsored by
John Govett, it will buy accommodation for the Shaftesbury Housing
Association, which will buy the properties back in five years at a price of
Pounds 1.34 for every Pounds 1 spent now. A guarantee from NatWest
effectively ensures that Shaftesbury will meet its obligation. The deal
should only fail if Shaftesbury collapses completely.
Great Western Assured Growth, sponsored by Dartington, has a buy-back
agreement from Knightstone housing association at Pounds 1.40 for every
Pounds 1 spent now, for accommodation in Somerset. It is already trading as
a BES company, so tax relief should be claimable more quickly, effectively
raising the return. There is no additional banking guarantee.
The Enterprise Zone market is still confused. Supply is constricted because
several EZs have lost their status, the ten-year term for tax exemption
having finished.
Also, there are more sponsors seeking to launch syndicated 'trusts' - which
allow small investors to buy a share of a large building, rather than buy a
smaller building outright. With more sponsors looking to make deals over
smaller numbers of properties, final offers have been delayed.
Four EZTs are on the market at present:
Concept Britannia Teesside is the first EZ trust from Neill Clerk, a
Scottish solicitor which previously specialised in the BES. It will buy
eight office units in the Middlesbrough Enterprise Zone.
EZT2, from Collective Investments, has bought seven warehouses in the North
West Kent zone. Its trustees will be based offshore, in Guernsey.
Laser Richmount Telford, a trust seeking to invest Pounds 30m in two large
office buildings in Telford, this week announced that it had arranged a
fixed rate loan facility with the Bank of Scotland. This means that the
investment can be effectively self-financing for those investors who do not
need income. About Pounds 17m has been invested so far.
PET 17, managed by Property Enterprise Managers, will buy an office block in
Salford, in a deal worth Pounds 3.404m. There is a 25-year lease to the
developer, Quorum Estates, and a five-year bank guarantee from County
NatWest.
It is not safe to wander into the world of specialised tax loopholes without
professional guidance. Guides to EZ investment are available from the
Allenbridge Group (071-409-1111) and from John Harrison of Investment and
Tax Publishing Services (0234-218740). But if you do want to take action, do
so before the end of the tax year.

Wall Street
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US president is not used to being upstaged, least of all in the week
when he delivers his most important speech of the year.
Yet it happened to George Bush. Not on Tuesday, when he presented the State
of the Union address to Congress, but the following day when the stock
market had its first opportunity to respond to the budget for 1993 and the
President's election-year cocktail of defence and tax cuts.
And who upstaged Bush? None other than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, and ironically, the man with whom the President's chances
of re-election most probably lie.
On Wednesday morning, while the market was trying to digest the implications
of the State of the Union address, Greenspan blew Bush offstage with his own
State of the Economy speech to the Senate Banking Committee.
Greenspan told the Senate hearing he expected a rebound in economic activity
in the second quarter. He indicated that monetary policy was now
sufficiently accommodating to allow the economy to enjoy a solid, if
unspectacular, recovery, and warned that another big cut in interest rates
might revive inflation fears and possibly push long-term rates higher.
The effect on market sentiment was instantaneous. Within an hour the long
bond had fallen a full point, and within three hours the Dow Jones
Industrial Average had sunk almost 50 points, recording its biggest one-day
fall in more than two months.
The logic behind the decline in bonds was clear. A growing economy and
stable, possibly even tighter, monetary policy is bad news for bond
investors, who appear convinced that the country is pulling out of
recession. Even a bit of careful hedging by Greenspan - he told the
committee that the Fed was ready to cut rates again if economic conditions
warranted it - failed to stem the rush out of bonds.
Why stocks should fall was more of a mystery.
One reason was that the modest measures outlined in Bush's speech (an order
to employers to reduce the amount of tax they withhold from staff paychecks;
a boost to personal tax exemptions for parents; aid to first-time home
buyers; and cuts in the capital gains tax, all paid for with reductions in
defence spending) gave the markets no reason not to sell.
Before Bush's address, expectations among investors that the president would
unveil a range of aggressive short-term economic stimuli had been running
high. So high, in fact, that they drove the Dow to a record close of
3,272.14 on Tuesday.
After the speech, however, disappointment set in. The conditions were ripe
for a sell-off if something nasty and unexpected happened.
That something nasty and unexpected proved to be Greenspan's testimony. At
first glance it seems odd that the equity market nosedives when the man in
charge of monetary policy says further easing is not necessary because
economic recovery is around the corner. An improved economic outlook should
be good for share prices, right?
Not in this market. Stocks staged a stunning 30-day rally between
mid-December and mid-January because the big cut in interest rates at the
end of last year buoyed hopes that the economy would be back on a growth
track by mid-1992. As of this week, therefore, the recovery had been fully
discounted in prices, and thus there were no benefits left to be gained from
another forecast of a mid-year turnaround.
The other main plank supporting investor sentiment was lower interest rates.
Hopes for further easing in the early part of this year had sustained demand
at the latter stage of the rally. With Greenspan suddenly pouring cold water
on such hopes, investors were left with little incentive to keep the rally
going.
Oddly enough, amid all the State of the Union/Greenspan/budget palaver,
Corporate America was enjoying its best reporting week for more than a year.
A host of blue-chip companies - Disney, American Express, Procter &amp; Gamble,
Boeing, Merck, Coca-Cola, Merrill Lynch - posted strong fourth quarter
earnings.
Even news of fresh cuts in US defence spending carried a silver lining.
Uncle Sam is standing down some of his defences because the former Soviet
foe is rapidly disarming. Enter International Disarmament Corporation, a new
company formed by three big US defence contractors, Lockheed, Olin, and
Babcock &amp; Wilcox, which will specialise in dismantling Soviet nuclear
weapons systems. The profits, no doubt, will be used by US arms contractors
to make more weapons. A case not so much of turning swords into
ploughshares, but of turning swords into new swords.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Life salesmen? Bah, humbug] - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIFE industry has been manning the barricades ever since this newspaper
highlighted a SIB study which revealed appalling lapse rates on certain
policies. Just to repeat the figures, in case you missed them: the study
found that up to 45 per cent of policies sold by direct or tied agents are
terminated within two years. The equivalent figure for independent financial
advisers is a better, but still dreadful, 22 to 32 per cent.
Anyone who surrenders a policy within two years is likely to get back only a
fraction of the premiums paid because the life company has given the money,
in the form of commission, to the salesmen and weights all the charges to
the early years.
This SIB study has been attacked on two fronts. The first is, simply, that
the figures are wrong. That is, of course, a perfectly reasonable argument.
But SIB's information was culled from returns filed by the life companies
themselves to the Department of Trade and Industry. The reason SIB
commissioned the study was the complete absence of publicly available
statistics on the subject.
The second line of attack is that, even if the figures are right, they are
not due to bad selling practices. No, sir. They are due, instead, to the UK
recession.
Of course, a life insurance salesman could not have expected a recession
within the 25-year lifetime of his product. He could not have expected a
substantial number of his clients to become unemployed, or get divorced, or
meet some other change in their circumstances that made it impossible to
keep up their payments.
In other words, blame life itself, not life salesmen. Bah, humbug]
Whose fault is it that the most-promoted of all financial service products
is so inflexible and biased so heavily against those who cash-in early?
Whose fault is it that the product is so complicated, with three different
rates of bonus on some products and two types of unit on another? Only in
the life industry could a product described as 'unitised with profits' be
hailed for its simplicity.
A further point made to me is that the life companies are more concerned
about bad selling practices than anyone. Bah, double humbug] If you run an
industry where large numbers of salesmen are paid solely by commission, you
cannot claim to be surprised if those salesmen use hard-selling tactics.
In my personal experience, I have been told that my failure to sign for a
life policy immediately was due to 'a psychological inability to make
decisions.' I have been told not to discuss taking out an endowment with my
wife because 'women don't like long-term financial commitments.' And I have
been called at home by a man claiming to do 'market research on inflation'
who turned out, of course, to be selling insurance.
I sat through one presentation by a woman who knew I was a financial
journalist. Nevertheless, she worked through her obviously prepared script
which culminated in the ringing phrase: 'What you need is capital' -
whereupon she clinched the argument by writing the word 'capital' on a piece
of paper and drawing a circle round it.
When I told her I was not interested, she demanded that, in return for 'all
my efforts,' I should give her the names and addresses of all my friends so
she could contact them.
Admittedly, all this occurred before the Financial Services Act. But I
suspect the tactics simply have altered, rather than improved. My colleague,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu, toured the building societies last year looking for
a mortgage. Her circumstances obviously made a repayment or interest-only
mortgage most suitable, but a Woolwich 'adviser' persisted in pushing an
endowment which, she claimed 'is more of a reality.'
Nor has the FSA put a stop to the practice of those who are really salesmen
passing themselves off as 'advisers.' There are some independent advisers
who genuinely live up to their name - but there are others who are just the
un-tied salesmen of life companies.
How can a tied agent, who cannot recommend anything but the products of his
own company, call himself an adviser? As one lady, whose life has been
ruined by the activities of a salesman, said to me recently: 'I thought he
was an adviser who was on my side. If I had known he was a salesman, I would
have had nothing to do with him.'
There is absolutely nothing wrong with the concept of straight life
insurance. Indeed, more people should have it and there is a simple product,
called term insurance, which can provide it. But there is no need to mix-up
the concept of life insurance with savings, especially in a form which takes
such a long time to give the policy-holder full value. Recent trends have
exacerbated this tendency, with bonus cuts concentrated on policies of 10,
rather than 25, years and with terminal bonuses assuming an increased
proportion of policy value.
How many of us can, with hands on our hearts, feel certain we will keep up
payments on a policy for 25 years? How many of us really feel that such a
commitment is tailored ideally to our needs? And yet, the industry which is
devoted to selling these products is supposed to be providing 'best advice.'
Bah, humbug to the power of infinity]

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Enfranchise, and watch those shares
rise - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS looking for quick profits will have noted the news that Greenall,
the pub retailer and hotel operator, plans to enfranchise its ordinary
shares with limited voting rights.
In the past, enfranchisement rumours often have triggered substantial rises
in the shares of the companies concerned. Take Great Universal Stores, the
mail order, financial services and property company which is controlled
tightly by the Wolfson family. Rumours that the group would enfranchise its
non-voting shares followed the death last June 21 of Sir Isaac Wolfson, its
president. The non-voting shares rose 55p to Pounds 12.35 that day.
Two-tier share structures typically have been employed where family-run
businesses come to the market but the controlling family is unwilling to
relinquish control. To get around the problem, it keeps a group of shares
with voting rights, or with superior rights for itself, and floats only
shares with limited rights, or no voting rights at all. But investors have
criticised the practice and say it makes the floated shares unattractive.
Enfranchisement raises expectations that the shares will become more
attractive as liquidity is increased, and that the company as a whole will
have a much simpler share structure. At the same time, it also raises
immediately the possibility of an increase in the share price.
The lack of widespread investor interest in companies with a complicated
share structure that prevents takeover bids has meant that many with
two-tier share structures have traded below their net asset value. When the
share structure is simplified through enfranchisement, and liquidity is
increased, it is possible that the shares will at least rise to their net
asset value.
Great Western Resources, the US-based but UK-listed oil and gas company,
which enfranchised at the end of 1989, saw its share price nearly double,
according to SG Warburg which was involved in the recapitalisation. The
company had substantial asset value but the shares had been held down by a
complicated structure under which Dan Pena, the chairman, held 40 per cent
of the voting shares and the Kuwait Investment Company controlled more than
75 per cent of the fully-diluted shares.
It is often, however, the chances of a takeover bid that tends to underpin a
sharp rise in a company's share price when an enfranchisement is expected.
In Greenall's case, the news did not generate much excitement and the
ordinary shares rose a mere 1p to 398p on the day of the announcement. The
following day, they dropped 8p.
This was due partly to the fact that enfranchisement would have resulted in
a dilution of the shares. Holders of 'A' shares were to be given two
ordinary shares for each 'A' share to compensate them for the elimination of
their superior voting rights. Interest in Greenall also was dampened by
widespread speculation that the group's move to enfranchise was the prelude
to a rights issue. If so, the market decided, it was not going to be a
likely takeover target.
So what are the chances of making a handsome profit by investing in two-tier
companies which are likely to enfranchise in the near future? First, it is
difficult to anticipate an enfranchisement. GUS, for example, has been
surrounded by talk of this for years but, unless it suddenly develops
ambitions beyond its means, it is thought unlikely to move in that
direction.
Furthermore, the uncertainty of the rewards could mean that it is not worth
the trouble of speculating on a likely enfranchisement.
As Greenall's case indicates, the chance of enfranchisement actually leading
to an increase in the share price is not guaranteed. Much depends on whether
the process leads to dilution of the ordinary shares.
Whitbread, the brewer, is another company with a two-tier structure where
there has been talk of enfranchisement. But even if this happened, the
consensus is that while there might be an increase of a few pennies in the
limited voting 'A' shares, nothing spectacular would be likely.
'There would be a modest rise like Greenalls but the market would not go
mad,' says Eric Frankis at UBS Philips &amp; Drew.
Whitbread is trading below its asset value of 581p and closed at 464p
yesterday. Frankis points out that although enfranchisement might raise the
shares to their net asset value level, it is not unusual for brewery stocks
to be trading below that.
The market also would look at the likely underlying reason for
enfranchisement - that the company was looking to raise money on the market.
And that would be enough to counter any hopes of a takeover.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The ticking of the hidden clockwork -
London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE turn-of-the-century spy novels of John Buchan give the impression that
public events form a thin veneer over a whirling clockwork mechanism of
intrigue, in which nothing is what it seems, and every innocent milk-cart or
postman is no more than a cog in a world-wide conspiracy.
Eighty years on, the Company News Service of the London Stock Exchange
appears to have taken up where Buchan left off, full of unexpected
references to a clandestine world of spies and terrorists. Last year, it was
Robert Maxwell and his alleged links with Israeli intelligence. This week,
it was Wace, the pre-press printing services group, denying rumours about a
connection with the IRA - rumours that eventually led to the departure of
John Clegg, Wace's managing director.
The company's statement on Friday, reporting Clegg's departure, emphasised
that the rumours were entirely unfounded. None the less, the statement said,
the rumours' persistence had led Clegg to conclude that he would best serve
the company's interests by resigning.
Over the past five years, Wace's share price has risen from 69p to a peak of
418p in July 1989. The shares were trading at 177p a week ago, before the
Sunday Telegraph reported that an unnamed rapidly growing public company was
under investigation for laundering funds for the IRA. On Monday morning,
Wace's share price fell from 177p to 155p in relatively heavy trading. The
company put out a statement denying any connection with the IRA, and the
shares recovered to close at 166p. By Thursday night, the shares had
recovered to 168p. On Friday morning, Wace announced Clegg's departure, and
the shares lost 38 per cent, to close at 104p.
The John Buchan view of the world was at work elsewhere this week - for
example in the CBI's January industrial trends survey. Stolid Midlands
businessmen, filling in their CBI forms, have succumbed to the Californian
persistence with which the organisation urges on them the question 'yes, but
how do you really feel?'.
As the chart on the right shows, although their expectations of their own
forthcoming output have dipped only slightly, their assessment of how
everyone else feels (in answer to the question 'what is the trend of general
business optimism') has worsened much more sharply.
In the depths of the recession, business-people have clearly started to
judge the outlook less by their own everyday experience of sales-calls and
orders than by the workings of some hidden clockwork.
The stock market has been listening to a different set of muffled tickings
this month, wrong-footing those who thought December's sharp recovery would
pre-empt the usual January rise. The FT-SE index closed at 2,571.2
yesterday, up 60.8 on the week and 3 per cent on the month. At one point
yesterday, it touched 2,580.2. It is now back to the levels reached last
August, just before the - mistaken - belief in an immediate economic
recovery sent it to record levels in September.
Favourable opinion-poll results for the Conservatives took some of the
credit. So did the strength of the pound; though it is only just above its
ERM minimum against the Spanish peseta, it is a good ten pfennigs clear of
its D-Mark floor, which is arguably the rate that matters. Early in the
week, there was talk that a cut in UK base rates from their current level of
10.5 per cent might be on the way. Friday, the usual day for interest rate
changes, came and went without any such move, however.
Tiny Rowland - who might, come to think of it, have steped out of
Greenmantle or Prester John - was again in the news, as shareholders in
Lonrho recovered from last week's dividend cut. An FT report that Lonrho is
to lose control of UK import and distribution of Volkswagens and Audis from
the end of 1993 had only a short-term impact on the shares; they closed at
123p, up 2p on the week, down 21 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Two other swashbuckling figures, Lord Hanson and Lord White, revealed some
of the inner workings of their empire, by announcing that they do not plan
to bid for ICI. Nine months ago, before Hanson bought a 2.8 per cent stake
in the chemical company, ICI was trading at 1100p. Its shares closed on
Friday at 1275p, up 30p on the week, and 16 per cent higher than before the
Hanson stake-building exercise, during which period they have outperformed
the market by 13 per cent.
As one intriguing mystery ended, another began: the market became convinced
that someone was building a stake in Fisons, the pharmaceutical company that
has run into problems with America's drug regulators and recently lost its
chief executive. The shares closed at 394p, up 59 1/2 p on the week and 21
per cent higher on the month.
In one respect, the week was a triumph for the prosaic, non-Buchan view of
the world. For years, economic conspiracy theorists have wondered why, if
big British companies routinely show up as among the world's most
consistently profitable, the earnings of the corporate sector as a whole
should do so badly on international rankings of return on capital. Surely
this must reflect some hidden weakness in corporate Britain? Not so, said
the CBI this week. Those international rankings have got it all wrong: if
you compare like with like, British profitability is perfectly adequate.
In one respect, though, the hidden universe of paranoia overlaps with the
mundane world of industrial reality: as the chart on the left shows, there
was a steady gap between British and German profits for all but the most
ebullient year of the 1980s; and UK profitability has now turned sharply
down. Meanwhile, off the coast, a submarine silently waits . . .

<TEXT>
Scottish Life has reduced the administration charges on its Talisman
personal pension scheme, with a resulting enhancement in benefits. At the
same time, it is introducing a so-called Retirement Investment Strategy
which is designed to be more suitable for pensioners' needs. Contributions
in the early years will be fully invested in UK equities in order to get
maximum growth. As the individual gets within 15 years of retirement, money
will be switched into a managed fund. In the last five years before
retirement, the fund will be switched into fixed interest and deposits for
maximum safety.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a Glance): Honesty pays for TSB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The TSB has set a shining example to the rest of the savings industry by
telling its customers in full when a new account is superseded by an old
one. It has launched a 60 Day Notice Account which will pay 10 per cent
gross on balances of Pounds 5,000 and upward. There must be an initial
deposit of at least Pounds 500. Interest can be paid yearly or monthly
according to choice, and account holders will be offered either a passbook
or cash machine card and statement service.
The 60 Day Notice Account replaces TSB's Special Notice account and all
customers are being automatically upgraded. Letters informing them of the
change went out this week, a move which contrasts with claims by some
building societies that it is not practical to notify all customers
individually about account changes. TSB says the new account is a better
deal for savers, with a reduced notice period and a minimum opening deposit
of Pounds 500 instead of Pounds 2,000.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a Glance): Standard Life bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life has announced bonuses on its with-profits policies which
should keep it at the top of the performance tables. However, it signalled
that bonuses might have to come down next year by reducing the 'interim'
bonus which would be payable if people needed to claim life cover from the
policies during the next year. Assuming that the policies were started by a
29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 monthly premiums, a 25-year endowment would
pay Pounds 66,087 (up slightly from Pounds 65,858) on maturity, while a
10-year endowment would pay Pounds 7,672 (down from Pounds 8,336). The
reversionary bonus rate on pension with-profits policies has been maintained
at 5.75 per cent.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a Glance): A rise in repossessions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Home repossession orders issued by county courts in England and Wales
increased by 35 per cent to 73,792 last year from 54,718 in 1990, according
to the Council of Mortgage Lenders using figures issued by the Lord
Chancellor's office this week. The figures do not include 'voluntary'
repossessions as these do not need a court order. The Building Societies
Association says it expects its figures, which cover the whole of the UK, to
total 80,000 actual repossessions for 1991. However, there were signs of
improvement in the last quarter of 1991 when orders made fell to 18,171
after a steady rise through the year to a peak of 20,218 in the third
quarter.
