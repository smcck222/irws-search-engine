FT  01 FEB 92 / The Long View: Thirty-something blues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MOST powerful man in the world this week found that his debt problems
had caught up with him. So what hope is there for the rest of us?
George Bush's State of the Union address and budget statement left the
President doing a passable imitation of our own Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Norman Lamont, hoping that the recovery will come along soon  - by the
spring, with any luck. With the federal deficit projected to swell to
Dollars 400bn (Pounds 220.9bn) his scope for boosting the economy through
tax cuts has been unimpressive, despite a certain amount of advance
publicity which had promised something more exciting.
Lamont himself has had marginally more room for manoeuvre. The UK
government's strong financial position after the budget surpluses of the
late 1980s has allowed public spending to be raised significantly, if
surreptitiously. And last Wednesday's unofficial Green Budget from the
Institute of Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs suggested that the Chancellor
might be able to give Pounds 2bn away through tax cuts in his pre-election
Budget, although this could with equal accuracy be presented as borrowing
Pounds 2bn more. But Lamont will surely have to drop his pretence of aiming
to balance the budget over the whole economic cycle, just as the Americans
have had to admit that there is no foreseeable prospect of balancing the
books in the US either.
The mountain of private sector debt created in the 1980s is now casting a
lengthening shadow. Gloomy pundits are drawing the parallel with the
excesses of the 1920s, which culminated in stock market crashes and a wave
of frauds, and created an overhang of unrepayable debt which led directly to
the slump of the 1930s.
It will not be quite the same this time around, because the monetary
authorities are determined to prevent the collapse of the banking system and
the severe contraction of the money supply that led to the falling prices
and shrinking production of the '30s. This time the Americans, for example,
have bailed out busted financial institutions and the Federal Reserve has
slashed short-term dollar interest rates down to around 4 per cent. But the
conjurors have to come up with their next trick; having rescued the private
sector from the immediate consequences of its misjudgments, they must make
the finance materialise. It is now the public sector debt mountain that we
must fear.
Depressions, according to the debt deflation theory, happen because the
burden of servicing debt becomes crippling. Consumer demand falls back
because people are no longer willing to go on increasing their borrowings,
and may want to reduce them. And developments in the asset markets,
especially property, may be more critical: as values tumble the borrowers,
and then in turn the banks, may become insolvent.
Not every country in the world has followed this well-trodden path to
potential ruin, but the US and the UK have, and so has Japan, where the
inflation of asset prices became notorious during the 1980s. Fortunately,
the Japanese government is still quite comfortably placed financially, but
it has to cope with by far the biggest private sector bubble. Significantly,
the Tokyo market is struggling in 1992, although it brushed aside the 1987
crash which laid Wall Street so low; in contrast, Wall Street is now booming
again, although without very distinct means of support.
So far the various efforts around the world to prop up the banking system
have had reasonable success. True, the monetarists are worried that growth
of the real money supply is still too sluggish to be compatible with
significant economic recovery. Whereas real broad money expanded typically
at the rate of about 5 or 6 per cent a year in the Group of Seven leading
world economies in the prosperous years of the mid-1980s, the rate had
slipped to about zero by 1991. However, this is not remotely as bad as the
minus 10 per cent or so which would go with a full-scale global slump: the
real US money supply fell by something like 40 per cent in the 1930s, as
thousands of banks locked out their depositors.
But how long can governments keep pumping capital into insolvent banks, and
generally maintaining excess spending programmes in order to prevent
economic contraction? If they finance all this through the bond markets they
will drive up long-term interest rates and crowd out the private sector,
including the banks, which will find it hard to attract deposits at the low
interest rates which cautious slump-time borrowers might be willing to pay.
Alternatively, the governments could finance themselves through the banking
system, though it could take an indeterminate period before monetary
expansion became effective in boosting the real economy. You could not
confidently predict the trade-off between real expansion and inflation.
In the end the world economy emerged from the slump of the 1930s because of
the war, which not only directly boosted output but led to the massive
destruction of accumulated capital in Europe and Japan. For a generation
afterwards that left the largely undamaged US as the global powerhouse where
returns on capital were high and economic growth seemed the most natural
thing in the world. Only by the 1970s and, especially, the 1980s did the US
and other major economies need to resort to injections of the drug of debt
in order to maintain the fading momentum.
Now the US is under great pressure from more competitive economies in Asia
and Europe. Some of its core industries are struggling and the level of
profits has tumbled: Wall Street is assuming that this is only a temporary
problem, but such optimism might prove misplaced if we are dealing not with
an ordinary economic cycle but a supercycle.
Only from a lofty historical point of view can we be reasonably sure of the
scale of the problem: a daily newspaper is much too close to the action. In
New York last weekend the G7 finance ministers claimed blandly that economic
prospects were improving.
But when the President of the United States can only make quite feeble
proposals in an election year to dig his economy out of a trough you have to
worry that history has taken effective command.

FT  01 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German strike ballot result
unsettles late-closers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS in the afternoon that German steelworkers had voted overwhelmingly in
favour of a strike brought late-closing bourses off their highs, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT overcame a bout of midsession profit-taking to continue its upward
trend. The DAX index rose 6.58 to 1,687.49, up 1.4 per cent on the week,
while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 3.83 to 683.17, a rise
of 0.8 per cent on the week. Volume was estimated at below Thursday's
DM6.6bn.
The luxury car manufacturer BMW jumped DM12.50 to DM536 on the back of the
previous day's news that group sales rose 9.8 per cent in 1991 and should
rise this year.
Steels were firmer ahead of the strike ballot results. Thyssen rose DM1.50
to DM220, Hoesch firmed DM1 to DM258 and Mannesmann added DM1.80 to
DM268.80. Degussa added DM2.50 to DM335 before announcing a
bigger-than-expected cut in the dividend to DM7 from DM11.
Commerzbank, which has lagged behind the banking sector recently, stood out
with a DM5.10 rise to DM263.60.
PARIS saw its heaviest volume in about six months as stock index futures and
options expired. The CAC-40 index came off the day's high of 1,895.79 to
close 1.31 better at 1,875.25 in volume of FFr4.9bn.
The banking sector stole the limelight. Paribas, which announced a 1991 loss
after the close on Thursday, rose FFr16 or 4.6 per cent with a hefty 783,500
shares traded. Analysts said the stock was pushed up by professional
short-covering and also by news that Paribas was holding the dividend in
spite of the loss.
CCF was also active following an upbeat presentation to fund managers in
London yesterday. The stock rose FFr5.90 to FFr189.90 on 594,340 shares
traded.
MILAN closed slightly higher after a volatile session. The Comit index rose
3.56 to 541.37, down 1.4 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at
slightly below Thursday's L97bn.
The approval by the lower house after hours on Thursday of legislation
designed to protect minority shareholders during takeovers lifted shares in
state-controlled companies which are earmarked for privatisation. The cement
group Cementir, rose L125 or 4.6 per cent to L2,860.
Eridania gained L205 to L7,210 ahead of details of the share exchange
operation with Beghin Say, its French subsidiary.
AMSTERDAM was mixed with most interest on Elsevier which finished up Fl 3.40
to a all-time high of Fl 108.00. The CBS Tendency Index moved up 0.7 to
121.7, barely changed on the week.
The strength of Elsevier spilled over into Wolters Kluwer, which gained Fl
0.60 to Fl 66.40 and VNU Fl 0.20 to Fl 83.20. Akzo, the chemical group, shed
Fl 1.30 to Fl 134.00 on news that it was holding its dividend and taking a
net charge of Fl 110m due to reorganisation. KLM rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 40.30
ahead of third-quarter results out next Thursday.
ZURICH ended quietly with banks recovering some of their losses after Credit
Suisse was downgraded by Moody's earlier in the week and Swiss Bank was
placed on the US credit rating agency's watchlist. Swiss Bank bearers put on
SFr3 to SFr300 and CS holding, parent company of Credit Suisse, gained SFr5
to SFr1,905. The all-share SPI index rose 4.6 to 1,111.4, steady on the
week. Bearer shares in Georg Fischer, the engineering group, fell SFr15 to
SFr990 after it told shareholders it expected a decline in last year's
profit.
STOCKHOLM finished slightly up with the slide in Volvo stock coming to an
end. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 2.6 to 970.1, but was down 1.5 per
cent on the week. Volvo B firmed SKr3 to SKr381, with Procordia B unchanged
at SKr198. Electrolux B were off another SKr3 to SKr236 on concerns about
Tuesday's preliminary results. Turnover improved to SKr414m (SKr380m).
MADRID moved ahead with Endesa, the electricity producer, reaching an
all-time high of Pta3,330, up Pta90 in volume of 264,000 shares. The general
index gained 1.23 to 255.03, improving 1.5 per cent on the week.
Telefonica's slide continued, down Pta15 to Pta1,145, on net profit figures
below market expectations.
ISTANBUL fell for the fourth consecutive day on lack of new investment. The
75-share index was down 13.68 at 4,926.196, off some 2 per cent on the week.
VIENNA closed at their highest level since last November in lively trading.
The Credit Aktien index rose 4.02 to 420.46, up 3.9 per cent on the week.

FT  01 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt takes industrial skirmish in
its stride - But a prolonged and acrimonious strike by steelworkers could
harm share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ammunition is ready and the powder is dry. German trade unions have
abandoned their traditional harmony of outlook with employers and made
aggressive, mostly double-figure, wage claims. The Bundesbank has taken
fright at the implications for inflation, now around 4 per cent - a heady
rate for stability-conscious Germans - and jacked up interest rates to
unprecedented post-war levels.
So far, the German stock market has taken all this pre-battle skirmishing in
its stride. In January, the DAX index of 30 leading shares showed a gain of
7 per cent to 1,687.49 as investors looked past the present economic
uncertainty to the expectations of improved export performance, more robust
growth in Germany (including the new east German states) and abroad. The
prospect of higher consumer spending after the tax surcharge comes off in
mid-year has also helped. Analysts generally expect the index to move up to
between 1,800 and 2,000 this year.
Yesterday the ballot called by the powerful IG Metall trade union came down
conclusively in favour of a steel strike. The fact of a majority vote for a
stoppage by the industry's 130,000 workers was never in doubt. When the
chips are down, steelworkers support their union leaders. What counts now is
how quickly and in what form strike action is called, how long it lasts,
what effect this has on other sectors, and what the settlement is.
In a way, the threat of a strike is seen as good news in the investment
community, paradoxical and cynical though this may appear. Last year,
employers awarded pay deals of up to 7 per cent. Many companies were willing
to pay this at a time when the economy was still booming, especially with
the stimulus from east German demand, and they were working at full stretch.
This is certainly not the case today, however. Consumer demand from the east
is dropping off - the domestic car market, for instance, is expected to fall
by 12 per cent or more this year - and export-oriented companies in
particular have been feeling the pinch. A number of companies, especially in
motor components, machine tools, and engineering, have cut employment,
shifted more production overseas, and slashed their dividends.
So industry's mood is much more defiant than last year. This being so, the
increased likelihood of moderate wage settlements is expected by investors
to improve industry's longer-term competitiveness, bring down inflation, and
thus induce the Bundesbank to reduce rates.
Before all this happens, though, a lot of water has to flow under the
bridge. Even though the unions are not in the strongest of positions, with
the German economy having slowed down sharply in recent months, it may not
be easy to find a face-saving formula. In the steel industry, the union
initially claimed 10.5 per cent and has since made clear that it wants at
least 6 per cent. The employers want to keep it below that figure.
A banking strike is also on the cards, with a 10.5 per cent pay demand
tabled. The banks, which have been reporting sharp profit increases for last
year, have offered no more than 4.5 per cent. The negotiations that really
matter for the economy, however, are those in the engineering industry.
Here, IG Metall has taken a small step in the direction of moderation by
recommending that regional claims do not exceed 9.5 per cent.
It will be the conduct of the steel strike that sets the tone for the 1992
wage round. 'A strike that lasted less than a week would be seen as no
problem at all for the market", says Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank. 'If it
went on for much longer and the atmosphere turned nasty, that might be
something the stock market had not accounted for'.
What many investors are really looking to is the prospects for late 1992 and
1993, when company earnings should pick up considerably. At the moment, many
companies in the mainstream of German industry are under severe strain.
Kolbenschmidt, for instance, the quoted car components subsidiary of
Metallgesellschaft, the mining, metals, and engineering group, suffered a
profits slump last year. It is halving its dividend, and has shed nearly 600
jobs in Germany and abroad.
MAN Roland, the printing equipment subsidiary of the MAN industrial group,
is laying off 750 people because of its order slowdown. Kugelfischer, the
bearing and industrial systems company, slid into the red last year and has
slimmed its workforce by as much as 6,000. Metallgesellschaft, which has
moved aggressively into environmental activities, had its growth trend
rudely interrupted last year by a combination of economic slowdown, lower
commodity prices, and adverse currency movements. Degussa, which is mainly
in metals and chemicals, yesterday announced a dividend cut.
For companies like these, reckons Ms Katrin Kandel of Sal. Oppenheim, the
German private bank, a strike at this low stage of their business cycle
could be beneficial if it helps produce a moderate cost base for the later
upswing. 'Since they are looking a few years ahead, they could put up with a
strike now'.
Thus she reckons that stocks with a strong cyclical tendency like
Kugelfischer, Metallgesellschaft, and the Thyssen steel and engineering
group could be among the best performers when the stock market really picks
up steam. 'The second half of this year could be when investors start
discounting better earnings'. These would be fuelled by the expected cut in
interest rates when the Bundesbank is happy that inflation is moving down
and not up. At present, though, the central bank is not happy at all.

FT  01 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of government
support lift Nikkei
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES jumped on reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) had announced measures to support the stock market, and the Nikkei
average recouped the 22,000 level for the first time since January 10,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed up 465.38 to 22,023.05, gaining 4.5 per cent on
the week. The index opened at the day's low of 21,620.40 and hit the day's
high of 22,343.22 in the afternoon session.
Volume rose to 330m shares from 250m, exceeding 300m for the first time
since December 13. Trading was dominated by dealers and arbitrage activity.
Advances overwhelmed declines by 942 to 83 with 102 issues remaining
unchanged. Of 36 sectors on the first section, 35 gained. The Topix index of
all first section stocks rose 32.59 to 1,630.94 and in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.61 to 1,252.80.
The index firmed at the opening on arbitrage buying, but then surged on news
that Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, secretary general of the LDP, had expressed
concern over the adverse effects the faltering stock market was having on
the economy. He proposed that the party should prepare its own measures to
revitalise the market, including urging companies to increase dividend
payments and reducing tax on securities trading.
Some traders said that the proposals did not offer immediate support. 'The
market needed an excuse to buy,' said Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd.
Brokerage houses gained on hopes of a market recovery and higher volumes.
Nomura advanced Y40 to Y1,560 and Yamaichi Securities gained Y31 to Y738.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone closed at Y18,000 to Y701,000. Large-capital
issues rose, with Nippon Steel up Y10 to Y362 and Kawasaki Steel adding Y8
to Y360. High-technology issues rose in active trading. Hitachi up Y10 to
Y932 and Toshiba Y11 to Y660.
Showa High Polymer fell Y30 to Y1,070. The issue rose by its daily limit of
Y104 on Thursday on hopes that its bio-degradable plastics, which go on sale
next year, would be favoured by consumers.
In Osaka, the OSE average surged 556.26 to 23,638.47 in volume of 53m
shares. High-priced issues with good earnings prospects advanced, but some
issues fell on profit-taking towards the close. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y70
to Y5,410.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Rim rose on local news but was also helped by strength in New
York and Tokyo. Taiwan was closed.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index added 30.31 to 4,601.78 but was steady on the
week. Volume was HKDollars 1.80bn (HKDollars 1.75).
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank gained 0.50 cents to HKDollars 37.50 on the back
of Thursday's strong Bank of East Asia results.
KUALA LUMPUR was encouraged by good November trade figures. The composite
index gained 1.89 to 570.64, up 0.36 per cent on the week. Motor stocks
recovered from Thursday's fall triggered by news of a rise in tax: UMV put
on 18 cents to MDollars 4.20.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index rose 7.0 to 1,619.5, steady on the week.
Turnover was boosted by options expiries to ADollars 348m from ADollars
265m.
Westpac Banking jumped 16 to ADollars 4.18 after the Australian Mutual
Provident Society said it would buy more shares.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index lost 1.34 to 1,455.05, down 1.8 per cent on the
week. Lion Nathan fell as low as NZDollars 3.42 on rights issue fears but
recovered to close 5 cents down at NZDollars 3.55.
SEOUL's composite index rose 16.38 or 2.5 per cent to 680.51, up 3.4 per
cent on the week, on economic optimism. SINGAPORE reversed three days of
losses, the Straits Times Industrial Index up 3.65 to 1,526.84, but down 1.2
per cent on the week.
JAKARTA saw interest in banks, following news that foreigners will be
allowed to invest in this sector. The index rose 6.51 to 282.24 in volume of
17.6m shares.
BANGKOK was cautious ahead of next week's Bangkok Land listing. The SET
index fell 1.25 to 763.45, down 2.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of
Bt6.7bn.

FT  01 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Asda rises on MFI hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOOD retailer Asda rose 3 1/2 to 39p
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one of the biggest percentage rises in the market yesterday - following
reports that furniture group MFI will seek a stock market quotation. Asda
retained a 25 per cent stake when MFI was sold off to its management in
1987. Trading volume in Asda shares jumped to 30m, making it the most active
stock of the day.
Written down in Asda's books to zero the MFI holding now clearly now has
significant value, which market estimates put at Pounds 30m to Pounds 60m.
Analysts pointed out that MFI makes no money at the pre-tax level, because
of high interest payments, but will benefit from the injection of cash when
the shares are floated.
Thorn-EMI ahead
The decision by Thorn-EMI to withdraw from electrical retailing was welcomed
in the market. The group gained 15 to 841p in exceptional volume of 2.4m.
The rationalisation of Thorn's loss-making Rumbelows division, involving the
loss of 800 jobs, will reportedly cost the company around Pounds 46m. Ms
Jane Anscombe at BZW described the share price rise as one of 'relief'. She
added: 'This is only slightly good news for Thorn. They still have a lot of
work to do. We remain a hold.'
Hotels firmer
Reports that hotel group Forte has been contacting City analysts, arguing
that the sector has bottomed out, helped some stock yesterday. The market
has been waiting for signs of recovery, but most of the news this week had
continued to undermine the sector. Kleinwort Benson reported dismal
occupancy figures, particularly in London, and brewery group Vaux yesterday
said that its hotel business remains depressed.
However, some of the more positive sentiment rubbed off yesterday with the
sector showing some resilience after a dull week. Forte gained 2 to 227 1/2
p in busy volume of 2.6m, while Ladbroke added 4 1/2 to 214p. Granada Group
rose 5 to 224p on continued optimism over BSkyB. Vaux rose 7 to 216p on
well-received results.
Dealing in Rolls-Royce stock shares first advanced 4 on suggestions that
replacement part sales were recovering.
However, news that Trans World Airlines had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
in the US sent the shares into retreat. TWA had placed an engine order for
20 Airbus A330 aircraft that were to be powered by Rolls engines and were
due for delivery in 1994. The shares retreated to end a penny lower at 144
1/2 p as turnover soared to 11m.
Mr Nick Cunningham at Strauss Turnbull said: 'This underlies the insecure
nature of the civil aerospace order book.'
The honeymoon continued for Rank Organisation after its well-received
results. The shares added 31 to 671p following a 45p gain on Thursday.
Volume was a busy 2.4m.
Reflection on the results failed to draw a consensus on the leisure group's
prospects. BZW, a bull on the stock, believe Rank still holds 'good value'
at its present price and the gains made will be sustained. A more cautious
Hoare Govett has worries on Rank's holiday business, but remains supportive
in the short-term.
Holiday group Eurocamp slipped a further 4 to 311p as profit-taking
continued.
Brent Walker won official approval for the lease of 734 public houses from
Allied Lyons. However, it emerged later that the move would not allow Allied
to discount the pubs from the total it must sell under government
regulations. One analyst said the development could put the deal in
jeopardy. Brent added 2 to 14p, while Allied gained 6 to 649p.
Business services group Hays was heavily traded after Warburg Securities
bought 15.8m shares at 178p. They were placed with between 12 and 15
investors, who already had stakes in Hays, at 180p in a bought deal. Dealers
said there was speculation that a large stakeholder had sold its holding.
The placing represents 4.1 per cent of the company and the shareholders
capable of selling a stake of that size are the Kuwait Investment Office and
the British Coal Pension Fund. The shares firmed a penny to 188p.
Publisher Reed International came under pressure after Kleinwort Benson cut
its profit forecasts for the company. The shares lost 11 to 523p with 3.6m
traded. The house cut its figure for the year to end March 1992 by Pounds 5m
to Pounds 215m and for 1992/93 by Pounds 20m to Pounds 250m.
Reuters continued firm on optimism over the trials on its new dealing
systems and overnight firmness in New York. The shares were 40 up at one
stage and closed 28 better at 1128p.
Bear raiding returned to BTR which lost 10 to 417p. The persistent story
that chief executive Mr Alan Jackson may have to resign through ill health
resurfaced.
Guinness rose 14 to 570 having earlier hit a record 579p, after securities
house Nomura reinforced its buy recommendation.
A line of 5.5m BAT shares dealt at 645p and said to be part of a tax-related
'bed-and-breakfast' deal boosted turnover. The stock also saw active two-way
business following a press article which was positive on the prospects for
tobacco companies. BATs rose 4 to 662p with a massive 14m traded.
Wellcome was affected by a bear squeeze and the shares rose 21 to 1149p on
thin volume.
Prudential lost 3 to 131p on worries about the effect of proposed tax
changes on its US subsidiary Jackson National.
Oils were weak as caution persisted ahead of the forthcoming Opec production
meeting and the UN-Iraq meeting shortly. There was also said to be stock
overhanging the market. Shell lost 3 1/2 to 476 1/2 p.
Pre-press printing specialist Wace Group dived 64 to 104p as concern
resurfaced about possible links with the IRA after the resignation of the
managing director.
British Aerospace added 7 to 285p on turnover of 4.9m after the company
announced the sale of an aircraft components-making unit for Pounds 47m.
TI Group fell 11 to 597p after broker Williams De Broe criticised the
company's accounting methods.
From today's issue, the FT's London Share Service will carry Investment
Trust share prices in two separate categories. Those companies designated as
investment trusts by the UK Inland Revenue under rule 842 of the Income and
Corporation Tax Act 1988 - all those shown under the Investment Trusts
heading in the past - will be printed under the heading Investment Trusts -
Authorised.
A second category, Investment Trusts - unauthorised, will contain 56
companies until now listed under the Other Financials heading. Initially,
daily net asset values estimated by County NatWest WoodMac will be shown for
seven of these companies. In time, it is hoped to provide net asset values
for all this category.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium slide dents
recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES THAT the recent strength of the aluminium and nickel markets might
augur a world economic recovery were dented this week when prices of both
metals fell sharply.
Aluminium buyers, especially in the Far East, were still in full cry during
the early part of the week and on Tuesday the London Metal Exchange cash
price closed at a 5 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,274 a tonne. But the
failure of the three months position, which closed that day at Dollars
1,298.50 a tonne, to push on through the psychologically important Dollars
1,300 barrier signalled a change of sentiment and Far Eastern traders began
to take their profits.
As the cash price retreated to Dollars 1,221.50 a tonne at yesterday's
close, down Dollars 28 on the week, dealers explained that the earlier
sustained rise had created an 'overbought' market and a technical correction
was overdue.
The rise in LME warehouse stocks of aluminium continued - net deliveries
amounted to 10,025 tonnes this week, taking the total to a record 1,055,875
tonnes - but the market appears to have become inured to this factor.
Dealers noted yesterday that deliveries into the exchange's US warehouses
had slowed to a trickle, keeping alive hopes that there was some improvement
in American demand. But there was concern about a 1,500-tonne shipment into
a Japanese warehouse.
The nickel market's Dollars 690 upsurge since the start of this year had
already run into stiff resistance at the end of last week, when the three
months price failed to pass the Dollars 8,000-a-tonne mark. And this week
saw a substantial retreat as the disappearance of recent influential buying
allowed the negative fundamental situation to come to the fore. The
bearishness of fundamentals was highlighted by a further 1,392-tonne rise in
LME stocks to 17,916 tonnes, the highest level since September 1984. Dealers
thought this week's rise largely reflected Russian deliveries into LME
warehouses, and they said more was expected from that quarter.
Another factor weighing on the nickel market was the prospect of a strike in
the German steel industry, which it was feared would reduce demand from
nickel's key end-use sector. But even before it was announced yesterday that
steel workers in the IG Metall union had voted overwhelmingly in favour of
striking in support of their 10.5 per cent pay claim the threat was
beginning to lose its market potency. Dealers explained that the impact of a
strike had already been discounted in this week's price fall and that, in
any case, the overall supply/demand balance was not likely to be much
affected because lost German output was likely to be made up by other
European producers.
The cash nickel price lost an early gain after the result of the strike vote
was announced, finishing unchanged on the day at Dollars 7,665 a tonne, down
Dollars 200 on the week.
Zinc prices were also in retreat, as fears of a technical squeeze receded.
The cash price fell Dollars 23.50 to Dollars 1,159 a tonne, and its premium
over the three months price narrowed from Dollars 17 to Dollars 5.75 a tonne
at one point, although it widened again yesterday to Dollars 13 a tonne.
The week's biggest base metals rises were in the copper market, where the
cash quotation gained Pounds 26.50 to Pounds 1,220.50 a tonne - but most of
that reflected sterling's decline against the dollar.
Also supportive of the copper market was the threat strike by Chilean miners
over a plan for Codelco, the state-owned metals group, to grant controlling
stakes in joint ventures to private companies. The company said, however, it
was confident that a stoppage was 'highly improbable'.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange the March robusta coffee price
slid by another Pounds 61 to Pounds 505 a tonne. Dealers said sentiment was
affected by news that Brazil, the biggest producer, had no market
stabilisation proposals to put before next week's meeting of the
International Coffee Organisation and that the National Coffee Growers'
Federation of Colombia, the second biggest producer, was not even sending a
delegation. The meetings will be attended instead by the federation's
permanent representative in London.
Coffee's weakness was also influenced by the evaporation of squeeze fears on
the expiring January position, which went off the board quietly yesterday at
a small discount to the March contract, now the only remaining sterling
position.

FT  01 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE in stock index futures continued for most of yesterday, sending
the March contract advancing to a strong premium, writes Joel Kibazo.
Buyers for March were seen from the outset from both independent traders and
large securities houses, sending the contract to a premium of 42 by
lunchtime and pulling up the underlying cash market.
That advance proved unsustainable and sellers were seen as dealers took
profits and awaited Wall Street's opening. News that TWA had filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected sentiment further, though dealers reported
healthy after-hours buying.
March closed at 2,604, a 33-point premium and some 17 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Volume, at over 7,000 contracts,
was better than the last few sessions.
In traded options, where dealers dealt on the options floor for the last
time, turnover reached 31,942.
The FT-SE 100 index option, which expired yesterday, traded 11,610
contracts. The Euro FT-SE option was also busy, with 6,009 lots dealt.
Rolls-Royce, which was hit by sentiment regarding TWA, was the busiest stock
option with 1,722 lots traded and the March 140 calls busy.

Tony Carter, a chartered mechanical engineer, has been appointed secretary
general of the British Deming Association which promotes the 'total quality'
philosophy of business management; it was named after the American quality
control guru, Edwards Deming.
Carter has worked in manufacturing, personnel and quality management in the
UK and Australia for companies including Ford, National Bus Group and London
International. He succeeds Patric Dolan.
Since it was formed in 1987, the non-profit-making association has developed
a nationwide programme of educational seminars, established more than a

FT  01 FEB 92 / Appointments: Pearson takes over at IMS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Pearson, who has been associate and then deputy director of the
Institute of Manpower Studies for the past eight years, will succeed John
Elliott as director in March. The IMS, which advises companies, government
departments and trade unions on employment and labour market issues, has a
staff of 50.
According to Sir John Cassels, president of the IMS council, Pearson 'knows
exactly what makes the Institute tick'. His colleagues obviously know what
makes him tick; 12 years ago they parodied his punctilious style in a staff
Christmas pantomime. He was characterised as someone who insisted on
punctuality, people speaking in turn and sticking to the point.
Now he says: 'Luckily I laughed. I have learnt that life is messier than I
thought; I was a bit naive then.'
Last year, when he was 42, Pearson started learning to play tennis. But his
performance in meetings is not replicated on the court; he is said to have
little style but makes up for this with stamina and determination to hit
every ball.
*****
Is John Hardman, former chief executive and chairman of Asda, in need of the
personal services of the executive search company of which he has just been
appointed a non-executive director?
Pushed from his position at the troubled store group by angry institutional
shareholders last June, Hardman has just picked up his third non-executive
directorship, this time at Adderley-Featherstone, a brand new Leeds-centred
headhunting outfit.
Peter Adderley, previously group managing director of Hoggett Bowers, says
Hardman has been a friend of his partner John Featherstone for years.
The former Asda boss, a Lancastrian who has made his home in Yorkshire, is
also a director of the Yorkshire Electricity Board and deputy chairman of
the Leeds Development Corporation. But that is unlikely to be keeping him
fully occupied.

FT  01 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer on increased demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONDON stock market showing increasing confidence on the domestic outlook
moved ahead strongly yesterday, brushing off potentially negative
developments elsewhere in Europe and the US. Institutional buyers were noted
again and the Footsie Index received a further boost from Rank Organisation,
whose maintained dividend has helped confidence across the range of
equities.
London opened sharply higher behind a good performance from Wall Street
overnight and took further encouragement from the stock index futures. The
March contract on the Footsie, which has traded at a strong premium against
cash all week, closed above 2,600 last night.
At the day's best, the FT-SE Index itself was ahead by nearly 30 points at
2,580.2, the best level since October 18. Last October, confidence began to
crack in the UK stock market as the Labour opposition party established a
seven point lead in the public opinion polls and doubts were cast over Wall
Street's performance.
There was no immediate response in the London market yesterday to the strike
decision by the German steel unions. However, share prices came off the top
in late afternoon when Wall Street opened eight Dow points off in UK hours
as Trans World Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was 20.4 higher on the day at 2,571.2. The
first week of the equity trading account has seen the Footsie rise by 60.8
or about 2.4 per cent as opinion polls have indicated an improvement in the
ratings of Mr Major's government.
The economic outlook has remained less certain, with the Confederation of
British Industry reporting falling confidence among its members.
Trading volume, after falling away at first, has increased, and the Seaq
system yesterday recorded 668.5m shares, comparing well with Thursday's
680.5m. More significantly, Stock Exchange statistics showed that retail, or
customer business in equities, rose to Pounds 1.3bn on Thursday and traders
believed that yesterday will confirm this improvement in genuine investment
activity.
Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull commented that, with a relatively light
corporate reporting list ahead and few testing levels nearby, the UK market
could well attempt FT-SE 2,600 in the near future.
But the UK bond market had a nervous session, closing with prices little
changed from overnight as UK investors reacted to the uncertain trends on
the US bond market. Some London analysts speculated whether the strike vote
in Germany might provoke the Bundesbank to raise interest rates.
Retail, or customer, volume in equities has begun to improve again and is
now running well above last year's daily averages.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK money market ended the week facing a sizable liquidity shortage
following several days during which easier conditions had prevailed, writes
Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.2bn early in
the session, revised up to Pounds 1.3bn. As has been the pattern this week,
maturing treasury bills and assistance were the main components of the
shortage, draining Pounds 1.18bn from the market.
However, there was no early rush for funding and in early assistance the
Bank of England injected just Pounds 386m. The Bank purchased bills for
resale to the market at 10 7/16 per cent on February 17 and 18, switching
the repurchase dates from February 12 and 13 seen earlier in the week.
Later in the morning session a further Pounds 151m was purchased for resale
on the same terms. In the afternoon the bulk of the remaining shortage was
taken out, through the outright purchase of Pounds 704m band 1 bank bills at
10 7/16 per cent.
Late assistance of Pounds 75m bought the total liquidity injection for the
day to Pounds 1.316bn.
The unsecured overnight money rate was steady at around 11 per cent for most
of the morning but fell back to close at 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent.
Longer rates were little changed. Three month interbank funds traded at 10
9/16 - per cent from 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent on Thursday; one month interbank
money closed at 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange lost ground during the day and closed at 89.67. In mid-week
the contract had traded as high as 89.82.
In Frankfurt, call money traded up to 9.75 per cent, the same level as the
Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate for financial
institutions.
The authorities injected funds at 9.7 per cent, transfering funds held on
deposit for public sector bodies, in an effort to relieve the the shortage.
The squeeze this week was sparked by pension payments draining cash from
banks and heavy funding towards the end of the month.
The pressure was evidenced by a surge in borrowing at the Lombard rate.
Financial institutions' Lombard borrowings reached DM7.1bn on Thursday,
having been static at under DM1bn for most of the month.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark gains on strike vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading on the foreign exchange markets remained nervous yesterday, with the
dollar falling more than 2 pfennigs on the the announcement that German
steel workers voted for strike action, writes Simon London.
Overnight trading in the Far East was featureless, with few dealers willing
to take on large positions on the last day of the month, a reporting
deadline at many firms. In addition, poor economic data from the US this
week and the threat of central bank intervention left traders uncertain
whether the dollar's recent gains would be increased.
The dollar ended in Tokyo at Y125.78, from Y125.75/85 at the close in New
York, and DM1.6162, from DM1.6163.
However, the narrow range against the German currency was shattered by the
announcement that steel workers voted overwhelmingly for strike action. The
result was preceded by statements from employers that there would be no
increase in the 5.7 per cent pay offer, setting the stage for a lengthy
dispute.
The D-Mark rose sharply against the dollar on the ballot result. From a
level of DM1.6230 against the dollar shortly before the announcement - the
low point the day against the US currency - the German unit rose suddenly to
DM1.6000 as dealers liquidated dollar positions.
In addition to the strike vote, the dollar was damaged by the release of the
index of leading US economic indicators for December, which fell 0.3 per
cent for the second month in succession.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, echoed hard-line statements by
other central bank officials this week, underlining that the medium term
inflation target is 2 per cent, against a current rate of 4 per cent.
This was taken as a signal that German interest rates will not be reduced in
the near term.
The weakness of the dollar against the D-Mark lasted through the afternoon,
with the US currency reach a low of DM1.5950 in mid-afternoon. Some of the
losses were later recovered, however, and the US unit closed in London at
DM1.6080, from DM1.6210 on Thursday; 125.55 from Y126; and Dollars 1.7900
from Dollars 1.7745 against sterling.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling gained ground against
the D-Mark, pressing DM2.88 for most of the day, the highest level since the
Bundesbank increased German interest rates on December 19.
However, other currencies also gained on the D-Mark and sterling remained
only just above its floor within the system, determined by its maximum
permitted divergence from the strongest currency, the peseta. The UK
currency closed unchanged at DM2.8775.

THE SWEDISH government has appointed a two-man team to negotiate with Volvo
over the future of Procordia, the country's food and pharmaceuticals company
in which the state and Volvo are the main joint owners.
These are Mr Johan Gernandt, the solicitor responsible for the recent
liquidation of Sweden's state holding company, Fortia, and Mr Tony Hagstrom,
the general director of the country's telecommunications utility,
Televerket.
This follows the government's rejection of the proposed SKr38.7bn (Dollars
6.6bn) deal to merge Procordia with Volvo. Despite an angry public exchange
of letters on Thursday, Volvo's executive chairman, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar,
and Sweden's prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, seem keen to reach a settlement
over Procordia as soon as possible.
Procordia is going ahead with a restructuring plan to make its organisation
better focused to meet market demands in Europe.

CREDIT LYONNAIS, the French state-owned bank, is studying the possible
acquisition of a stake in BfG Bank, the troubled banking subsidiary of
Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), the Germany insurance group.
The move, suggested by AMB, could pave the way for a compromise in AMB's
power struggle with Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state-owned
insurer.
AGF has, over the past 18 months, built up a 25 per cent stake in AMB in the
hope of striking a co-operation deal to improve its access to the German
market. But the German group has, until now, been unwilling be courted.
AMB has not allowed AGF to take up its full voting rights, instead pursuing
an alternative alliance with Fondiaria of Italy and Royal Insurance of the
UK. Currently, AGF has only 9 per cent of the votes at AMB.
The German insurer hinted yesterday that relations with AGF were unfreezing.
'We have offered AGF a joint solution on BfG. AGF has announced an offer for
BfG from Credit Lyonnais and we would assess such an offer thoroughly,' said
Mr Peter Matthiessen, AMB spokesman.
AMB was seeking the French insurer's mediation in selling a stake in the
bank subsidiary to Credit Lyonnais, he said.
A formal Credit Lyonnais offer, possibly for 30 per cent of BfG's equity,
has yet to be tabled, and the French bank said yesterday it was just
starting to study the proposal.
BfG is 51 per cent owned by the German insurer, with the balance held by a
German trade union holding company. They have had to make two large capital
injections to cover provisions for unsound sovereign debts.

<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation had achieved 'encouraging' operating results for
the 1991-92 first quarter, chairman, Sir Eric Neal, told a long and, at
times, fiery annual meeting in Sydney yesterday.
Facing a barrage of questions from shareholders dissatisfied with the bank's
performance, Sir Eric said an uncertain economic outlook precluded more
specific profit predictions.
However, he expected the group's troubled finance arm, Australian Guarantee
Corporation, to perform this year in line with the year ended September,
1991, when it made a loss of about ADollars 220m (USDollars 164m).
'Westpac has already taken the hard decisions affecting its operations,' Sir
Eric said. 'This will allow the bank to focus on better business
opportunities and to build upon its inherent market strengths.'
'Despite the continuing poor economic conditions, Westpac's operating
results for the first quarter of 1991-92 are encouraging and, if sustained,
offer tangible proof that the worst is behind us.'
Sir Eric received some much-needed public support from Australia's biggest
investor, the AMP Society, whose managing director, Mr Ian Salmon, told the
meeting the society would immediately purchase 74m Westpac shares.
Mr Salmon said the purchase would cost about ADollars 300m. It followed
Thursday night's approval from Federal Treasurer (chancellor), Mr John
Dawkins, of a long-standing request for the AMP to lift its Westpac stake
from 10 to 15 per cent.

PERSTORP, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, made a profit
after financial items of only SKr67m (Dollars 11.4m) in the last quarter of
1991, a drop of 60 per cent from the SKr166m for the same months in 1990,
writes Robert Taylor.
Group sales were up 5 per cent, to SKr2.38bn from SKr2.26bn in the
September-December period of 1990. This, however, was mainly due to
acquisitions.

<TEXT>
TAMPELLA, the troubled Finnish forestry and engineering group owned by the
Bank of Finland, has reported a sharp deterioration in its financial
performance, with a FM1.3bn (Dollars 298m) loss after financial items for
1991, compared with a FM600m deficit in 1990.
Sales increased by 5 per cent, to around FM7.2bn from FM6.8bn. The result
would have been worse but for a FM1.5bn loan write-off. A FM530m increase in
capital after the Bank of Finland took control also helped to improve the
company's balance sheet.
Tampella believes interest costs will be cut by around FM200m in 1992 as a
result of the measures taken to restructure operations. The 10,239-strong
workforce is to be reduced by 1,473.
Tampella said shareholders' equity and reserves at the end of last year
totalled FM1.7bn. The solvency ratio was about 18 per cent.
The company was saved by the Bank of Finland as part of the rescue of the
country's main savings bank, SkopBank, last autumn. The bank's credit loss
troubles were mainly caused by the outstanding debts accumulated by Tampella
on loans totalling FM1.5bn.
Tampella said although the recession in Finland appeared to have bottomed
out, demand in the company's main markets would remain sluggish throughout
this year. It said the recovery measures taken would lead to an improvement
in performance and a considerable cut in losses.

FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics prepares for
defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the second largest US defence contractor, has reported
fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 166m, compared with a Dollars 530m
net loss after special charges a year ago. It said the defence spending
cutbacks proposed this week by President Bush would reduce its year-end
backlog of orders by less than 4 per cent.
Nevertheless, General Dynamics, in common with all US defence contractors,
is being hit by the sharp reduction in US weapons procurement. Its chairman,
Mr William Anders, has adopted a particularly aggressive strategy to cope
with the problem.
This includes concentration on its core defence operations; selling off
peripheral activities, such as Cessna, its business aircraft subsidiary; and
returning the excess cash generated by this to shareholders. General
Dynamics recently agreed to sell Cessna to industrial group, Textron, for
Dollars 600m in cash.
Yesterday's Dollars 166m, or Dollars 3.95-a-share, fourth-quarter earnings
included Cessna, and for 1991 as a whole the company made Dollars 505m, or
Dollars 12.06 a share. Excluding Cessna, the company reported fourth-quarter
earnings of Dollars 66m, or Dollars 1.56 a share, on sales of Dollars 2.3bn,
and 1991 earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 374m, or Dollars
8.93 a share, on sales of Dollars 8.8bn. The full-year figure included a
Dollars 140m tax gain.
The fourth-quarter loss in 1990 included Dollars 567m in special after-tax
charges, and for 1990 as a whole the company reported a net loss of Dollars
578m after Dollars 881m of charges.
Mr Anders said cash generation in 1991 had been better than expected. The
company had ended the year with balances of more than Dollars 800m. It now
intended to call in two debt issues: the 7 7/8 notes due 1993 and the 9 per
cent debentures due 2016. This would reduce debt by some Dollars 350m in the
first quarter of 1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale, one of France's largest private sector banks, expects to
see a recovery in gross operating profits to around FFr10bn (Dollars 1.84bn)
in 1991, after a fall in profits during the previous year.
The news of Societe Generale's anticipated recovery came only a day after
Paribas, another prominent French bank, warned that it had fallen into a
loss - of FFr200m - last year for the first time in its history.
Both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, have put
Paribas under surveillance to decide whether to reduce its rating.
The projected increase in Societe Generale's profits represents a marked
improvement on its performance in 1990, when net profits fell by 25 per cent
to FFr2.7bn after it was forced to increase provisions for bad debts and
securities.
Mr Marc Vienot, president, speaking at a shareholders meeting in Paris,
yesterday refused to disclose the likely level of 1991's net attributable
profits. He said only that they 'would not be poor'.
In the first half of 1991, net profits rose to FFr1.83bn from FFr1.41bn in
the year-ago period. Mr Vienot said although first-half results were usually
stronger than those of the second, last year the performance in the second
half had been stronger than in the past.
Societe Generale increased its lending by 13.4 per cent last year, with
business loans showing particularly strong growth of 18 per cent. However,
demand for new credit was poor because of the low level of French interest
rates.
The group cut back on country risk provisions last year, after reducing its
exposure by 10 per cent from 1990. It was forced to increase provisions for
commercial debt in 1991, but managed to reclaim part of the FFr1.2bn set
aside in provisions for its share portfolio.
The French stock market authorities have criticised the share sale agreement
between Pinault, the timber and retailing group, and the Maus family, the
main shareholders in the Au Printemps retail group for which Pinault has
made a FFr5.3bn two-thirds bid. The Commission des Operations de Bourse said
the agreement was not fair to Au Printemps' minority shareholders.

DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals concern,
yesterday announced a sharp cut in dividend after a steep fall in profits
last year.
The company, which has embarked on an extensive restructuring and
cost-cutting programme, said it would be paying shareholders only DM7 a
share instead of the DM11 distributed previously.
Group net income dropped by 33 per cent, to DM99m (Dollars 62m), in the year
ended September 1991, with earnings per share tumbling to DM12 from DM25.50.
Several other German industrial companies, especially those involved with
export markets, have recently announced lower profits, dividend reductions,
and job cuts.
Degussa said in December its pre-tax profits were 44 per cent lower at
DM179m.
It blamed the world economic slowdown for the deterioration, and said an
expected improvement in the second half of the year had failed to occur.
Instead, business took a turn for the worse in the summer.
Turnover was only 4 per cent lower at DM13.4bn. However, like the previous
year, precious metals turnover - down by 13 per cent to DM3.8bn - was
excluded.

The following is the text of the statement by Wace Group made to the Stock
Exchange yesterday:
'The directors of Wace announce that John Clegg today tendered his
resignation as managing director of the company. This has been accepted with
great regret by the board, who acknowledge the outstanding contribution made
by Mr Clegg to the growth of the group over the past eight years.
'Notwithstanding the announcement made by Wace on 27 January following press
speculation over the weekend, rumours have continued and Mr Clegg has
decided that the interests of Wace would be best served by his resignation
from the board. The directors wish to reiterate that they are not aware that
the company, its investors or its directors (including Mr Clegg) have ever
had any links of any sort with the IRA or any other terrorist organisation.
Nor are they aware of any suggestion of any impropriety in the way in which
the group is managed, or in the constitution of Wace's shareholding list.
'The directors' objective remains to maximise the group's potential to the
benefit of Wace, its shareholders, customers and employees.
'A strong new management structure has recently been put in place for Wace
UK, Wace Europe and Wace USA, which is well equipped to take full advantage
of the opportunities open to Wace. In the short term, Mr Frans ten Bos,
chairman of Wace, will assume Mr Clegg's executive responsibilities.'

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: Extrovert with reputation for
deal-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESIGNATION of Mr John Clegg, 33, as chief executive of Wace Group
brings a sudden and mysterious halt to the career of one of Britain's most
successful young businessmen.
Mr Clegg was just 26 when he was appointed, becoming the youngest chief
executive of a listed company and promising 'aggressive development and
youthful enthusiasm'.
The extrovert young man soon established a reputation as a deal-maker.
A rapid series of acquisitions helped make Wace the world's largest
pre-press printing specialist, with companies in Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and the United States.
Born in Nice, he was brought up in Sheffield and studied law at the London
School of Economics.
He trained as a solicitor with Nabarro Nathanson in London between 1979-83
and then worked in the City for a year as corporate finance executive with
Minster Trust before moving to Wace.
In spite of his title of managing director for the group, Mr Clegg has been
spending most of his time recently in the United States, where Wace is
facing very depressed markets.
He has also been taking a less active role in operational issues since
extensive management changes at the beginning of last year.
Mr Clegg no longer has a home in London and stays with relatives when
visiting the UK.
Wace said yesterday that Mr Clegg was anxious to return to his wife and baby
in America as soon as possible.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: Rapid expansion in US after series
of acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1990, Wace USA, which has its headquarters in Chicago, moved from second
to first position in the pre-press printing sector, according to Graphics
Arts Monthly, a US trade publication.
The US company, whose clients have included the newspaper USA Today, Time
magazine, catalogue retail firms such as J. C. Penney and Sears Roebuck, and
retailers such as Macy's and Bloomingdales, refused to disclose any
information about profits, turnover or other financial data. All enquiries
were referred to Wace in London.
Wace has expanded rapidly in the US through a series of acquisitions,
beginning with the 1988 purchase - for Dollars 56m - of Techtron Imaging
Network of Chicago, a company that had achieved an annual turnover of
Dollars 83m in the previous year.
Wace agreed to pay Dollars 20.3m in cash to holders of Techtron stock, and a
further Dollars 33m to pay off debt built up during a 1985 management
buy-out of the company from the Beatrice Group.
The remaining cost of the purchase was for profit-related payments to
Techtron's management.
Techtron's name was changed to Wace USA, and the present chief executive is
Mr John Collins, an American who sits on the main board of Wace plc.
In 1989, Wace made its second US acquisition - a Dollars 5.5m purchase of
Etheridge Company, a printer based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Later that
year, Wace paid Dollars 5m for Ros Ehlert, a film processing laboratory with
operations in Illinois and Florida.
In February 1990, Wace agreed to pay Dollars 450,000 for Hawkey and
Associates, a Chicago-based consulting and services company.
Mr Clegg said in April 1990 that about one third of Wace's group profits
came from the US.
In late 1991, SPP Hambro &amp; Co helped Wace Group to tap the US private
placement market for Dollars 60m.
Mr Neil Powell, SPP Hambro's chairman, said at the time that the proceeds
would be used to repay bank debt. Mr Powell said four buyers, principally
insurance companies, had agreed to the offer of Wace bonds.
Hambro of the UK is the main shareholder in New York-based SPP Hambro.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: Suspected links with IRA discussed
last year after police probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH-LEVEL meeting attended by the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange,
the Serious Fraud Office and the Royal Ulster Constabulary was held in
London last year to discuss an investigation into suspicions that
individuals connected with the Wace Group may have had links with the IRA.
The meeting, also attended by the Metropolitan Police, was held within the
Stock Exchange in June and followed earlier investigations carried out by
the Insider Dealing Group of the Stock Exchange and by police in Sheffield.
The SE investigations are believed to have stemmed from share dealings at
the time of Wace's takeover of Parkway in August 1990, although insider
dealing is understood to have been ruled out.
The SFO declined to take up the case but detectives in Sheffield carried on
investigations, liaising with the RUC's C13 anti-racketeering unit.
Investigations were held into the background of Mr John Clegg, the chief
executive of Wace, and Miss Jane Wright, his cousin, who helped fund his
purchase of a controlling share in the Wace Group in 1983. At the time Mr
Clegg said that Miss Wright, who is based in South Africa, had largely
financed the takeover from a family inheritance.
Detectives were mainly concerned to discover the exact source of the funding
and whether there were any links between Wace and the IRA.
A senior security official, confirming the investigations yesterday, said
that they had uncovered no evidence to link Mr Clegg with the IRA. 'We did
the investigation but the story died very quickly. We could find no
linkage.'
The police were working, however, on a large dossier of evidence on unusual
transactions concerning Wace and related interests. Some of the transactions
are believed to have involved corporate interests with an address in South
Africa.
The investigation is understood to have been shelved some time ago. 'We will
not be carrying out any further investigation unless someone can bring out
some hard facts,' said the official.
The probe into the alleged links between the Wace Group and the IRA is only
part of a much larger drive designed to identify several potential sources
of IRA funds.
In their search for large sums of money, the security forces are understood
to be up against a complex organisation through which the IRA attempts to
exploit the financial system.
Other public companies are also known to have been featured in suspected
insider dealing rings in Northern Ireland which detectives believed could
have been raising funds for the IRA. These were quite separate and unrelated
to any dealings in Wace shares.
The transactions that came under scrutiny in initial inquiries involved
millions of pounds of dealings.
Some discussion on the investigation is believed to have been held between
the Bank of England and the Bank of Ireland.
Officials believe the IRA raises up to Pounds 6m a year, financing arms and
explosives, payments to about 500 active volunteers, safe houses, travel,
bribes, and research and development on armaments.
The RUC's C13, set up in its present form in 1986, has recently increased
its personnel and now uses high-tech state-of-the-art surveillance equipment
and computerised intelligence databanks.
While several investigations into illicit fund-raising are understood to be
continuing, the RUC and government officials are anxious to keep them as
secretive as possible.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Shield forced to restate last published
accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIELD GROUP, the property developer and estate agent, was yesterday forced
to publish restated 1991 accounts after it was criticised for contravening
accounting standards, in a move which almost doubled its losses per share,
writes Andrew Jack.
It also continued to wind down its activities and reported a pre-tax loss
for the six months to September 30 of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 955,000), on
turnover of Pounds 5.81m (Pounds 2.97m).
Shield is the third company to be criticised by the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, which polices accounting standards. It contravened SSAP 6, a
prior year adjustment standard.
In its re-stated accounts Shield made provisions of Pounds 3.58m for the
year to March 31 1991, against Pounds 784,000 when the accounts were first
published. It also increased stated losses before exceptional items by
Pounds 876,000 to Pounds 3.75m.
The difference represents adjustments to the value of properties which were
made during 1991 but originally transferred to the 1990 accounts in a move
which it felt more fairly represented the value of the properties then.
However, the treatment did not comply with SSAP 6. This divergence was
highlighted in a qualified report from Stoy Hayward, its auditors.
'We believe the standard gave the wrong answer,' said Mr Norman Mazure,
chairman. 'In reality life isn't always black and white.'

British Aerospace is selling its Aerostructures Hamble aircraft components

This is a first step in BAe's rationalisation policy of concentrating on its
core defence, commercial aircraft, Rover cars and property and construction
businesses.
Aerostructures was set up in 1989 to produce components for civil and
defence aircraft. It employs about 1,700 and supplies parts for BAe aircraft
programmes as well as to other customers, including Saab McDonnell Douglas,
and Westland, the helicopter group.
Last year its turnover was Pounds 66m and pre-tax profit Pounds 4m.
BAe outlined its strategy of disposing of certain peripheral activities in
its prospectus for its controversial Pounds 432m rights issue last
September.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Rosehaugh, the troubled property company, yesterday announced it had
extended its standstill agreement with its banks.
The company, which has net debts of Pounds 310m, is negotiating a
medium-term refinancing. Rosehaugh's statement to the Stock Exchange
yesterday said that discussions were 'continuing satisfactorily'.
Rosehaugh's share price slipped from 4 3/4 p to 4 1/2 p.
The standstill agreement was set up at the end of last year, when Rosehaugh
announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 227m for the year to June 30 and breached
its covenants. Shareholders' funds shrank from Pounds 471m to Pounds 164m.
Rosehaugh's 28 banks, led by Barclays and National Westminster, are
discussing the margins and the maturity of its loans and the security
position of the lenders.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Appointments put MFI on path towards
reflotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI, which was the subject of one of the largest management buy-outs in the
UK, has taken an important step towards reflotation with the appointment of
a financial adviser and joint stockbrokers.
The indebted furniture retailing and manufacturing group has appointed
County NatWest as its merchant bank adviser and Rowe &amp; Pitman and Smith New
Court Corporate Finance as joint stockbrokers.
The announcement triggered a rise in the shares of Asda, the food retailer,
which as MFI's former parent company retains a 25 per cent stake in its
offspring. Asda's shares surged 11 per cent to 39 1/2 p before closing up 3
1/2 p at 39p.
Mr Derek Hunt, MFI chairman, said the group had seen strong sales in the
past six weeks and was ready to begin preparations for a reflotation.
Although no decision has been made as to the exact timing of the flotation,
the group would prefer to see the general election out of the way. The
flotation was also subject to MFI's buoyant performance being sustained and
to favourable conditions on the stock market.
MFI was bought out from Asda in November 1987 by a management team led by Mr
Hunt, in what was at the time the largest MBO in the UK. The highly
leveraged Pounds 718m buy-out soon ran into difficulties, however, as
interest rates climbed and consumer spending fell sharply.
The group negotiated a refinancing in the summer of 1989, and rescheduled a
portion of its debt in May last year.
It is still saddled with Pounds 500m of capital repayment, the first Pounds
15m of which falls in April. There will be another repayment of Pounds 25m
in the autumn.
Mr Hunt is cautiously optimistic about the group's trading outlook. 'We
believe the bedrock was at the interims,' he said.
MFI posted a 21 per cent increase in trading profits to Pounds 25m (Pounds
20.6m) in the six months to November 9 on slightly lower turnover of Pounds
319.2m (Pounds 320.4m). The pre-tax loss was trimmed to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds
16m).
Since then, the group has seen a strong rise in trade in the January sales,
which provide more than a quarter of total turnover. In the six weeks since
the sales period started in late December, there has been an improvement in
group sales in the double digits in percentage terms over last year, Mr Hunt
said. The improvements seen were at least in the 'higher teens', he said,
and he expected to see continuing strength ahead.
MFI has invested heavily in software and strengthened inventory controls,
thereby releasing Pounds 18m as working capital.
In its stores it has raised the proportion of products manufactured in its
own factories, which has enabled it to maintain gross profit margins at
about 58 per cent. Overheads have been lowered by 5 per cent on a
year-on-year basis.
A virtually just-in-time delivery system has been adopted for its stores and
is being introduced to its factories.

However, this time there is a Pounds 502,000 extraordinary provision against
the investment in C3W's application for the Channel 3 franchise for Wales
and the West of England. Earnings per share came to 6.4p (6.8p).
Expro, which serves the petroleum exploration and production industries,
recorded a satisfactory increase in profits. Regarding the sale of this
company, Flextech and its advisers are in discussions with interested
parties and shareholders will be informed further when appropriate.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: SEP Industrial down to Pounds 303,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The widening impact of the recession in the UK and increasingly in overseas
markets hit SEP Industrial Holdings, the USM-quoted engineering products
group.
In the year ended September 30 1991 sales fell from Pounds 58.3m to Pounds
49.5m - and were Pounds 10m below budget - leading to a decline in pre-tax
profit from Pounds 2.33m to Pounds 303,000.
The group's prime customer base in the vehicle and construction industries
was particularly badly affected, said Mr Paul Formby, the chairman.
However, he looked for a significant increase in the current year, the scope
and extent being dependent on the timing of any improvement in the
manufacturing division. And that justified payment of a dividend - 0.2p
against 1.04p.
Earnings per share for the year fell to 0.48p (3.07p).

European Motor Holdings, the motor group formerly known as Cargo Control
which bought the motor retail division of Thomas Robinson Group for Pounds
7.1m in November, has reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 735,000 for the six
months to September 30. This compares with losses of Pounds 2.72m incurred
in the 15 months to March 31 1991.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 8.85m), with turnover on
continuing businesses down less sharply at Pounds 3.06m (Pounds 5.33m).
Operating losses on continuing activities were reduced to Pounds 442,000
(Pounds 527,000) - those on non-continuing activities were Pounds 93,000
(Pounds 1.61m) - and interest payable was cut to Pounds 115,000 (Pounds

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Palmerston Holdings, the property trading and investment group, returned to
profits in the half year ended September 30 1991, making Pounds 476,000.
That compared with a loss of Pounds 2,700 for the corresponding period and a
deficit of Pounds 2.68m for the full previous year.
The directors take the view that, for the company at least, 'the worst is
behind us'. But they will continue with the recent cautious dividend policy
and have cut the interim from 1.65p to 0.5p per share. Earnings were 2.12p
(losses 0.01p).
Mr Philip Rose, chairman, said the main contributors to the results were an
increase in net rental income to Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 2.64m), a decrease in
the share of losses of associates to Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 2.21m), and the
ability to achieve a greater return from trading activities.

A 74 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 251,000 to Pounds
436,000, was announced by Wentworth International Group for the six months
to September 30.
The plastic packaging products group achieved a 66 per cent increase in
turnover to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 6.54m) and the pre-tax result was after an
exceptional Pounds 29,000 credit.
However, Mr Haque Khan, the chairman, said group profits had suffered from
losses at Wentworth Cartons which had been badly affected by the current
economic climate.
Further cuts to its manufacturing cost base had inevitably led to further
redundancies, he added.
Looking ahead, he was confident of increased activity both at Paraphane
(flexible laminates) and within the point-of-sale display division of
Edwards (corrugated packaging).
Earnings came through at 0.29p (1.78p) on an increased number of shares. As
usual, there is no interim dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH pre-tax profit at J&amp;J Dyson dropped from Pounds 671,000 to Pounds
347,000, it was a better result than anticipated so the interim dividend is
being maintained.
Turnover for the six months ended September 30 1991, of this refractories,
motor and builders' merchant group rose to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 23.5m).
Mr Richard Field, chairman, said M and G Tankers and Trailers suffered
particularly badly as it took volume work at marginal cost. But that
strategy had been revised and led to redundancy costs of Pounds 55,000,
taken to profit as an exceptional charge.
In contrast, the garage and builders' merchant companies turned in improved
results.
Steel industry customers, the main consumers of the refractories, continued
to see their orders decline. Dyson had made substantial technical progress
in reducing their refractory costs but they were also looking for direct
price reductions, 'not a formula which helps our own short-term results', Mr
Field said.
The interim dividend is 2p paid from earnings per share of 1.68p (3.15p).

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Heavyweight bout with no real winners - The
anti-climactic ICI/Hanson title fight showed up weaknesses, rather than
strengths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON and Sir Denys Henderson, the ICI chairman, are stepping down
from the ring bloodied and bruised. Retiring to their dressing rooms they
can now assess how the battle has left them placed for their next bouts in
the corporate ring.
Lord Hanson's scorecard shows that his reputation for unrivalled mastery of
the acquisition game is in peril. That means that questions about the future
of his acquisitive conglomerate will become more pressing.
Sir Denys has won the contest on points. ICI is becoming leaner and more
agile. But many of the doubts raised about its performance will haunt it
long after Hanson has sold its stake.
For Lord Hanson, and for investors in his company, much has changed since
the daring purchase of 2.8 per cent of ICI's shares in May last year.
A fund manager who had attended a recent meeting with Lord Hanson, said:
'The last time we saw Lord Hanson was in 1990, when he was in a triumphant
mood. This time he was more sober. He had come to tell us that he had been
wrong about ICI and that he was ruling himself out of bidding for the
company.'
For Lord Hanson to admit that he was wrong has come as a shock not only to
institutional shareholders, but also to the City as a whole. Goldman Sachs,
which advised ICI during the battle, believes that, by initiating a debate
about the quality of Hanson's profits and its style of management, ICI has
weakened the conglomerate's ability to make another big takeover.
Mr Charles Pick, conglomerate analyst at Nomura, agrees, but says that
Hanson could still make a medium-sized acquisition. 'If he wanted to make a
bid for a company on the scale of ICI, he would need to issue equity. That
is now harder for him because of the revelations about his managerial style
and quality of profits. But with credit lines of around Pounds 5bn, Hanson
would have no problem in making an all-cash bid for a medium-sized company.'
Yet Hanson needs a big takeover to maintain its record of 28 years of
earnings growth. Recent large US acquisitions have enabled Hanson to
increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.31bn in the year to
September 30. But in the UK, where there were no significant deals, pre-tax
profits fell from Pounds 474m to Pounds 424m.
The big investment institutions are still not happy about Hanson's corporate
governance. Although Lord Hanson has reassured some of them that the
management of the company will become more open, and that there will be
increased delegation of responsibility, there are still concerns among fund
managers that Hanson has failed to appoint non-executive directors with
sufficient power to protect shareholders' interests.
As Hanson licks its wounds, one consolation might be the knowledge that it
has thrown the solid, stable and occasionally complacent world of ICI into
turmoil.
Hanson's assault has raised doubts about ICI's strategy, management and
financial performance which it has yet to dispel. In particular, the
scrutiny provided by Hanson showed that in spite of reshaping in the last
decade, ICI still does not have a mix of businesses to insulate it against
recession.
During the last year, only ICI's pharmaceuticals division has kept the
company's results respectable. In the third quarter of 1991, the division
generated pre-tax profits of Pounds 147m, compared with Pounds 196m for the
whole group.
Even here, the weakness exposed by Hanson - the division is small by the
standards of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies such as Glaxo and
Merck - persists.
The bulk chemicals operations - still ICI's troublesome core business - are
being restructured so that only the parts that have stayed profitable in
this recession will remain. But the success of that plan is yet to be
tested.
A shadow has also been cast over the success of ICI's move into added-value
products such as speciality chemicals and advanced materials.
'ICI has pumped hundreds of millions of pounds and huge management resources
into specialities and they have nothing to show for it,' says Mr Stuart
Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter.
A senior ICI executive admits that Hanson has forced the company to change:
'It has made us all much more aware than we were about the importance of
assessing how we satisfy shareholders in everything we do.'
It has ripped out layers of management as part of an attempt to cut costs by
about Pounds 400m a year by the mid-1990s. About Pounds 200m has been taken
out so far.
Since January 1990, the workforce has been cut by nearly 14,000 and the
company has made divestments of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m. Four of
ICI's seven general managers have been changed.
Although Sir Denys insisted in November that Lord Hanson's holding was a
distraction from the strategic review he started in February last year, the
reality is that it was an essential spur to the process.
ICI may have emerged from its contest with Lord Hanson determined to get
fit, but the ICI corporate body has a tendency to corpulence. The danger is
that, without the daily exercise of sparring with Lord Hanson in the
takeover ring, ICI will once again lose its shape.

FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat Aviation plans April
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the aircraft leasing company, is considering raising
about Dollars 700m (Pounds 386m) of new money in its flotation, which it
plans to bring forward to April.
However, shares with a value of up to Dollars 1.5bn are likely to be on
offer, the precise amount depending on how many of its existing shareholders
wish to sell.
The flotation, aimed primarily at investment institutions, will be one of
the most ambitious attempts to market shares in the big share markets of the
world.
Air Canada and Aer Lingus own substantial blocks of shares, each worth about
Dollars 200m, and are expected to sell part of their holdings.
Air Canada said the company would sell its holding if the price was right.
The company would not comment on what price would be acceptable, but
industry sources believe it is looking for a price in excess of Dollars 20 a
share.
The biggest shareholder is Japan's Mitsubishi group of companies with 16 per
cent.
Advisers to the group, which include Nomura, the global co-ordinator, the UK
merchant bank, Schroders, and Goldman Sachs of the US, are understood to
have recommended different share prices ranging from Dollars 17 to Dollars
23. GPA would prefer to get the issue away with a higher share price.
The sale will help GPA finance its ambitious programme of aircraft
purchases. To the year 2000 it has firm orders of Dollars 11.9bn and a
further Dollars 9.2bn of non-binding commitments. Last summer, GPA asked the
huge Japanese securities firm, Nomura, to examine the possibility of a
flotation, though GPA has never given a commitment that it would go public.
Nonetheless there has been speculation that a share sale would take place
towards the end of the year.
However, GPA has decided to accelerate the flotation process to take
advantage of the buoyancy of the US stock market. It hopes to make a
preliminary filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US
regulator, by the end of February.

Sir, Robert Rice's description ('The ass brays over the silence of the
lamb', January 30) of the law as 'an ass' in the matter of a 'right to
silence' is surely not only right but a reason to change it - the law, that
is.
The so-called right to silence is claimed on the ground of avoiding
incriminating oneself. How ridiculous] In a just society the guilty should
be encouraged to incriminate themselves, and the innocent would not be
capable of doing so by telling the truth.
As a layman, I despair at the widening gulf between the law and justice,
which serves only to help lawyers get ever fatter by splitting hairs to
protect the guilty.

Sir, Your report, 'A shake-out for S African banking' (January 30), on the
ABSA merger mentions market rumours to the effect that Standard Bank
Investment Corporation, through the South African Reserve Bank, tried to
have the merger stopped.
We can categorically state that SBIC has at no time approached the Reserve
Bank or the Competition Board (or, indeed, any other body) to interfere with
the planned merger.
Such action would not square with our frequently stated view that
rationalisation within the South African banking and financial services

competitiveness and standards of service, nationally and internationally,
are thereby enhanced.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: Public should be told reality of life assurance
contributions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT K YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Messrs Ross and Scurfield's predictable defence of the life assurance
industry (Letters, January 29) ignores a simple truth - most policyholders
do not KNOW that large proportions of their savings are being siphoned out
of first year contributions to fund the industry sales system. All that is
asked is they tell them. If the public are told and accept that 90 per cent
of the first contribution to a pension scheme is paid away in commissions
and acquisition costs so be it.
But let the public be the judge. They should publish their commission
scales.
It is the responsibility of the life industry to justify its charges, not to
hide them behind cleverly worded policy constructions the public do not
understand.
One cannot compare long-term, equity-based investments with deposit-based
savings. In the latter there is no capital risk and instant access without
penalty. This is neither a fair comparison nor an addition to balanced
debate.
They may like to consider why an endowment policy is sold in preference to
either a unit trust or PEP in the majority of cases. The answer, of course,
is one word - commission.
Messrs Ross and Scurfield know it. The industry knows it. Every salesman
(IFA or tied) knows it. They are just too frightened to admit it. They may
claim that the SIB survey is flawed but they can hardly deny their own
policy conditions. They weave a tangled web. It is time it was stopped.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: Questions Occupational Pensions Board should address
on AGB funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A H J MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is difficult to question the decision ('Four Maxwell pension funds
to close', January 28) of the trustee to wind up the four AGB pension funds,
without knowing far more of the figures. What is of concern, however, is the
complete lack of any reference to the employer's obligations, and the
apparent silence of the Occupational Pensions Board.
In most defined benefit plans, as it appears these were, the employees pay a
fixed percentage of salary, with the employer meeting the balance of the
cost. In recent years companies have benefited from the surpluses in their
funds by enjoying reduced, and in some cases nil, contributions. No doubt
the AGB group did so too.
The converse of this arrangement is that employers have to be the first to
stump up when the fund is in deficit. In the AGB case, the employer seems to
have a double obligation, because it was one of its appointed trustees who
was responsible for the disappearance of much of the assets.
Whatever the size of the hole left by the Maxwell depredations, what
arrangements were considered by the company to fund the deficit over a
period? Could reduced benefits and increased employee contributions have
played a part in saving at least a more modest scheme? Were the members even
consulted by their employer?
Surely these are questions the OPB should have been asking before the
decision to wind up was made, if its protective role means anything at all.

FT  01 FEB 92 / A new direction for Rumbelows: The high street retailer's
change of role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since he became chief executive of Thorn EMI five years ago, Mr Colin
Southgate has been steadily dismantling the empire built up by Sir Jules
Thorn, the group's immigrant founder.
Yesterday's announcement that the Rumbelows electrical retailing business is
to be converted into an appliance rental operation represents a further
retreat from the older, highly-diversified Thorn towards Mr Southgate's
vision of a company focusing on two primary businesses: music and the
renting out of appliances from television sets to washing machines.
In doing so, he is leaving a business in which Thorn had failed to make an
impact and seeking to capitalise on the group's leadership in the UK and
international appliance rental market. The move will also provide a
significant expansion in the market for consumer products rental.
Employees at Rumbelows, Thorn's electrical retailing chain, have had to live
for at least three years with the knowledge that Mr Southgate was desperate
to sell the business. Yesterday he acknowledged that he was unlikely to find
a buyer and finally decided to act.
Mr Southgate had previously sold Ferguson, the last significant UK-owned
maker of television sets, to Thomson of France in 1987. After a protracted
search for a buyer, Thorn's light manufacturing division, the Austrian-born
Sir Jules's first business, was sold to General Electric of the US in 1990.
Rumbelows, according to Mr Southgate, was made up of 'about 45 businesses
that Jules acquired in many different ways. Some came to him as payments for
debts'. Rumbelows has found it impossible to compete with larger rivals such
as Comet, Dixons and Currys. Competition is likely to intensify as regional
electricity companies expand their retailing interests.
With Rumbelows accounting for only 6 per cent of the UK market and with
losses of Pounds 16m last year, Mr Southgate yesterday declared: 'Enough's
enough, really.'
Rumbelows' head office in Waltham Cross will close, along with the company's
service organisation. Existing Rumbelow service contracts will be fulfilled
by employees of the Thorn rental business. Initially, 800 Rumbelows jobs
will go from a workforce of 4,000.
Mr Southgate believes he will have little trouble selling Rumbelows' 45
out-of-town sites. He says fax messages from interested buyers started
arriving yesterday morning. The remaining 450 shops high street shops will
be reduced to 250 over the next two years.
The remaining business will still be called Rumbelows for the time being,
but Thorn plans to turn them into rental outlets. They will be different,
however, from the existing 1,000 rental outlets which trade under the Radio
Rentals, Multibroadcast and DER names.
The Rumbelows operation will offer customers an eventual right to buy
appliances - something not available at the existing UK outlets but common
in the 19 other countries in which Thorn has rental businesses. Rumbelows
will also be slightly more down-market than the other UK rental shops and
will, for example, rent out used equipment.
Rental is big business for Thorn, accounting for 27.5 per cent of 1991
turnover of Pounds 3.7bn. Although rental profits fell from Pounds 185.6m in
1990 to Pounds 138m last year, the division remained Thorn's biggest earner.
In the UK alone, Thorn currently has 3.5m pieces of equipment out on rent.
Rental, Mr Southgate says, appeals to different types of people in the
different regions in which Thorn operates. In the US, where Thorn has 1,000
Rent-a-Center outlets, rental is more of a blue collar habit than in Europe.
In northern Europe, Thorn's rental customers tend to be young couples with
children. They want expensive television sets or washing machines but cannot
afford to buy them outright.
In the UK, almost all Thorn's rental business is of consumer electronic
rather than kitchen appliances. UK rental appeals to a wide range of
customers from impecunious students to pensioners. The latter are often
afraid of appliances breaking down or of not being able to operate them and
like the quick service visits available from rental companies.
The biggest boost to appliance rental in the UK, however, is the appearance
of new technologies, particularly if there are rival standards. When the
video cassette recorder first appeared, many consumers sensibly rented VCRs
rather than buying them until the standards showdown between VHS and Betamax
had been settled.
Thorn had hoped that the satellite television battle between Sky Television
and British Sky Broadcasting - using different, incompatible systems - would
result in a similar rental bonanza. The merger of the two organisations into
British Sky Broadcasting, using the Sky standard, meant that viewers were
less afraid to buy their equipment.
Mr Southgate concedes that there are no new technologies in the offing that
might tempt confused consumers to rent rather than buy, although he has some
hopes for wide-screen and high definition television.
Although some consumers might consider renting a better alternative to
buying during a recession, the drop in Thorn's rental profits last year
demonstrates that the business is not immune to a downturn.
Thorn's experience is that during a recession customers tend to hold on to
the appliance they have rather than returning it and renting a more
expensive and up-to-date one. In the US last year, recession-hit retailers
cut the sales price of electrical goods, damaging rental income.
Nevertheless, the US side of the business produced a 25 per cent increase in
dollar profit.
As the world's largest rental company, Thorn is more confident of its
ability to compete in this sector than in the cut-throat world of electrical
retailing. The City approved of the decision to get out of electrical
retailing, boosting Thorn's shares by 15p yesterday to 841p.
Whether Mr Southgate has been successful in building a healthy and viable
company to replace the group that Sir Jules Thorn built will require longer
consideration. Mr Southgate contends that many of the original Thorn
businesses were too small and UK-based to compete internationally.
Had he been able to turn companies such as Ferguson into world beaters, he
would have been regarded as one of the UK's most successful industrialists.
That he sold the companies instead is not necessarily to his discredit.
Thomson has suffered heavy losses with Ferguson and has closed all its UK
research and manufacturing facilities.
Someone else might have made a success of Thorn's electrical retailing. But
the fact that no one wanted to buy Rumbelows probably speaks for itself.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: Only the fit can travel by train
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN PETERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins must be a fit, lithe young man to imply that a train is
a treat to travel on ('When fare is not fair', January 29).
I am a retired doctor and occasionally go to Romilly in Cheshire, near
Stockport. The thought of travelling by train is a nightmare.
I phone for a taxi to the station - time to arrive unspecified. I have to
carry two relatively light suitcases to the taxi and then to the station
(which was built recently but could have been constructed in the last
century). I queue to obtain a ticket, then climb two flights of stairs, to
be presented by the pride of British Rail - the Southend to Fenchurch Street
line.
On arrival at Fenchurch Street, I am presented with a nice choice: a taxi to
Euston, which is slow and expensive, or a walk to the Tower tube station. I
battle my way on the Underground to Euston. Then to Manchester at high
speed. Then what? I am, I hope, met at the station. If not, I am faced with
another difficult journey.
Compare this with travelling by car and enjoying power-assisted steering,
automatic transmission, radio and tapes. By car, I can be in Romilly in less
than four hours. Pull the other one Mr Tomkins. I simply am not fit enough
to travel by rail.

<TEXT>
Sir, As a Briton permanently resident in the US I found Christopher
Dunkley's review of the 40 Minutes documentary 'Wild Man Gatherings'
especially amusing ('A contrast of cultures' - Television, January 29).
However, the implied suggestion that these absurd male bonding rituals are
widely practised among Americans is quite wrong. 'Wild Man Gatherings' are
in fact widely ridiculed by Americans, who are perfectly capable of
identifying bogus cant when they hear it. Unlike Mr Dunkley I find that very
few Americans make me cringe, but the smug superiority of my fellow
countrymen all too often does.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Superpowers move the winning post: The arms race may have
gone into reverse, but more nations think they need a nuclear deterrent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nuclear arms race, as we knew it, between the superpowers is no more. In
fact, it has gone into reverse. This renders obsolete the process of arms
control as we knew it, since that was concerned essentially with regulating
the arms race.
Arms control started from the assumption that there were two superpowers,
mutually hostile and suspicious, whose only common interest lay in avoiding
the destruction or irremediable pollution of the planet on which both were
obliged, until further notice, to live.
Only in 1987, with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, did arms
control produce an agreement requiring the actual destruction of existing
weapons: in fact, of an entire category of missiles. What made that possible
was the discovery made by the Soviet Union, when it found the arms race
running beyond what its economy could sustain, that security is not a
zero-sum game. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev recognised that the Soviet Union's
security problems were at least partly of its own making, since its military
preparations had made Nato countries feel insecure and prompted them to
respond in kind.
This discovery reversed the assumption which drives all arms races, namely
that whatever one side does to increase its own security makes it easier for
it to contemplate an attack on the other. Followed to its logical
conclusion, Mr Gorbachev's discovery makes arms control unnecessary: if each
side realises that it can best enhance its own security by dismantling those
weapons which most threaten the other, then it will do so without having to
be constrained by detailed agreements. All it needs is a general conviction
that the other side has got the message and is behaving similarly. In the
end the very concept of 'sides' becomes irrelevant.
That is precisely what is now happening. The upward spiral in nuclear
weapons has been replaced by a downward one. It has not yet gone down to the
point where smaller nuclear powers like the UK and France are obliged to
join in. Their forces, as Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted after a
tutorial on the subject at 10 Downing Street on Thursday, are still 'not
comparable' with those of the superpowers.
But Mr Yeltsin was perhaps too generous in adding that 'therefore the matter
is not really worth any discussion'. There is already discussion in
Washington, no longer regarded as purely academic, about the floor level at
which US nuclear weapons should ultimately be stabilised. In this discussion
it is assumed that Russia is now willing to match any cuts that the US
decides on. Therefore the size of other countries' forces become a relevant
consideration.
One school of thought holds that the US should not allow its arsenal to fall
below 5,000 warheads, on the grounds that it must, in order to maintain its
superpower status, have a larger number than Britain, France and China
combined.
Every nuclear power is obliged to rethink its position in this new strategic
context. What does it have nuclear weapons for? How many does it need, and
of what type? How many nuclear powers will there be, and what kind of threat
will they pose?
Probably no political or military leader, since General Douglas MacArthur in
the Korean war, has wanted actually to fire nuclear weapons at an enemy.
Their usefulness, if any, is as a deterrent. The 'war-fighting strategies'
which caused so much alarm in the early 1980s were not expressions of desire
or intent. They were contingency plans, designed to make nuclear deterrence
more credible - the theory being that the adversary will not be deterred
unless he believes the danger of nuclear retaliation is real; that he will
not believe so unless the putative retaliator has a credible plan of
retaliation; and that no such plan is credible unless it provides for the
survival, in some shape or form, of the society on whose behalf it is made.
Even Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is unlikely to have been developing
nuclear weapons with a positive determination to use them. It is now known
that, in the late 1970s, he took trouble to procure and study the writings
of General Andre Gallois, theoretician of France's nuclear force de frappe.
The essence of General Gallois's theory is that possession of nuclear
weapons enables a state to make its national territory an invulnerable
'sanctuary', which no one will dare to attack. Mr Saddam probably hoped to
achieve this for Iraq, thereby enabling him to wage conventional war against
his neighbours at relatively low risk. It is fortunate for those neighbours
that in the end he found himself unable to wait until his nuclear umbrella
was in place before launching his attack on Kuwait.
The example of Saddam Hussein is useful because it illustrates both the
reasons why a state may wish to deploy nuclear weapons, even though it has
no desire to use them. It may want to deter an attack on its own territory
by superior conventional forces; or it may want to counteract the advantage
gained by another state which has nuclear weapons. Whatever Mr Saddam's real
intentions, his public justification for having a nuclear programme - a
valid one in the eyes of the Arab public - is that Israel should not be
allowed a nuclear monopoly in the Middle East.
Again, this does not mean that Arabs generally believe Israel would use
nuclear weapons against them for the fun of it, so to speak. No matter how
callous one imagines the Israelis could be, it is clear that they could
expect no positive benefit from nuclear war. But the fact that Israel is
universally believed (despite its occasional pro forma denials) to have
nuclear weapons does put it at an advantage vis-a-vis the Arabs in
conventional war, and hence also in diplomacy. Israelis would see that as
necessary to ensure their survival, given Arab numerical superiority. But
Arabs see it as enabling Israel to humiliate them, notably by holding on to
occupied territory, with impunity. No state likes to be at that kind of
disadvantage in a dispute with its neighbour.
Now consider the case of western Europe. The historic justification for
having nuclear weapons there has been the need to deter an attack by
superior conventional forces, specifically those of the Soviet Union. This
applied to Nato, and also to France's independent strike force.
Nato's 'flexible response' doctrine meant, in essence, that it sought always
to maintain a credible option of nuclear retaliation if its conventional
forces seemed about to be overfore Nato always firmly rejected suggestions
that it should make any kind of pledge, even a reciprocal one, not to be the
first to use nuclear weapons, replying simply that it would not be the
aggressor. France disliked 'flexible response', not because it implied being
the first to use nuclear weapons but, on the contrary, because it implied
that a nuclear war might be survivable.
While Nato strategy sought to make the nuclear deterrent more credible by
limiting its initial impact, French strategy sought to make it more awesome
by stressing its apocalyptic character. It was based on a simple syllogism:
nuclear war is unthinkable; any war in Europe will be a nuclear one; ergo,
war in Europe is unthinkable. Thus French literature on the subject tends
almost to deify nuclear weapons as a phenomenon which has saved Europe from
the demons of war which so ravaged it in the past.
That was broadly also the view of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, although less
dithyrambically expressed. The Americans were always more ambivalent on the
subject, since for them the proposition that Armageddon was worth risking to
avoid conventional defeat in Europe had less obvious attractions. A
non-nuclear world was one they could more comfortably contemplate. Indeed,
President Ronald Reagan proclaimed it as his objective when he launched his
Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), and came close to agreeing on it with Mr
Gorbachev at Reykjavik in 1986.
Now that the Soviet Union has disintegrated, and the fear of Russian
conventional forces overrunning western Europe has vanished, it has become
much harder for Nato to justify retaining an option to use nuclear weapons
first. Nato's New Strategic Concept, published at last November's Rome
summit, does still assert that nuclear weapons 'demonstrate that aggression
of any kind is not a rational option', and that they are therefore
'essential to preserve peace'. But those words were included at French, and
to a lesser extent British, insistence. UK politicians, unlike the French,
have tended to explain their national deterrent as a necessary response to
the existence of other nuclear powers, rather than as something good in
itself.
In the post-Cold War world, superior conventional force is no longer the
main threat that west Europeans have to worry about. But it may still be the
main threat for Israel; for some of the ex-Soviet republics, such as Armenia
(which may fear invasion from Turkey), or Kazakhstan and Ukraine (whose
fears are directed at Russia); and for any number of third world states. The
temptation for these states to emulate France, hoping that nuclear weapons
will make their national territory invulnerable, is likely to be strong
whether or not they themselves harbour any aggressive intent towards their
neighbours.
For Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine - republics on whose territory parts of
the Soviet strategic arsenal are located - this question is an immediate
one. Belarus and Ukraine, traumatised by the Chernobyl disaster, seem for
the moment eager to do without their own nuclear deterrent: they have
committed themselves to signing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
as non-nuclear weapons states. But that position could change if the fragile
Commonwealth of Independent States, with its cumbersome arrangement for
joint control of strategic forces, falls apart. Kazakhstan in any case is
taking a more cautious line. Its leaders have talked of retaining strategic
weapons on their territory until the year 2000.
Meanwhile, thousands of ex-Soviet nuclear technicians are reputedly looking
for jobs abroad, and it is almost inevitable that some of them will end up
in the service of would-be nuclear powers in the third world.
It is this process of nuclear proliferation, rather than any conventional
threat, which is now most worrying for Nato countries. France implicitly
recognised that when it agreed to sign the NPT last year, reversing a long-
held national position. Doing so does not require France to renounce its own
nuclear deterrent, since it is one of the five states which qualify as
nuclear weapons states under the treaty, having exploded a nuclear device
before January 1 1967.
But there is an apparent contradiction between the logic of the NPT and the
French, or indeed the Nato, doctrine, that nuclear weapons are essential to
deter aggression and preserve peace. Why, the would-be proliferator can
reasonably ask, do some states require their own national deterrent for
these purposes, while others are expected either to seek a nuclear guarantee
from their allies or (if that is not available, or comes at an unacceptable
political price) simply to rely on some vague notion of collective security
and 'new world order'.
As they seek to maintain and strengthen the NPT (which comes up for renewal
in 1995) and to persuade new states to adhere to it, the five recognised
nuclear weapons states are likely to find that question more and more
difficult to elude.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Car trade warned of risk posed by thefts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOLEN cars are being offered for sale to the motor trade in such volumes as
to present a risk to the viability of dealers who buy them inadvertently,
according to HPI, the credit information agency.
In the final quarter of last year 6,900 such cars were offered to traders,
more than three times the level of a year previously, HPI's statistics show.
The agency believes those figures considerably understate the extent of the
activity because its statistics include only those cars offered to traders.
They take no account of individuals who may have bought such cars privately.
HPI describes the volume of car thefts as having reached 'epidemic'
proportions.
In last year's final quarter, one out of every 103 dealer inquiries about
cars offered for sale resulted in the car being established as stolen. A
'security alert', indicating that a car was probably being offered for sale
without the owner's consent, was issued for one in every 406 inquiries made
in last year's final quarter - more than double the rate of the
corresponding 1990 period.
A quarter of cars inquired about were shown as being subject to a finance
agreement. HPI emphasised that cars subject to such agreements remained the
property of the finance house concerned.

MORE THAN Pounds 50m of investment in private housing, offices and small
industrial plants is expected to be created on the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival
site after the event closes in October.
The Prince of Wales, who is to open the festival on May 5, will be
associated with the development through the creation of an urban village.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said yesterday that the project should
create 1,100 jobs in the south Wales valley, an unemployment blackspot since
steelmaking ended in the 1980s.
Ebbw Vale will be the last festival, following those held at Liverpool's

FT  01 FEB 92 / Appeal on County Hall plan rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN APPEAL against the government's decision to approve the conversion of
London's County Hall into a hotel, residential and conference complex was
rejected in the High Court yesterday, John Willman writes.
The appeal was lodged by Lambeth Borough Council in an attempt to oppose the
change of use of County Hall, which formerly housed the Greater London
Council, now abolished.
Lambeth argued that Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, was
under a duty to preserve the Grade II listed building in its historic
local-government role.
Mr Justice Pill said there was nothing unreasonable about the stance taken
by Mr Heseltine and he ordered Lambeth to pay the costs of the secretary of
state, the London Residuary Body which proposed the development and the
County Hall Development Group, the Anglo-Japanese consortium which is in
liquidation.
The next step in the battle remained unclear last night. A planning
application to move the London School of Economics into County Hall is due
to be heard on February 19.
The council has 21 days to appeal against the High Court decision. An appeal
would almost certainly postpone a final decision until after the general
election. If Labour wins the election it may make County Hall the
headquarters of its planned Greater London Authority.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Gould attacks poll-tax policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is intentionally jeopardising the ability of local
authorities to collect unpaid poll tax for short-term political advantage,
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, said yesterday.
In a fierce attack on Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, he
said the government's refusal to negotiate swift legislation to close the
legal loophole over computer-based evidence on those who had not paid poll
tax was a 'dereliction of duty'.
Labour has offered to help through a short bill to remedy the legal
difficulty. Yesterday Mr Gould received a letter from Mr Heseltine rejecting
the offer and saying the matter would be resolved in a new clause in the
council tax bill.
Mr Gould said Mr Heseltine, the 'most ruthless and unprincipled' politician,
had made his decision in order to blame Labour for surcharges that were
certain to be added to poll tax bills for the additional costs incurred by
non-payment or delayed payments.
He said figures released recently by the Chartered Institute for Public
Finance and Accountancy confirmed Labour's claims that final poll tax bills
for 1992-93 would near Pounds 300 and not the Pounds 257 originally claimed
by the government.
He added that the institute had confirmed that there was no truth in Tory
claims that Labour authorities would have higher surcharges than Tory
councils.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, yesterday charged that
Labour's plans to free councils from poll tax capping would provoke huge
rises in charges, with Sheffield planning a 40 per cent increase.

FT  01 FEB 92 / World leaders optimistic on future: UN declaration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is an edited version of the final declaration approved by 15
world leaders at the first-ever Security Council summit yesterday:
The members of the Security Council consider that their meeting is a timely
recognition of the fact that there are new, favourable international
circumstances under which the Security Council has begun to fulfil more
effectively its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security.
Time of change
This meeting takes place at a time of momentous change. The ending of the
Cold War has raised hopes for a safer, more equitable and more humane world.
Last year, under the authority of the United Nations, the international
community succeeded in enabling Kuwait to regain its sovereignty and
territorial integrity, which it had lost as a result of Iraqi aggression.
The resolutions adopted by the Security Council remain essential to the
restoration of peace and stability in the region and must be fully
implemented. At the same time the members of the Council are concerned by
the humanitarian situation of the innocent civilian population of Iraq.
Members of the Council support the Middle East peace process, facilitated by
the Russian Federation and the United States, and hope it will be brought to
a successful conclusion on the basis of Council Resolutions 242 (1967) and
338 (1973).
The members of the Council note that United Nations peace-keeping tasks have
increased and broadened considerably in recent years. Election monitoring,
human rights verification and the repatriation of refugees have in the
settlement of some regional conflicts, at the request or with the agreement
of the parties concerned, been integral parts of the Security Council's
effort to maintain international peace and security. They welcome these
developments.
The members of the Council also recognise that change, however welcome, has
brought new risks for stability and security.
The international community therefore faces new challenges in the search for
peace. All member states expect the United Nations to play a central role at
this crucial stage. The members of the Council stress the importance of
strengthening and improving the United Nations to increase its
effectiveness.
Commitment to collective security
The members of the Council pledge their commitment to international law and
to the United Nations Charter. All disputes between states should be
peacefully resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.
The members of the Council reaffirm their commitment to the collective
security system of the Charter to deal with threats to peace and to reverse
acts of aggression.
The members of the Council express their deep concern over acts of
international terrorism and emphasise the need for the international
community to deal effectively with all such acts.
Peace-making and peace-keeping
To strengthen the effectiveness of these commitments .. the members of the
Council have decided on the following approach.
They invite the secretary-general to prepare, for circulation to the members
of the United Nations by 1 July 1992, his analysis and recommendations on
ways of strengthening and making more efficient within the framework and
provision of the charter the capacity of the United Nations for preventive
diplomacy, for peacemaking and for peace-keeping.
Secretary-general's analysis and recommendations could cover the role of the
United Nations in identifying potential crises and areas of instability as
well as the contribution to be made by regional organisations in accordance
with Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter in helping the work of the
Council. They could also cover the need for adequate resources, both
material and financial. The secretary-general might draw on lessons learned
in recent United Nations peace-keeping missions to recommend ways of making
more effective Secretariat planning and operations. He could also consider
how greater use might be made of his good offices, and of his other
functions under the United Nations Charter.
Disarmament, arms control and weapons of mass destruction
The members of the Council underline the need for all member states to
fulfil their obligations in relation to arms control and disarmament; to
prevent the proliferation in all its aspects of all weapons of mass
destruction; to avoid excessive and destabilising accumulations and
transfers of arms; and to resolve peacefully in accordance with the Charter
any problems concerning these matters threatening or disrupting the
maintenance of regional and global stability. They emphasise the importance
of the early ratification and implementation by States concerned of all
international and regional arms control arrangements, especially the START
and CFE Treaties.
The proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to
international peace and security. The members of the Council commit
themselves to working to prevent the spread of technology related to the
research for or production of such weapons and to take appropriate action to
that end.
On nuclear proliferation, they note the importance of the decision of many
countries to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and emphasise the
integral role in the implementation of that Treaty of fully effective IAEA
safeguards, as well as the importance of effective exports controls. The
members of the Council will take appropriate measures in the case of any
violations notified to them by the IAEA.
On chemical weapons, they support the efforts of the Geneva Conference with
a view to reaching agreement on the conclusion, by the end of 1992, of a
universal convention, including a verification regime, to prohibit chemical
weapons.
On conventional armaments, they note the General Assembly's vote in favour
of a United Nations register of arms transfers as a first step, and in this
connection recognise the importance of all states providing all the
information called for in the General Assembly's resolution.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the members of the Security Council affirm their
determination to build on the initiative of their meeting in order to secure
positive advances in promoting international peace and security. They agree
that the United Nations secretary-general has a crucial role to play. They
welcome the new secretary-general, His Excellency Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
and note with satisfaction his intention to strengthen and improve the
functioning of the United Nations. They pledge their full support to him.
The members of the Council agree that the world now has the best chance of
achieving international peace and security since the foundation of the
United Nations.

<TEXT>
THE Serb-dominated Yugoslav state presidency yesterday summoned Serb leaders
from Croatia for a crisis meeting in Belgrade to try to persuade them to
accept a United Nations plan to deploy 10,000 peacekeepers.
At the same time, Mr Borisav Jovic, Serbia's representative to the state
presidency, accused Croatia of blocking the UN initiative, raising fears
that the ceasefire would collapse.
In an interview on Belgrade television, Mr Jovic said despite opposition
from Mr Milan Babic, leader of Krajina, a Serb-stronghold in southern
Croatia, 'the greatest obstacle in my opinion is still the non-acceptance of
Croatia.'
The closed-door session of the Serb-controlled presidency was attended by Mr
Babic and Mr Goran Hadzic, a Serb leader from eastern Croatia, General
Blagoje Adzic, the acting federal defence minister, Mr Slobodan Milosevic,
the president of Serbia, Serb leaders from Bosnia-Hercegovina, the central
republic and other top government officials.
A western diplomat said: 'The meeting shows the tremendous pressure being
exerted on Babic. They (Serbia's leaders) are trying to gain his approval.
But Babic keeps vetoing the plan.'
Mr Babic opposes the UN plan which calls for the federal army to withdraw
from Serb-populated regions of Croatia after the deployment of UN
peacekeepers. The army and Serb irregulars currently control one-third of
Croatia.
Western diplomats confirmed that the Croatian government was raising
objections to the duration of the peace-keepers' mandate, and over who
should control local police forces in the republic.
Croatia will accept, if necessary, the six-month mandate being extended to
one year. In addition, Croatia opposes the composition of the police forces,
which would be proportionally represented.
In practice, this would give the Serbs a majority control over the police
forces in heavily Serb-inhabited regions of Croatia, and fuel fears that
Croatia would not regain control over these territories.
Mr Stjepan Herceg, a senior member of the republic's ruling Croatian
Democratic Union, said: 'If Croatia did not succeed with the help of the UN
or through peaceful means, it would have to use armed force (to regain its
territory),' Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, reported.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin is expected to issue a decree setting out rules for
foreign investors to exploit Russian mineral wealth.
The decree will act as a substitute for long-awaited legislation on mineral
rights and allow foreigners to operate concessions - gaining ownership of up
to 50 per cent of the output of a given area.
It will seek to clear the way for rapid western investment to revive
Russia's flagging oil and gas industry, circumventing a delay of months
while bills make their way through parliament.
Meanwhile, Mr Viktor Danilov-Danilian, minister for ecology and natural
resources, brushed aside opposition to a deal with a US-Japanese consortium
for a feasibility study of oil and gas reserves off Sakhalin Island.
He said that Mr Valentin Fiodorov, the local governor, had no sound reason
to criticise the deal and suggested he would be sacked if he caused trouble.
Moscow and the three western companies - McDermott International, Marathon
Oil and Mitsui and Co - would decide later whether to exploit the reserves
through a joint venture, production-sharing or a concession.
The minister said that the consortium may still admit two of the defeated
parties in the tender - Mobil, of the US, and Japan's Sodeco.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Mollemann calls for G7 summit on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, called on Friday for a
summit of the Group of Seven (G7) rich industrial nations if long-running
talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to liberalise
world trade remained deadlocked.
'If necessary, we need in March or April a special summit of the G7 to
overcome the standstill,' he told business and political leaders attending
the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
In Geneva, a spokesman for Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, said
Mr Dunkel would welcome such a meeting to bring long-running trade talks to
a speedy close.
The crucial talks have been snarled by a row between the United States and
the European Community over agricultural reform. Mr Dunkel has set a
mid-April deadline for a Uruguay Round agreement.
Mr Peter Lilley, the British trade secretary, said it was too early to say
whether or not a summit of the G7 heads of government was needed to bring
about a resolution of the deadlocked Uruguay Round trade talks.
'We need a demonstration of leadership from G7 leaders and a reduction in
special interests, especially on the agricultural issue.' Mr Mollemann said:
'We cannot leave it to negotiators of the second rank.'
Mr Mollemann was supported by Mr Bill Bradley, a New Jersey senator known
for his advocacy of free trade.
Mr Lilley sparred briefly with an official of the French motor group Peugeot
over allowing Japanese cars free entry into the European market.
Mr Tristan d'Albis, an adviser to Peugeot chairman Jacques Calvet, argued
that it was difficult to worship the religion of free trade in the motor
industry when Japan had built up its powerful companies behind a wall of
protection.
Mr Lilley replied that protectionism was not a significant factor in the
success of the Japanese car makers.

RUSSIA'S chief nuclear bomb scientist yesterday rejected western fears that
his experts could sell their skills abroad en masse but called for
international co-operation and higher pay to keep them contented.
In an unprecedented interview clearly timed to coincide with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's mission to the United Nations, Professor V.
Mikhailov revealed that 100,000 people produced atomic weapons in the former
Soviet Union.
The head of Russia's military nuclear programme said that 10,000-15,000 had
access to classified information, with 2,000-3,000 people holding vital
secrets.
While it was possible 'a few adventurists' could go abroad, Prof Mikhailov
said that the nuclear arsenal was built by 'patriots, responsible people.'
He complained that their monthly salaries of around Rbs1,200 (Pounds 6 at
the market rate) were 'not money' but said Russia did not need western help
to pay them more.
He also pointed out that legislation banning his people from leaving the
country for between five to 10 years was still in force - even though the
former Soviet Union's borders are no longer as tightly sealed as they were.
Regardless of financial problems, Russia would have to find the money to
dismantle excess nuclear weapons 'if we don't want to turn the country into
one big Chernobyl.'

<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN leaders yesterday called for the sacking of the Black Sea fleet's
pro-Russian commander, Admiral Igor Kasatonov, raising the tempo of their
conflict with Moscow over control of the fleet.
At a press conference yesterday, Mr Vitold Fokind, the Ukrainian prime
minister, said that the conflict over the Black Sea fleet could not be
resolved until the commander was replaced.
Ukrainian television and radio reported that Ukrainian President Leonid
Kravchuk sent telegrams to Commonwealth military leaders demanding that
Admiral Kasatonov be sacked.
Admiral Kasatonov is an ethnic Russian who took the helm of the Black Sea
fleet after the attempted putsch last summer. He makes a point of taking
orders only from Moscow, going so far as to refuse to meet with Ukrainian
MPs this week.
The Ukrainian move could provoke an angry reaction from Moscow, whose
interest in the fleet was underscored by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
unscheduled visit to Novo-Rossysk, Russia's Black Sea port, earlier this
week.
The controversy over the Black Sea fleet, which flared up earlier this month
when Ukraine asked seamen to swear an oath of allegiance, has being hotly
debated. Both sides agree that Ukraine should take the non-strategic ships
and that the strategic forces should go to the Commonwealth, but the
definition of strategic is fiercely contested.
Many believe the struggle for the fleet is in fact a struggle for the
coveted Crimean peninsula.
Mr Fokind also said yesterday that the Russian takeover of Vnesheconombank,
the former Soviet foreign trade bank, earlier this month prompted his
declaration that Ukraine will pay its 16.37 per cent share of the Soviet
Union's foreign debt independently.
Mr Fokind said he believes the west is backing away from its insistence that
Ukraine pay its debt 'jointly and severally' with other republics. Germany
has taken the hardest line but Mr Fokind said he hoped Mr Kravchuk will
persuade Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the Ukrainian position when the two meet
on Monday.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA demanded a 40 per cent reduction in its bank debt, in New York on
Thursday, in its first formal encounter in New York with commercial
creditors on restructuring of its Dollars 39bn (Pounds 21.5bn) foreign debt
through the Brady debt reduction mechanism.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, offered the banks a range of options
to reshape the debt. He came to the talks strengthened by firm backing for
his policies from the International Monetary Fund and the US government.
Argentina owes banks Dollars 31bn in debt principal, plus a further Dollars
8bn in interest arrears. At present, it pays banks Dollars 60m in token
interest payments.
Mr Cavallo offered the banks the following options:
Reduce principal by 40 per cent by replacing debt with 30-year discount
bonds. The principal would be guaranteed by US Treasury zero-coupon bonds.
These bonds would pay interest linked to Libor plus 0.8 per cent, rising by
up to half a percentage point every six months, until reaching a ceiling of
9 per cent a year.
Cut interest in half by swapping debt for 30-year par bonds that pay
half-Libor plus 0.8 per cent. Interest would be adjusted in the same way as
the discount bonds and principal backed by US bonds.
Refinance the Dollars 8bn in interest arrears with 15-year bonds with a six
years' grace period, bearing 4.5 per cent annual interest. This would allow
immediate redemption of one-tenth of arrears. The bonds would be partially
backed by US Treasury bonds.
Offer banks Dollars 5bn-worth of 16-year par bonds convertible into equity
in privatised state companies. Interest will be equivalent to Libor.
Principal to be paid after six years' grace.
Some banks could take 25-year bonds that pay 2.5 per cent per year in fixed
interest, rising with time to 5.5 per cent. Banks can restructure existing
contracts rather than offering new bonds for old debt.
Mr Cavallo said his proposal would add an extra Dollars 380mn a year to the
Dollars 720m interest Argentina already pays, but would be a decisive step
towards normalising Argentina's economy.

FT  01 FEB 92 / OFT move throws ruling over pubs into confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by Britain's big brewers to reduce their estates of tied public
houses to comply with government orders were thrown into confusion yesterday
by the Office of Fair Trading.
The OFT said 734 pubs which the brewing group, Allied Lyons, was planning to
lease to Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group, would still be counted as
belonging to the tied estate.
Allied supplies beer to Brent Walker pubs under a separate contract.
Allied hoped the deal would help it meet the government requirement that it
should free 2,380 pubs from ties, or exclusive beer supply contracts.
The OFT has been reviewing a complex deal between the Allied and Brent
Walker.
The OFT's decision came as a shock to Brent Walker. It believed there were
no obstacles to the deal after the Department of Trade and Industry said in
the morning that it would not refer the transaction to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Brent Walker is in the process of trying to persuade its banks to reschedule
and restructure Pounds 1.5bn of debt.
A vital condition of the restructuring is the completion of the pub deal
with Allied.
However, Brent Walker's chief executive, Mr Ken Scobie, said he was
confident that the deal with Allied would still go ahead. 'The key condition
for us was that there should not be a reference to the MMC.'
He said there was a fall-back clause in the agreement with Allied which
would allow the deal to go ahead on different beer supply terms.
An adviser to Brent Walker said that this might involve changing the lease
terms, but that it would not change the overall financial attractions for
Brent Walker.
For a year, Brent Walker has been perilously poised between rescue and
receivership. Yesterday its banks agreed to a further extension, until the
end of February, of standstill on loan repayments.
A banker said that agreement from all 50 banks was not given until minutes
before yesterday's deadline.
The OFT's view of the pubs deal - supported by Treasury counsel - was that
Allied's continuing interest in the pub properties coupled with an
agreement.
Under the agreement, it would supply Brent Walker pubs with an estimated
250,000 barrels of beer a year for seven years effectively 'tied' the pubs
to the Allied estate.
Allied said last night that it wants to proceed with the deal but would be
seeking clarification of the OFT's views.
Its legal advice was that the leasing arrangement would free the 734 pubs
from the tie and would not infringe the beer orders, it said.
This would certainly involve either reducing the period or the amount of
beer supplies to Brent Walker - and thus reducing the value of the deal to
Allied.
Apart from the disposal of the pubs, the other main attraction for Allied
was the fact that supplying the enlarged Brent Walker estate of more than
1,800 pubs would lift its share of the UK beer market by up to 1 per cent.
Allied announced last month that it had agreed a similar deal, involving the
lease of 142 pubs and a supply of beers, to Burtonwood Brewery, the
north-west regional brewer.
The turn of events yesterday will also cast further doubt over the
government's response to its proposed merger of its brewing interests with
the UK operations of Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, in a Pounds 510m joint
venture, Carlsberg-Tetley.
That merger would give the combined group an 18-19 per cent share of the
beer market, putting it into third place close behind Bass and Courage.
Allied Lyons' shares rose 18p to 661p but fell back to close at 649p, a gain
of 6p. Brent Walker's shares closed 2p higher at 14p.

The days of the all-female Pounds 10 note are numbered. On April 29 Florence
Nightingale will abandon the Queen and Brittania to make way for Charles
Dickens.
The Bank of England said the Victorian novelist would appear on the back of
the redesigned note - smaller than the new pounds 20 note but slightly
bigger than the pounds 5.
There are only two conditions for gracing the back of a Bank of England bank
note - to have made a significant but uncontroversial contribution to
society, and to be dead.
The new pounds 10 will be the third in a string of note redesigns known as
series E. A smaller pounds 5 note was issued in June 1990 with George
Stephenson, the railways pioneer, ousting the Duke of Wellington from the
back. A year later it was the pounds 20 note, with William Shakespeare
giving way to Michael Faraday, the inventor.
A redesigned pounds 50 will be issued at the end of 1993, with Sir
Christopher Wren being replaced by the little-known Sir John Houblon, the
first governor of the Bank of England. His significant contribution might
not be as obvious as the Lady with the Lamp's but, as the Bank said
yesterday: 'At least he's dead.'
Illustrated in descending order are notes in circulation from 1795 to 1945;
1964 to 1979 and 1975 to date.
The new note will measure 7.5 cms by 14.2 cms, roughly the space taken by
this story.

TRADING in Footsie futures was volatile, with a squeeze in the closing
minutes of the session helping to lift the underlying cash market out of the
doldrums, writes Joel Kibazo.
There was little buying interest for the March contract early in the session
and it fell to the day's low of 2,561 by around 9am. Bargain hunters soon
caused a turnround in the contract but the buoyancy was curtailed by the
release of disappointing US statistics.
Nevertheless, a firm Wall Street and several buying orders late in the
session triggered a squeeze, sending March higher which helped to revive the
cash market.
March closed at 2,584, a premium to the index of 28, and 12 points above its
estimated fair value premium of 16. Turnover was 6,218 contracts.
In the traded options market, turnover surged to 32,791 contracts, above the
30,000 break-even level, and with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for 10,847
lots. BZW was reported to have done most of the day's trading in the index.
British Steel was the busiest stock option. It traded 3,254 contracts in
what dealers said was largely 'protection business'. This was followed by
Fisons with 1,828 contracts. Asda, Hillsdown and Glaxo were also busy.

FT  31 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rank up sharply on figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRIS PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE much-trumpeted adverse developments feared from Rank Organisation failed
to materialise yesterday when the full-year figures were announced. Profits,
earnings and debt all came comfortably within analysts' ranges, while the
dividend - the target of worries which depressed the shares last week - was
maintained.
A relieved market sent the shares up 45 to 640p, just above their level of
two weeks ago, in very heavy turnover of 4.6m.
Analysts remain divided over prospects for the leisure group. UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew is cautious, while County NatWest, a long-time bear of the stock, also
sees little prospect of recovery, advising a 'weak hold' until the dividend
is paid. Ms Lisa Gordon at County also warns: 'Rank will have to address the
problem of its debt, either through a rights issue or by disposals.'
Smith New Court, however, is more bullish, believing that 'the company's
credibility has been restored'. Kleinwort Benson is also positive. Mr Paul
Slattery said: '1993 will be Rank's year for growth, particularly through
its US operations.'
He is raising his pre-tax profits forecast for the coming year by Pounds 35m
to Pounds 285m, compared with Paribas' Pounds 305m, Smith's Pounds 282m,
UBS's Pounds 280m and County's Pounds 270m. For 1993, Kleinwort and Paribas
forecast Pounds 355m, Smith Pounds 345m, UBS Pounds 310m and County Pounds
305m.
Heavy BT trade
The two classes of BT stock between them easily topped the market's list of
active stocks after the telecoms group unveiled third-quarter profits below
those of the comparable period last year. The results were at the top end of
market expectations but were closely followed by publication of the
consultative document on BT tariffs by Oftel, the industry regulator.
At the close, BT 'old' shares were 4 up at 329p on volume of 8.8m, while the
'new' settled 2 firmer at 119p on big turnover of 27m. At their best
yesterday the two stocks touched 332p and 122p respectively.
Mr Robert Millington, telecoms specialist at BZW, the investment bank, said
the figures were the first manifestation of the tariff cuts instigated by
Oftel during the summer and the recession in the UK, and that the chances of
more big cuts are 'receding very quickly'.
He noted that return on capital employed had already fallen to 'more
acceptable levels'. Mr Christopher Tucker at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said the
Oftel document 'will help to dispel some of the wilder speculation about a
more aggressive price control regime'.
Reuters favoured
Interest in Reuters pushed the shares to Pounds 11 for the first time since
their plunge 18 months ago, when they had reacted to a second-half profits
warning.
The spur, yesterday, was a belief in the market that US securities house
Wertheim Schroder had put out a note reiterating the positive stance on the
stock which it first adopted in December.
There was also optimism over the trials for Reuters' much-vaunted automated
foreign exchange system, Dealing 2,000-2. The Professional Investor Report,
a US newswire service that concentrates on market speculation, labelled the
trials as 'impressive'. The shares were strong all day, reaching a mid-price
high of 1103p before closing 20 to the good at Pounds 11 with 1.6m dealt.
GEC wanted
GEC shares powered ahead to their best level since April 10 last year,
closing 6 1/2 higher at 209p. Turnover in the stock, noticeably heavier over
the past few sessions, expanded rapidly to top 14m yesterday.
Last week GEC-Alstom announced a Pounds 550m-plus contract and there were
suggestions in the market that more big orders could be on the way soon.
Dealers paid little notice to some wild stories of a break-up bid for GEC.
Dealers reported another burst of speculative buying in Premier Consolidated
Oilfields, the oil exploration group, which rose 1 1/2 to 28 1/2 p on keen
turnover of 3.5m. Monument Oil &amp; Gas, marginally ahead at 35 1/2 p, was
suggested as a potential predator.
Shell Transport, which figured prominently in the big programme trades
executed yesterday, lost 3 more to 481p on turnover of 5.4m, not helped by a
strong sell recommendation from Strauss Turnbull.
SG Warburg rose 8 to 563p after being included in the prestigious County-30
list of best buys.
County was also influential in hitting the insurance broking sector, which
it viewed as 'significantly overvalued'. Willis Corroon slipped 3 to 350p
and Sedgwick declined to 210p before bouncing to close 4 ahead at 218p.
There was another heavy trade (7.4m shares) in Guardian Royal Exchange,
where stakebuilding and takeover stories refused to die down. GRE settled 2
firmer at 136p.
Vodafone eased a shade to 346p after Hoare Govett published a note detailing
the increasing competition threat in the UK mobile radio market. Hoare
labelled Vodafone shares as 'overvalued'. A recent broker visit to Volex
resulted in some keen support for the stock, which moved up 6 to 295p.
Dealers felt that a UK television documentary on Hanson, shown on Wednesday
evening, had made little impact on the stock market. The shares, which had
fallen on the previous day on concern over what the programme might reveal,
bounced up 4 yesterday to 207p.
Recovery continued in Fisons, which gained 14 to 396p on heavy turnover of
7.2m, with some traders talking of a chart break-out. News on Tuesday that
the UK has relicensed all formulations of its Opticrom eye preparation
product, coupled with the persistence of bid talk, ensured firmness.
Glaxo fell 13 to 835p in a follow-through reaction to overnight US sales of
the pharmaceutical group's American Depositary Receipts. The shares were
later affected by fierce two-way trading in the US, where Merrill Lynch was
said to be offering stock and Salomon Brothers was said to be on the buy.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' climbed 14 to 963p and the Units were particularly
strong, jumping 130 to 4268p. Hoare Govett reinforced its positive stance on
the stock in a review of the sector published yesterday. The stock also
benefited from speculation that the company had made a research breakthrough
on an Aids drug. SmithKline later said there was no basis for the rumour.
Pharmaceuticals group Medeva rose sharply for the second day running
following a positive presentation to institutional investors by securities
house Strauss Turnbull. The shares added 15 at 279p.
Brewers weakened after Courage, part of the Australian-based Foster's
Brewing group, told analysts that it expected UK beer turnover to fall by 4
per cent this year and probably not show an upturn until 1993. The brewer
was also said to have voiced concern over the standard lager market. Bass,
which produces Carling Black Label and Tennents lagers, lost 3 to 544p.
The effect of a note by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew on Grand Metropolitan and its
pension fund was compounded by speculation that the company might launch a
bid for Pernod Ricard, of France, and the shares retreated 9 to 935p.
A buy recommendation from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken helped Lucas Industries to
appreciate 4 to 116p. Mr David Blackwood at Carr is predicting current-year
profits of Pounds 36m, with Pounds 80m for the following year.
Vickers hardened 5 to 176p as talk of interested parties for the company's
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary increased.
Aerospace and electronics concern ML Holdings dropped 10 to 43p after
reporting a first-half loss of Pounds 1.31m, compared with a Pounds 3.02m
profit a year earlier.
Food retailer Albert Fisher retreated 6 to 71p after several brokers reduced
profits forecasts for the company.

FT  31 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market deals boost equity business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL large trading programmes in blue chip equities helped the London
stock market yesterday and, after tracing an erratic pattern, the FT-SE
Index managed to close above the 2,550 mark again. The index benefited from
gains in a handful of constituent stocks, including Rank Organisation, which
rebounded strongly after the trading report dispelled last week's bearish
fantasies.
London turned firmer towards the close when Wall Street came in with a 9.6
Dow improvement in early deals, but the generally unconvincing response to
President George Bush's State of the Union Message continued to hang over
investors. The firmer trend in the dollar appeared to have only a marginal
effect on the international stocks.
On the domestic side, retail shares weakened as Marks and Spencer, one of
Britain's best-known high street names, was taken off the recommended buy
list of County NatWest, the London based investment bank.
UK equities opened sharply lower in the wake of Wall Street's fall of 47
points overnight but quickly rallied, helped by the first of at least four
trading programmes. The initial programme, relatively modest and limited to
non-Footsie stocks, was quickly followed by another, much larger, trading
operation by a leading brokerage house. Traders believed that the second
programme, which ranged through the Footsie list, was worth more than Pounds
360m.
However, the market failed at its first attempt to rescale the Footsie 2,550
level and lost a net six points as turnover faded for a time. Two further
trading programmes, said to be from UK securities houses, together with the
early improvement on Wall Street, provided renewed encouragement for London
in the final couple of hours of the trading session.
The best gains were not held and the final reading on the FT-SE Index of
2,550.8 left a rise of 4.3 on the day, compared with a 9.5 gain only 20
minutes earlier.
Dealers sounded relatively unenthusiastic at the close, in spite of the
brighter showing by share prices. Outside of the trading programmes,
investment interest was highly stock selective and often for very visible
reasons.
Seaq volume, boosted by the trading programmes, increased to 680.3m shares
from the 549.7m of the previous session; on Wednesday, retail business
remained just short of the Pounds 1bn mark, continuing the disappointingly
low level of genuine investment activity which has developed over the past
week.
Heavy trade in shares of BT followed a somewhat cautious trading statement
from the UK telephone and telecommunications group, which coincided with new
pricing proposals from Oftel, the industry regulator. The shares closed
firmly with at least one London broker regarding them as cheap.
The rise in Rank Organisation, which represented nearly one point of
yesterday's gain in the Footsie, implied a successful outcome to what can
now be identified as a bear raid on the stock during last week.
Among the pharmaceuticals, interest continued to turn away from Glaxo and to
focus on Fisons, where the market is convinced that a stakebuilder is at
work. ICI continued to drift lower as the stock market assessed the outlook
for the share price now that Hanson has ruled itself out as a bidder.

FT  31 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Good blue chip quarterly
results push Dow ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
GOOD quarterly results from a few big blue chip corporations lifted share
prices on US stock markets yesterday, as investors continued to digest the
implications of the new budget package and comments by the chairman of the
Federal Reserve about the state of the economy writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 19.90 firmer at 3,244.86, its high
for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index improved
1.28 to 411.62, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks
advanced 5.06 to 621.37. New York Stock Exchange turnover amounted to 195m
shares.
The sharp fall in prices on Wednesday was triggered by hints from Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that because the economy was steadily
recovering it was unlikely that fresh interest rate cuts would be needed to
stimulate growth. Mr Greenspan did say, however, that policy would be eased
if economic indicators suggested that further stimulus was required, and in
light of yesterday's bad economic news - a bigger than expected fall in
December durable goods orders and a 24,000 rise in weekly jobless claims -
investors' hopes for more rate red-uctions were briefly revived.
Among individual issues, three Dow contituent stocks gained good ground on
positive fourth-quarter earnings reports. Coca-Cola jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to
Dollars 77 1/8 , Boeing Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 and McDonald's
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 44 1/4 .
Dow Chemical rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 in spite of news of a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 92m, incurred because of a one-off Dollars
370m charge to cover asset write-offs and write-downs related to a recent
retrenchment in the company's operations. Investors were cheered by the
company's forecast of a return to profitability in 1992.
Airline issues were in the news. UAL forged ahead Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars
144 1/2 after the company, as it had warned, announced its biggest ever
quarterly loss, a Dollars 10.69 a share deficit for the final three months
of 1991. UAL also revealed a Dollars 130m charge and plans to cut capital
spending by Dollars 2bn over the next three years.
Kellogg advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 on news that Merrill Lynch,
the big broking house, had upgraded its long-term investment rating for the
food company's stock to 'very attractive', citing strong volume and margin
prospects. The recovery in Kellogg follows the sale on Wednesday by a
Boston-based money manager of his entire 1.1m-share stake.
On the over-the-counter market, Immunex jumped Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 62
after entering an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (up Dollars 5/8 at
Dollars 80 3/8 ) to develop and market cancer therapeutics.
Canada
TORONTO finished on a modestly firmer note after fairly heavy trading. The
composite index gained 7.2 at 3,605.8, while rises exceeded declines by 316
to 245 after volume of 31.2m shares.
Canadian Turbo, up 65 cents at CDollars 3.30, said it has signed a letter of
intent with private concern Pay Less Holdings under which Pay Less would buy
most of Turbo's common shares for CDollars 3.96 apiece.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rebounds on rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar rebounded on the foreign exchange markets yesterday in spite of a
further batch of poor economic figures, recovering as buyers stepped in the
ground lost on Wednesday, writes Simon London.
During late trading in New York on Wednesday and overnight in the Far East,
the dollar regained the losses seen in Europe. The US currency rallied to a
high of DM1.6103 and Y125.95 in Tokyo, above the New York closing levels of
DM1.6020 and Y125.75.
Analysts pointed to statements by Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve
chairman, which were interpreted as meaning that another cut in interest
rates is unlikely.
The new optimism over rates inspired by Mr Greenspan's comments was briefly
dispelled by the release of economic indicators underlining the weakness of
the US economy.
Durable goods orders during December were down a full 5 per cent on the
previous month, following a 1 per cent rise in November. Excluding defence
contracts, the position was worse still, with orders down 8.9 per cent on
the month.
Further gloom came from jobless claims figures for the week ended January
18, which showed a rise to 464,000 from the previous week's 440,000.
The US currency dipped to a low of DM1.5975 shortly after the figures were
released, but met with support at this level as buyers came into the market
and traders moved to cover short positions.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6210, up a full three pfennigs from
Wednesday's close of DM1.5900. It eased in New York to end at DM1.6163.
Against the yen, the US unit was more stable, with the threat of
intervention by the US and Japanese authorities capping it below Y126 for
most of the day. The dollar closed at Y126.00 in London, having traded in a
Y125.20 to Y126.00 range through the day. It dipped in New York to Y125.80.
The D-Mark lost ground against the yen as well as the dollar, closing at
Y77.75, from Y78.95 on Wednesday, and losing most of the gains made this
week. Analysts said sentiment was weak ahead of today's announcement of the
result of a strike ballot by steel workers.
Against this, Mr Johan Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank board member, echoed
statements from other central bank officials this week by saying that it was
too early to expect a cut in German interest rates.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the peseta remained the
strongest currency and advanced against the D-Mark, breaking decisively
through the Pta63.00 barrier. The Spanish currency closed the day at
Pta62.88 against the German unit.
This pushed sterling's floor within the system, determined by its maximum
permitted divergence from the strongest currency, close to DM2.8700. The UK
currency responded with a firm tone, trading over DM2.8750 for most of the
day and closing in London at DM2.8775, from DM2.8725 on Wednesday.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK market tighter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK money market faced a substantial liquidity shortage yesterday
following easier conditions earlier this week, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 950m early in
the session, revised up to Pounds 1.1m later. The main factor was maturing
treasury bills and assistance, draining Pounds 758m from the market.
Exchequer transactions resulted in a small net addition of funds,
underlining that the tax payments which drained funds earlier in the month
have now subsided.
Faced with a larger shortage than in recent days, market participants moved
early for funding and the Bank of England was able to inject Pounds 668m in
early assistance.
This was mostly made up of Pounds 650m paper purchased for resale to the
market on February 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent. This added to the Pounds
1.2bn paper already due for repurchase on these dates, storing up the
potential for tight market conditions around the middle of next month.
Afternoon assistance comprised the purchase of Pounds 40m band 1 and band 2
bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance was Pounds 210m, bringing the
total liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 918m, around Pounds 200m
less than the forecast shortage.
The unsecured overnight money rate was steady at below 11 per cent for most
of the day, climbing slightly above this level in the early afternoon before
settling back to close at 10- 9/16 per cent.
Longer rates were little changed. Three months interbank funds traded at 10
3/4 - 5/8 per cent, just up on the 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent seen on Wednesday;
one month interbank money was 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange closed down on the day at 89.73, implying base lending
rates of 10.27 per cent by the spring.
In Frankfurt, call money rates moved higher again, continuing the trend
which has prevailed all week. Call money traded up to 9.65/75 per cent, from
9.60/70 per cent on Wednesday.
Analysts said that the squeeze was due to financial institutions moving to
bolster reserves to meet month-end requirements.
Borrowings by financial institutions at the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent,
the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate, rose to DM2.1bn, from DM700m on
Tuesday.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK group wins contract to value
Peruvian mining giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH-based firm, International Mining Consultants, has won the contract
for valuation of Peru's giant state-owned mining and refining company,
Centromin. Valuation, scheduled to take four months, is due to start 'in the
first days of February', according to a Centromin spokesman.
Peruvian mines minister Mr Jaime Yoshiyama confirmed earlier this week that
privatisation in his sector will be under way by August. The seven Centromin
production units and the huge smelter and refinery complex at La Oroya
should have a price tag by early June.
To win the international tender, IMC has formed an association with a small,
but well -established local engineering consultancy, Gerenpro (Gerencia de
Proyectos). The contract was signed on 31 December for 'a sum in excess of
Dollars 600,000', according to Centromin. Only a handful of financing
documents and the arrival of key personnel are delaying the start of the
valuation.
International Mining Consultants is jointly owned by British Coal and
Intercontinental Fuels. It was set up three years ago as a holding company
for a group of nine consultancy companies in various parts of the world,
mainly concerned with mining, metals and energy.
Mr Robert Yates, IMC's director of finance and economics, said the group was
among 10 international consultancies considered by the Peruvian government.
IMC also hopes to be invited to bid for the valuation of Minero Peru if the
government decides to press ahead with privatisation of that company.
President Alberto Fujimori this week denied that there had been undue delay
in beginning the privatisation process. 'We've been in office for only 18
months,' he said, 'and we started from way below zero, with companies that
were in no shape to be privatised.'
President Fujimori is calling 1992 'privatisation year' and Centromin is
likely to lead the way. 'The plan is to subdivide the company and sell off
the separate production units as quickly as possible,' he said. 'This is
vital as Centromin is on the verge of collapse.'
Privatisation is now being pushed ahead by a specially formed commission ,
headed by Mr Yoshiyama. President Fujimori, in an apparent reversal of his
earlier position, does not now rule out debt-for-equity swaps as a
privatisation mechanism.
'In certain cases, debt-swaps could be a possibility,' he said. 'The door is
open.'

FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Fun and games' at the London
Metal Exchange - The background to the recent technical supply tightness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NASTY technical squeeze on the London Metal Exchange's zinc market seems
to have been avoided. The question is: did the squeeze collapse because the
exchange frightened off those who might be attempting some manipulation; or
was it simply that the people behind the squeeze achieved their objectives?
As with most LME squeezes, only a very few will know the full story. But
most of the evidence suggests that an objective was achieved.
The most popular theory about the latest squeeze is that the zinc price was
being artificially propped up while the so-called 'mating season', or annual
contract negotiations, between the Australian miners and Japanese smelters
are going on.
According to supporters of this theory, the talks have dragged on much
longer than usual because smelters have been holding out for higher charges
for treating concentrates from the mines. There is a surplus of concentrates
(an intermediate material produced by the mines) so the smelters have been
asking for Dollars 200 a tonne, up from Dollars 180 last year, to treat
them.
Producers have argued that this is unreasonable at a time when the LME zinc
price has been falling. So, according to some traders, some smelters have
used the options market astutely to squeeze the LME market and boost the
price in the hope that this will make the producers more willing to give
way. A squeeze is when pressure is put on a particular delivery date which
makes the price of that date higher in relation to other dates.
The contract talks, which usually are out of the way before the year-end,
are at last nearing conclusion and analysts suggest it is no coincidence
that the LME squeeze is now easing.
As usual when the market appears not to know what is really happening, some
fingers are pointing at Marc Rich, one of the world's biggest trading
organisations. Some suggest that Rich, based in Zug, Switzerland, has taken
control of 60 to 70 per cent of the LME's zinc stocks by the clever use of
options.
A source close to Rich, who prefers not to be identified, says this is not
quite correct. While the company does have some options, two zinc producers
(one European and one North American) are playing a bigger role in the
squeeze. All three apparently concluded independently that the zinc price
was due to rise.
The source says: 'There will be some fun and games, but not in any major
way. There will be a little squeeze, no big deal'. There certainly will be
no repeat of the zinc squeeze last April when the backwardation - the
premium for metal for immediate delivery over forward prices - soared to
Dollars 217 a tonne and at one point Dollars 60 a tonne was paid to borrow
zinc (buy cash and sell forward) for one day.
The squeeze has been building since early December. Dealers say that the
technical tightness at one stage forced the premium to borrow metal from
February for three months to touch Dollars 60 a tonne. But it eased back
after Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, gave the first of his two
recent warnings that the exchange was 'closely monitoring the zinc market'.
Analysts suggest that the squeeze has defied the zinc market's fundamental
situation. The price stayed up even though record stocks of the metal have
been attracted to the LME. Stocks now stand at 167,500 tonnes.
Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez
group, says the squeeze has made consumers shy away from buying zinc on the
exchange and frightened off those who might have sold short (sold metal they
did not have in the expectation they could buy it at a lower price in
future). Neither has there been much hedging or forward selling by
producers, perhaps because they fear this would depress the price.
After its January meeting, the LME board said it had 'noted and expressed
concern about the current tightness for nearby dates in the zinc market'.
Activity in the market would be closely monitored, it added.
According to Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's marketing director, this was to
show 'that we are aware of the talk in the market that there could be
tightness coming. This tightness has been so well signposted that the whole
world should know about it by now. We, in turn, have reminded the world that
we are watching - all the time'.
The LME's critics suggest that traders are able to play fast and loose with
metal prices, particularly by using options, for their own financial benefit
without breaking the rules. Mr Abbott points out in response that markets do
not behave in a perfect way at all times. At least 'the LME makes any errant
behaviour very transparent'.
During the zinc squeeze in April last year the LME executive took no overt
action but worked hard behind the scenes to make sure matters did not get
out of hand.
However, the LME executive has a statutory responsibility not to let a
'disorderly' market develop and the executive did have to take action during
a similar squeeze in the copper market in December. This quickly ebbed away
after the LME imposed a limit of Pounds 25 a tonne of the daily
backwardation.
Zinc and copper prices dropped substantially after previous squeezes ended.
They attracted a great deal of metal to LME stocks, which are highly
visible. High LME stocks usually have a depressing impact on prices and that
impact can last for a long time after the squeeze is over.
At first sight there seems no reason why history should not repeat itself
now the present zinc squeeze is ending. Analysts point out that about half
of all zinc consumed outside the former eastern bloc goes into galvanised
steel for the construction and automotive industries. Both industries are
severely affected by the present prolonged recession.
The International Lead and Zinc Study Group recently estimated that zinc
consumption dropped by 1.1 per cent last year while refined metal production
reached a record level. Consequently, there was a 170,000-tonne supply
surplus. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, a Royal
Dutch/Shell subsidiary, forecasts there will be another surplus in 1992 and
says that the zinc price should not be expected to recover until the final
quarter of this year.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall as supply fears dominate
sentiment

SUPPLY concerns remained the dominant influence on US bond market sentiment
yesterday, and prices fell across the board amid nervous trading ahead of
next week's quarterly refunding announcement.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at 102
13/32 , yielding 7.784 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down
3/32 at 99 13/32 , yielding 5.175 per cent.
After Wednesday's big losses, the market opened in a subdued mood. Even a
bigger-than-expected 5 per cent decline in December durable goods orders and
a 24,000 rise in weekly unemployment insurance claims failed to buoy
investors' spirits.
In the wake of the State of the Union speech and the new Budget, which
forecast a higher deficit for 1992 than had been anticipated, market
participants are worried about how badly the extra supply of new securities
will depress prices, and what the mix will be along the maturity range.
DEMAND for long-dated German government bonds helped to wipe out early
losses in the market, with the result that the bund futures market closed
almost unchanged yesterday.
The fall in the US Treasury bond market overnight pulled German government
bond prices down yesterday morning.
However, dealers reported plenty of extension trades, whereby market
participants sell short-dated issues and switch into long-dated paper.
The move out of the short end of the market reflects worries that German
interest rates are likely to remain high for some time, traders said.
Yesterday, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank directorate member, warned
that high inflation levels in Germany preclude any easing in the
Bundesbank's monetary policy.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.20 and traded at around 88.21
by late afternoon, down on Wednesday's close of 88.37.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch government bond market ended slightly firmer,
buoyed by overseas demand for 10-year and 15-year bonds.
UK government bonds barely moved in dull trading yesterday.
The Liffe gilt futures contract, which opened at 97.14, inched up to 97.16
by late afternoon, while the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07
slipped from 115 15/16 to 115 29/32 .
JAPANESE government bond prices slipped following the fall in the US
Treasury bond market overnight and the weakening of the yen against the
dollar.
Traders said that sentiment in the Tokyo market was bearish following the
decline in US bond prices on Wednesday.
The US market fell after comments by the US Federal Reserve's chairman, Mr
Alan Greenspan, dashed hopes of a further cut in US interest rates.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.26 per cent and closed at
5.265 per cent in Tokyo after trading in a range of 5.25 to 5.275 per cent.

<TEXT>
THREE leading US armaments contractors, seeing a profits opportunity in the
ending of the Cold War, have formed a new company with the grandiose title
of International Disarmament Corporation to specialise in the dismantling of
former Soviet nuclear weapons systems.
The three are Lockheed, Olin and Babcock &amp; Wilcox, a unit of the energy
services company McDermott International. Each will have a 33 per cent
interest in IDC.
The US defence industry as a whole faces a severe contraction over the next
decade as the ending of the Cold War has produced a sharp drop in defence
spending by the Pentagon. Companies have been pursuing a wide variety of
different strategies to find new business, but this is thought to be the
first company offering a disarmament service of this kind.
IDC plans to offer its services to the four Commonwealth Independent States
which hold weapons that previously made up the Soviet nuclear arsenal. Mr
Troy Wade, president of IDC, said yesterday that the former Soviet Union was
clearly capable of dismantling nuclear weapons, but it was unlikely that all
of the four successor states had this expertise.
The company does not see significant commercial opportunities in the US,
where the government already has a well-organised weapons destruction
industry, although it could bid for some of this work in future.
Mr Wade said that while the scope for Soviet work was extremely uncertain,
the kind of disarmament discussions taking place between President George
Bush and Russian leader Mr Boris Yeltsin could lead to the destruction of
'thousands of warheads and a business worth billions of dollars over many
years'.
One of the spurs to the company's formation was a bill passed by the US
Congress last year authorising the US to spend up to Dollars 400m to help
Russia'a disarmament efforts.
Lockheed, one of the largest defence contractors in the US, has great
experience in the systems integration and the management of high technology
programmes, including the US navy fleet's ballistic missile programme.
Olin Ordnance specialises in high explosives and ammunition production and
destruction, while Babcock has expertise in the manufacture and assembly of
nuclear components, and nuclear materials processing.
Mr Wade was formerly the senior career civil servant at the Department of
Energy in Washington dealing with defence systems, and has experience of
international weapons treaty verification.

Taylor.
As part of a worldwide restructuring, the multinational group's UK
subsidiary will announce today that its Copy Products and Business Imaging
Systems divisions are being merged to form Kodak Office Imaging.
Kodak intends to exploit its expertise in handling images in the expanding
electronic business information technology sector. Kodak Office Imaging will
be responsible for providing a range of products and services spanning all
areas of business document imaging.
Kodak recognises its commercial business was overshadowed by its consumer
photographic business and its previous business structure failed to fully
capitalise on commercial customer relationships.

XEROX, the US document processing group, yesterday reported a 61 per cent
drop in fourth-quarter net income as it took a Dollars 175m pre-tax charge
against earnings to cover the cost of cutting 2,500 white-collar jobs.
The group reported net income of Dollars 91m, or 73 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 235m, or Dollars 2.27, in the same period of 1990. Last year's
figures included a Dollars 50m gain from the sale of its South Pacific
operations and Dollars 12m of losses from discontinued operations.
Revenues in the latest quarter dipped from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 4.9bn.
Xerox announced the Dollars 175m charge in December, saying it would
eliminate the jobs to create a more efficient, flatter, customer-responsive
organisation.
Revenues from its document processing business increased 3 per cent in the
fourth quarter, compared with 1990, excluding the South Pacific sale and
currency translations.
Fourth-quarter income was Dollars 188m, against Dollars 180m, excluding
special items. The group's insurance and other financial service operations
produced fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 47m, down from Dollars 68m a
year ago.
For 1991, Xerox reported net income of Dollars 454m, or 3.91 a share,
compared with Dollars 235m, or Dollars 2.27 a share in 1990. Revenues
totalled Dollars 17.8bn, compared with Dollars 18bn the previous year.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said Xerox had become a more customer-responsive
organisation in 1991. It had also increased market share as sales of
lower-end, less expensive office equipment continued to show good growth
throughout the year. However, the weak economy had hit sales of higher-end
products to larger customers.
He said that despite a weak property and casualty insurance market, profits
from financial services had been relatively stable.

SCOTT PAPER, the world's largest manufacturer of toilet tissue, has revealed
a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 157.7m, after taking a large charge for
restructuring and a cut of 3,800 jobs, around 10 per cent of its workforce.
The company warned this month it would be taking a Dollars 183m after-tax
special charge, about half of it due to job cuts. The figure also includes a
gain from the sale of its Japanese joint venture.
Its fourth-quarter loss worked through at Dollars 2.14 a share, and compared
with a loss of Dollars 51.5m, or 70 cents, a year earlier. Excluding special
items, earnings per share dropped from 66 cents to 35 cents. Sales totalled
Dollars 1.32bn, against Dollars 1.43bn.
For the full year, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 69.9m after special
items, or 95 cents, against profits of Dollars 148m, or Dollars 2.01. The
1991 figures do not include businesses to be divested.

<TEXT>
THE RAPID growth of soft drink sales outside the US helped Coca-Cola, the
leading US carbonated beverage company, to achieve a 17.1 per cent increase
in 1991 net profits, to Dollars 1.6bn.
The earnings improvement was struck on total revenues 13 per cent higher at
Dollars 11.6bn. Net profits for the fourth quarter of 1991 rose by 21.8 per
cent, to Dollars 358.4m, on 12.6 per cent higher revenues of Dollars 2.9bn.
The growth in full-year operating income, which was up by 18.8 per cent, was
led by the group's international soft drinks division, which achieved 19 per
cent higher profits of Dollars 2.14bn.
Operating income from the US soft drink business rose by 31 per cent, to
Dollars 469m. The operating profit from Coca-Cola's foods division was 11
per cent higher at Dollars 104m.
The company's share price was buoyed by the healthy 1991 results, and by the
announcement of a planned two-for-one stock split. The share price was
marked Dollars 5 5/8 higher to Dollars 77 1/8 .
Soft drink sales volume, as measured by unit cases, rose faster
internationally than in the US market. International soft drink volume grew
by 6 per cent in 1991, more than twice the rate of US growth.
In the US, volume was 3 per cent higher in the last quarter of 1991, and up
by 2.5 per cent for the full year. Coca-Cola yesterday claimed its US market
share increased during 1991 by a fraction of 1 per cent, to 41 per cent;
this compares with an estimated 33 per cent share for Pepsi Cola, the main
competitor.
In the European Community, operating income rose by 15 per cent and unit
case sales volume by 8 per cent. This was despite an 11 per cent decline in
volume in the UK, which the company blamed on economic conditions.
In Germany, unit case sales increased by 18 per cent, thanks to the
company's penetration of the eastern regions of unified Germany.

GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last surviving big US-owned tyres group, expects
to post profit of Dollars 96m for 1991, compared with a loss of Dollars
38.3m a year earlier.
The news bolstered Goodyear's share price, which rose Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 58 5/8 .
The company forecasts operating income of Dollars 783m on sales of Dollars
10.9m for the year.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said the company expected to report
fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 105m, including an after-tax gain of
Dollars 43m from the sale of its Scottsboro Alabama tyre yarn plant.
Proceeds of that sale, with a Dollars 600m public stock offering, have
helped Goodyear cut debt by Dollars 1bn to about Dollars 2.6bn.
Since Mr Gault took the helm at Goodyear last summer, shortly after he
retired as Rubbermaid's chairman, the company has announced several new
tyres for the North American market.
'Our initiatives should lead to the achievement of our goal of tyre unit
growth in excess of the 2 to 3 per cent annual growth expected in the tyre
industry as a whole,' he said.

<TEXT>
LOTUS Development, the US personal computers software publisher best known
for its spreadsheet programs, reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter
sales. Income after charges for job cuts and consolida-tion of operations
was in line with analysts' forecasts.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was Dollars 249.2m, a 32 per cent increase
over sales of Dollars 188.4m in the same period a year ago. Net income
declined to Dollars 5.8m, or 14 cents a share, after a Dollars 23m
restructuring charge which was higher than anticipated.
In December, Lotus announced plans to cut its workforce by 10 per cent,
eliminating about 4,000 jobs, and said it would take a fourth-quarter charge
of between Dollars 14m and Dollars 18m.
The charges were higher because consolidation of facilities was 'more
aggressive than previously anticipated', the company said.
In the corresponding quarter of 1990, Lotus reported a net loss of Dollars
31.6m, or 74 cents a share, reflecting a Dollars 53m one-time charge related
to the acquisition of Samna, another software company.
Including the fourth-quarter restructuring charge, Lotus' net income for
1991 totalled Dollars 43.1m, or 98 cents, compared with Dollars 23.3m, or 54
cents, after the Samna acquisition charge. For the year, revenues rose to
Dollars 828.9m from Dollars 692.2m in 1990.
'We are extremely encouraged by the strong business momentum experienced in
the fourth quarter,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and chief executive
officer.
The company's 1992 goals include expanding spreadsheet market share and
building on the expanding market for personal computer communications
software.
Lotus also said it would expand its efforts in portable and pen-based
computing.

NET INCOME at R. R. Donnelley, the world's largest provider of print and

It ended its fourth quarter, however, with net income of Dollars 68.5m,
slightly up from Dollars 68.1m in the year-ago period. Earnings per share
were 88 cents, the same as last year.
The full 1991 results were held down by a recessionary downturn in the
advertising, retail and direct mail markets, as well as by a dilution
associated with a 1990 acquisition and increased start-up costs for three

Chemical Dollars 94m into red

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOW CHEMICAL, the second biggest US company, has announced a Dollars 94m
loss in the fourth quarter of 1991, compared with a Dollars 273m net profit
last year. The result again reflects the depressed state of the US chemicals
industry.
The company's poor showing comes in the wake of this week's disclosures of a
Dollars 240m fourth-quarter loss at Du Pont, and a Dollars 63m loss in the
quarter at Union Carbide.
Dow attributed the fourth-quarter loss to the slowdown in the global
economy, weak industry fundamentals, and a Dollars 370m pre-tax charge
related to plant shutdowns and asset write-offs.
Revenues for the fourth quarter were 11.3 per cent lower at Dollars 4.6bn.
For the whole of 1991, Dow's net profit declined by 32 per cent, to Dollars
935m, on revenues down by 5 per cent, to Dollars 18.8bn.
Mr Frank Popoff, Dow Chemical's chief executive, acknowledged the
fourth-quarter loss 'ends a very disappointing year in which pricing was our
major challenge and accounted for about 90 per cent of the profit reduction
we experienced'. Mr Popoff estimated that lower prices reduced profits by
about Dollars 800m in 1991.
Dow's chemicals and performance products division suffered a 65 per cent
slump in its 1991 profit, to Dollars 276m, after special charges relating to
the shutdown of chlor-alkali and derivative plants. Sales in the division
declined by 11 per cent.
The group's plastic products division also had lower sales and profits
compared with 1990, with the latter 50 per cent down year-on-year, to
Dollars 491m.
The company said the high-volume thermoplastics, including polyethylene and
polystyrene, accounted for more than 75 per cent of the drop in sales and
earnings.
Dow said its hydrocarbons and energy division suffered a Dollars 230m loss
in 1991, mainly because of special charges related to asset writedowns.
The consumer specialties division - which generated 57 per cent of Dow's
total operating income of Dollars 1.7bn in 1991 - had an operating profit 16
per cent higher at Dollars 962m.
Mr Popoff said he expected a resumption of growth during 1992 and a return
to 'positive earnings momentum' in the second half of the year, when the
world economy was expected to improve.
On Wall Street, where the decline in chemicals sector earnings has been
discounted by investors, Dow Chemical's share price was marked Dollars 1 3/8
higher to Dollars 54 3/8 .

JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the leading healthcare products manufacturer, yesterday
turned in a 15 per cent increase in underlying 1991 earnings, led by strong
sales growth in its pharmaceutical business, and an expanded
over-the-counter products line.
Net income in the fourth quarter rose about 18 per cent to Dollars 274m, or
83 cents a share, from Dollars 232m, or 70 cents, a year earlier. Sales grew
nearly 13 per cent to Dollars 3.15bn from Dollars 2.79bn.
Stripping out the impact of currency exchange rates, the company said sales
increased 15 per cent in the quarter. About half of Johnson &amp; Johnson's
revenues come from outside the US.
For the year, the company had record earnings of Dollars 1.46bn, or Dollars
4.39 a share, on record sales of Dollars 12.45bn. In 1990, it earned Dollars
1.27bn, or Dollars 3.81, excluding non-recurring first-quarter charges of
Dollars 125m, or 38 cents. Sales were Dollars 11.23bn.
The company increased its spending on research and development by 17.5 per
cent in 1991, to almost Dollars 1bn. Mr Ralph Larsen, chairman and chief
executive, said more than 25 per cent of sales came from products introduced
in the past five years.
The company's consumer products operations had US sales of Dollars 2.46bn in
1991, up 17.8 per cent. International sales were flat at Dollars 2.12bn.
Johnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceuticals segment performed better than consumer
products overseas, bringing in sales of Dollars 2.26bn, up 13.9 per cent in
the year. Domestic pharmaceutical sales advanced 16.4 per cent to Dollars
1.53bn.

battle with Intel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MARKETING battle between Silicon Valley semiconductor rivals, Advanced
Micro Devices and Intel, intensified yesterday when AMD announced plans to
launch its own version of Intel's 486 microprocessor, the device used to
power most high-performance personal computers, writes Louise Kehoe.
Although AMD said volume deliveries of its 486 would not begin until the
fourth quarter, slightly later than analysts had expected, the announcement
represents a significant challenge to Intel, which dominates the
microprocessor market.
AMD's 486 plans follow the introduction last year of its version of Intel's
386. AMD claims to have won a 30 per cent share of the 386 market, with 1991
sales of over a Dollars 1bn.
However, Intel is fighting back. Earlier this month the company unveiled
aggressive plans to introduce a barrage of 30 new versions of its
microprocessors this year, including some designed for portable computers
and others that lift the performance of existing products. In addition,
Intel said it would launch its next generation microprocessor, code-named
the P5, this year. The new chip will offer performance of 100 Mips (millions
of instructions per second).
The P5 will bring features such as fault tolerance to desktop computers.
These were previously found only in mainframe computers, Intel said.
Intel slashed the prices of its existing 386 products in December,
intensifying competitive pressure upon AMD. Intel aims to lead an industry
shift to its 486 chips before AMD can gain a foothold in the high end of the
microprocessor market.
AMD said that it would offer two new versions of the 386, including a
version that will rival the performance of Intel's current 486 product.

COMINCO, the Vancouver- based metals and fertiliser producer, expects to
decide the fate of its troubled lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia, by
the middle of the year.
Announcing a fourth-quarter loss, Cominco said senior management would visit
Stolberg, Germany, next month to review tests on a smaller version of the
Trail smelter, which uses the same QSL technology.
The new CDollars 130m (USDollars 112m) Trail plant has been idle because of
technical problems since March 1990. The project has embarrassed Cominco and

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Ambitious debt-based expansion that's
providing some food for thought - Questions raised by Waterford Foods'
latest buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for scale and market share in the Irish food industry was
highlighted earlier this month by Waterford Foods' IPounds 62m (Pounds
57.8m) acquisition of Express Ireland, which was accompanied by a rights
issue of IPounds 25m.
By fighting off other sizeable contenders, such as Avonmore and Golden Vale,
Waterford is now one of the Republic of Ireland's largest dairy companies.
It has annual turnover in excess of IPounds 500m and has ambitions to become
a IPounds 1bn company over the next few years.
Starting out as a milk producer's co-operative, Waterford has undergone
rapid growth since it was floated on the stock market in 1988.
The flotation was part of a strategic expansion plan, mapped out in 1987,
which according to Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, was aimed at
doubling the company's turnover in four years.
An aggressive acquisition programme ensued starting with the purchase of the
Heald dairy group in the UK in 1989, Galloway West in the US in 1990 and
United Co-operative Daires in northern England last year.
Together with Express Ireland (formerly a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan),
Waterford has spent over IPounds 200m on its spate of acquisitions, mostly
financed through debt.
Although largely welcomed by shareholders and market analysts, the
debt-based expansion strategy has not been without its critics.
One Dublin stockbroker estimated group debt to be 'in the region of IPounds
150m', which he described as a 'millstone'.
'The growth in scale has not been matched by a growth in the bottom-line
figure,' he added.
Earnings per share have not matched the doubling in growth of turnover and
'shareholders are still waiting for the pay-off of the expansion,' he said.
Others, however, are more upbeat. Davy, one of Dublin's leading
stockbrokers, noted in a recent review of the Irish food industry that
'there is a pervasive view that milk processing, at least domestic milk
operations, are a liability.
'This is not the case. The fact that the companies are diversifying away
from domestic operations reflects more the growth constraints on these than
any risk attaching to their long-run profitability or good cash flow
potential', it said.
Davy pointed out that recent acquisitions would leave Waterford's 1991
balance sheet 'prospectively some 90 per cent geared . . . but with the
profits outlook positive . . . gearing on our estimates will fall to less
than 40 per cent by the end of 1993.'
Several factors could upset this forecast:
the cost impact of reduced milk supplies due to lower EC milk quotas;
a failure to achieve savings through the marriage of the UK operations of
Heald and UCD;
the effect of a weaker sterling and US dollar.
In the longer term, some analysts believe the group's exposure to
door-to-door milk deliveries in Ireland and the UK could present problems as
the trend of milk sales appears to be leaning more towards retail outlets.
The market was disappointed by the failure last year of merger talks between
Waterford and Avonmore which, had they succeeded, would have produced a
substantial, diversified food group with cost-savings potential and the
financial and management muscle for further expansion in the European and US
markets.
It would also have spread Waterford's debt burden across the two groups.
However, having now to compete alongside Avonmore and the other big Irish
dairy groups, Waterford's management will be under pressure to produce good
results in 1992 to justify its debt-based expansion programme.
The group's shares have not performed as well as its competitors over the
past 12 months, and if good bottom-line results do not appear in 1992,
Waterford's expansion programme could well be pulled up short.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: A barbed peace offering to Rowland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE of Fraser Holdings delivered a barbed peace offering to Lonrho
yesterday in a corporate feud that has dragged on for nearly seven years.
This was the latest exchange in a battle that started after Mr Mohamed
Al-Fayed and his brother Ali, acquired control of House of Fraser when Mr
Rowland sold them Lonrho's own shareholdings in the company in 1984.
The approach, which House of Fraser insisted was a genuine effort to settle
the differences between the two companies, came in the form of a letter to
Mr Tiny Rowland, the Lonrho chairman, from Mr Royston Webb, legal director
of House of Fraser Holdings.
The letter began: 'Dear Tiny, you must find the events of the last few days
very depressing. Lonrho shares have halved in value in eight weeks and your
deputy chairman has broadcast that everything, including his desk, is for
sale.'
Pleasantries over, it suggested that Mr Rowland might permit a
representative of House of Fraser to address shareholders at Lonrho's
forthcoming general meeting.
The ink was still sizzling on the page when Mr Rowland delivered a
blunderbuss response by return of dispatch rider. He said: 'The company you
represent is now so sunk in debt that Harrods, the once proud flagship, can
barely be said to be trading at all. It is only the excess of debt over the
value of the assets that prevents its bankers selling up at this
unpropitious time.'
He was confident, he said, that his various court actions against the
Al-Fayeds would result in the award of massive damages to Lonrho. Mr Webb,
he said, could not expect the 'wild suggestion' of addressing the Lonrho AGM
to be taken seriously. 'It has not been. The matter will be resolved in the
proper forum - the High Court of Justice.'
Last November, a meeting was set up between Mr Rowland and Mr Webb. The
first proposed encounter at Claridges Hotel ended disappointingly when Mr
Webb did not attend.
A second meeting was arranged in which negotiations began on a settlement.
The Al-Fayeds even offered to remove the name Tiny from their stuffed shark
hanging in the Harrods food hall, but the talks ended in acrimony.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Financial restructuring for Principal
Hotels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCIPAL Hotels Group is in discussions with its bankers and main
shareholders concerning a financial restructuring of the group.
This follows its withdrawal from all financial services activities, which
gave rise to extraordinary losses of Pounds 7m in the year to June 30, with
a further Pounds 4m deficit anticipated in respect of the 16 months to
October 31 1991.
Meanwhile, payment of interest on the 11 per cent convertible unsecured loan
stock 1994 - 1998 has been postponed.
Directors said that the group's principal bankers remained supportive and
bank facilities continued to be available. In the last few months the
company had been able to increase operating profits of the hotels, compared,
on a like-for-like, with the same period a year earlier.
Details of the proposed restructuring will be announced, together with the
results for the 16 months to end-October 1991, in due course. The group's
business now comprises solely the ownership and management of 19 hotels in
the UK and five in continental Europe.

<TEXT>
SCAPA GROUP, the UK industrial products manufacturer, is set to expand in
Italy following an agreement to buy Adenax, a producer of adhesive tapes for
industrial uses, from the financially-troubled Pirelli tyres and cables
group.
Adenax is one of dozens of companies in the diversified products division
which Pirelli put on sale following the failure of its bid for Continental,
its German rival, late last year.
However, Pirelli said the decision to sell Adenax, which is based near
Vercelli in northern Italy, pre-dated its wider disposal programme.
Scapa is paying about L13bn (Pounds 6.02m) for Adenax, which had sales of
about L16bn last year. The company makes adhesive tapes, mainly used for
packaging.
The acquisition will fill out the range of industrial products and adhesive
tapes made by Scapa's Rotunda subsidiary. Following the acquisition,
Rotunda's turnover should reach more than Pounds 30m.

DY DAVIES, the USM-quoted architect, is passing its interim dividend for the
six months to the end of October after reporting an increased pre-tax loss
of Pounds 426,000, compared with Pounds 203,000.
The loss was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 244,000 (Pounds
44,000) to cover redundancy costs, payment of rent on unoccupied office
space and bad debts.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said: 'A number of our clients went into
receivership during the six months to the end of October.'
He added that trading remained very difficult. The only glimmer of light was
a slight increase in inquiries affecting some developments which had been
postponed.
The company has net borrowings of Pounds 2.2m compared with shareholders'
funds of Pounds 1.25m. Mr Davies said the company had not breached its loan
agreements and was working within its borrowing facilities.
Turnover during the six months fell from Pounds 5.21m to Pounds 3.54m.
Losses per share were 5.4p, compared with losses of 2.4p for the first half
of the previous financial year and losses of 5.5p for the full year.

Turnover increased by 14.5 per cent to Pounds 62.2m, but profits were hit by

previous Pounds 17.1m.
Earnings per share expanded by 20 per cent to 9.37p (7.81p), helped by a

red

<TEXT>
ML HOLDINGS, the aerospace, cargo handling and electronic component
distributor, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.31m for the six months to
end-September, compared with profits of Pounds 3.03m last time, writes Paul
Betts.
The loss included Pounds 1.9m of restructuring costs in defence activities.
The workforce has been cut from 1,768 at end-March last year to 1,496 by the
end of December.
The company, which has been reducing its dependence on the defence market
during the past four years by developing its civil aerospace and electronic
component distribution businesses, said it had suffered from the combined
effects of the slump in civil aviation and the reduction in military
spending.
Turnover in the first half fell from Pounds 44m to Pounds 40m.
After accounting for some 64 per cent of total sales for the year to
end-March 1988, the contribution of defence activities has declined to 29
per cent of total sales for the 12 months ending September 1991.
It is expected to continue declining to about 20 per cent of total sales.
The company said its order book, which had fallen very sharply as a result
of the Gulf war and the recession, had recovered strongly in recent months.
Interest costs rose to Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 1.05m) in the half-year to
September. But borrowings peaked in October with gearing of more than 70 per
cent and were now on a downward trend.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.85p. Losses per share emerged
at 2.6p (earnings of 3.9p).

FT  31 JAN 92 / History's vanquished return to favour: Why some UK fund
managers are looking at bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a growing debate between UK fund managers content to pursue proven
equity-led investment strategies and those arguing for increased investment
in bonds.
The case for equities is overwhelming: in the 1970s and 1980s equities
offered an average annual real return of 8.1 per cent, against 0.8 per cent
from bonds. Over longer periods a similar pattern emerges.
This encouraged institutions to switch funds out of bonds and into shares.
UK pension funds held about 45 per cent of assets in bonds in the mid-1960s,
falling to just 8 per cent by September last year.
However, in December Norwich Union, the mutual insurance group, announced
that its main fund had built up a 16 per cent holding of bonds, from zero at
the start of last year. GT, the fund management group which has about Pounds
6bn under management, now holds some 23 per cent of its balanced funds in
bonds. It held nothing during the 1980s.
'There is an excess of funds in the UK equity market which has been built up
over the past decade,' said Mr Nick Train, investment director at GT Unit
Managers. 'It is difficult to see where the next marginal buyers of equities
are going to come from. This imbalance could take another decade to put
right.'
This argument is backed up by the observation that, if you believe pegging
sterling to the D-Mark within the exchange rate mechanism will result in
lower UK inflation, bonds at current yields offer exceptional value.
For example, long-dated gilts offer a yield of about 9.5 per cent. If future
governments can maintain inflation at about 3.5 per cent, the German average
over the past 25 years, this implies 6 per cent real return.
Bonds have been a poor investment ever since the UK economy started to run
with a high level of inflation in the mid-1950s. In countries with a better
inflation performance, the bond market has been of at least equal importance
to the equity market as a magnet for institutional funds.
In 1988, Japanese pension funds held 55 per cent of assets in bonds, against
47 per cent in Canada, 38 per cent in the US and 28 per cent in Germany.
However, even in these low-inflation countries, bonds have substantially
under-performed equities.
The average annual real return to a Japanese holder of Japanese bonds was
just 0.2 per cent in the years 1967-90, against 10.9 per cent from Japanese
equities. German bonds averaged a real return of 2.7 per cent over the
period, against 9.5 per cent from equities. US bonds returned an average
loss of 0.6 per cent, against an annual return of 4.7 per cent on equities.
These figures suggest that factors other than investment performance are as
important in deciding how much money is devoted to the bond and equity
markets. For example, continental European countries are only now developing
competing funded pension schemes which set aside assets over a long period
to meet future liabilities.
Under these circumstances, foreign fund managers have preferred low-risk,
low-return government bond investments and the certainty of a fixed income
from bonds.
Another factor relevant to the UK is the maturity of pension funds. When a
fund is new, outgoings in the form of pension payments are low and income
from contributions is high.
Fund managers' chief concern is to protect the capital value of investments.
Equities have been historically the best way of achieving this. Yet when a
fund is mature, outgoings will increase and the fund manager becomes more
concerned with achieving a guaranteed stream of income.
'Techniques of asset-liability modelling are leading more funds to look at
their cash flows and question whether they should move more into bonds,'
said Mr Martin Shaw, chief executive of Baring Investment Management, which
manages Pounds 6bn for more than 100 separate pension funds.
The ageing of the population means that many UK pension funds are reaching
maturity: outgoings relative to inflows are increasing. For example, in 1980
the net inflow of cash into UK pension funds amounted to 19 per cent of
assets; by 1990 this had fallen to 4 per cent. However, the argument in
favour of bonds only becomes compelling if sterling's membership of the ERM
squeezes down corporate earnings and dividend payments along with inflation.
During the 1970s and 1980s equities provided capital growth and real growth
in investment income. Even mature pension funds which needed to finance
current pension payments had no reason to buy bonds.
Most pension fund managers believe they need at least to match wage
inflation - usually about 2 percentage points higher than retail price
inflation - if future commitments are to be covered.
Real dividend growth ran at an average rate of 5.7 per cent cent during the
1980s, easily in excess of the target. But can real growth in dividends be
maintained if the economy remains depressed over a number of years rather
than just months?
There is an argument that institutions pressed companies to deliver
abnormally high dividend growth during the 1980s to meet their growing
pension commitments. Some fund managers say the strain of maintaining
dividends is starting to show. Last year dividends paid by companies were
more than half earnings for the first time in 10 years.
But only a few institutions have allocated more funds into bonds. UK pension
funds sold a net Pounds 3bn gilts in the nine months to the end of
September, suggesting that most fund managers still see equities delivering
both real income growth and capital growth.

FT  31 JAN 92 / French steel group reports FFr3.1bn loss and job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USINOR SACILOR, Europe's largest steelmaker, yesterday estimated net losses
for 1991 at FFr3.1bn (Pounds 317m) and announced plans to lose 8,000 staff,
just over 13 per cent of its workforce, in the next three years.
This is the French state-owned group's first loss since 1987. It is further
evidence of the decline in prices and demand that has swept the US and
European steel industries.
Mr Francis Mer, chairman, said the downturn was 'worse than we feared', but
that Usinor Sacilor was 'practically certain' to make a net profit this year
on the grounds that most of its main markets would begin to stabilise.
To support Mr Mer's guarded optimism, Moody's, the US credit rating agency
yesterday accorded a Prime-1 rating to the French group's short-term
borrowings. Moody's said Usinor Sacilor's operating cash flow compared well
with European and North American competitors, it had achieved great
efficiency improvements and its state ownership was a source of strength.
The group's turnover rose from FFr96.1bn in 1990 to FFr97.1bn last year,
though there was an underlying 7 per cent decline when adjusted for
acquisitions.
Operating profits collapsed from FFr4.4bn to FFr400m over the same period,
mainly due to losses from the long products division - beams and wire for
the depressed construction and engineering industries - which represents
one-fifth of sales.
However, the group made an operating profit from stainless steel, flat
products - such as sheet for cars and household goods - and long products
for the mechanical construction industries.
French steel consumption fell 6.5 per cent last year, slightly faster than
the 5 per cent decline in EC steel use, according to the French steel
federation. The FFr3.1bn group net loss, compared with a FFr3.5bn net profit
in the previous year, comes after a FFr700m tax charge and FFr2.8bn of
provisions for restructuring.
Most job losses will come from closures of integrated steelworks and long
products plants in Lorraine and Normandy. The reductions are small compared
with the 100,000 job losses Usinor Sacilor has made over the past 15 years.
But they have been criticised by Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, who
wants the public sector to help her campaign to reduce unemployment.

FT  31 JAN 92 / GPA plans Dollars 1.5bn flotation for spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is
hoping to bring forward its flotation to late March or early April, when it
is expected to launch a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 820m) international share
offering.
An adviser to the group, which is based in Shannon in the Irish Republic,
said yesterday that Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's president, is planning to
announce the group's decision to go public on February 11, when it discloses
its quarterly profits.
Yesterday, the group's financial advisers were meeting to discuss the
pricing of the flotation, which could value the group at more than Dollars
3bn. The share offer is likely to be one of the biggest flotations of a
private sector company, as opposed to a privatisation.
Earlier this year GPA raised Dollars 100m through a private placement of
convertible redeemable preference shares in the US. These convert into
ordinary shares at a price of Dollars 34. However, the group's advisers
believe the new ordinary shares are likely to be priced at between Dollars
20 and Dollars 25.
The offering will make multi-millionaires out of most of GPA's executive
directors. The shareholding of Mr Tony Ryan, the group's chairman and
founder, is likely to be worth more than Dollars 200m at the flotation
price. The share sale will raise hundreds of millions of dollars in new
money for the company, which it needs to finance its ambitious programme of
aircraft purchases. The total value of shares on offer - likely to be no
more than Dollars 1.5bn - will depend on how many of its existing
shareholders wish to sell.
GPA has decided to accelerate the flotation process to take advantage of the
buoyancy of the US stock market. It hopes to make a preliminary filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, by the end of next
month.
The marketing of the offer would then begin at the end of March and the sale
of shares would take place in April.
The timing of the flotation depends in part on the date of the UK general
election. GPA is hopeful that the election will be called on April 9 and is
thought to be relying on the political intelligence of Mr Nigel Lawson, the
former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, who is a non-executive
director. If the election is later, the offer may have to be delayed until
afterwards.
The group's investment bank advisers - Japan's Nomura, Schroders, the UK
merchant bank, and Goldman Sachs of the US - are earmarking a third of the
shares for each of the London, Tokyo and New York markets. GPA will obtain
listings simultaneously in New York and London. The Japanese share sale will
be a public offering without listing, a technique pioneered in the sale of
the UK water industry.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Panfida goes into liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PANFIDA, the Australia-based group which owns the Martin chain of
newsagents, yesterday went into liquidation following the collapse of a
proposed Pounds 155m debt-for-equity swap.
The main stumbling block to the refinancing appears to have been Panfida's
determination to raise Pounds 5m through a placing as part of the
debt-for-equity swap.
Panfida had announced in September that it had reached agreement on the
debt-for-equity proposal with three of its principal non-bank lenders,
including Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International which had a 29.9 per cent
stake.
However, creditors were believed to be unable to agree on a Panfida placing,
because its only wholly-owned subsidiary was the Martin newsagents chain.
'There was nothing else generating cash,' said one source close to the
company.
A liquidator is expected to be named in the next two days. The shares, which
were as high as 180p in 1987, were suspended at 2 1/2 p yesterday.
A spokesman for News International said the group had written off its Pounds
10m stake in Panfida two years ago.
Panfida expanded rapidly in the late 1980s and owned food, property and
retailing interests in the US, UK, and Australia. The pre-tax loss for the
year to June 30 was Pounds 1.7m, against a loss of Pounds 9.58m the year
before, although the group was forced to make a Pounds 17.7m extraordinary
provision for its US and Australian assets.
The board of Martin and its bankers were anxious last night to distance the
group from Panfida's liquidation proceedings. The newsagent had been kept
off-balance sheet and therefore had no obligations to Panfida.
Mr Michael Peterson, a director of BZW, which is one of Martin's bankers,
said: 'Martin is alive and well, and totally supported by its banks.' The
newsagent's board said last night that the syndicate of banks which had
provided its finance 'now controls and effectively owns the . . . group'.
Martin debts total Pounds 100m, leaving Panfida with loans outstanding of
about Pounds 55m.
News International, which has some Pounds 30m outstanding to Martin, also
backed the newsagent. 'We are totally happy with Martin,' the company said.
The banks and News International said they would continue to provide
financing for Martin, which has 760 outlets.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Rank falls 19.7% to Pounds 250.5m pre-tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY higher interest costs combined with the recession to push full-year
pre-tax profits down 19.7 per cent to Pounds 250.5m at the Rank
Organisation, the leisure group whose interests include casinos, bingo, the
Hard Rock cafes and Butlin's holiday camps.
Sir Patrick Meany, chairman, said: 'I wouldn't wish to pretend that our
results are anything but disappointing to us.'
Rank's shares rose 45p yesterday to close at 640p as the group confounded
market rumours that it was going to cut its dividend and announce a rights
issue. The final dividend of 20.75p brings the total payment for the year to
an unchanged 31p.
Turnover was Pounds 2.1bn, compared with Pounds 1.3bn in 1990. Last year's
figure, however, includes the contribution from Mecca, which Rank bought in
August 1990. On a comparable basis, 1990 turnover would have been just over
Pounds 2bn. Trading profit was Pounds 186.6m, compared with an actual Pounds
145.1m in the previous year or Pounds 192.7m if the figure is adjusted as if
Mecca had been in the group throughout 1990. Earnings per share fell from
70.1p in 1990 to 38.4p last year.
Profits rose to Pounds 59.4m, against Pounds 34.2m or an adjusted Pounds
52.6m, in the recreation business. Profits also rose to Pounds 23.6m -
against Pounds 5.1m actual, or Pounds 22.2m adjusted - in leisure.
The drop in trading profit came primarily in the film and television
businesses which fell to Pounds 21.9m from Pounds 36.7m actual and adjusted.
Profits from Rank's interest in Rank Xerox, the photocopying company were
Pounds 158.7m, compared with Pounds 167.2m in 1990.
Interest costs rose to Pounds 93m from Pounds 16.2m, due to high borrowing
rates and the assumption of Mecca's debts.
Investors in the Hard Rock Cafe have filed suit in Los Angeles against Rank
for allegedly trying to coerce them into selling their interests in the
restaurant company below the market price. They are seeking damages of more
than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 555.5m).
A. Kershaw and Sons, Rank's separately quoted subsidiary which owns about 10
per cent of the group's 49 per cent share of Rank Xerox, reported pre-tax
profits for the year to October 31 of Pounds 9.93m, against Pounds 19.3m. An
unchanged final dividend of 18p is proposed for a same-again total of 27p.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Electrical safety plugged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PECULIARLY British custom of requiring consumers to attach their own
plugs to electrical appliances is coming to an end. Soon there will be no
more fiddling with tiny screws and trying to discern which terminal takes
which coloured lead.
The government yesterday bowed to five years of lobbying from safety groups
and said it would insist that electrical appliances be sold with plugs
attached. At present, almost all of the 60m plugs sold each year are fitted
at home.
Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister, said domestic appliances should
be supplied fitted with a correctly fused 13 amp plug. 'Too many people are
injured every year because of incorrectly wired electric plugs,' he said.
The regulation is expected to take effect within about 18 months, although
no date has been set.
Welcoming the move, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents
(Rospa) said: 'It is common practice everywhere else in the world to sell
electrical goods with a plug attached.' Rospa said the requirement should
eliminate the 200 hospital visits a year by people injured at home by
electric shocks due to faulty plugs. Last year a woman was electrocuted when
the live wire in the plug of a washing machine became detached.
The Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Electrical Appliances said the
change 'would add 10 per cent to the cost of a Pounds 15-Pounds 20
appliance' such as a toaster or iron.
'It is painful for us to see all these costs piling on,' said Mr Richard
Lines of Hornby Hobbies, which makes model railways and the Scalextric
electric car racing circuits.
But Sony, which has made televisions fitted with plugs at its plant in South
Wales for a year, said the extra cost was 'a few pence' per unit on a
production run of hundreds of thousands.
British Home Stores, the retailer which began to sell all its lighting with
plugs attached in October 1991, said sales had soared by 60 per cent.
Many companies had dragged their feet over a voluntary agreement to fit
plugs, according to Rospa. Industry associations concede that they pressed
for legislation to forestall imports of plugless devices from the Far East.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Yeltsin finds some friends in the London fog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN must have been pleasantly surprised to meet a crowd that
wasn't demonstrating about the cost of sausage.
Previously given low-key welcomes by western countries unsure of the
etiquette while Mr Gorbachev was still Soviet president, Mr Yeltsin is now
afforded full 'world leader' treatment and is discovering the Gorbachev
syndrome of being baited at home but feted abroad.
Hailed last year as the saviour of Russia, Boris Nikolaevich is now the
target of constant criticism about his economic programme. In London
yesterday, the questions were different, but his answers were
characteristically blunt.
Was Russia receiving enough aid, 'Tsar' Boris was asked by reporters as he
perched atop the steps outside the Russian embassy, evoking memories of his
defiant leap on to a tank during the Moscow coup.
'No, of course not,' he snapped back brusquely.
'There has been a lot of talk about this. But we need deeds, not words.'
After a quick shopping list of Russian needs - food, credit lines to build
storage and production facilities, and new technology - he was off without
another word in a Zil limousine.
Mr Yeltsin might be forgiven for not being in the best of moods. His
intensive, seven-hour visit had consisted entirely of meetings with British
politicians.
Even as the former party boss from Sverdlovsk in the Urals touched down at
Heathrow, a beaming Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was on the tarmac to
greet him.
Within an hour he was shaking hands with Mr John Major on the red carpet
outside 10 Downing Street before being taken inside to meet such luminaries
as Mr Tom King, defence secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and
Mr John Selwyn Gummer, agriculture secretary.
In the afternoon he had a 15-minute tete-a-tete with the Labour leader Mr
Neil Kinnock, and more than half an hour with Mrs Margaret Thatcher, a
fellow sufferer from the Gorbachev syndrome.
Naya Iosifovna, Mr Yeltsin's 60-year-old wife, was spared the politicians
and treated instead to a tour of London by Norma Major. She was, however,
under even more scrutiny than her husband, tailed by reporters anxious to
see how she matched up to the elegant Raisa Gorbachev.
'Rather smart, I thought,' remarked one Downing Street aide, with a touch of
surprise.
Mr Yeltsin's visit also provided a shindig for the Russian press, though
some were disappointed.
'It's a bit small,' said one reporter, clearly unimpressed by 10 Downing
Street, and by Mr Major's inability to fix himself up with something better.
British politics, too, seemed to cause some consternation. Was Mr King a
Konservator or a Laborist, asked one Russian reporter, running through the
list of politicians Mr Yeltsin was to meet. Laborist was his colleagues'
consensus.
At least it was foggy, they reassured themselves. Popular myth in Russia has
it that London is still the victim of constant pea-soupers.
Perhaps not all the propaganda was wrong.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Haughey to stand down as Irish PM: Reynolds and Ahern move
to the front in Fianna Fail leadership race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A POTENTIALLY divisive race for the Irish premiership was set in train
yesterday following the resignation of Mr Charles Haughey as prime minister
and Fianna Fail party leader over a 1982 telephone-tapping scandal.
He announced his decision at a parliamentary meeting of his Fianna Fail
party, saying: 'I have decided that to end the present political
uncertainty, the time has come for me to hand over to a new leader who will
have the opportunity to further advance the best interests of the country
and the people and to build on the achievements of recent years.'
Mr Haughey was presented with an ultimatum last week by his junior coalition
partner, the Progressive Democrat party, either to resign or face a general
election.
He will formally hand over the party leadership at a parliamentary group
meeting next Thursday, at which a new leader will be elected.
Mr Haughey will remain prime minister until the following sitting of
parliament on February 11. The Progressive Democrats are expected to support
Fianna Fail's choice of new leader.
Mr Albert Reynolds, a 56-year-old former finance minister who was sacked by
Mr Haughey for heading a leadership challenge last November, is the leading
candidate in the succession stakes and has strong backbench support.
But hopes that his candidacy would go unchallenged were dashed yesterday
when it became clear that Mr Bertie Ahern, the new finance minister, would
also stand.
A number of Fianna Fail backbenchers said Mr Ahern's candidacy could lead to
an acrimonious struggle for leadership of the party.
On Wednesday Mr Ahern presented a Budget of sweeping tax reforms, which were
widely welcomed by business and trade unions alike.
Mr Ahern, 40, has not formally declared his decision to stand, but last
night Mr Brian Lenihan, a former presidential candidate and close friend of
Mr Haughey, said: 'Mr Ahern will be standing. I am confirming this to you
now.'
The two potential rivals are close friends and hold similar views on
economic policy. They met last night to discuss the leadership race.
There are two further contenders: Mrs Mary O'Rourke, health minister, and Mr
Michael Woods, agriculture minister.
Mrs O'Rourke is Mr Lenihan's sister and a supporter of reforms to Ireland's
social legislation on issues such as divorce and women's rights.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Deuce, ad Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not bank on the idea that Labour is finished. That is what the crystal
ball has indicated for most of the past fortnight, but these are early days.
The great British political game of 1992 is not yet over. Indeed, it has
hardly begun. The date of the contest is still uncertain, although it sounds
like April 9. As to who will win, none of us can be sure. The poll results
are maddeningly close. Just a few weeks ago, the score stood at deuce,
advantage Labour. Today it stands at deuce, advantage Conservative. Next
week the percentage point could hop back over the net.
My current guess is that the Tories will squeak home, either with a majority
of less than 10 or as the largest party in a hung parliament. This is also
the conventional wisdom, which should be a warning that it stands a high
chance of being wrong. The guesswork can be refined by asking why the
Conservatives are doing so well and - an entirely different question - why
Labour is not five or six points ahead.
The first of these questions is the easier one to answer. Since the turn of
the year, the Tory campaign has been extremely cleverly managed. In
mid-December, the government realised that the Autumn Statement forecasts of
economic recovery would not come true. It looked as if the continued
recession would sweep the Conservatives out of office. So a decision was
made to divert the public's attention. It has been adhered to with the
fierce determination of ruthless politicians who want above all to win.
Trump after trump has been played. The nature of the entire election
campaign has been ingeniously restated. We are now to believe that this is
not a clapped-out administration grasping for an unearned fourth term, but a
brand-new government, headed by a personable young prime minister who is
seeking his first mandate from the electorate.
Labour's tax proposals have been subjected to intense and justified
scrutiny, with by now well-known results. Other court cards have come out
this week: a spot of trade union-bashing from Mr Michael Howard, followed by
a reminder from Mr Tom King that the Tories are resolute on nuclear weapons.
Mr John Major has been portrayed as something better than Mrs Margaret
Thatcher. He is cast as both international statesman and the ordinary chap
of humble origins who can be trusted by middle England. He suits the part
perfectly. He is the Conservatives' ace.
What is surprising is that Labour failed to prepare itself for all this. It
was obvious that the government would focus on tax and spending during an
election year. The correct defence was a pre-emptive attack. The shadow
chancellor should have been put on television after Christmas to set out
Labour's fiscal proposals in precise detail, in the hope of fixing them in
the public mind before the Conservatives could make their Mr Major is cast
as both statesman and ordinary chap who can be trusted
move. The avuncular Mr John Smith could have achieved that.
That he did not is symptomatic of what ails Labour. When Tories are down
they pick themselves up and fight harder. When Labour is down it moans and
turns in on itself. The party was ahead at Christmas-time, so it relaxed. It
should have been hammering the Tories on a single theme, such as the
persistence of the recession. But Labour's strategy is not managed by a
single individual or a tight working group. The Conservatives have Mr Chris
Patten as an energetic and surprisingly tough-minded chairman, plus Messrs
John MacGregor, John Wakeham and Richard Ryder to help day-to-day planning.
Labour's war cabinet is far more diffuse. Its campaigns co-ordinator, Mr
Jack Cunningham, does not enjoy the powers or status of a Tory chairman.
These operational details matter. There is no longer the hatred of the
government that some expressed when Mrs Thatcher was in office. Nor is there
much overt enthusiasm for Mr Neil Kinnock's party. Yet the underlying mood
of the country is one of impatience with the recession. There is a feeling
that it is time for a change, perhaps time to give Labour a chance. With a
mood like that and gloomy economic outlook reports like the one from the
Confederation of British Industry this week Labour should be five or six
points ahead.
It can still recover. The Conservative tax campaign, born of Christmas
desperation, may have been timed too early for maximum impact. The CBI
message may yet seep into the general consciousness, confirming what people
know from experience to be true. This week's insinuation that the Tories
would raise VAT if re-elected may not have been wholly countered by Mr
Major's denial. Mr Smith's party political broadcast, stating who will
benefit from Labour's proposals, may help. It did not have the knuckleduster
quality of the Tories' anti-tax propaganda of the previous week, but it may
be no less successful. Labour's decisions to adopt proportional
representation for elections to a Scottish assembly and a new London
authority could confuse the Liberal Democrats and attract some of their
votes.
Much therefore depends upon Labour's political dexterity over the next few
weeks. If its tactics are sharp, it could recover. If not, the penalty could
be severe. When Labour looks like winning, some Liberal Democrats vote Tory;
when the danger seems remote, they return to the fold. In England, a Labour
lead could therefore start the unravelling of the opposition. In Scotland,
the peril is imminent. This week's ICM poll, published by The Scotsman and
Independent Television News, shows 50 per cent in favour of an independent
Scotland. This may not translate into Scottish Nationalist Party victories
at a general election - unless Labour looks like losing the main contest. In
that circumstance there could be an accelerated swing to the SNP. Mr Major
would win, at the small price of losing Scotland. You would never have to
worry about Labour again.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Smoke signals give encouragement: The international
cigarette companies are targeting new markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growth prospects are now opening for international cigarette companies that
would have been regarded as a pipe-dream a decade ago. Political change in
eastern Europe and the removal of trade barriers in the Far East have given
the four multinationals - Philip Morris, BAT Industries, R J Reynolds and
Rothmans International - access to big potential new markets.
Ten years ago, the world market amounted to 4,500bn cigarettes. But more
than 60 per cent of that was virtually closed to the multinationals by
communist and non-communist state monopolies.
Today, world consumption of cigarettes is 20 per cent greater at 5,400bn;
and western tobacco companies are barred from less than 5 per cent of it.
Sir Pat Sheehy, chairman of BAT, says the prospects for international
companies are better than at any time during his 40 years in the industry.
The group's exports have risen from 45bn cigarettes in 1986 to 86bn in 1990.
Philip Morris, the tobacco exports of which already contribute Dollars 3bn
to the US balance of payments, says: 'The potential for our business
overseas is phenomenal.' The group plans a Dollars 3bn investment programme
over the next five years to increase its worldwide production capacity to
cope with the expected demand.
The surface of the liberalised markets has as yet only been scratched. The
scope for growth can be measured from the fact that BAT supplied 10.3 per
cent of the total world market in 1990, but a mere 1 per cent of the
communist and former communist market, which accounted for 2,460bn
cigarettes, and only 2.9 per cent of the 1,050bn cigarettes consumed in
other countries with tobacco monopolies.
The multinationals have continued to extract profitable growth from
established markets in the US and much of western Europe in spite of a
decline in consumption under the constant and growing pressure of health
lobbies.
But they are now brimming with confidence about the outlook for profits well
beyond the next decade. In most of the newly opened markets, smoking is
still on the increase; and consumers are showing a strong preference for the
multinationals' products.
Worldwide sales of international brands, led by Philip Morris's ubiquitous
Marlboro, have grown by 7 per cent a year over the past three years, and
they are gaining market share almost everywhere from national brands in
western European countries such as France, Italy and Spain where state
monopolies have previously dominated. new markets.
The multinationals' salesmen are advancing in force into eastern Europe
where the demise of communism has opened a potential market for 700bn
cigarettes - eight times bigger than the UK's.
Economic problems, political uncertainties, and poor service facilities may
slow the profitable exploitation of opportunities. Mr Charles Pick, tobacco
industry analyst at Nomura Research Institute, says: 'The market is
characterised by a lack of hard currency, modern technology and
competition.'
Initial operations have encountered frustrating day-to-day difficulties with
inadequate banking and telephone systems, and a chronic shortage of hotel
accommodation and trained personnel. BAT's advance guard in east Germany,
for instance, lived for a time in caravans and sent messages by taxi.
The lack of clearly defined lines of responsibility between central and
local government authorities in the republics also makes negotiation long
and difficult.
But the longer-term potential is worth serious investment. Mr Philippe
Grandjean, spokesman for Philip Morris's operations in eastern Europe, says:
'We have to make a firm commitment; show that we intend to be a permanent
partner in the new systems being established in these countries. We do not
expect immediate returns. We are building a solid base for the future.'
Cigarette production in Russia this year is expected to fall about 150bn
cigarettes short of demand. Philip Morris recently signed a contract to
supply 11bn, and will start producing Marlboros in Russia this year. It
supplied the republic with 22bn cigarettes last year - and says it was paid
promptly for them in spite of reports that other companies have been offered
payment on a 720-day basis or various barter deals.
R J Reynolds, which sold 14bn cigarettes to Russia last year, also expects
to be producing Camel and other brands in a joint venture in Kazakhstan
later this year; and BAT is investigating opportunities.
In east Germany, Philip Morris has gained 44 per cent of the market by
acquiring a former state-owned factory, and simply improving the quality of
its F6 and Juwel brands as well as adding Marlboro to the range. Reynolds,
which also bought a factory, has had less success with the local Club brand
and Camel, holding only a 7 per cent share.
occupied intermediate positions by using the factories of their west German
subsidiaries to supply the new market. BAT has gained 11 per cent of the
market, but its HB and Pall Mall brands lead the higher-priced segment.
Rothmans has adopted a more cautious approach than its rivals, apparently
believing that there is scope for losing money as well as making it. But its
Golden American brand, developed to provide 'good quality at an affordable
price', has a 16 per cent share.
In Hungary, with an annual consumption of 26bn cigarettes, BAT has recently
signed a joint venture agreement with the state-owned company at Pecs, which
supplies 45 per cent of the market. It is also helping to improve the
quality of the country's tobacco crop.
Philip Morris and the Austrian state tobacco monopoly have jointly bought
another cigarette company near Budapest which has been making Marlboros
under licence for the past 15 years and has a 24 per cent market share.
Multinationals are competing to set up operations through similar deals in
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
While profitable sales growth may be slow in eastern Europe, Far East
markets, with rising populations and personal incomes, are already a prime
source of profits. Rothmans, for example, has 55 per cent of the Malaysian
market, and it increased operating profits in 1990 by 70 per cent.
Since US trade pressures cracked the government monopoly in Japan in the
mid-1980s, Philip Morris has captured an 11 per cent share of the 320bn
cigarette market - almost double the combined share gained by its
international rivals. Volume sales of Marlboro and other PM brands, such as
Lark, rose 22 per cent in 1990 to 35bn.
BAT, too, is well established through Lucky Strike and Kent, produced by its
US subsidiary, Brown &amp; Williamson. Its John Player Special also occupies a
profitable niche.
Rothmans, which still has less than 1 per cent of the market, is investing
in marketing its mild Dunhill Lights.
South Korea, with an annual cigarette consumption of 96bn, has proved more
difficult to penetrate. Four years after liberalisation, imports account for
only 4 per cent of the market. The national monopoly still dominates
distribution channels, and the international companies complain of red tape
and an anti-imports drive thinly disguised as a campaign against
'conspicuous consumption.'
The 40bn cigarette market in Thailand was only opened to imports late last
year; but the internationals are becoming well established in Taiwan. Philip
Morris brands lead the imports sector, but BAT's State Express 555 brand has
a 23 per cent share and sales are growing vigorously.
Rothmans is optimistic about prospects in Indonesia, where western-style
cigarettes have made little impression on a market dominated by locally
produced kreteks, a blend of cloves and tobacco.
However, the prize on which all the multinationals have set their sights is
China, where demand for cigarettes has grown by nearly 10 per cent a year
over the past decade to 1,700bn, almost a third of the world's total
consumption.
Reynolds has already established a joint venture company in the country; and
Rothmans, which has long been associated with efforts to improve Chinese
tobacco farming, is a partner in a joint venture company which will begin to
manufacture cigarettes in Shandong province in June.
Philip Morris and BAT, with its State Express, Kent and Hilton brands, have
been successful in selling into duty free and other hard currency outlets.
Imports, according to Philip Morris, still account for only 0.3 per cent of
Chinese consumption. Because of constraints on hard currency, nobody expects
any rapid growth in the near future. But the prospective rewards are worth a
little patience: just over 5 per cent of the market would equal total
cigarette sales in the UK.

Franz Welser-Most conducted the LPO in a curious programme last night:
Dvorak's little-played The Golden Spinning Wheel and his compatriot
Martinu's Fifth Symphony, and between them a very black-and-white
performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto no. 3. There was nevertheless a
well-filled house - perhaps because the pianist was Piotr Anderszewski, the
young Pole who beat a sensational retreat from the 1990 Leeds Competition.
That was during his recital in the semi-finals, when after delivering
Beethoven's gigantic 'Diabelli' Variations with with an intellectual control
and authority far beyond his years, he faltered in Webern's brief Variations
and abruptly left the platform, never to return. This time his Beethoven was
not so remarkable - except for definiteness of intention, which was striking
enough; but Anderszewski's intentions were plain and austere, in a work
which invites more generous and indeed Romantic responses.
This was a tight, narrow-gauge reading. Every note penetrated clearly, so
that when he missed one - just a couple of times - it was unmissable. What
he meant for every section was unmissable too; but stark black-and-white
contrasts do not necessarily generate drama, and they leave scant room for
nuances.
Surely the C minor concerto presupposes some personal input from its
performer, some effect of a piano with an individual voice. Treating it with
the detached reverence that can illuminate the huge 'Diabelli' structure
rather diminished it: one admired the thoughtful planning, but longed for
some vital stamp of character to enliven it.
One of Dvorak's most inventive orchestral studies, The Golden Spinning Wheel
was pleasant to hear - particularly with Anthony Burton's detailed matching
of folk-tale with music in the programme book. I hadn't known that the
scenario was so specific. None the less, the piece lacks the symphonic
drawing-of-threads-together that would make it memorable. Much the same is
true of Martinu's Fifth Symphony, composed just after the Second War.
As artfully conducted by Welser-Most, and delivered with bright verve by the
LPO, it too fell attractively upon the ear. In (one of) Martinu's standard
manners, the triple woodwinds crackled and warbled high; most of the music
kept up a motorised canter, kicked lightly along by percussion; from time to
time there were svelte paragraphs with broadish tunes and cosmopolitan
between-the-wars airs.
As often with Martinu, it was utterly unclear what it should add up to: it
chattered engagingly for just under a half-hour, with 'symphonic' patterns
of development and reprise, and then stopped. Where it had arrived, if
anywhere, remained a mystery.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government fights to recover on VAT
 -Taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday escalated its offensive over the government's plans for
value added tax by seeking to highlight inconsistencies in prime minister
John Major's statements on the subject.
Using remarks made by Mr Major last April, the opposition tried to cast
doubt on his apparent pledge earlier this week not to implement further VAT
increases.
It later appeared to be unwittingly assisted in its aims when Mr John
MacGregor, leader of the Commons, reasserted Conservative commitment to the
notion of indirect taxation.
Mr MacGregor said the Tory-engineered shift from direct to indirect taxation
was 'absolutely right' because it enabled more people to spend money as they
wished to spend it.
'That is the policy we have consistently pursued, with the result that
direct taxes have come substantially down,' he said.
In an exceptionally rowdy Commons, Mr Roy Hattersley, deputising for Mr Neil
Kinnock, the Labour leader, opened by inquiring whether Mr Major's remarks
on Tuesday constituted a 'categorical assurance' that the VAT rate would not
rise.
If it was, he asked, how did that assurance square with Mr Major's statement
made last April 6 that 'no honest government could give a categorical
assurance that they would not increase VAT - no government ever has and no
government ever will.' Was Mr Major telling the truth 'last Tuesday or last
April?'
Mr MacGregor, standing in for the absent Mr Major, said the prime minister's
remarks on Tuesday had made the position 'absolutely clear.'
Mr Major had stated then there would be no VAT increase. The government had
published its spending plans and did not need a VAT rise to meet them.
He said this contrasted with Labour's position, which involved 'high
spending policies and is all over the place in deciding how it intends to
finance them.'
Mr Hattersley retorted by maintaining that Mr MacGregor lacked either the
courage or the authority to say whether the prime minister's pledge was
categorical or represented a promise he had no intention of keeping.
Mr Peter Kilfoyle, (Lab Walton) asked by how much VAT had risen since the
Tories entered office in 1979.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: No longer the best form of attack?
 -Political battles over defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY election chiefs deliberately held fire during Westminster's
pre-election skirmishes yesterday. With the visit of President Boris Yeltsin
grabbing the television lights, set-piece press briefings or big speeches
were suspended to allow Mr John Major another electorally priceless stroll
on the international stage.
Today, too, the prime minister can continue the show in New York, where his
chairmanship of the United Nations Security Council will provide more
statesmanlike film for the Conservative Central Office archive.
Yet, rather than kicking its heels in frustration, Labour's leadership
believes, with some justification, that the new round of US-Russian arms
cutting has knocked impetus from the Tories' efforts to push defence on to
the electoral agenda.
Tories vow Britain's security will be a central issue in the election
campaign but, for Labour, defence has become less of a headache than in the
party's unilateralist past.
Walworth Road officials claimed yesterday that in private polling the end of
the Cold War has dropped the issue well below the top 10 of voters'
concerns.
Less than three weeks ago Tory campaign chiefs were hopefully pushing
defence - traditionally a 'winning issue' for the Tories - as the 'follow
up' to their attack on Labour's tax and spending plans.
However, Mr Neil Kinnock's now famous remarks on phasing in rises in
National Insurance contributions persuaded them temporarily to abandon the
defence tack.
'The very fact that they were raising it (defence) was an indicator that
they only have tax and spending, John Major and defence in their list of
'winning' issues,' a Labour official commented yesterday.
To neutral ears, that arguments may have some resonance. Yet there is little
doubt that defence is still a useful vehicle for Tories to play their
'strong leadership' card.
Few have failed to miss that Mr Chris Patten, the Tory chairman, never
fluffs an opportunity to compare Mr Neil Kinnock and his shadow foreign
secretary, Mr Gerald Kaufman, as Britain's potential representatives abroad
with Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the patrician foreign secretary.
To that, the Tory election machine adds the equivocation of Labour on
whether it will cancel a fourth Trident-bearing nuclear submarine and the
opposition's reluctance to produce a comprehensive policy paper on defence
issues.
But if those are the Tory bull points, the rapid acceleration of the
disarmament process seemed to put the Conservatives on the defensive.
While nobody would suggest defence has become a winning issue for Labour,
the pace of events has allowed Labour and Liberal Democrats to suggest
Britain is dragging its feet.
In carefully moderated language, Mr Kinnock took up the theme after his
meeting with Mr Yeltsin yesterday. Taking care not to carp too loudly, he
made clear that Britain should be participating fully in the disarmament
process - a message similar to that his party espouses about the UK's
'failure' to participate fully in Europe. Liberal Democrats also urge that
Britain should not buck the international trend towards fewer nuclear
weapons.
Labour, in particular, is targeting the government's determination to press
ahead with plans to deploy 512 Trident warheads in place of the 192 now in
service.
As Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, points out: 'It goes
against the grain of everything that is happening internationally and sends
a very bad signal to nuclear proliferators.'
Labour, meanwhile, is holding its cards close to its chest. It remains
unclear whether it would commission a fourth Trident submarine, deemed
essential for credible deterrence by the Tories, saying it would need to
look at the books when it takes power.
The party argues that there is a clear case for not deploying all the new
warheads ordered by the government.
Mr Alan Clark, the defence procurement minister, has characterised this
standpoint as the equivalent of running a Rolls-Royce with a Morris Minor
engine.
Mr Major also emphasised yesterday that, with Russia still holding 27,000
nukes, Britain's 500 would not amount to a fifteenth of those it faces in
even a decade of cuts.
Yet to some extent, ministers are now boxed in by their insistence that what
is already planned is the absolute minimum necessary.
Any cut in the number of Trident warheads - still not inconceivable,
although impossible before an election - would be tacit acceptance of Labour
and Liberal Democrat arguments.
On cuts in conventional weapons, too, Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, is
not invulnerable. His handling of the 'options for change' review was
regarded even by some Tories as ill-thought-out. He was stung, too, by a
leaked internal armed services report earlier this month which strongly
criticised interference by ministers in the conduct of Britain's role in the
Gulf campaign a year ago.
None of that is going to make defence a key factor at the ballot box. But it
does inhibit somewhat Conservative attempts to emphasise defence as a
election issue.
Between them Mr Major's friends - presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin -
have significantly diminished the old Tory adage that defence is one of the
best forms of attack.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems set out plan for Scots PR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats yesterday moved to distance themselves from Labour's
endorsement of proportional representation for its proposed Scottish
parliament, emphasising their preference for the single transferable vote
form of PR, David Owen writes.
The party also criticised Tory suggestions that Scotland faced a choice
between the union and full-blown independence. Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal
Democrat president (above, left), described the stance as 'a very reckless
game'.
He suggested that political expediency might have motivated Labour's
plumping for the alternative member electoral system of PR. There was
concern that Labour's proposals might convert a minority Scottish vote to a
permanent Labour majority in Scotland, according to Mr Malcolm Bruce, the
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader (above, right).
The party also differed from Labour in admitting there was a case for
reviewing Scottish representation at Westminster 'once a Scottish parliament
with the powers we want is up and running'. Under the single transferable
vote, the electorate ranks candidates in order of preference - an
arrangement favoured by the Liberal Democrats for putting power in the hands
of voters as opposed to parties.
Under the additional member format, voters cast two votes - one for an
individual constituency candidate, as at present, and another for a party.
Labour yesterday denied that its motives were impure, saying it preferred
the additional member approach because it maintained a constituency link and
'topped up' the present first-past-the-post system.

Education Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTION taken by the government to curtail debate on the Education (Schools)
Bill strengthened the belief that the general election would take place on
April 9, Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, suggested in
the Commons last night.
He said the 'panic' decision to invoke the parliamentary guillotine to
ensure that the bill completed its passage through the Commons by 10 o'clock
last night reflected ministerial anxiety over the as yet unannounced
election timetable.
Denying that Labour had mounted a filibuster to prevent discussion on the
bill being completed by Wednesday night, as the government had planned, he
emphasised that the longest speech, lasting just under 40 minutes, had been
made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, criticised the bill as a
'crackpot' measure, and promised that it would be repealed by a Labour
government.
The use of the guillotine was approved by a government majority of 88
(271-183).
The bill was given a third reading by a government majority of 134
(266-132), and now goes to the House of Lords.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour highlights southern
marginals - Housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARGINAL seats in the south of England were targeted yesterday by Labour in
a move to bring home to voters the effects of the Conservatives' policy on
house prices over the past four years.
Publishing a survey of house prices in 30 towns, Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow
environment secretary, said it showed 'there is rightly a very substantial
feel-bad factor running right through the very marginal seats that the
Tories are desperate to defend'.
Labour highlighted the fall in house prices in Mr John Major's Huntingdon
constituency and Mr Norman Lamont's Kingston seat since the end of 1987 - by
28 per cent and 19 per cent in cash terms.
The opposition offensive marks a renewed effort by Labour to point up the
difficulties faced by people in the south-east under the Tories, after a
Tory onslaught on the impact of Labour's tax plans on earners in London and
the south-east.
It also comes after Labour's national executive committee approved plans for
an elected, strategic authority for London.
Other areas where Labour highlighted the difficulties of homeowners were the
north-west and the Midlands, which saw rises of more than 40 per cent in the
numbers of court repossession orders made in 1991, and which contain a
number of marginal Tory seats.

claims - Exports to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister was yesterday challenged to answer in detail what Labour
said were fresh allegations that ministers permitted UK companies to breach
the arms embargo against Iraq before its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, listed in a letter to Mr Major
allegations made in a book entitled The Death Lobby, by Mr Kenneth
Timmerman, an investigative journalist.
The all-party Commons trade and industry committee is investigating breaches
of embargoes during the Iraq-Iran war, but it may not complete its report
before the general election.
Last night the Ministry of the Defence accepted, at least in part, a claim
in the book that Iraqi pilots had been offered training in the UK.
The MoD added that no weapons training or training in combat techniques had
been provided.
The Department of Trade and Industry was confident that no equipment
approved for export to Iraq in the 1980s was 'any danger to UK interests'.
It emphasised that the arms embargo allowed the export of non-lethal
equipment.
GEC-Marconi, one of the companies mentioned in the book, said that the
allegations were 'inaccurate'. It said last night: 'We have not supplied
Iraq with any equipment in the last 10 years.'

FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rightwing Tories urge Major to
reform - PM's image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative MPs closely associated with Mrs Margaret Thatcher last night
called on Mr John Major to abandon his 'safety-first' image in the final
weeks before the general election.
In a thinly veiled warning to the prime minister not to depart from basic
Thatcherite principles, the Conservative Way Forward said it was time for
him to demonstrate his radical credentials.
The group, which has Mrs Thatcher as its president and counts former cabinet
ministers Mr Cecil Parkinson and Mr Norman Tebbit among supporters,
congratulated Mr Major on the achievements of his first year in office.
It said that the public had come to know him as 'pleasant, hardworking and
trustworthy, with steady judgment and the will to fight hard for Britain'.
But in a judgment that appears to reflect some irritation on the right of
the party with the way Mr Major has distanced himself from his predecessor's
radical approach, it said: 'The safety-first image may have served him well
but a bolder image is needed now.'
It added that the voters needed to see the prime minister pushing forward
with the reforms of the 1980s.
That meant he should associate himself more closely with Conservative
programmes such as the overhaul of the health services; that he should be
seen to be heading the challenge to the educational establishment; and that
he should be pushing for tax reform as well as tax cuts.
Backing Mr Major's pledge to reduce the burden of inheritance tax, the group
said he should go further and make all family bequests of less than Pounds
500,000 tax-exempt.
Concluding that the loyalty of Conservative voters had been tested by the
recession, the group said the party's supporters throughout the country were
now ready to respond to bold leads.
'So step forward John Major Mark II - the reforming prime minister.'

FT  31 JAN 92 / Debtors may add Pounds 21 to community charge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLL TAX bills in England and Wales could be increased by more than Pounds
21 because of non-payers, according to a survey.
In inner-city areas the extra burden could amount to nearly Pounds 32 a
person, said the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy
(Cipfa).
The survey, for Radio 4's Today programme, reinforces Labour claims that the
poll tax could become a crucial issue in an early election.
Budget-setting debates take place in councils in February and March, with
bills being sent out in April - around the same time as the earliest likely
election date of April 9.
The estimates, which Cipfa says could be conservative, come just days after
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, admitted that many bills are
likely to overshoot the government's average forecast of Pounds 257 by up to
Pounds 15.
The survey asked local authorities to give estimates of the surcharges
forced by non-payment. Some 144 councils - just over a third of all local
authorities - responded.
The average increase due to uncollected bills for the current financial year
was put at Pounds 21.37, rising to Pounds 31.97 in metropolitan districts.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Driver licence centre accused in Nissan row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency was yesterday accused
of passing confidential customer information worth millions of pounds to
Nissan Motor (GB), the Japanese carmaker's recently formed distribution
company.
Nissan UK, Mr Octav Botnar's company that used to hold the Nissan
distribution franchise for the UK, claimed that the Swansea-based DVLA had
sold a list of 700,000 names of its customers to Nissan Motor (GB).
Mr Botnar was said to be 'furious' about the sale of the list, which he said
covered customers who had bought vehicles from Nissan UK in the past six
years.
Nissan UK said: 'Now they (Nissan Motor (GB)) are using confidential
information for a huge marketing programme.'
However the DVLA, while it acknowledged that a list of about 400,000 names
had been supplied to Nissan Motor (GB), said last night that it had acted
within its guidelines.
An official of Nissan Motor (GB) insisted that the list had been sought
solely to reassure Nissan owners about their entitlement to warranty after
the confrontation between Nissan and Nissan UK that led to the termination
of Nissan UK's distribution contract at the end of last year.
The company said the database had already been returned to the DVLA 'and we
have made no copies'. It acknowledged that letters had already gone out to
most of the owners, but insisted that they were a 'one-off' to clarify the
warranty situation. There would be no marketing follow-up.
The database is one of the few substantial assets left to a distribution
group in the event of a vehicle supplier terminating its franchise.
An official for Nissan UK said last night that the rival Nissan group's
acquisition of the database was likely to prejudice the success of efforts
to sell alternative makes of cars when new franchise arrangements were put
in place.
In a statement the DVLA said that although its records were not a public
register the law specifically provided for information to be disclosed to
parties regarded as having reasonable cause to seek it. The purpose of
Nissan Motor GB 'was solely to advise the keepers of Nissan vehicles of the
position with regard to warranty following the withdrawal of the
manufacturer's franchise from the previous distributor.'

FT  31 JAN 92 / Carsberg renews quest to curb monopoly: Oftel's proposals
for BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE 1984, when BT was privatised, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the departing
director-general of Oftel, has overseen a sweeping extension of price
controls on the privatised telecommunications operator.
At first, the watchdog covered services that provided half BT's revenues. It
now covers services that account for almost 70 per cent of BT revenue.
If BT hoped it would escape some of this regulation in the next few years as
competitors enter its market, encouraged by the government's liberalisation
of the telecommunications market last year, it will be disappointed.
It seems likely that as Sir Bryan departs this summer for his new job as
director-general at the Office of Fair Trading, he will leave behind an even
more extensive system of regulation.
According to an Oftel consultative document, published yesterday, on
proposals to renew price controls on BT from the middle of next year, the
case for regulation is undiminished.
Although BT may face growing competition in some areas of business services,
it is likely to retain an overwhelming monopoly in most sectors of the
market for the foreseeable future. In the absence of competition, regulation
is needed to prevent BT exploiting its monopoly power.
The document suggests three possible forms of regulation: a direct limit on
BT's profits; continuation of the price cap introduced in 1984; and a
profit-sharing arrangement that would ensure that the company shared any
unforeseen excess profits with its customers.
Oftel is firmly in favour of maintaining the current price-capping formula,
which limits BT's price increases to an amount less than the annual retail
price index, the so-called 'RPI - X' formula.
It says that, in spite of its drawbacks, the RPI is the most transparent
index to use, rather than BT's input prices or a special basket of
telecommunications prices.
The main issue to be decided by the review will be the value of 'X' in the
formula, which at present limits price increases to the RPI less 6.25 per
cent.
The document says the cap should continue to cover prices for local,
long-distance and international calls as well as private circuits.
Regulation should be extended to cover the rental price of hard-wire
handsets and might apply to new services such as call forwarding and call
barring, it says.
Oftel is seeking views on whether the price controls should cover an overall
basket of services or whether individual services, such as international
calls, should have special caps. It rejects the idea of a one-off reduction
in charges.
Sir Bryan recommends that the next price cap should last between four to
five years, the length of the previous two caps.
The document raises the possibility of linking quality-of-service targets to
the price controls, particularly where the quality of the network as a whole
is at issue. Oftel has no statutory powers relating to BT's quality of
service, although since 1987 BT has been forced to publish
quality-of-service reports.
It suggests that the present compensation scheme is the best way to deal
with customer complaints about poor quality.
Sir Bryan will consider whether BT should be required to publish its
accounts on a current-cost basis, which would reflect the high costs faced
by its competitors in installing modern telecommunications networks.
The drawback to that would be that it would allow BT to charge higher
prices, although it may also encourage competition by reflecting the real
costs of installing equipment.
The document casts doubt on the merit of controls on particular costs, such
as BT's investment expenditure.
It will review the adequacy of traditional measures of BT's productivity,
such as unit costs and the number of people employed per exchange line.
Those measures will be central to Oftel's judgment of the scope BT has to
cut costs, and its likely profits in the next few years - and therefore how
tightly the cap should be set.
The other main issue to be covered by the review is the flexibility and
structure of BT's tariffs, particularly the balance between prices for
installing lines and making calls, between prices for calls at peak and
cheap-rate times of day, and the size of local telephone districts.
Oftel favours an extension of the low-user scheme, which is designed to
compensate those on low incomes who might be affected by BT's moves to
rebalance its prices by raising line rentals and cutting call charges.
It will consider whether that scheme, which covers between 1.5m and 2m
customers, should be extended to a further group of customers, defined as
those whose telephone bills are significantly below the median.
The review will also examine whether BT should be obliged to provide a
recently developed talking terminal service which allows deaf people to use
the telephone.
After considering responses, Oftel will seek to negotiate a formula with BT.
If that fails, the issue will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Responses to the paper, The Regulation of BT's Prices, should be submitted
to Oftel, Room 229, Export House, 50 Ludgate Hill, London EC4M 7JJ. They
should arrive by Friday March 27.

Sun Alliance took over the scheme from Security Pacific, the US banking

proved 'unprofitable'. Sun Alliance is not withdrawing from payment
protection business in general.
NHL said it expects to sign a new payment protection insurance scheme with
an insurer next week. The scheme will be slightly more expensive for NHL
customers.
About 750 NHL mortgagees are claiming on their payment protection policies

FT  31 JAN 92 / Regulator relies on price cap to maintain control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST way of regulating BT's prices is by a price cap rather than by
controlling the telecommunications company's profits directly, Oftel, the
industry regulator, made clear yesterday.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, also said, however, that
profits had to play an important part in deciding the appropriate price cap.
The main consideration was to set a cap that would lead to BT's making
'reasonable' profits if it achieved likely levels of efficiency.
Unlike previous price reviews, Oftel will be conducting this one mainly in
the open. In particular, it is making explicit what it means by reasonable
profits, has disclosed how BT's actual profits have diverged from its
forecasts, and has published disaggregated profits of the company's
different services for the first time.
Oftel says that in judging reasonableness, profits as a proportion of
capital employed should be weighed against the company's 'cost of capital' -
what it must pay to raise finance. That is the level of profitability that a
company in a competitive market would expect to earn.
Oftel uses two measures for cost of capital. The first is a calculation of
how much BT would have to pay to raise funds through a mixture of debt and
equity, taking into account the fact that its business is less risky than
most of the rest of British industry.
The second is an attempt to judge what rate of return investors are looking
at by comparing the company's share price with expectations of future
dividends.
Ideally, Oftel would do all those calculations on a current-cost -
inflation-adjusted - basis, but it has to rely on BT's conventional
historic-cost accounts.
On that basis Oftel calculates that a reasonable rate of return is 17 per
cent to 20 per cent for BT's regulated services. That is not directly
comparable with BT's reported return on capital because the figures cover
all its business.
Oftel calculates that in 1990-91 BT's return on regulated business was 25.4
per cent, compared with its expectations of 18 per cent when the last
comprehensive price review was conducted four years ago.
The implication is that BT's profitability is about 40 per cent higher than
expected. Another way of judging BT's profits is to compare them with those
of other companies (see table).
According to Oftel's document 'comparisons made on this basis suggest that
BT's returns are currently above average'. That conclusion is consistent
with an analysis of BT's profits last year by the Financial Times and Robert
Fleming Securities, the stockbroker.
Oftel's document explains how BT's profits diverged from expectations. The
main reason was that international call charges were not initially
regulated. If those are removed, the return on BT's regulated businesses was
only 20 per cent in 1990-91.
A tighter price cap, requiring BT to cut the average level of prices by 6.25
per cent after inflation, came into effect in September and is intended to
correct that.
Sir Bryan made clear that the decision on the new price cap would have to
take into account expectations of how effective the current price cap would
be in reducing BT's profitability.
The fall in BT's quarterly profits, announced yesterday, is evidence that
the tighter cap is having some effect. But other factors were also
responsible, in particular the weak economic climate and growing
competition.
The breakdown of profits for each of BT's main services supports the
company's case that it loses money in supplying telephone lines to
residential and business customers. It also shows BT is earning very high
profits on international and domestic long-distance calls.
It does not support BT's contention that the situation is deteriorating. Its
loss on residential line rentals as a percentage of capital employed fell to
11.8 per cent in 1990-91 from 14.3 per cent in 1989-90.
So the jury would still seem to be out on whether BT should be given greater
flexibility to increase rental charges - something likely to be one of the
most contentious features of the review.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Car tax backfired, retail group claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last year raised taxation on motor vehicles so much that it
actually lost Pounds 2.1bn of potential revenue through reduced sales,
servicing and other activities, the Retail Motor Industry Federation said
yesterday.
Last year's Budget has also accelerated closures among franchised dealers,
with 10 per cent having closed or been sold off last year, the federation
claims in a submission to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Mr Neil Marshall, the federation's director of economic affairs, said that
by the middle of this year a total of 25,000 jobs would have been lost over
12 months among car dealers and distributors. The car trade is the UK's
largest retailing sector.
In its submission, aimed at influencing March's Budget, the federation calls
for the abolition of special car tax; the scrapping of existing plans to
impose, from April, National Insurance contribution charges on employers for
their employees' private use of company cars, and for companies to be able
to claw back 50 per cent of VAT on car purchases. Currently, cars are the
only area of businesses' operational expenditure where VAT is
non-deductible.
Although the government's total tax take from the motor sector did rise
again last year, to Pounds 21bn from Pounds 19.9bn according to federation
stimates, the extra revenue forgone as a consequence of collapsed confidence
and reduced activity was equivalent to a penny in the pound off income tax,
Mr Marshall argued.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Councils back wider pension scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 200,000 part-time workers in local government are likely to win
the right to join a pension scheme after local-authority associations agreed
to back a union claim that they should be admitted.
The decision by the associations representing county, metropolitan and
district authorities follows years of argument by the unions that the Local
Government Superannuation Scheme is discriminatory because it is not open to
council staff who work fewer than 15 hours a week.
Most part-time workers in local government are women.
The council associations are to write to the Department of the Environment
advising that the rules should be changed. Approval is expected to be given
because a similar change was made recently in health service pension
schemes.
Separately, local-government unions claimed a breakthrough in their campaign
for shorter hours when Kirkcaldy council, in east Scotland, agreed to a
36-hour week for 880 manual workers. The agreement to reduce hours from 39 a
week is one of the first to be negotiated at a UK local authority since
employers agreed as part of last year's national pay deal that they would
negotiate to introduce a 37-hour week by January 1994.
Measures to make it self-financing might include the introduction of monthly
rather than weekly pay.
The council associations' move on pensions was welcomed by Mr Donald
Macgregor, national officer at the GMB general union. He said it would
benefit thousands of council employees. 'It means that our members are on
the road to being treated with the respect they deserve.'
Local authorities have resisted the inclusion of part-timers in the pension
scheme partly because of cost implications. However, many councils believe
that maintaining the status quo is unfair. Some are also doubtful whether it
will increase costs because they believe many part-timers will choose not to
join the pension scheme.
One reason is that any pension could affect social security benefits after
retirement.
The Tate Gallery, the British Museum and the main part of the British
Library will be closed to the public today as London civil servants stage a
one-day strike over pay.
Jobcentres, unemployment benefit offices, the passport office and ministries
will also be affected by the strike called by the CPSA and NUCPS Civil
Service unions in protest against the government's refusal to raise London
weighting.
Union members will also picket the entrance to Downing Street, which
includes the home of the chancellor of the exchequer, who is responsible for
Civil Service pay.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Profit-linked pay plans double to
3,000 in year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies with profit-related pay schemes more than doubled to
almost 3,000 last year, according to figures released by the Inland Revenue
yesterday.
The number of individual employees enrolled in schemes rose to nearly
600,000.
Profit-related pay schemes, which were introduced in 1987, offer tax relief
to employees up to a certain proportion of their salary. The number of
companies with schemes rose to 2,949 in the 12 months to last December,
compared with 1,233 a year earlier. The number of employees covered rose
from 263,400 to 581,000.
The number of employees covered by schemes still represents only 2 per cent
of the British working population.
Much of the increase took place in the last quarter of 1991, which the
Revenue said reflected attempts to register before the beginning of the new
tax year in April.
Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the figures
reflected the doubling of tax relief for schemes announced in the 1991
Budget and they represented a 'major boost' to the idea of profit-related
pay.
Ms Jenny Davenport, head of employee relations and communications at the
Industrial Society, said: 'Performance-related pay is a bit of a
performance. It's a good thing but not terribly relevant.'
She said the limited level of tax relief offered under the scheme, the delay
before relief was paid and the bureaucracy involved in administering the
scheme explained why adoption rates were not higher.
Profit schemes have to cover 80 per cent of the employees in a company and
use a complex formula to fix payments.

THE DECISION of the judge in the Blue Arrow fraud trial to direct the
acquittals of all three corporate defendants met with a muted response
yesterday from the companies concerned.
Only the briefest of statements welcoming the decision was issued by their
parent companies, National Westminster Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Neither wanted to comment further while proceedings continue against five
former employees of their acquitted subsidiaries, NatWest Investment Bank,
County NatWest and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities.
The judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, ordered the acquittals on the ground of
insufficient evidence.
His explanation to the jury was limited to saying that there were legal and
separate evidential reasons concerned with corporate criminal liability that
had led him to his decision.
The ruling had no bearing on the cases against the remaining defendants, he
said. They had all acted with the authority of their companies in buying the
shares rather than on some 'frolic' of their own.
The reasoning behind the judge's decision will become public only after the
end of all proceedings - including a possible second trial.
There is no doubt that yesterday's decision was received with considerable
relief by those in the parent companies.
The acquittals mean the removal of the prospects of both criminal
convictions and fines on a scale that few lawyers were prepared to speculate
about. Few legal precedents exist for the charge of corporate fraud and
there is little or no established tariff for possible fines.
The Guinness trial ended with Mr Gerald Ronson and Mr Jack Lyons being fined
Pounds 5m and Pounds 3.5m respectively, but those were penalties against
individuals and the charges were of theft and false accounting rather than
conspiracy to defraud.
With the Blue Arrow corporate defendants backed by companies of the size and
financial resources of NatWest and Union Bank of Switzerland, estimates that
fines could have run into tens of millions of pounds were commonplace.
The decision to award costs in the companies' favour was also welcomed by
them. The companies are continuing to meet the legal costs of the individual
defendants, but the refund from public finances following yesterday's
acquittals is likely to be substantial.
The total bill for defence costs is estimated by some to total Pounds 30m.
Neither NatWest nor P&amp;D were able to comment on the precise cost of
defending their corporate subsidiaries, but they certainly ran into several
million pounds each.
Yesterday's acquittals will be seen in both organisations as a further step
away from a serious corporate trauma.
At County, the publication of the Department of Trade and Industry report
had a substantial effect on both its reputation and business.
Blue Arrow was one of many reasons, including the general management style,
that prompted the wide-ranging reorganisation after the appointment of Mr
Howard MacDonald as chairman and chief executive. Although the City's
regulators were quick to acknowledge the changes, it took time for the bank
to recover standing within the markets.
P&amp;D also saw organisational changes after Blue Arrow, although they would
have happened regardless as Union Bank of Switzerland introduced its
business philosophy into the partnership it was then in the process of
taking over. Nevertheless, concerns remain that the existence of criminal
charges against the company may have hampered its efforts to win some
business, such as government privatisation work.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Vosper Thornycroft to shed jobs at warship yard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOSPER THORNYCROFT, the smallest of the UK's four warship yards, is to cut
its workforce by several hundred in the next six months after a lack of
defence orders from the Royal Navy and from overseas.
The job losses, believed to be about 350, will take place mainly between
April and June and will be concentrated at the shipyard at Woolston,
Southampton, which has a workforce of 1,900, and at another unit in
Portchester, near Portsmouth.
The cut has been caused by a delay in funding a fourth minehunter to be
built for the Saudi Arabian navy and by postponement of the follow-up order
for Sandown class minehunters for the Royal Navy.
Mr Martin Jay, Vosper Thornycroft managing director, said yesterday: 'We are
obviously very sad to have to make this announcement, but the reduced GRP
(glass-reinforced plastic) workload forces us to take this step.'
The announcement is another illustration of the troubles facing defence
manufacturers as orders are cancelled or postponed in the wake of relaxation
of tension between the west and the former Soviet bloc.
The company hopes to avert further cuts by receiving the delayed Saudi order
and by the confirmation of an ex-pected corvette order from Oman.
It put in a bid for the frigate order announced by the Royal Navy earlier
this month but lost to Yarrow Shipbuilders on Clydeside.
The company says that in spite of redundancy costs and the reduction in GRP
work, it is financially strong and is well-placed to win new business at
home and abroad in its defence and civil markets.
Mr John Simmons, chairman of the local Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, said the yard was running out of new orders and it was
up to the government to release work to maintain employment.
'Our main effort now will be to convince the government it has to change its
mind on Royal Navy orders . . . You can't keep throwing people on the dole.'
A lobby of parliament is planned next week to coincide with a debate of
defence procurement.
Anglo Great Lakes Corporation, one of only two UK producers of graphite
electrodes for the steel industry, is to close its plant at Newburn,
Newcastle, with the loss of 230 jobs.
Mr Jim Munro, managing director, said yesterday a fall in demand from UK and
continental steel producers and steep increases in UK electricity costs led
to the decision.
Mr Munro will meet Mr Doug Henderson, MP for Newcastle North and Labour's
trade and industry spokesman, and trade union officials today at their
request to see if closure can be averted. He said Great Lakes Carbon
Corporation, the plant's American owner, had tried in vain to find
alternative markets for Newburn products.
Mr Henderson said: 'It is yet another example of a company going to the wall
in the recession because of under-investment and a failure to compete in the
European market.
'The gap in supply will apparently be met by competitors in Europe who are
more productive.'

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tea break loss brings widespread
protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOSS of a Friday morning tea break has provoked unrest among engineering
construction workers at several sites, including Grangemouth in Scotland and
Sizewell in Suffolk.
The break was scrapped as part of a cut in working hours agreed with unions.
However, some workers may take their break today in protest, in spite of the
agreement.
Reductions in the working week have been achieved widely in the engineering
and building industries, partly by phasing out tea breaks.
National officials from the AEU and EETPU engineering unions and the GMB,
MSF and TGWU general unions met yesterday in an attempt to quell the unrest.
Earlier this week 3,000 workers stopped work for half a day at two oil
refinery sites in Grange-mouth.
There have also been protests involving a total of up to 6,000 workers at
the Sizewell nuclear power station, the Shell Haven oil refinery in Essex,
two power station sites at Killingholme, Humberside, and at one of the sites
at the St Fergus gas-processing plant in Grampian, according to Construction
News, the trade newspaper.
The employers confirmed yesterday that there had been a walk-out at
Grangemouth but said working had been resumed according to the agreement
that took effect on January 6.
Mr John Porter, chief executive of the National Engineering Construction
Employers' Association, said the 'vast majority' of sites had accepted the
new terms. He added that there were still matters to be resolved at Sizewell
and at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site in Cumbria.
At those two sites some workers already worked a shorter day on Fridays, so
breaks were having to be cut from long shifts during the week, he said.
The agreement on reduced hours includes a 6.4 per cent increase in the
hourly pay rate and a cut in hours from 39 to 38. The first hour of overtime
will not now be paid at a higher rate. The deal means an overall pay
increase of just under 5 per cent, according to Incomes Data Services, the
pay research group.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Advertisers suffer as glitzy image
survives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE advertising industry is suffering from low profit margins, according to
a report commissioned by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising.
In 1990 the combined billings of all IPA agencies was Pounds 4.06bn, while
combined net profits totalled Pounds 50m.
At the same time, there is still a widespread perception that advertising
agencies are very profitable and pay their staff too much, the report finds.
In its introduction Mr Peter Mead, president of the IPA and joint chairman
of Abbot Mead Vickers, the advertising company, says: 'In some senses it is
sad that we feel it is necessary to publish this document at all.'
He emphasises that trust and respect are being undermined by the false view
that the advertising business paid itself too much and passed on the cost to
its clients.
'Our business can make an enormous difference,' he writes. 'It is not
unreasonable to expect that we should make both a reasonable living and a
fair profit for making that difference.'
The false impression of great wealth and profligacy has got about, the
report argues, because of a surge of higher profits in the mid 1980s and
'the typical ad agency bravado' which obscures the fact that advertising is
a precarious, low-margin business, the report says. The average advertising
employee earns Pounds 24,830.
The report also suggests that if public relations and marketing can argue
for professional status, then advertising is in a strong position to claim
similar recognition.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Moynihan approves imports of gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN opened its borders to gas trade with the rest of Europe yesterday by
approving two import deals and announcing the study of a pipeline link to
the Continent.
Mr Colin Moynihan, junior energy minister, told the Commons: 'A market in
which gas moves freely across frontiers and competes its way freely to final
consumers provides the best assurance for all . . . of the continued
development which will bring the environmental attractions of gas within
reach of the widest public.'
Mr Moynihan sanctioned an import deal agreed between National Power and
Statoil, Norway's state-owned oil and gas company, to buy 2.2bn cu metres of
gas a year.
Separately, he said Statoil could import a supply of gas to provide power
for one independent electricity generation project.
The approval leaves Statoil free to contribute the gas - about 1bn cu metres
of gas a year - to its agreed joint venture with BP and Norsk Hydro. The
three companies plan to set up a company in the UK to sell gas to the
industrial market.
The financial details of the deal will be finalised in the next month but it
is expected to involve Statoil and NH paying Pounds 10m to BP for a half
share in BP's existing gas marketing business in the UK.
Norwegian imports will go some way towards easing supply constraints in the
UK market, particularly in gas for power generation. A gas shortfall forced
up prices last year, making many proposed power stations uneconomic.
Although the Department of Energy has reversed its position on gas imports
since it vetoed British Gas's attempt to import Norwegian gas in 1985, Mr
Moynihan said yesterday that the department would still require importers to
submit individual deals for approval.
The feasibility of building a gas interconnector pipeline between the UK and
the Continent will be examined by six companies. Such a project is likely to
cost between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m.
British Gas, British Petroleum, Conoco, Elf, Norsk Hydro and Statoil will
complete a study late this year. The group will be chaired by Mr Geoffrey
Chipperfield, chief executive of the Property Services Agency and former
permanent secretary to the Department of Energy.
The link is unlikely to be built unless the companies perceive demand for UK
gas in Europe at attractive prices.
Kinetica, one of the new independent gas companies, yesterday agreed a deal
with National Power to transport gas to a new power station on Humberside.
The company won the transit contract in competition with British Gas. It
will provide a pipeline link between a Conoco gas terminal at Theddlethorpe
in Lincolnshire and National Power's plant at Killingholme, Humberside.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Policy on supplies attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISMANAGEMENT of Britain's natural gas supplies had necessitated the
decision to authorise imports from Norway, Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow
energy secretary, said in the Commons yesterday.
'Where there was abundance, the government's policies have created
shortage,' he said.
Mr Dobson protested that the government had encouraged the 'dash for gas' by
giving in to selfish demands of the privatised electricity companies instead
of telling them to consider Britain's long-term interests.
He feared that the UK would become dependent on gas imports not just from
Norway, but also from the Gulf, countries in the former Soviet Union and
from Algeria.
Mr Colin Moynihan, junior energy minister, told the Commons that it would be
necessary to examine the treaty with Norway concerning the Frigg field to
determine whether it required amending or renegotiating. He maintained that
the developments set in train would help significantly to open up
competition in the gas industry.
Mr Moynihan said companies participating in the feasibility study of a gas
pipeline between the UK and the Continent would be in a position to win
long-term contracts when the project was completed.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Prince's campaign builds up shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S launch of the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture
continues the prince's campaign to improve architectural standards.
The institute, which will open in October, represents a significant
development in his interest, which has so far been confined mainly to
speech-making.
Prince Charles dropped his first bombshell on the architectural world in
1984 by attacking the entire profession at a dinner to celebrate the 150th
anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects for incompetence
and inhumanity.
Speaking at St James's Palace in London last night, he explained the need
for an alternative school of architecture. He wants it to bridge the divide
between the professionals who design and those who build. He said he hoped
his institute would encourage 'an architecture of the heart'. He said: 'I
hope it can be based on real principles.'
His school would place considerable emphasis on learning craft skills, and
training architects in history and fine arts as well as technology.
He believes that modernist training, which has monopolised architectural
schools for 50 years, has over-emphasised functional and industrial aspects
of design at the expense of spiritual and human values.
The prince added: 'It is in bringing together the best traditions of the
past, and the diverse technological potential of the future, that I hope my
institute may become a crucible in which the architecture of the 21st
century can begin to be forged.'
The institute has grown out of two Prince of Wales's summer schools in
Oxford and Rome. Their students showed frustration with the system.
The head of the institute, the base for which is planned in two Crown Estate
houses designed by John Nash in Regent's Park, London, will be Dr Brian
Hanson, the prince's architectural secretary for the past four years.
The teaching staff includes some radical tutors representing a wide range of
philosophies: Mr Christopher Alexander from the University of California; Mr
Keith Critchlow from the Royal College of Art; Mr Abdel Wahed El-Wakil, a
distinguished Islamic architect; and Mr Leon Krier, who is master planner
for the Duchy of Cornwall's new-town development at Dorchester, Dorset.
The school will begin with a one-year foundation course for 150 students.
Fees have not been disclosed but are expected to be comparable with those of
other institutions.
Private donations have enabled this school to be launched at a time when
higher education is being forced to make economies.

FT  31 JAN 92 / SIB may drop unit trust plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and In-vestments Board is preparing to drop its controversial
proposal to allow unit trusts to be sold through far more outlets than
competing life assurance products, according to industry sources.
SIB made the proposal, known as 'depolarisation', because it viewed unit
trust charges as more transparent to the prospective purchaser than those of
life assurance investments.
The proposal provoked an outcry from the life assurance industry, which saw
it as aiding its competitors.
Under polarisation, imposed with the Financial Services Act in 1987, sales
agents may be 'tied', selling the products of a single producer, or
'independent', selling the products of several producers. The rule was
intended to help consumers to gauge the objectivity of the advice they were
given.
Since 1987 the life assurance industry has adapted to polarisation, building
large sales networks around both types of distributors. The number of
outlets for unit trust companies has shrunk.
SIB is not expected to make a formal decision until its meeting next month,
but industry sources said recent informal soundings suggested the proposal
had already been dropped.
Among the reasons for the move is the opposition of consumer groups.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, money policy adviser for the Consumers' Association, said
her group opposed the move, partly because research showed that sales agents
frequently misled buyers about the company for which they were working.
Depolarisation would only make it easier for that confusion to occur, unless
sales agents were forced to disclose their employer much more clearly.
The Unit Trust Association, which supported the proposal, has found itself
deserted by five of its most powerful members - life assurance companies
which also sell unit trusts.
The association sent a paper to SIB supporting the proposal. It attacked the
sales methods of the life industry in support of its arguments. The
association has been forced to back down and is submitting a new paper to
SIB.

FT  31 JAN 92 / ECGD adds Pounds 496m to bad debt provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Export Credits Guarantee Department has made fresh provisions
against possible bad debt - mainly in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia
 -amounting to Pounds 496m.
The ECGD provisions, disclosed yesterday with the agency's annual report for
the year ending March 31 last year, lift total provisions against sovereign
debt in 1990-91 to Pounds 7.6bn. The former Soviet republics were 'off
cover' for most of last year and remain so.
Only yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, agreed in a meeting with
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, that the UK would make available
Pounds 280m in new export credits for Russia and the other republics of the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
The provisions are sharply lower than in 1989-90, when a once-off charge of
Pounds 3.37bn was made as the agency adjusted to the introduction of a
controversial method of gauging its lending risks.
Notional borrowings at the financial year-end from the Consolidated Fund - a
discipline imposed by the Treasury - rose to Pounds 3.1bn from Pounds 2.39bn
a year earlier.
The ECGD remains coy on the exact levels of exposure to Yugoslavia and the
former Soviet bloc, saying only that it is in the region of Pounds 1bn. That
is small by comparison with Germany's export credit agency, which has
exposure in excess of DM29bn (Pounds 10bn) to the former Soviet republics
alone.
While acknowledgement of the provisions will arouse critics who argue that
taxpayers should not be asked to fund dubious export business, the
comparatively limited exposure will be seen as a vindication of the ECGD's
recent adoption of the portfolio management system, aimed at making a more
rigorous assessment of the level of risk involved in providing credit cover
to different countries.
Exporters have protested at the system, introduced in May, because it has
raised the cost of obtaining export credit insurance and put them at a
competitive disadvantage to foreign competitors.
Mr Brian Willott, chief executive of the ECGD since the start of this year,
admitted yesterday that for Britain's top 20 export markets, ECGD insurance
costs were between a third and two thirds more expensive than in France,
Italy, Germany or the US.
He said progress had been made in pressing foreign export credit agencies to
raise rates closer to those of the ECGD. He pointed to an Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development study due for completion in April
which will 'reveal the facts' on losses other countries face as a result of
adopting a laxer approach to the provision of export credit cover.
The annual report showed that gross premiums amounted to Pounds 180m, down
from Pounds 188m in the previous year. Claims paid rose to Pounds 968m, from
Pounds 913m, leaving a trading deficit of Pounds 646m (previous deficit
Pounds 3.13bn). Total business insured rose to Pounds 16.8bn from Pounds
15.7bn.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Venture capital fund-raising falls 70%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT UK venture capital companies raised Pounds 250m last year,
against Pounds 840m in 1990 and Pounds 1.7bn in 1989, according to the
British Venture Capital Association, Charles Batchelor writes.
In spite of the 70 per cent drop in fund-raising, independent venture
capitalists - which account for about 45 per cent of all venture capital
investments - still have more than Pounds 1.6bn available to invest, the
association said. That is equivalent to two years' worth of investments.
The decline in fund-raising last year was due in part to a more critical
attitude towards venture capital by investors, the association said. It was
also a reaction to the record fund-raising levels of the preceding two
years.
Venture funds normally take three to four years to invest their money before
they need to raise new finance.
Mr Adrian Beecroft, the association's chairman, said: 'Given the liquidity
of independent venture capital funds, it is hardly surprising that very few
firms attempted to raise capital in 1991.' It was natural for investors to
want to assess the impact of the recession on venture capital before
committing significant new funds, he added.
Earlier this month Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures, a venture fund, and Venture
Economics, a research group, estimated that Pounds 400m had been raised last
year.
The Confederation of British Industry is to undertake a review of the
provision of finance for smaller companies. It will look at the difficulties
they face and make recommendations for action. Small businesses are often
over-reliant on overdrafts when term loans or equity finance would be more
appropriate, it said.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Peat protection deal is attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL announced yesterday between Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and
horticultural company, and English Nature, the conservation organisation,
over areas of peat extraction was attacked by other environmental groups.
Under the agreement Fisons, the biggest peat producer in the UK, is donating
nearly 8,000 acres of peatland to English Nature. Of that, 2,800 acres that
have planning permission for peat extraction will be managed by English
Nature for conservation purposes.
That leaves 5,000 acres where Fisons is already extracting peat and will be
allowed to continue to do so. The Ipswich-based company has promised to
assist in restoring the land for conservation after commercial use ends.
Fisons said its peat production would continue at existing levels.
Environmental organisations say that stripping the earth for peat destroys
irreplaceable lowland bogs. All the sites are listed as of special
scientific interest.
Mr Robin Maynard, of Friends of the Earth, speaking for the Peatlands
Campaign, a consortium of environmental organisations, said English Nature
was sanctioning the destruction of its own sites of special scientific
interest.
Mr Bob Lankester, chairman of Fisons' horticulture division, said the
agreement was a 'balanced way forward'.
Mr Tony Baldry, junior environment minister, congratulated Fisons and
English Nature on the agreement.
Yesterday Friends of the Earth and people from Thorne, near Doncaster, South
Yorkshire, took a 7,000-name petition to Mr Michael Heseltine, environment
secretary, asking him to save Thorne Moors, one of the sites handed to
English Nature on which peat extraction will continue.
Other sites given to English Nature in the deal are Hatfield Moor, South
Yorkshire, Glasson Moss and Wedholme Flow in Cumbria and Shapwick Heath and
Westhay Moor in Somerset.
English Nature advises the government on conservation and manages sites of
special scientific interest.
Environmentalists have seen Fisons as a test case for getting institutional
investors to put pressure on a company. Fund managers and insurance
companies that control more than 40 per cent of Fisons shares were asked to
urge the company to cease peat cutting.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Legal test of VAT ruling goes ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN COMPANIES are to challenge in the High Court the legality of a decision
by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, requiring them to pay VAT monthly
instead of quarterly from the autumn.
The companies are Allied Lyons, Arjo Wiggins Appleton, Bank of Scotland,
Barclays Bank, British Telecom, Burton Group, Courage, Kingfisher, National
Westminster Bank and Next.
Yesterday the court gave them leave to make an urgent application for
judicial review on the ground that the chancellor had no power to act as he
did.
The companies are also challenging a move by Customs and Excise - as
recorded in a letter to the VAT In Industry Group in November - to implement
Mr Lamont's decision by making new directions under the VAT regulations.
Last October the chancellor announced the government's decision to
reintroduce the 'postponed accounting system' for VAT on goods and related
services acquired from the rest of the European Community. He said it would
cause a one-off cashflow loss to the exchequer in 1992-93.
To prevent any increase in the public-sector borrowing requirement, he
decided the largest VAT traders should account for the tax monthly instead
of quarterly.
That would apply to traders whose net payments exceeded Pounds 2m over the
period covered by their last four quarterly returns up to March 31 this
year.
The companies, which all expect to exceed the Pounds 2m figure, say the
decision will increase administrative costs, affect cashflow and put them at
risk of surcharges and penalties for accounting errors.

NEGOTIATIONS on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), linking the
US, Canada and Mexico, are moving at a rapid pace, but President Bush's
brief reference to the talks in his State of the Union message sent a signal
to political observers that he is still keeping his options open.
In an effort to secure a draft agreement before the end of the month, trade
negotiators from the three countries have planned an almost non-stop series
of meetings, culminating in a possible head-of-state reunion at the end of
February. On Sunday, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, will head
a delegation to Mexico of congressmen and businessmen, and Mrs Hills will
meet with President Carlos Salinas.
Next Tuesday, the chief trade negotiators will meet in Ottawa, Canada; and
next weekend the three trade ministers will meet in Annapolis, Maryland. A
further ministerial meeting has been pencilled in for the end of February in
Dallas, Texas.
Reports from Mexican newspapers suggest that negotiators have completed 15
draft chapters of a total of 18.

FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US says Spain abused OECD rules on aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Spain have become embroiled in a row over a suspected attempt by
Madrid to circumvent tough new curbs against the misuse of aid to buy market
share in developing countries.
Washington, supported by many of its fellow members of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has accused Spain of abusing
the new rules by launching two unusually large lines of export credit only a
fortnight before the restrictions come into effect.
The new rules will restrict the use of such assistance to genuine
development aid, such as schools and hospitals, and ban it entirely for
richer developing countries.
The dispute blew up after Spain informed the OECD's Paris headquarters that
it had agreed to make available SDR723m (Pounds 565m) of mixed aid and
commercial credit to Mexico and SDR650m to Venezuela, both of which would be
ineligible for such assistance under the new rules.
These credit lines, the latest in a long-standing Spanish campaign to
promote trade links with Latin America, are available for two years and are
made on condition that the recipients use them to purchase Spanish exports,
an OECD official said. Their combined value of SDR1.4bn compares with
Spain's Dollars 800m (Pounds 446m) aid budget for 1990, according to the
OECD's latest records. Spanish officials say most of - if not all - the
credit lines are simply existing credits which had not been fully taken up
and which are being renewed.
They are among the five largest concessional credit lines ever recorded by
the OECD, an official close to the talks said. A US official added that the
move was a serious breach of the agreement.
Italy, which like Spain, had resisted the new curbs, has also made available
unusually large concessional credits recently, but these are not nearly
large enough to cause a political problem, officials say.
The curbs were agreed in principle at the end of last October, pending
ratification by OECD members' parliaments. They received their final touches
at an OECD meeting in Paris this week, and will come into effect on February
15.
The new rules allow OECD members to vet each others' aid projects in advance
to ensure aid budgets are not used for schemes that could be commercially
financed. Projects of more than SDR50m must be examined by a committee of
OECD members.

<TEXT>
THE World Bank has asked the 'Aid Sri Lanka' group of western donors to
pledge Dollars 860m (Pounds 475m) - Dollars 630m for projects and the rest
for balance of payments support - when they meet in Paris next week.
Last year Sri Lanka received an all-time high of Dollars 1bn.
The World Bank has told the government it must limit the budget deficit to 8
per cent of gross national product; 'commercialise' three state-owned banks,
and the tea and rubber plantations run by two state corporations; devalue
the Sri Lanka rupee; reform labour laws to facilitate retrenchment;
introduce higher interest rates; and impose a stricter monetary policy.
A US delegation led by Senator Larry Pressler recently spoke of Sri Lanka as
'a fine example of how to use development aid' and commended the trend
towards 'privatisation and free market economies'. The US has pledged
Dollars 55m and 20 per cent of the World Bank support.
However, some EC countries and Canada are critical of the government's
failure to negotiate a settlement of the 15-year-old Tamil separatist
insurgency in the north and east.
A parliamentary delegation from Canada, one of the leading critics of the
government's human rights record, offered to mediate. But the offer was
rejected, largely because President Ranasinghe Premadasa has come under
furious attack from majority Sinhala groups openly backed by the Buddhist
clergy.
A 'new-right' Sinhala Defence League (SAS) has been launched by a former
general secretary of the ruling United National Party, who resigned over the
India-Sri Lanka 'peace accord'.
The SAS insists that the Tamil 'tigers' should be militarily defeated before
any concessions are made. The policy has been taken up by a new party formed
by three former ministers who were sacked when their plan to impeach Mr
Premadasa collapsed.
While the donors and the World Bank are worried that defence spending
exceeds 5 per cent of GDP, a western ambassador said the opposition made the
president look 'moderate and sensible'.

FT  31 JAN 92 / World leaders to call for enhanced UN role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN
Correspondent

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD leaders meeting in New York today will call both for a more active
peace-making and peace-keeping role for the United Nations and more
stringent controls on nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, in a
joint declaration proposed by the UK.
The UN ambassadors of the Security Council members reached broad agreement
last night on the proposals which will be submitted to government leaders
for adoption at the Council's first-ever summit session today.
The draft of the declaration, to be read on behalf of the members at the end
of the summit tonight , asserts that the world now has the best chance for
achieving international peace and security since the UN was founded in 1945.
The Council declaration proposes that the secretary-general submit by July 1
recom mendations to strengthen and make more efficient the UN's capacity for
preventive diplomacy, an area in which it has a particularly poor record.
This could cover its role in identifying potential crises and areas of
instability.
The draft also deals with arms control, the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, nuclear proliferation and the problem of chemical weapons.
Sir David Hannay, the UK ambassador, who led the drafting, emphasised last
night that now it was up to the government leaders, because there was never
an intention that the declaration be agreed by ambassadors before the
summit, then for it to be rubber-stamped.
The summit meeting will be chaired by Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, because Britain holds the rotating presidency in January. He
proposed the session to reinvigorate the UN and set a political course for
the five-year term of Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, of Egypt, who became
secretary-general on January 1.
Most of the Security Council members consider that Mr Boutros-Ghali should
be urged to adopt a higher profile on the international stage than has been
the practice for a UN secretary-general.
Apart from spelling out new preventive diplomacy and financial proposals, Mr
Boutros-Ghali is also expected to suggest ways in which the UN could quickly
mobilise small military contingents for deployment in trouble spots.
Citing the example of the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait, under the authority
of the UN, the declaration is expected to place particular emphasis on the
principle of collective security as a means of dealing with future threats
to peace.
It will also reiterate the need for member states to carry out their
obligations under existing arms control agreements, to bring negotiations on
chemical weapons to a rapid conclusion, and to strengthen nuclear
non-proliferation arrangements.
Just as important as the summit itself will be bilateral meetings today and
tomorrow.
Those to be held by President George Bush of the US with Mr Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian president, who will be making his first appearance at the UN,
and Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, promise to be particularly
significant.
Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin, who are due to meet at Camp David near Washington
tomorrow, are expected to have detailed discussions on their respective
proposals for significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of the US
and Russia.
Apart from the proposed cuts in the land-based multi-warhead missiles of
both sides, the discussions will focus on Mr Yeltsin's proposal that the US
and Russia should co-operate on a global system of defence against
long-range missiles.

BULLDOZERS and builders are to move into Algeria's teeming slums in an
offensive against misery and Islamic fundamentalism, Reuter reports from
Algiers.
Algeria's new rulers announced a crash programme aimed both at pushing aside
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), their main opponents, and attracting
support from ordinary Algerians.
The interior minister, Mr Larbi Belkheir, unveiled the programme on
Wednesday evening after an emergency meeting of officials from all 48
provinces.
'The absence of the state in the last three years brought a situation of
anarchy essentially due to negligence . . . towards the worries of some
citizens and the application of the laws,' the Algerian news agency quoted
him as saying.
The FIS, denied victory at the polls by the halting of Algeria's general
election this month, has built up a strong following among the poor -
particularly the young.
This week it appealed for money to help the homeless. The authorities
promptly ruled the move illegal.

<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said yesterday none of the funds
Israel hopes to receive from US-guaranteed loans would be used for Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
'The funds we shall obtain through the loans will be devoted only, and
entirely, to the purpose of absorbing the olim (immigrants) and not for
building settlements,' he said.
Mr Shamir said he thought his declaration would satisfy Washington, which is
linking approval of Israel's request that it guarantee Dollars 10bn (Pounds
5.7bn) in loans to some form of a freeze in settlement in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
'We will speak to (Washington), and we will see if it satisfies them,' Mr
Shamir said after a speech to an Israel Bond corporation conference.
Israel's ambassador to the US, Mr Zalman Shoval, said on returning from
Washington yesterday that there would be tough bargaining over US-imposed
settlement limits.
Mr Shoval said: 'We are only at the beginning of a very long process of
negotiations, and I definitely expect there will be difficulties. However, I
do hope a way will be found for us to get the guarantees.'
This week there were claims that Israel and Washington had reached a
compromise that no new settlements would be built after Israel completes
9,000 already started in the disputed territories. But Israeli officials
said the announcement was premature.
Mr Shamir called the reports 'incomplete and inexact,' and said the US had
shown 'a certain willingness' to compromise in Israel's favour.
In another development, leaders of the opposition Labour party yesterday
endorsed an agreement with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party
setting the stage for early general elections on June 23.
'We will recommend holding the election on June 23,' Labour's parliamentary
chairman Mr Haim Ramon said.
Mr Shamir proposed early elections after losing his majority in parliament
last week when the far-right Tehiya and Moledet parties quit the coalition
in protest at perceived concessions to Palestinians in US-brokered Middle
East peace talks.
The elections had been originally scheduled for November.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Japan's PM announces further defence review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is considering cuts in its defence forces, in response to the end of
the Cold War and the reductions in US and former Soviet military forces, Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, announced to the Diet late this week,
Stefan Wagstyl writes from Tokyo.
He said the Defence Agency had started a review of personnel and hardware,
which could lead to cuts in the mid-1990s.
Japan has already reduced planned increases in defence spending by delaying
the introduction of new weapons and other measures.
The government is proposing to raise defence spending in the financial year
starting in April by just 3.8 per cent - the lowest increase in over 30
years.
However, Mr Miyazawa, regarded as a dove in the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, has often indicated that he would like Japan to respond more clearly
to the end of the Cold War.
He said in a policy speech at the opening of the Diet last week that the
current 1991-95 defence programme had been decided in late 1990, but that
even since then there had been major changes in the international situation,
including the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
On Tuesday, he said the review, the first to be carried out since Japan
began a defence build-up in 1976, and slated for 1993, had already started.
It will include regulations covering the size of the defence forces.
The 1976 regulations specify that the army should have around 180,000
troops, the navy 60 anti-submarine ships and 16 submarines and the air force
about 430 aircraft.
Mr Koichi Kato, the chief cabinet secretary, said the aim of the review
would be a reduction of the stipulated manpower levels.
For the army, or Ground Self Defence Force, a cut in the stipulated level
may have little effect since, due to recruitment difficulties, it can now
muster only about 153,000 troops.
Nevertheless, to consider cuts is a significant step for the Defence Agency
which has until recently been supervising a build-up in Japan's defence
forces.
Any cuts are likely to be preceded by long arguments between the services,
government ministries and politicians.
The timing of Mr Miyazawa's announcement has itself as much to do with
domestic Japanese politics as with the end of the Cold War. He needs the
support of the centrist Komei party to smooth the passage of the budget bill
through the Diet.
Komei has demanded defence spending cuts. Mr Miyazawa's offer of a long-term
review of spending is being seen in Tokyo as a peace offering to Komei.

THE president of the French Red Cross and three top government officials
resigned senior positions yesterday after the admission of radical
Palestinian leader George Habash to a Paris hospital for treatment for a
stroke, Reuter reports.
Mr Habash, whose Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine pioneered
aircraft hijacking, was flown to Paris by the Red Cross.
Ms Georgina Dufoix, the Red Cross president, offered her resignation as
adviser to President Francois Mitterrand, who accepted it. It was not clear
whether she would continue to head the Red Cross.
Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, demanded and obtained the resignations of
his director of cabinet, Mr Bernard Kessedjian, and his secretary-general,
Mr Francois Scheer.
The office of Prime Minister Edith Cresson said the director of cabinet at
the Interior Ministry, Mr Christian Vigouroux, had also offered his
resignation.
Mr Habash's admission to France from Tunisia on Wednesday provoked angry
condemnation from Israel and French opposition leaders. Israel's foreign
minister, Mr David Levy, called it a 'slap in the face' for his country. 'It
does France no honour.'
Mr Francois Leotard, a senior figure in France's centre-right opposition,
said: 'This is one of the world's leading terrorists. . . . I want to know
how this happened.'
Earlier, Mr Mitterrand had said Mr Habash's stay should be 'extremely
brief', and that a French judge investigating terrorism related to the
Middle East would have access to any information he needed.
Mr Scheer and Mr Kessedjian were the two top civil servants in the Foreign
Ministry. The former, responsible for administration, has had wide
experience in Middle Eastern affairs. He recently negotiated a long-standing
financial dispute between France and Iran.
Mr Kessedjian, the ministry's top political officer, was chief adviser to Mr
Dumas on all aspects of foreign policy.

FT  31 JAN 92 / European Court questions Danish tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DANISH import and production tax on companies was illegal under European
Community law, according to the advocate-general of the European Court.
In an opinion delivered yesterday in Luxembourg, the advocate-general said
the tax conflicted with the EC's sixth value-added tax directive, which
forbids new taxes levied on a VAT basis.
The tax was introduced in 1987 after the conclusion of a particularly
expensive collective wage round. The government scrapped the employers'
social security contribution, levied on the basis of the company's wage
bill, and introduced in its place a tax levied on the company's total import
bill and on value added in production for the domestic market. The tax,
which did not apply to export sales, was levied at 2.5 per cent.
Import companies brought the case against the government, claiming that the
tax was discriminatory and in conflict with the Treaty of Rome. The case was
originally taken to a Danish court, which asked the European Court for an
opinion.
The tax raised DKr9.4bn (Pounds 850m) in 1991 and, over four years, has
raised more than DKr30bn, equal to about 40 per cent of last year's revenue
from value-added tax.
In November last year, the government, in anticipation of the court's
verdict, repealed the tax and instead increased the standard value-added tax
from 22 to 25 per cent, with effect from January 1 this year.
It is thought unlikely the European Court will ask the government to repay
the taxes. Trade groups representing Danish companies said yesterday they
were considering whether or not they would seek reimbursement through the
Danish courts, although it is unclear what sums might be involved since much
of the tax was passed on to customers through prices.
Mr Henning Dyremose, Danish finance minister, said he still expected that
the European Court's final judgment would go in favour of the government,
while Mr Thor Pedersen, home affairs minister, said there could be no
question of repaying the tax to business claimants.
The advocate-general's opinion is usually followed by the European Court.

</HEADLINE>

   CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is likely to fall in the next few months,possibly
next month, according to a senior Russian parliamentarian accompanying
President Boris Yeltsin on his trip to the US.
Mr Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the parliament's foreign relations committee,
told a private audience at Harvard University that 'the possibility of the
government falling is quite realistic'. He was speaking off the record, but
later let his speech be reported.
Mr Lukin said Mr Yeltsin would be able to dissociate himself from the
government in spite of being its head - he is also prime minister.
Mr Lukin added: 'The most important thing is for the president to survive.
Where the government has a popularity rating of only 10 per cent, Mr Yeltsin
has a rating of around 40 per cent'.
He warned of possible serious social disturbances in February and March,
when food held in people's refrigerators ran out. The next government, he
said, would be composed of people 'with their feet on the ground, practical
people'.
They would re-establish price controls on a much wider range of goods than
at present, and would give more prominence to rapid privatisation. 'The
important thing is to be able to change the personalities while keeping up
reform'.
Aides travelling with Mr Lukin said the Russian parliament would be likely
to pass legislation to deprive Mr Yeltsin of the right to appoint ministers
by decree. Parliament would demand the right of joint control of ministerial
appointments.
Mr Lukin, whose memorandum to Mr Yeltsin, advising him to take a tough line
towards Ukraine, was leaked last week to the Russian press, called in his
speech for a 'slowdown' in the disintegration of the former USSR in order to
allow the military forces to be properly divided among Russia and Ukraine.
Mr Lukin, in his memorandum, called for the Black Sea Fleet to be transfered
to Russian jurisdiction. If Ukraine objected, Russia should threaten to
reopen the question of control of the Crimea, where the fleet has bases. The
Russian parliament is discussing the legality of the transfer, in the 1950s,
of the area from Russian to Ukrainian rule.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Commission may try to raise ceiling on EC revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FARM and regional spending will gobble up most of a likely modest increase
in EC revenue over the next five years.
The Commission has not yet finalised its 1993-97 finance package, due to be
unveiled to the European parliament on February 12. But already it seems
plain that an increase of about two thirds planned for regional development,
and rises in farm spending which cannot yet be fixed because of uncertainty
over reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), will absorb at least 60
per cent of the increase.
This leaves little over to finance the bigger foreign aid obligations the EC
expects to assume towards eastern Europe and North Africa, and the desire of
the Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, to set up a fund for
restructuring, retraining, and research in the car, defence, electronics and
textiles industries.
Officials expect the Commission to try to raise EC revenue to 1.35 per cent
of Community gross national product by 1997, from its ceiling of 1.2 per
cent now. This year's budget of Ecu66bn (Pounds 47bn) is below the current
ceiling, at 1.14 per cent of GNP, so that the 1997 budget would be Ecu86bn
at current prices, assuming annual EC growth of 2.5 per cent.
Several officials now believe a bigger increase would be resisted by the
current net contributors to the EC budget: Germany (by far the largest), the
UK and France. Germany, moreover, 'is not going to commit itself until it
knows what's happening on farm spending,' a senior Commission official said.
He added that 'if we stay within 1.35 (per cent), there will be limits; we
will have to choose among our options'.
Regional spending looks set to rise from Ecu17.7bn this year to Ecu29bn in
1997, at 1992 prices. This would include a new 'cohesion fund' worth up to
Ecu2.5bn to help Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece meet EC environmental
standards and put in cross-border transport links.
The Commission's original costing of its CAP reform plans would raise farm
spending from Ecu35.3bn this year to Ecu38.6bn in 1997. Both figures look
optimistic. But reform would initially cost even more, with spending
reaching close to Ecu40bn in 1996, and it is unlikely that it can be
financed without bigger allocations.
Spending on what would become a separate budget category for foreign policy
would get priority, but still remain modest, rising from less than Ecu3bn to
just over Ecu5bn at current prices.
The Commission has not agreed on Mr Delors' so far undocumented plan to
regroup spending on research and unemployment into a fund to raise
competitiveness in the face of industrial restructuring in the 1990s.
The two core ideas are: that research spending should be brought closer to
the market, able to respond to innovation in industry; and that the part of
Social Fund spending on long-term unemployment which is not tied to regions
could be used to intervene to prevent job losses through retraining in the
four targeted industries.
Mr Delors appears to be testing the water before making a formal proposal.
However, the tight arithmetic suggests any new fund would not get more than
about Ecu 5bn in 1997.
EC governments yesterday received the final version of the Maastricht treaty
on European union for signature next week, after vain Dutch and Irish
attempts to alter aspects of the controversial social policy protocol agreed
by Britain's 11 partners, writes David Buchan in Brussels.
Negotiated at last month's Maastricht summit, the 'treaty on union' is
likely to be signed on February 7 in Maastricht at a meeting of foreign and
finance ministers.
The past month, spent in cleaning up the text for signature, has produced a
treaty whose substance is virtually identical to that agreed by EC leaders
on December 11.

FEARS of renewed violence in Yugoslavia mounted yesterday after Mr Marrack
Goulding, the United Nations special envoy, said he would not be
recommending the deployment of 10,000 UN peace-keeping troops to Croatia.
Mr Goulding, who returned to the US after ending negotiations with Croat,
Serb and federal army officials, said differences of interpretation of the
UN peace plan continued to block the deployment of the peacekeepers, despite
a three-week ceasefire. Western diplomats yesterday expressed fears that the
ceasefire could be broken if there was substantial delay in deploying the
peacekeeping troops.
While Croatia has some objections to the plan, the strongest oppostion comes
from leaders of Serb regions in Croatia. Mr Milan Babic, head of the
self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina, southern Croatia, is refusing to
allow the deployment of peacekeepers there, and is calling for the
Serb-dominated federal army to remain in Serb-populated regions of Croatia.
He says Serb irregulars will not be disarmed unless Croat forces are also
disbanded.
The Serb-controlled state presidency, which may now exert considerable
pressure on Mr Babic to accept the plan, said yesterday in a statement that
'it had drawn up an unspecified programme of activities' to gain backing for
the plan from Serb leaders in Croatia.

<TEXT>
JOB cuts at German car makersare inevitable because of high labour and
manufacturing costs and the need to slim down in line with the rest of the
European industry, the industry association (VDA) warned yesterday.
It also said the possibility of a steel industry shutdown - a strike ballot
to be completed tomorrow is expected to show a big majority for a stoppage -
would hit car manufacturers in two days. Steel stocks are low because the
industry has operated at full stretch to meet domestic demand.
Mrs Erika Emmerich, the VDA's president, said Germany's advanced
technological standards were no longer enough in a climate of fierce
competition. 'Whichever way you look at it, we produce too expensively, she
said.'
Jobs in the motor industry had fallen by 10,000 in the last few months of
1991; this followed a rise of the same amount to 787,000 (including
components makers) in the first seven months, mostly spurred by
post-unification demand.
Mrs Emmerich's comments are in line with recent complaints in much of German
industry that high labour costs, tough environmental laws, and lengthy
approval processes for new plants are eroding competitiveness.
This year will pose challenges for the German motor industry as the recent
surge in domestic demand is likely to be followed by an expected 12-15 per
cent decline while foreign markets remain depressed. Mr Achim Diekmann, the
VDA's general manager, said production levels could only be maintained if
manufacturers raised their share of foreign markets. Last year, west German
car output was unchanged at 4.7m units, with truck production 12.5 per cent
higher at 356,000. Car exports fell by 16 per cent to 2.2m.
He declined to estimate what effect this might have on unemployment but
said: 'We can't overlook the fact that the German industry has some catching
up to do in the reduction of personnel.'
The German union DAG said it wanted a 10 per cent pay rise for 3.3m west
German shop workers, Reuter reports from Hamburg.
Orders for west German plant and machinery rose last month for the first
time in a year, the VDMA manufacturers' association said yesterday. Export
demand was 3 per cent higher and German orders were 4 per cent up in real
terms on December 1990, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn.
The aggregate 4 per cent rise was the one bright spot in a year in which the
value of orders fell 8 per cent.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Airlines suffer poor year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S airlines suffered their worst setback since the second world war
last year under the twin yokes of recession and the Gulf War.
The number of passengers fell by more than 7m to 99m, the Association of
European Airlines, which represents 22 scheduled carriers, said.
This was more than seven times the decline experienced in recessions in the
early 1980s and mid-1970s and confirm industry forecasts of grim trading
conditions. Only routes to Latin America managed a small improvement in
passenger numbers last year.
Traffic volume finished the year slightly below the level of 1989. 'Events
last year effectively cost the industry two years of growth,' the AEA said.
By comparison, in 1986 after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor
and the attack on Libya by US aircraft, passenger numbers fell 1.1m in five
months. It recovered to previous levels by the end of that year.
Air freight also suffered in 1991, with a 2.9 per cent decline in traffic.
Steepest losses were on the North Atlantic route.
Airlines cut capacity in response to falling demand. But passenger capacity
fell by under 2 per cent, less than the decline in demand. This meant that
the load factor, the proportion of seats occupied, was 68 per cent, down
three percentage points on the previous year. Airlines closely monitor this
figure as an indicator of profitability.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Italy increases central bank's independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S politicians yesterday approved a long-awaited law granting much
greater independence to the central bank regarding monetary policy.
The move has been accompanied by the first serious reorganisation of the
Treasury since 1889. Together, the two steps form part of an attempt to
improve management of economic and monetary policy and bring Italy closer
into line with European Community commitments on economic and monetary
union.
The most obvious symbol of the changes involves the divorce of the Bank of
Italy and the Treasury in the setting of the discount rate. The rate was
previously determined by the Treasury, but only on the recommendation of the
central bank, which retained a powerful voice in interest rate policy. The
bank will now be free to set the rate independently.
To reinforce its own economics team, the Treasury has appointed five new
directors-generals (equivalent to permanent secretaries in the UK civil
service) including two outsiders, among them Mr Francesco Giavazzi, a
prominent economist from Milan's Bocconi university, who will head a new
macroeconomic research department.
Mr Mario Draghi, the highly respected ex-IMF official brought into the
Treasury as director-general last year, is being promoted, but he will
retain his existing title.
A 10-man council of permanent advisers to further reinforce the Treasury is
also expected to be set up.
The developments mark an important attempt to get to grips with Italy's
long-standing structural economic problems, notably the massive government
budget deficit.
However, with a welter of new spending bills up for approval before the
dissolution of parliament (expected next week), Italy's politicians have yet
to show they have the determination to face the unpalatable choices that
curbing the deficit will require.
Nor has the government fully completed the divorce of the Treasury and the
Bank of Italy. That still needs a law to limit the government's right to run
a massive overdraft with the central bank. Mr Guido Carli, treasury
minister, has announced plans to bring in legislation to close the account.
However, it seems unlikely the step will be taken before parliament is
dissolved.

TACTICAL nuclear weapons have been withdrawn to Russia from all the other
former Soviet republics except Ukraine and Belarus, Marshal Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov, commander of the joint armed forces, said in London yesterday.
The weapons, previously spread throughout the former Soviet Union, have been
the principal source of concern about the possibility of nuclear arms
getting into the wrong hands. About 11,500 tactical nuclear arms are
believed to have been deployed with army, air defence and air force units,
but Moscow promised last year to destroy a large part of the stockpile.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, who was accompanying Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, told British officials that all the tactical weapons would be in
Russian sites by July. Strategic nuclear weapons are due to be withdrawn
from Ukraine by 1994 and from Belarus and Kazakhstan - the other two
republics outside Russia where they are based - by 1998.
Britain is to send specialists to Moscow to assess Russia's needs for
technical assistance in dismantling its nuclear arms.
The US will end or reduce operations at 83 more military installations in
Europe and bring home 17,000 troops from those sites, mostly in Germany, the
Defence Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
A Pentagon spokesman said the military was accelerating its reductions in
Europe and now planned to withdraw 106,600 troops instead of 86,600
previously announced for the year ending on October 1.
US troop strength in Europe had gone from 314,000 in September of 1990 to
227,000 and would be further reduced to 208,000 by the end of next
September.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA and Germany yesterday urged foreign ministers at the Prague
meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to
strengthen the forum's institutions and allow it to play a more active
mediation and peace-keeping role in member states.
The Conference, which groups 36 European states, the US, Canada, the Baltic
states, and 10 former Soviet republics, has no legal or political powers to
enforce agreements.
However, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, said it was
time to expand its role among member states in the field of security, and
change the rules of consensus.
'The CSCE should provide for the possibility of creating CSCE 'blue helmets'
and CSCE 'green helmet' missions to safeguard peace and the environment,' he
said.
Officials also discussed the possibility of changing the decision-making
process to a consensus minus one. Such a mechanism would also allow members
to condemn one member state.
Under the unanimity principle, Yugoslavia has refused the admission as
members of Slovenia and Croatia, which were recognised as independent states
by the European Community countries, among others, on January 15.
Slovenia and Croatia were instead granted temporary observer status.
Officials said that membership would be considered at the Helsinki meeting
in mid-July.
Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak president, suggested the creation in the
CSCE of a body similar to the United Nations Security Council.
This new council would be vested with certain executive powers from members
states in the security sphere.
'If the CSCE is to be a guarantor of the inviolability of frontiers, the
security of its member states and the protection of their democratic
constitutional systems, it must have instruments enabling it to perform this
function,' he said.
The US, however, reacted against such proposals. 'The most dangerous thing
for the CSCE is to launch a series of ideas to which members are not ready
to subscribe and which will therefore prove unworkable,' a senior US
official said.
The extent of the CSCE's role in monitoring peace settlements has been
discussed all summer as senior officials met regularly to issue declarations
on the Yugoslav crisis.
A possible new role for the CSCE was further highlighted yesterday after 10
former Soviet republics were admitted as full members.
Armenia and Azerbaijan have waged a virtual war over the disputed area of
Nagorno-Karabakh. Mr Raffi Hovannisian, Armenia's foreign minister, said he
would welcome CSCE peacekeeping missions in his republic.
The 10 republics were granted admission yesterday after Russia took over the
Soviet Union's seat, taking to 48 the number of member states. Only Georgia,
in the grip of civil war, did not apply for membership.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK to give Russia more aid: Major tells Yeltsin the Trident
programme will be maintained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Russia yesterday signed a declaration of friendship providing
for closer economic and military co-operation, including joint efforts to
reduce forces and armaments.
The 15-point declaration, to be converted into a treaty later this year and
including an agreement by Britain to give extra economic assistance to
Russia, was signed in Downing Street by Mr John Major, the in, the Russian
president.
Mr Yeltsin was making a stopover in Britain on his way to New York for
today's United Nations Security Council summit.
Mr Major, during four hours of 'warm and friendly' talks, made it clear to
Mr Yeltsin that Britain would not cancel or reduce its Trident nuclear
weapons programme, which represented a minimum 'credible deterrent'.
Although it had been suggested previously that Mr Yeltsin would put pressure
on Britain to reduce its nuclear weapons in line with the latest US and
Russian proposals to cut strategic arms, the Russian leader proved to be
surprisingly accommodating.
Mr Yeltsin said he respected the British government's decision, adding: 'The
number of nuclear weapons at the disposal of the UK is not comparable with
ours and therefore the matter is not really worth any discussion.' In spite
of Mr Major's declared intention to go ahead with the Trident programme, the
Russian leader announced on the steps of Downing Street that Russian
missiles would no longer be targeted at Britain, echoing a similar
undertaking he has already given to the US.
Mr Major said in a toast at a working lunch in Downing Street that the
visit, the first to Britain by Mr Yeltsin as Russian leader, had turned 'a
new page in history'. The joint declaration, 'Partnership in the Nineties',
was an indication that co-operation had replaced confrontation in Europe,
'we hope for ever'.
The extra UK economic assistance for Russia and other members of the new
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) pledged in the declaration is in
addition to financial and food aid it has already provided.
The UK would make available Pounds 280m in new export credits and investment
insurance for Russia and the other CIS republics, in the context of an
International Monetary Fund programme, Mr Major said. The UK, the first
country to propose Russian membership of the IMF, would also press for
Russia to be admitted to the organisation by April.
It would also make an improved European Community trade and co-operation
agreement with Russia one of the priorities of the next UK presidency of the
EC, which starts in July this year.
In the defence field, the UK has agreed to co-operate with the Russians in
handling surplus former Soviet nuclear weapons and safeguarding nuclear
materials.
Britain has also agreed to help in the restructuring of the former Soviet
armed forces and Mr Major announced that Ministry of Defence officials might
be sent on secondment to Russia's defence ministry. Mr Major said he and Mr
Yeltsin had agreed on further discussions on how the UK could help Russia
'to use the talents of their scientists in the cause of peaceful
development'.
The two leaders had agreed to set up a 'hot line' between their offices to
facilitate their new relationship and agreed on the opening of new British
and Russian consulates in St Petersburg and Edinburgh.
Mr Yeltsin said he had accepted an invitation to make an official visit to
Britain in the first half of this year and Mr Major is to visit Moscow in
the second half.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Oftel to keep firm control on BT prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFTEL, the regulator of the telecommunications industry, yesterday promised
to maintain firm control over BT's prices as it launched its most
comprehensive review of the company since privatisation.
The review, which is unlikely to be completed before the middle of the year,
will take place at a time of public debate over whether BT is earning
excessive profits.
The debate is expected to be particularly intense because of the general
election campaign and Oftel's decision to conduct the review in public.
BT yesterday announced a 4 per cent fall in third quarter pre-tax profits to
Pounds 759m from a previous Pounds 787m, a result of regulatory and
competitive pressures and the recession.
Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, countered criticism about BT's profitability,
saying it was reasonable. The Labour party, however, claimed profit levels
were still excessive.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, said the new price control,
which would take effect in August 1993, would 'provide BT with a tough
challenge'. But he said the current control was starting to affect BT's
profits.
Sir Bryan argued that a price cap was preferable to direct control of BT's
profits because this gave the company an incentive to cut costs and improve
efficiency.
Oftel published two consultative documents - one on BT's prices and the
other on its cost of capital - and invited comments by March 27. After the
consultation period, Sir Bryan will try to strike a deal with BT and if
unsuccessful, he can refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The main issues in the review are:
Should the price cap be tightened or loosened? At present, BT is required to
cut the average price of a basket of its main services by 6.25 per cent a
year less than the annual rate of inflation.
Should BT be allowed to increase line rental charges rapidly? At present, it
is barred from raising them by more than 2 per cent above the annual
inflation rate but argues it is losing money on the service.
Oftel said its investigations suggested there was justification for
increasing household rental charges to Pounds 100 a year from the current
Pounds 73.84, but gave no timescale for such a move. In that case trunk call
charges might be cut by 50 per cent and local call charges might go up by 30
per cent.
Many telephone users, for whom rental charges are a large portion of their
bills, would resist rapid increases.
The Telecommunications Users' Association hoped the review would stop BT
'manipulating prices in those areas where it holds a monopoly' - BT does
faces little competition in the residential market.
Oftel promised to review BT's policy on disconnecting non-paying customers.
'A utility with a captive market can abuse its position by using the threat
of disconnection to make sure that the company's interests always prevail
over those of the customer,' it said.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Arrest warrant issued for Nissan UK chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue has issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Octav Botnar,
chairman and managing director of Nissan UK, the former importer/distributor
of Nissan vehicles in Britain.
Mr Botnar, 78, was named in Teesside magistrates' court, Middlesbrough,
yesterday in charges brought against Mr Tore Arne Thorsen, manager of
Scansiris AS, a Norwegian freight transport company, alleging a corporation
tax fraud in which the pre-tax profits of NUK had been understated by Pounds
100m.
Separately Mr Michael Hunt, NUK assistant managing director and a
substantial personal shareholder in NUK, and Mr Frank Shannon, a former NUK
finance director, appeared in Worthing magistrates' court yesterday also
charged with alleged corporation tax fraud.
Mr Hunt, who was also named along with Mr Botnar in the charges against Mr
Thorsen, was charged in Worthing with alleged corporation tax frauds in
which NUK pre-tax profits had been understated by a total of Pounds 150m
over a period of 17 years. Mr Hunt, 58, was charged on two counts.
The first alleged that he had 'cheated' the Inland Revenue of corporation
tax between December 1 1982 and December 31 1991 'with intent to defraud'.
The charge alleged that he had arranged 'dishonestly' for the preparation of
'falsely inflated' invoices by Scansiris showing sums for freight charges
allegedly due from Nissan UK.
The charge stated that the invoices were charged in the Nissan UK accounts
for the years ended July 31 1983 to July 31 1992, causing pre-tax profits to
be understated by about Pounds 100m.
In the Middlesbrough magistrates' court the same detailed charge was made
against Mr Thorsen that 'together with Octav Botnar and Michael Hunt' he had
cheated the Inland Revenue with 'intent to defraud'.
Mr Hunt was also charged along with Mr Shannon that they had 'cheated' the
Inland Revenue of corporation tax between October 1 1975 and March 31 1983
'with intent to defraud'.
The charges alleged that they had arranged 'dishonestly' for the preparation
of 'falsely inflated' invoices by a Dutch company Autocontex BV showing sums
for freight charges allegedly due from Datsun UK (now called Nissan UK).
The charges stated that the invoices were charged in the Nissan UK accounts
for the accounting periods ended December 31 1976 to July 31 1983 causing
pre-tax profits to be understated by around Pounds 50m.
Mr Hunt and Mr Shannon are to appear again in Worthing magistrates' court on
February 25. Mr Thorsen from Grimstad, Norway, is to appear again in
Teesside magistrates' court on March 26. All three were released on bail.
Mr Hunt was released on bail totalling Pounds 175,000 and on condition that
he surrendered his passport and resided at home.
He gave an undertaking 'not to exert influence concerning the investigation
of the prosecution on any witnesses or potential witnesses including persons
who have connections with Nissan UK past or present'.
Nissan UK said yesterday that Mr Botnar was on holiday in Switzerland.
The Inland Revenue said: 'What we do in these cases is to approach the
lawyers of the person and invite them to come back.'
The Inland Revenue mounted a dawn raid against Nissan UK in June last year.
Codenamed Operation Bluebird, it was the largest search undertaken by the
Inland Revenue involving 135 of its officers.
In all 13 locations were searched, including the Worthing headquarters of
Nissan UK, the offices of some of its legal and financial advisers and the
homes of some current and former directors.
Late last year Mr Shannon, Mr Brian Laventure, a partner in the Portsmouth
office of Grant Thornton, the personal and corporate tax adviser to Nissan
UK, and Mr Gerald Compton, a partner in Kidsons Impey, the NUK auditor, were
arrested and charged with conspiracy to cheat the Inland Revenue.
They were charged in Worthing magistrates' court with conspiring to cheat
the Inland Revenue by filing false stock relief claims for Datsun UK, the
former name of Nissan UK, for the accounting periods ended July 31 1980 and
the year ended July 31 1981 amounting to Pounds 9m and Pounds 5.5m.
The charges claimed specifically that the three men conspired between March
19 1980 and July 14 1984 at Worthing and elsewhere:
To bring forward the accounting date for Datsun UK from December 31 1980 to
July 31 1980, 'falsely representing' that the change had been done for
commercial reasons unconnected to any tax liability, whereas 'the sole or

County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities -
were acquitted yesterday of joining the alleged conspiracy to mislead the
markets over the result of the employment agency's 1987 rights issue.
Instructing the Old Bailey jury to acquit the companies, the judge, Mr
Justice McKinnon, ruled that there was insufficient evidence for the cases
against them to proceed any further. With five of their former employees
still on trial, the companies issued only the briefest of statements
following the acquittals.
A National Westminster spokesman said that the parent bank was 'pleased'
that its subsidiary companies had been acquitted. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
welcomed the judge's ruling but said no further comment could be made while
the trial against the individual defendants continued.
Mr Justice McKinnon said the companies' acquittals did not affect the cases
against the remaining five individual defendants in any way.
'There are legal and separate evidential reasons concerning the companies
and how they can be liable in respect of crime which have led me to my
direction,' he told the jury.
The five defendants now left in the trial are: Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former
County chief executive; Mr David Reed, a former head of corporate finance at
County; Mr Nicholas Wells, a former County corporate finance director; Mr
Martin Gibbs, a former head of corporate finance at P&amp;D; and Mr Christopher
Stainforth, a former P&amp;D director.
Each individual defendant had had the authority of his employer to buy the
shares taken by County and P&amp;D in the rights issue, the judge said.
'There is no suggestion that any one of the individual defendants was on a
frolic of his own,' he added.
The jury, which had not sat since mid-December, was recalled to return the
not guilty verdicts. The judge told the jury he had reached his decision to
acquit P&amp;D on December 19 last year and his decision regarding the two
NatWest subsidiaries on January 17.
Costs - estimated at several million pounds - were awarded in the companies'
favour.
The trial will resume on Tuesday when Mr Justice McKinnon will begin his
summing up.
He told the jury that in his summing up he would have particular things to
say about Mr Stainforth.
The trial, which started on February 11 last year, is one of the longest in
criminal history. With estimates of its total cost exceeding Pounds 35m, it
will be the most expensive.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (13): When the spending
stopped - Consumer Electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE heady growth of the 1980s for the consumer electronics industry has come
to a screeching halt. The prolonged recessions in the US and the UK, along
with the slowdown of the Japanese economy, have put a drag on the industry.
But, just as important, electronics companies have hit a gap in the product
development cycle. The big mass-market products of years past such as video
tape recorders or Walkman-type cassette players have already found their way
into homes everywhere and sales have slowed down. Video recorder sales are
actually going into reverse in many of the big markets.
One of the few bright spots is the brisk sales of 8mm hand-held video
cameras, developed by Sony. Sales of the tiny video cameras has taken off
following repeated reductions in size and weight, along with steady
improvements in quality.
Profits at electronics companies have been hit hard in the Far East and in
Europe.
The travails of the European consumer electronics industry are well
established.
Philips, the Netherlands based group which is Europe's leading consumer
electronics group, is widely expected to emerge this year from a sustained
bout of cost cutting imposed by Mr Jan Timmer, the company's president. He
has taken Philips into important joint-ventures with Japanese producers to
help to develop the next generation of products as well as taking the
company out of some areas such as the loss making mini computer division.
The other leading European groups such as Thomson of France and Nokia of
Finland are also under pressure to cut costs and find partners to help to
shoulder rising research and development costs.
Far less familiar are the across the board cuts in capital spending in the
Japanese industry which have become the rule of the day. Sony, one of
Japan's most aggressive and innovative companies, this year is likely to cut
spending by 30 per cent in the year starting in April. Its mid-term profits
to the end of September were down 26 per cent.
Sony and Matsushita Electric Industry are also suffering from their
expensive purchases of US film producers. Sony paid Dollars 3.4bn for
Columbia Pictures just over two years ago, while Matsushita bought MCA for
Dollars 6.1bn in December 1990. With the US industry going through a slump,
the financial gains from these acquisitions have been extremely elusive.
While interest in hits of the past has lagged, products of the future -
especially high definition television - have been maddeningly long in
coming. HDTV produces a significantly higher picture quality, approaching
but not matching cinema projection, by increasing the line count on
television monitors.
Japanese electronics companies such as Sony and Matsushita Electric
Industrial have spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing
manufacturing facilities for HDTV.
HDTV broadcasts were expanded in Japan last November to 8 hours a day, but
with the price of a large picture tube needed to appreciate the higher
quality of HDTV and the electronic decoding equipment still costing about
Y4m (Dollars 32,500), and programme offerings comparatively paltry, sales
have been scant.
Meanwhile, the Japanese companies have formed two separate development
groups jointly with a number of US companies and with Philips of the
Netherlands in order to share the huge costs of developing sets of
semiconductor chip sets that will reduce the size, complexity and the cost
of making HDTV equipment.
The appearance of these groups amounts to an admission that the risks of
going it alone have become prohibitively high. The Japanese are also aiming
to ease trade friction with the US, which has complained about the exclusion
of US semiconductor companies from the Japanese electronics industry.
Beyond this, the electronics companies are struggling to develop concepts
for a new generation of hit products that will re-ignite the growth which
the industry has enjoyed for decades. Many focus on the still nascent
concept of multimedia - interactive devices that combine high quality
audio-visual functions with computing capability.
Sony has launched with modest success a forerunner of multimedia with its
Data Discman - a hand-held compact disc player that displays reference books
on a flip-up LCD screen. The Data Discman can display simple illustrations
and pronounce dictionary entries. The product, already launched in Japan,
the US, and Germany, will reach the UK in the spring.
Philips has already launched its CD-I (compact disc interactive, developed
jointly with Sony), to mixed reviews. The machine allows users to call up
moving pictures, CD-quality sound, and text from a CD. But it appears so far
to lack the applications software needed to turn it into a hit product.
Attention is now focused sharply on how to use CD-ROM (read only memory)
technology to design products. Many specialists, for example, believe that
CD drives will soon become standard equipment on personal computers.
Sony is teaming up with Apple Computer to design a new generation of
hand-held multi-media computers. Sony believes that the personal computer
and audio-visual industry will gradually become indistinguishable. From a
technological standpoint, this is likely to be true. The biggest uncertainty
facing the industry, however, is whether consumers will go for the fancy
machines and prices dreamt up in research laboratories.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (14): Degrees of
discomfort - Machines and Tools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT REQUIRES a Roget's Thesaurus, opened at the entry for 'poor,' to describe
current conditions - and immediate prospects - in world markets for the
mechanical engineering and industrial equipment industries.
Depending on the industry and the market, business can be flat, uncertain,
weak, bad or downright dreadful. All too rarely, and for too few companies,
can markets be described positively, and the remaining pockets of resistance
against the general trend can hardly be deemed buoyant.
'The machinery business is bad, but not awful, at least outside the UK,'
said Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley in a recent research note. 'In the
US, demand has not picked up, but has at least stopped declining. In Asia,
not an important market for most European companies, the trend is down, but
not (yet) sharply.'
In Europe, says Mr Hadas, sales are weak in most places outside Germany, but
generally not declining any more, although Italy and Spain could be
exceptions on the negative side. German demand, fuelled by reunification,
had been 'incredible,' but has now fallen back into the credible range.
Elsewhere, sales into eastern Europe and the former USSR have dropped to
virtually nothing, he says, while the Middle East has not yet recovered from
the Gulf war, although the latest signs from the region are more
encouraging.
Inevitably, there are exceptions to the general picture presented by broad
reviews of current business conditions.
Even in the UK, which has sunk into a recession in manufacturing of
unequalled severity, oases in a sea of gloom can be identified.
The machine tool industry, producer of the basic metal-cutting and forming
machines used in manufacturing, is a case in point. A recent survey for
Machinery magazine on sophisticated computer-numerically controlled (CNC)
machine tools indicated a potential fall of more than 40 per cent in 1990/91
volume sales to the automotive sector, yet sales to the
electrical/electronic sector may have grown by 21 per cent.
Giddings &amp; Lewis, the US machine toolmaker, is doing relatively well selling
to the North Sea oil sector, but it has been a grim year for many machine
tool producers dependent on the UK market.
Similarly, in continental Europe, the few machine tool builders to reveal
financial results are awash in red ink. Maho, the German milling and turning
machine maker which is one of Europe's biggest producers, plunged to a
DM17.3m net loss for the year ended June, against a DM14m profit previously.
Even Japan's Yamazaki, the world's largest producer of CNC machine tools, is
feeling the pinch in many export markets, but is big enough to take the
knocks of a cyclical business while hardly flinching.
Another industry taking a hammering is construction equipment. Worldwide
unit sales of the seven main product types slumped from around 200,000 in
1979 to 130,000 in 1983, and then began a slow climb to nearly 160,000 by
1989. But the recession, notably in the US and the UK, has prompted a
renewed fall to below 140,000 units.
Little wonder, therefore, that the big players in the construction equipment
industry are scrambling for a good position in Germany, where market
prospects have been transformed by reunification and the subsequent
infrastructural investment. Corporate Intelligence Group, the London-based
analyst, says the eastern market grew by 200 per cent in 1991, with perhaps
a further 15 per cent increase this year.
Caterpillar of the US, Komatsu of Japan and VME, the joint venture between
Volvo and Clark Equipment, have all made acquisitions or joint venture
arrangements with western German construction equipment companies to exploit
the new environment. Local equipment suppliers such as Krupp and Liebherr
have also moved smartly across the old border.
The German effect is also at work in the agricultural equipment business,
where the large eastern farms offer good long-term prospects to the big
producers such as NH Geotech, Massey-Ferguson, JI Case Europe and Deere.
Elsewhere in Europe, however, structural problems associated with the Common
Agricultural Policy, and general recessionary factors, give little room for
optimism. The US agricultural equipment market, which went through the
wringer in the 1970s, is now steadier, but elsewhere equipment manufacturers
are frustrated by a painful fact of life: Third World countries that need
equipment most urgently have little money to pay for it.
Amid all the gloom, however, it is important to remember equipment
industries which operate on very different business cycles. Infrastructural
spending is often immune to short-term economic factors, and power
generating equipment producers are one group currently prospering from
growing demand in the western world for new, cleaner generating methods.
Meanwhile, ambitious power station programmes in China and elsewhere in Asia
continue to underpin demand for coal-fired stations, while in eastern Europe
there is likely to be plenty of work for western companies retrofitting
Soviet-designed nuclear power stations.
One curious aspect, at least prima facie, of the general downturn over the
past year is that it has not generated a rash of big mergers. A strong
underlying trend of restructuring in Europe - ahead of the Single Market -
continues, but it seems most of the mega-deals prompted both by the 1992
effect, and by overcapacity in the heavy equipment sector, are now completed
in good time for the implementation of the EC reforms.
The completion in mid-1991 of the merger of Fiat and Ford's agricultural and
earthmoving equipment interests to create NH Geotech, was the only mega-deal
of 1991 for which global strategic factors were the prime motivator.
Although grand strategy played a part in three other deals - the takeovers
of Davy, Hawker Siddeley and Alfa-Laval by Trafalgar House, BTR and
Tetra-Pak respectively - special circumstances dominated.
In construction equipment, there has been an encouraging trend of realistic
deals between Japanese and European producers which recognise that each side
has its strengths. JCB, the fiercely independent UK producer, has announced
a significant joint venture with Sumitomo Construction Machinery to attack
the European crawler excavator market.
A similar deal pooling Japanese - and US - technology with European
distribution strength could be announced very soon between Deere, Hitachi
Construction Machinery and Fiat. The deal would create a new European giant
and leave NH Geotech to concentrate mainly on farm equipment - it will
retain the Ford New Holland skid steer loader and backhoe loader line.
What of prospects for the short- and long term? Clearly, the immediate
outlook is weak: in the UK it could be 1993 before some machinery markets
recover, and the US economy seems stuck between recession and growth. Rising
interest rates and warnings of recession in Germany cannot be dismissed
lightly.
Longer-term, there is more reason for optimism. Industrial growth prospects
in the Pacific Rim may waver occasionally, but the trend line is firmly
upwards. The heavy capital investment required to rebuild eastern Europe's
industries and businesses, along with the continuing investment needs in
western Europe, ought to get the machinery sector moving in the mid-1990s,
if the politicians can find the money.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (12): On a triple
springboard - Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE telecommunications sector is still growing, despite the world recession.
Profits of many telephone companies have continued to increase - albeit at a
slower rate than before - the volume of telephone traffic is rising,
investment is up and new services are mushrooming.
Three principal factors lie behind the market's continuing dynamism:
First: The industry is in the midst of a far-reaching reorganisation as
national state-owned telephone monopolies try to turn themselves into
globally-competitive operators. Globalisation itself is being spurred on by
the fact that governments are increasingly privatising their state-run
telephone companies and subjecting them to competition.
Second: new technology is reducing costs, improving efficiency and expanding
the range of services that can be offered to customers. The widespread
introduction of fibre-optic cable and digital exchanges has laid the
ground-work for the modern telecommunications infrastructure.
The increasing intelligence of networks combined with advances in radio and
semi-conductor technology have also played their part.
The most explosive growth continues to be in mobile communications, in
particular cellular, and data communications, which is being spearheaded by
the facsimile machine, and the personal computer.
Third: developing countries and the nations of the former Soviet bloc are
now trying to make up for decades of under-investment in telecommunications.
There is a growing appreciation that they cannot participate in the modern
world economy unless they can communicate effectively, both domestically and
internationally.
Most Third World and eastern European governments have recently adopted
crash programmes to increase the number of phone lines in their countries.
However, there is considerable doubt over whether they will be able to find
the funds needed for the massive investments planned.
The world telecommunications services market was worth Dollars 279bn in
1990, up from Dollars 175bn in 1986, and is forecast to reach Dollars 567bn
in 1995 by the Telecommunications Research Centre, the UK-based industry
analyst. Meanwhile, the global equipment market has grown from Dollars 88bn
in 1986 to Dollars 127bn in 1990 and is forecast to reach Dollars 169bn in
1995.
The liberalisation of telecommunications markets is now fairly well
established in the US, the UK, Japan and a number of other smaller
countries. These countries allow competition in the full range of
telecommunication services, including the basic telephone service.
The European Commission is due later this year to examine whether
competition in the basic phone service should be required across the
Community. In most developed countries there is already competition in
mobile and data communication services.
The one area of the telecommunications market which has proved particularly
resistant to competition is the provision of international telephone
services. These have traditionally been provided by national monopolies,
co-operating with one another in a series of cartel arrangements.
Even here, though, change is coming. The US regulatory authorities, the EC
and a number of national regulators are trying to reform the cartel
practices and international call charges have already started to fall.
Governments have been keen to privatise their telephone monopolies, partly
in order to promote efficiency and partly to attract greater investment. The
latter reason has been a prominent feature of Third World privatisations.
The trend towards globalisation has had three main manifestations:
First: the acquisition of stakes in newly-privatised telephone companies.
The US 'Baby Bell' operators have been particularly prominent in this area.
Second: establishing 'green field' operations in basic telephony, cable
television and mobile communications. Earlier this year, for example,
American Telephone and Telegraph formed a joint venture to build a network
in the Ukraine, while Nynex, one of the Baby Bells, is close to finalising a
deal to build a network in Bangkok, Thailand.
Third: the formation of international partnerships with the aim of catering
to the global telecommunication needs of multinational business customers.
Last year, BT, previously British Telecom, tried to persuade Germany's
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telphone to
join its US-based Syncordia partnership.
Meanwhile, AT&amp;T has held extensive negotiations with the UK's Cable and
Wireless about collaborating extensively across the globe.
So far, nothing has materialised in either BT's or AT&amp;T's case. But
international partnerships are expected to be an important feature of 1992.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (15): The enduring
obstacles - Tariffs and Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EASTER, 1992, has now become the latest in a long list of 'final' deadlines
in the seemingly interminable Uruguay Round of multilateral talks aimed at
liberalising world trade and preventing the growth of protectionism.
But even after five-and-a-half years of negotiations the unresolved issue of
farm subsidies could still wreck them. Failure to reach agreement might not,
by itself, have an immediate impact on the growth of world trade and of the
global economy. But it could strengthen trends towards protectionism,
bilateralism and managed trade.
The current round is the eighth conducted since 1948 when the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) came into force. And it is by far the
most ambitious as for the first time it has covered for first time sectors
such as agriculture, textiles, investment, services and intellectual
property.
Since September, 1986, when the new round of Gatt talks was agreed upon at
Punta del Este, Uruguay, the negotiations have been whittled down from 15
specific topics to seven. The talks have proved detailed and complicated and
several 'final' meetings have taken place.
Their complexity was in part forced on Gatt. The seven previous rounds had
reduced the tariffs on the manufactured products of the major industrial
markets from around 40 per cent to an average of 4.7 per cent. If Gatt,
which now covers 103 countries, was to remain, despite the changing nature
of world trade, global in its rule-making, it had to broaden its scope and
tackle new areas.
Agriculture - especially the dispute between the European Community and the
US over support for farmers, market access and export subsidies  - has been
the main stumbling block. Already, this has crippled the mid-review of the
Round in Montreal in December 1988, stalled the 'final' meeting in Brussels
two years later, and caused the end-1991 deadline to be missed.
On January 13, the participants in the Round agreed that the proposals made
before Christmas by Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, should be the
basic document for further talks leading to a final agreement by mid-April.
But the EC still maintained strong objections to the section on farming. It
remains to be seen whether a successful conclusion will be reached as
scheduled.
Since Gatt came into operation, world trade has acted as one of the primary
engines for the growth of world output. Annually, almost without exception,
the growth rate of the former has exceeded that of the latter. According to
Gatt, between 1960 and 1970, the volume of merchandise trade grew at an
annual average of 8.6 per cent while output grew at 6 per cent. The rates
have slowed: for 1970-80 to 5.3 per cent against 3.8 per cent for output;
and in the 1980s 4.2 and 2.7 per cent.
In the most recent decade, these rates have been unevenly distributed. In
Asia, trade in goods and services rose by an annual average of 7.7 per cent
and Gross Domestic Product by 5.4 per cent. In other areas, the rates have
been: north America 5.7 and 2.8 per cent; western Europe 4.2 and 2.2; Latin
America 2 and 1.6; and in Africa, the exception to the pattern, -0.3 and 2
per cent.
Exports of merchandise trade grew between 1980 and 1990 by an annual average
of 5 1/2 per cent to reach Dollars 3,485bn in 1990 (up 13 per cent that
year), while trade in commercial services, which expanded over the decade at
the faster pace of 7 1/2 per cent, reached Dollars 815bn in 1990. That was
up 17 per cent over the previous year and accounted for 19 per cent of all
world exports.
The distribution of merchandise trade (based on the value of exports and
imports) was: western Europe 46.5 per cent, Asia 21.9; north America 16.5;
central and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union 5.2, Latin America 4, the
Middle East 3.3 and Africa 2.6.
With some justification, Gatt, whose contracting parties account for about
90 per cent of world trade, can claim much credit for providing the impetus
for the growth in world output.
Through eight rounds, it has preached its gospel of multilateral trade and
most-favoured-nation status, which obliges each signatory to the Gatt to
grant the same treatment to all other members on a non-discriminatory basis.
It has evolved regulations which it has tried to enforce through its
adjudicatory disputes panels and complaints procedures.
But other factors must be acknowledged, The remarkable growth in
communications and transport and the fall in their costs have helped to
expand the transnational production of manufactured goods. The international
lowering of investment barriers and the integration of financial markets
have also influenced considerably the growth in global trade and output.
At the same time, these features have also contributed to growing
bilateralism and regionalism with the risk of an increasing disrespect for
Gatt's rules.
These trends were apparent even before the farm dispute thwarted the Uruguay
Round's progress and must be seen as protection against the effects of the
Round failing.
The EC's single economic market in 1993 is the most obvious and mature
example of regionalism. But in America, the 1989 Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
between the US and Canada is being expanded to include Mexico; in Latin
America and the Caribbean, there are four regional blocs either formed or in
the offing. In the Far East, the Association of South East Asian Nations
(Asean) - and Malaysia's Dr Mahathir Mohamad in particular - is trying to
set up an economic group which might include Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
South Korea and Taiwan.
Bilaterally, the US has 16 'framework' agreements in Latin America and one
in Singapore which could be the basis for FTAs. President Bush's visit this
month to Japan was a notable example, of the US trying to manage trade on a
bilateral basis.
In the short term, these arrangements might only confirm and
institutionalise existing trading patterns, like those between the EC and
the European Free Trade Association within the still-unratified European
Economic Area.
But as these groupings become more established and in the absence of a firm
international regulatory body, be it Gatt or its mooted successor, the
Multilateral Trading Organisation, they will become more exclusive and
resort increasingly to such protective mechanisms as anti-dumping actions,
countervailing duties and, in the case of the US, the retaliatory Super 301
provision of the 1988 Trade Act.
If the Uruguay Round fails, those countries with protective statutes will be
best insulated. By contrast, developing countries, especially in Africa,
which account for more than two-thirds of Gatt's members, will be especially
vulnerable.
In the short term, the growth of world trade and world output will be
governed more by global recession than the presence or absence of Gatt
regulations.
But, according to the findings published in The World Economy of December
1991, a minimalist 'face-saving' outcome to the Round would benefit world
trade by Dollars 118.7bn, while a 'comprehensive' agreement would produce
benefits of Dollars 262.5bn.
This is what is at stake if no successful conclusion is found by Easter.
Thereafter, protectionist trends will be stimulated by the US congressional
and presidential elections in November. The EC's attention will be on 1993.
Against this background, the Uruguay Round negotiations will be seen as a
temporary holding operation against the resurgence in world trade of
bilateralism and protectionism.

'THE test of the whole global media concept really hangs now on Time Warner.
If they can't make it work I'm not sure anyone can.'
That is the view of a UK company which set itself up to barter TV programmes
to emerging European TV channels, and has become increasingly sceptical that
truly global media businesses can flourish in the face of regulatory and
cultural differences between countries.
It is right to point to Time Warner, the world's biggest media company, for
clues to whether the corporate experiments of the 1980s will be retained or
rejected in the 1990s.
Time Warner performed one of the most audacious of those experiments, the
Dollars 14bn merger of the magazine group Time and Warner Brothers film and
television studios and cable television. The test of its success will be
whether economies of scale and synergies - the 'two plus two equals five'
factor - will let it pay off its debt of Dollars 8.5bn and keep growing.
That hypothesis - that size brought more wealth, and justified high
acquisition prices - was behind many of the most flamboyant media deals of
the 1980s. But that theory is now under attack, given the spectacular
collapse of some of the most aggressive wheelers and dealers.
The late Mr Robert Maxwell's empire, now under investigation by the UK's
Serious Fraud Office, may have caught the most headlines, but there is no
lack of other examples.
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has spent two years negotiating with
its bankers for its survival; it won their support only by agreeing to sell
businesses it had fought to buy just a few years before.
The French giant Hachette, whose ambitions led it to leap the Atlantic and
take over US encyclopedia publisher Grolier at the end of the 1980s, now
finds its room for manoeuvre tightly circumscribed by debt, while some of
its investments such as the failing French TV channel La Cinq continue to
inflict damage to its profits.
An informal poll of finance directors of large US and UK media groups, who
are now surveying the wrecks of some of the 1980s empires in search of
bargains, produces the consensus that prices for acquisitions are finally
falling.
At the start of the 1980s a good magazine group would typically fetch a
price of 10-15 times post-tax profits in the UK - slightly higher in the US
because of differences in accounting for profits. However, by 1986-1988, the
peak of the acquisition boom in media, those prices had more than doubled,
partly driven by the availability of finance: banks were keen to offer
credit, leveraged against what they saw as unshakeable, advertising -driven
cashflow.
According to media finance directors, prices have now fallen sharply to
levels only slightly higher than the early 1980s.
The spectacle of failure on a grand scale is not the only reason for the
change: media companies and their bankers have been firmly reminded by the
past few years that there is no natural law that says advertising must keep
growing.
Advertising - the revenue that drives television, newspapers, magazines, and
most media - apart from book publishing - grew faster than the US, UK and
French economies for most of the 1980s.
Advertising agencies notably Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the UK-based company that
itself came to grief through over-ambitious international expansion, were
fond of arguing that advertising was 'recession proof' and that advertising
budgets were among the last areas of spending that would be cut in an
economic downturn.
That argument has been decisively undermined by the US and UK experience in
the past two years, when advertising budgets have plunged across most media
as economies dipped into recession.
As well as new nervousness about estimating media revenue in a particular
country, there is more caution about predicting whether a magazine, book or
programme will cross national borders, not just in Europe, where the
linguistic and cultural barriers are obvious, but within the
English-speaking countries too. Media corporate financiers on Wall Street
say that banks are using less ambitious assumptions about foreign sales in
valuing back catalogues of book, pop music, film and TV companies.
Some media companies are tentatively returning to the bids and deals market,
although the specialist media corporate finance boutiques that sprang up in
the 1980s may still find it hard to scratch a living from advisory fees.
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm which is handling the dismemberment
of Mr Maxwell's Maxwell Communication Corporation under UK insolvency law,
reports no shortage of interested bidders once the liabilities of the
companies are established.
But the signs are that media acquisitions will be on a more cautious scale
than in the 1980s. It is the companies that held back in the 1980s and
survived with balance sheets intact who are now reaching for the bargains,
such as the UK's Reed International, or Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of the
UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper, who recently won control of the collapsed
Australian Fairfax group, a pattern that some see as virtue rewarded.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (11): America takes fright
 -Cars and Trucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE

<TEXT>
THE admission by General Motors, the world's largest vehicle maker, that it
must scale down its massively loss-making North American automotive
operations, has thrown into stark relief the awesome competitive challenges
facing vehicle makers in the 1990s.
In the face of losses on its North American vehicle operations estimated by
analysts at as much as Dollars 7bn last year, GM is being forced to close 21
plants and cut around 74,000 jobs in North America over the next four years.
The GM cut-backs add fuel to the protectionist flames fanned by the
prolonged US recession, as pressures grow for legislation to limit Japanese
car sales in the US and to force Japan to reduce its Dollars 31bn automotive
trade surplus with America.
The big three US car makers, GM, Ford and Chrysler, have all been pushed
into heavy losses, and the US motor industry is now engaged in an intensive
lobbying campaign to force Tokyo to reduce its automotive surplus which
accounts for three quarters of the overall US deficit with Japan.
The chairmen of GM, Ford and Chrysler accompanied US President Bush on his
recent controversial visit to Japan, a move which pushed the US auto
industry's woes to the top of the political agenda.
In order to increase the pressure, the chairmen of the US car makers are
urgently seeking a further meeting with the leaders of the Japanese auto
industry.
There have also been proposals in the US Congress to restrict the number of
Japanese vehicles imported into the US and the numbers of vehicles built in
Japanese manufacturing facilities in the US.
North America was the battleground of the world auto industry in the 1980s
as the Japanese invested heavily to build an extensive production presence.
Now in the face of the prolonged US recession the Japanese challenge has
been turned into huge losses for the big three US car makers.
Following the wave of investment in assembly plants in North America in the
1980s - eight in the US and three in Canada - Japanese producers accounted
for 24.9 per cent of total US car output last year, increasing their share
from 21.7 per cent in 1990.
Car production by the Japanese transplants in the US (including NUMMI, the
Toyota/GM joint venture) increased by 1.1 per cent to 1.33m - despite the
deep recession in US new car sales - in stark contrast to the 11.7 per cent
drop in overall US car output to 5.36m.
Meanwhile, Japanese capacity continues to expand with:
Toyota spending Dollars 800m to almost double its Georgetown, Kentucky plant
to 420,000 cars a year by the end of 1993 from 220,000 at present, and
Nissan spending Dollars 490m to virtually double its car and light truck
production capacity at its Smyrna Tennessee plant to 440,000 units a year by
mid-1992.
The Japanese transplants' total car and light truck production capacity in
North America is planned to reach around 2.7m vehicles a year by 1993/94
following an investment of some Dollars 7.5bn.
In the 1990s, however, the focus of Japanese competition is moving to
Europe, where the spectre of overcapacity, already a reality in North
America, looms as the Japanese establish their first wave of transplant
(local assembly plant) facilities.
Nissan has been producing cars in the UK since 1986. Volumes were modest at
first, but this year output should reach 175,000 cars and will grow to
270,000 in 1993. Later this year production begins at Toyota and Honda's
first European car assembly plants - both located in the UK. Mitsubishi
Motors is also creating a joint venture with Volvo of Sweden in the
Netherlands with the aim of producing 200,000 cars a year by the mid-1990s.
After stumbling in 1991 world car sales are forecast to stage a recovery in
1992. World new car demand is estimated to have contracted last year by 2.9
per cent to 34.4m from 35.5m in 1990, the largest sales reduction since the
1980-81 recession.
However, according to the latest DRI World Automotive Forecast Report,
worldwide new car demand will regain the lost ground this year to reach
35.5m. Worldwide new car sales are forecast to resume steady growth through
the first half of the 1990s to reach 40.3m in 1996.
While demand is set to recover gradually, car producers and their suppliers
still face a daunting array of other challenges through the 1990s. Costly
regulations on exhaust emissions are being toughened while regulations
governing improved fuel economy and the recycling of old cars appear
unavoidable.
Recent regulatory developments in the US virtually ensure that the electric
car will play an increasingly important role on the roads of North America,
and probably the world, before the end of this decade.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (7): A rising tide of red
ink - Steelmaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RED ink is starting to flow thick and fast across the world's steel
industry.
According to MEPS, the Sheffield based steel consultancy, steel production
in the European Community will continue the fall which set in with a 3.5 per
cent drop last year. It projects EC production in 1992 of about 129m tonnes,
down from 132m tonnes in 1991 and production in western Europe is projected
to 151.4m tonnes down about 5m tonnes from last year. MEPS expects European
production to grow again in 1993 and climb to a peak in 1994.
The weak outlook in western Europe will be compounded by the mounting
difficulties facing producers in eastern Europe which suffered sharp falls
in production last year. Steel production in the former Soviet Union in 1991
was about 133m tonnes, a 14 per cent fall on 1990. The Polish industry was
among the worst hit with output down about 23 per cent at 10.5m tonnes,
while in Czechoslovakia it was 18 per cent lower at about 12m tonnes.
With the disruption to trade with the former Soviet Union, and with lower
growth in many of these economies, production is likely to fall
substantially again this year by about 20 per cent in Poland and 16 per cent
in Czechoslovakia and more than 10 per cent in the former USSR.
Outside Europe steel markets will suffer gentler falls. MEPS forecasts that
US production is forecast to be about 79m tonnes, up only about 1 per cent
on last year's production. According to OECD figures steel deliveries fell
8.3 per cent in the first nine months of last year, with sales to the car
industry worst hit - they fell 15.6 per cent in the first three quarters -
followed by the construction industry, down 11.4 per cent against the same
period in 1990.
However, the decline in output and falling capacity utilisation is only one
of the factors putting the industry under pressure, especially in Europe.
Producers there are being hit by a savage combination of falling demand and
steeply falling prices as producers battle to preserve their strong domestic
market shares and expand exports.
Prices have remained highly volatile because they are being set by the least
efficient, mainly subsidised producers who need to keep their plants running
at high capacity. They are trying to buy market share. More cuts in capacity
led by the best managed companies such as British Steel will not make the
industry as a whole more stable.
Mr Jeremy Fletcher, a director of Beddows Company, the specialist steel
consultants, explained: 'The industry has been through a lengthy and painful
period of restructuring. Yet from the peak to the trough of the cycle
production volumes may still fall by 30 per cent and in addition prices may
fall by at least 20 per cent.'
The weakness of European markets is bound to complicate the situation facing
US steel makers as they see their export surge in the last year dry up (US
steel sales to parts of the Far East were 200 per cent up in the first seven
months of last year) and face intensifying competition from higher priced
imports.
The fierce competition is taking a heavy toll upon the industry's finances
in Europe and the US, after the brief buoyancy they enjoyed in the late
1980s. British Steel, widely regarded as Europe's financially strongest
producer, last month reported its first half pre-tax profits had collapsed
to just Pounds 19m from Pounds 307m last year. Analysts expect it could make
a loss of up to Pounds 100m this year.
In Germany, first half pre-tax profits at Krupp Stahl fell 69 per cent,
while at Hoesch, which is in merger talks with Krupp, the fall was 65 per
cent. France's Usinor Sacilor warned there were signs the second half of its
financial year would be worse than the first when pre-tax profits fell 72
per cent. Most European producers are facing the prospect of falling in loss
in 1992.
In the US the top six integrated producers, which made a combined loss of
about Dollars 1bn in the first six months of 1991, will remain under intense
financial pressure this year.
However, perhaps the most interesting test will come in Japan, where output
is widely expected to fall about 4m tonnes, to about 107m tonnes this year.
However, steel producers there are also facing a sharp deterioration in
their finances.
Nippon Steel, the largest producer, is considering a large reduction in
sheet production, which analysts estimate might be 20 per cent. Kawasaki
Steel, a leading manufacturer, says all product ranges are under review.
With prices falling for many products and labour costs continuing to rise,
profits will be squeezed hard. Nippon Steel foresees a 30 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits to Y110bn and Sumitomo Metal Industries, another leading
maker, is bracing itself for a 40-45 per cent decline to about Y45bn.
Ironically perhaps, the structure of the Japanese industry is one which both
US and European makers would like to emulate. In Europe 15 main producers
jostle for position in an industry which makes 140m tonnes. In Japan, just
five producers dominate an industry which is only marginally smaller. The
average Japanese hot strip rolling mill has a throughput of 5m-6m tonnes a
year, twice the volume of European counterparts. To compete with the
Japanese in the long run the Europeans would need a sweeping reduction in
their number of companies and plants.
The next year in Europe and the US will be consumed by fighting the downturn
through plant closures, labour shedding, joint-ventures to lower research
and marketing costs and even full scale mergers to reduce capacity. US
producers, which have in the past questioned their long term future in the
steel industry, may be forced to answer, while in Europe there will be
additional pressure for cross border restructuring. It will be another very
tough year.

THE aerospace industry is bracing itself for another unstable and grim year
as it continues to adapt itself to the irrevocable decline in government
defence spending and the recession in civil aviation.
Restructuring is expected to lead to more job cuts in the defence sector as
manufacturers grapple with the uncertainty of future defence programmes at
the same time as they reduce capacity in the face of defence cuts.
In the US alone, more than 100,000 people were laid off last year and the
industry expects a further 36,000 to go this year.
In Europe, the leading defence contractors are all in the throes of
restructuring programmes which are likely to be affected by a series of
important government decisions this year on the future of several new
programmes ranging from the European Fighter Aircraft, the French Rafale
fighter and the Swedish Gripen jet, to short range air-to-air missiles and
military helicopters.
With shrinking national defence markets, aerospace companies have had to
place increasing emphasis on defence export sales as well as on civil
aviation. But while the civil airliner market is expected to continue
expanding in the longer term, it is still under pressure as it attempts to
recover from the post Gulf war slump in air travel.
The leading commercial aircraft manufacturers have all seen new orders drop
sharply. Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, booked 252
aircraft valued at Dollars 20.26bn last year compared with a record 543 new
aircraft orders valued at Dollars 47.69bn in 1990. Airbus, the European
aircraft consortium, booked 101 new aircraft orders worth Dollars 9.4bn last
year compared with 404 aircraft orders in 1990.
The financial crisis of many airline customers forced the manufacturers to
adjust some of their existing orders and aircraft deliveries. New aircraft
orders are also expected to remain under pressure this year because many
airlines are unlikely to commit themselves in new fleet renewal and
acquisitions until confident of a sustained recovery in air travel.
Aircraft engine makers and aerospace components suppliers have also had to
adapt to the recession in civil aviation and defence spending cuts. But like
the airframe manufacturers, they remain confident that the commercial side
of the business will probably start recovering by the end of this year,
although not to the record levels of the late 1980s.
The industry expects to see a significant shift towards airlines buying
large widebody aircraft rather than smaller narrow body jets during the next
10 years. Indeed, the market for widebodies and heavy thrust engines to
power this new generation of big airliners has become the focus of
competition between the leading airframe and engine makers.
All three aircraft manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas -
are developing widebody rivals to position themselves in this growing
market. Boeing recently launched its new 777 twin engine widebody to compete
against the new Airbus A330/A340 large aircraft and the McDonnell Douglas
MD-11 three engine jet.
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus are also canvassing airlines over the
possibility of building later this decade a new breed of jumbo aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas is negotiating a landmark agreement with Taiwan Aerospace
to develop its new MD12 high capacity three engine jet, while Boeing is
discussing the possibility of developing a new 650 seat version of its
successful Boeing 747 jumbo jet family. Airbus has already announced that it
plans to challenge Boeing's dominance in the jumbo market by considering the
development of a 600 seater airliner in cooperation, perhaps, with a new
Asian partner.
All the manufacturers are continuing to scramble to forge international
alliances to improve their competitive position on the export market and
spread the huge investment costs of developing new aircraft. This is
particularly the case at the lower end of the commercial aircraft market
where manufacturers are competing to develop new commuter and regional jet
airliners.
Efforts to consolidate the industry across traditional national borders are
likely to intensify this year as part of the overall restructuring of both
the military and commercial aerospace businesses.
France's Aerospatiale and Germany's MBB launched at the beginning of this
year their new Eurocopter company merging the two group's helicopter
activities. Matra and GEC of the UK have linked their space operations in a
new joint venture called Matra Marconi Space which is now seeking to attract
other European partners. British Aerospace is actively looking for a new
partner for its regional aircraft operations as part of its recovery
programme launched last year after a top management crisis saw the
resignation of its chairman, Professor Sir Roland Smith. But perhaps the
most ambitious partnership under current negotiation is the decision of
Taiwan to invest in a stake in McDonnell Douglas's commercial aircraft
business.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (5): Chips are everywhere
 -Semiconductors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK economic conditions in the US and Europe cast a shadow over the world
semiconductor industry last year.
Worldwide revenues grew by only about eight per cent, to Dollars 55bn, a far
cry from the industry's traditional double digit growth but nonetheless
better than 1990 when sales were flat.
However, overall market trends mask a mixed performance by leading
manufacturers, as sales of some product categories boom, while others are in
a slump.
The ubiquitous microprocessor, the 'brains' of computers, for example,
continues to be a gold mine for companies such as Intel, now the largest US
producer of integrated circuits. Microprocessor sales revenues leaped 60 per
cent last year, to Dollars 3.5bn. Intel won the lion's share of this growth.
Sales of microcontrollers, the blue-collar cousins of the microprocessor
used in a wide variety of industrial equipment, in cars and in consumer
electronics products, grew by about 25 per cent to almost Dollars 5bn.
The market for commodity memory chips, in contrast, is experiencing severe
oversupply and rapidly falling prices that have depressed the semiconductor
earnings of some of Japan's giants as well as Texas Instruments in the US.
Prices of Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAMs) are in a nose-dive, with
the average selling price of 4 Megabyte DRAMs, the latest generation of
memory chips, declining by about 55 per cent over the past 12 months. DRAM
sales picked up by 5 per cent last year, to Dollars 7bn, after a disastrous
24 per cent decline in 1990, according to Integrated Circuit Engineering, a
US industry consulting group. Even optimistic projections of 28 per cent
growth this year would only bring this segment of the industry back to its
sales record of 1989, when revenues totalled Dollars 8.75bn.
Japan's leading chip makers, with their commanding lead in the DRAM market
of over 80 per cent of world sales, have become the latest victims of the
most volatile and risk-prone segment of the semiconductor market.
Historically, DRAM market slumps have had a profound influence upon the
entire semiconductor industry. A 1981 reversal in the DRAM market, when
revenues fell by 40 per cent, prompted several US chipmakers, including
Intel which invented the DRAM, to leave the market. In 1985, when worldwide
sales revenues took a 57 per cent dive, the US accused Japanese producers of
'dumping' and ultimately won a controversial five year trade pact.
Similarly, the current problems facing DRAM manufacturers may signal a
seachange in the industry. A major expansion of DRAM production during the
boom years of 1987-1989 has created excess supply at a time when economic
trends are dampening demand. Some of today's DRAM makers seem certain to cut
their losses and retrench, leaving only a handful of DRAM 'specialists' to
dominate the market.
However, the future of the semiconductor industry will also be shaped by the
fortunes of its major customers. The computer industry remains by far the
biggest user of semiconductor devices, consuming over 40 per cent of
products manufactured by 'merchant' chipmakers as well as the bulk of
'captive' production by companies such as International Business Machines.
The general malaise in the computer industry has set the tone in the
semiconductor industry over the past year, as world computer sales revenues
declined for the first time in that industry's history. In most segments of
the computer market, however, unit shipments continue to expand, increasing
demand for semiconductor chips. For semiconductor manufacturers, therefore,
computers remain a growth market.
Similarly, the automobile industry, although severely affected by general
economic trends, is a growing consumer of semiconductor devices. Today, each
car sold is estimated to contain about Dollars 200 worth of semiconductor
chips. By 1995 the 'chip content' of the average automobile is expected to
double. Other important markets for chips include consumer electronics,
telecommunications and defence electronics.
The key role of the semiconductor industry as the supplier of 'building
blocks' to the entire electronics industry has thrust chipmakers into the
debate over international competitiveness. Japanese and North American
producers dominate the world semiconductor market, with Japanese
semiconductor manufacturers claiming 45 per cent of the world market in
1991, while US producers accounted for about 40 per cent. European
producers' share of the world semiconductor market has remained relatively
flat, at about 10 per cent, over the past few years. New entrants in Korea
and Taiwan have, however, achieved a five per cent world market share last
year.
The US-Japanese battle over semiconductor trade remains an over-riding
concern among chipmakers on both sides of the Pacific. Last year, the two
countries reached a new semiconductor trade agreement in which Japan
endorsed the US goal that Japan should import 20 per cent of the
semiconductor products that it consumes by the end of 1992.
Currently, US suppliers hold a 14 per cent share of the Japanese
semiconductor market, according to data agreed upon by both countries.
Unless the 20 per cent goal is reached, however, there is sentiment in the
US for some form of retaliation with serious consequences for all
semiconductor makers.
While political and economic trends have a significant influence upon the
semiconductor industry, it is the creation of new markets for semiconductor
chips that drives the industry's growth. The emergence of 'nomadic
computing', high definition TV and other new types of consumer products that
combine computer technology with multimedia presentations represent vast new
opportunities for chipmakers that should ensure growth in the 1990s.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (9): At the parting of the
ways - Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PATHS followed over the last year by the world's chemical and
pharmaceutical industries have diverged markedly, in spite of their common
scientific base.
Buoyed by ageing populations and increasingly expensive and sophisticated
drugs, pharmaceutical groups have proved inoculated against the insidious
slowdown of the world economy. In contrast, the chemicals sector has
confirmed its lamentable reputation for being the most cyclical of
industries.
Two problems dominate the chemicals sector: the recession and the
environment. The industry is making too little money as it makes too much
pollution.
The chemicals industry is bleeding cash. The recession and the Gulf war have
battered demand for basic chemicals. At the same time, capacity ordered in
the boom times of the late 1980s - when even the least efficient plants were
profitable - continues to come on stream, increasing competition still
further.
The consequent squeeze on margins has been further exacerbated by the
increased capital costs required by ever-tougher environmental legislation.
Complying with environmental legislation is cutting deeply into ordinary
capital expenditure. Increasing public and legislative demands for more
environmental protection appear unlikely to slacken in coming years.
At the end of last year, German chemical companies complained that new taxes
on emissions would stretch the industry to its limits, making Germany too
expensive for manufacturing certain types of products.
In Britain, too, environmental spending is set to mushroom. The UK's
Chemical Industry Association estimates capital expenditure on the
environment will double between 1990 and 1992 from Pounds 200m a year to
Pounds 400m. It is now 25 per cent of all investment. With costs and
capacity rising, while demand falls, the descent from profits to loss has
been precipitous. There are few signs of an upturn.
Even the German giants, hitherto protected by German reunification, are
suffering a slowdown. Mr Wolfgang Hilger, president of the German Chemical
Industry Association, warned this month that the German domestic market was
likely to stagnate this year and there was no sign of upturn in export
markets.
Only in the Far East has demand held up, but capacity there, particularly in
the petrochemical sector, looks set to grow rapidly over the next few years
as investments by newly industrialised nations come on stream.
The contrast with the pharmaceuticals sector could not have been more
marked. Drugs have proved a panacea for those companies trying to escape the
roller-coaster ride of the cyclical commodity chemicals business. ICI and
Rhone-Poulenc, two groups traditionally involved with basic chemicals,
reported profits last year heavily dependent upon the success of their
pharmaceuticals business.
For the pure pharmaceuticals companies 1991 was a heady year. Most European
pharmaceuticals groups proved the ultimate counter-cyclical stocks, with the
sector reporting sales growth averaging 13 per cent over the past 12 months.
But although the pharmaceuticals market remains buoyant, the horizon is not
without its clouds. Research and development costs are rising inexorably at
the same time as governments are beginning to balk at the ever increasing
cost of drugs.
Western governments are grappling with ever increasing healthcare budgets.
In Germany, for example, health costs more than 13 per cent of GNP.
Drugs form a significant proportion of such costs and have been designated
as easy targets for recession-battered governments. In Germany,
pharmaceutical spending represents nearly 16 per cent of healthcare costs,
while in Italy and Portugal it represents more than 30 per cent.
Prices are likely to come under increasing pressure in coming years. And the
sparkling performance of the pharmaceuticals groups over the last 12 months
has not helped their position.
In the US, the world's largest drug market, Senator Edward Kennedy has
conducted a vocal campaign to restrain price increases for drugs sold to
public health service-funded institutions. A wave of pricing legislation is
presently sweeping through Congress questioning the sector's pricing
structure.
A debate also opened up last year on whether uncontrolled healthcare costs
had not become a full-blown contagion - one that was sapping the nation's
competitiveness and standard of living.
It is far from clear whether the pharmaceutical industry's traditional
defences - the need to reinvest profits in research and development, and the
requirement for a return for the significant risks involved in drug
development - will withstand the current political tide.
Outside the US, governments are already attempting to limit drugs
expenditure through:
Lists of products which doctors are forbidden to prescribe or for which
patients receive only partial reimbursement.
Obligatory and direct price cuts.
Profit controls which insist on a limited return on capital employed.
Controls on marketing costs.
Penalising doctors who prescribe excessively.
Encouraging generic, non-patented, cheaper products.
At the same time, the pharmaceutical groups continue to struggle with the
inexorable rise in research and development costs.
Such growth in costs is partly explained by the increasing complexity of new
drugs. But it has also been caused by the growth in regulation to test the
safety, quality and efficacy of drugs.
Meanwhile, recessionary storms appear to have set in for the duration over
the the basic chemicals industry. Dark clouds may also be gathering for the
pharmaceuticals sector.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (6): In confusion and
disarray - Computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE computer industry enters 1992 in confusion and disarray.
The major hardware manufacturers are all in difficulties. International
Business Machines (IBM), the largest manufacturer, and Digital Equipment
(DEC), the leading minicomputer supplier, are among the companies reporting
declining sales and losses for 1991.
IBM, the bellwether of the US industrial economy, had the worst year in its
history - the first time growth had fallen on a year-on-year basis since
1946 and the first pretax loss in living memory.
Apple Computer, the largest personal computer manufacturer, made pretax
profits of only Dollars 310m after a Dollars 224m restructuring charge in
the third quarter to finance a 10 per cent cut in its workforce.
Compaq, the skyrocket of the US personal computer industry, ran out of
sparkle and fell heavily to earth, deposing its chairman and founder, Mr Rod
Canion, on the way and bringing in a European, Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, to
engineer a change in the company's fortunes.
The surviving European owned manufacturers, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, Bull
of France and Olivetti of Italy, all lost money last year and have put in
place wide-ranging recovery plans.
The Japanese manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC, which have hitherto
grown strongly on the back of a buoyant home market, faltered as problems
with the powerful Japanese banks and hints of scandals in Tokyo shook
business confidence.
Some manufacturers - Sun Microsystems, a US supplier of high performance
workstations, for example - seemed relatively unaffected.
For many software and services companies, too, 1991 was a good year.
Microsoft, the leading personal computer software supplier, posted its
eighth consecutive quarter of growth at the end of January, boosted by
strong demand for its 'Windows' family of products which make IBM's design
of pc easier to use.
The industry is in such a confusing state because it is at the confluence of
three seemingly irresistible forces which are forcing large and small
companies to reevaluate their market strategies.
These forces are:
technological change, which by reducing barriers to entry and stimulating
price competition is reducing hardware manufacturers' profitability. the
recession in the US, Australasia and much of Europe which is damaging
customers' ability to pay for new computer equipment and forcing them to
delay decisions on new computer-based projects. customers' disenchantment
with the benefits of computerisation, which is reducing their willingness to
invest further in data processing equipment.
There is also the effect of the growth of 'open systems' on the market. This
has to date made more impact in Europe than the US or Japan but is becoming
a worldwide phenomenon. Open systems imply hardware and software that obey
industry-wide standards; computers obeying these standards can be connected
together easily, while most manufacturers' traditional proprietary designs
can be interconnected only with great difficulty.
Because most large corporations have over the years built up a diverse
collection of computer systems, they can see obvious advantages in moves to
open systems. The open systems movement centres around an operating system
called 'Unix' developed originally by AT&amp;T. Two rival camps have sprung up,
with each promoting its own 'flavour' of Unix. Unix International has as its
principal member AT&amp;T; the Open Software Foundation is led effectively by
IBM. The signs are that the two sides this year will call a truce and agree
a single Unix standard.
Hardware companies are reacting in two principal ways to the problems
besetting the industry. First, they are restructuring on a grand scale.
Their most pressing need is to bring their staff numbers into line with
reduced profit margins. IBM, for example, is going through the most profound
change in its 66 year history; some 29,000 jobs went last year and a further
20,000 job cuts are planned for 1992. The idea is to shrink to about 350,000
people or less worldwide without forced redundancies.
IBM's approach has been to offer attractive severance packages. The cost has
been huge. Last year, it took a restructuring charge of Dollars 3.4bn and a
further Dollars 2.3bn for the future cost of health care benefits for IBM
pensioners.
The company is increasingly attempting to turn itself from a monolithic
dinosaur with a cumbersome, centralised decision-making procedure into a
series of self-contained, entrepreneurial units, each responsible for its
own profit and loss.
Second, they are merging or forming marketing agreements or technological
collaborations. In Europe, only Siemens Nixdorf has the capacity to survive
alone, chiefly through the financial strength of the parent company. (And
Siemens has found it expedient to collaborate with IBM on the next
generation of high capacity memory chips.)
The performance of the computer industry in 1992 will depend heavily on
rejuvenation of the world economy. But no matter how strong the recovery,
industry observers agree that the boom times of the 1980s will not be
repeated.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (1): Engines of growth
slow down - The down-turn may be more than merely cyclical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of the world's youngest and healthiest industries, electronics and the
aerospace and aviation sector, have reached a painful turning point.
Last year there was a growing recognition that these industries have reached
a moment which could change the course of their evolution and their role as
engines of growth. The changes sweeping through these industries will
profoundly affect the companies which make them up, the people who work
within them, their customers and suppliers in the next few years.
Their travails in 1992 will be set against the backdrop of slower economic
growth, intensifying competition in older industries such as cars, and
painful restructuring in steel and chemicals.
Electronics and the aviation/aerospace industry have both enjoyed near
permanent growth since their birth after World War Two. They have not
suffered the cyclical swings in demand which have become common in older
manufacturing industries established in the 1920s and 1930s such as
chemicals, motor cars and electrical goods.
In the past year, both electronics and aviation/aerospace have been hit by
slower economic growth, in the wake of the Gulf War. But doubts about their
health run deeper than the chill they have caught from the recession. Both
industries face structural challenges which could sap their dynamism.
In electronics, the doubts have been raised largely by success in generating
new technology. Semi-conductor manufacturers used to a ready demand for
their products are cutting production and investment because of doubts about
the demand for their most sophisticated chips.
The computer industry has been accustomed to growth rates of 20 per cent a
year over the 30 years since its birth. In the past year it has come to a
shuddering halt.
The choices facing computer makers are daunting. The cost of backing a
technology which proves unpopular is huge. But the costs of success -
research on successive generations of hardware and software - are also huge,
while margins earned on finished products are falling as computing power
becomes an oversupplied commodity. Computer users who even five years ago
might have been so dazzled by new technology have become more dubious about
the benefits of information technology. Consumer electronics companies for
years they have made money through incremental improvements to familiar
products such as televisions and hi-fis.
Now its growth prospects depend on technological leaps of faith into new
products such as high-definition television.
In aerospace and aviation the doubts are different. For the first time since
World War Two, passenger traffic suffered a decline last year. Just as IBM,
the heart of the old computer industry, is suffering heavily, so Pan
American, the illustrious airline, disappeared last year.
Just as significantly for aerospace manufacturers the end of the Cold War
probably spells a permanent reduction in military funding for expensive
aerospace programmes. Meanwhile, there is only one major new civil aircraft
planned for this decade the Boeing 777. Around the world, engine and
airframe makers are shedding labour as they adjust to this environment.
More mature industries, such as cars, chemicals and steel are also beset by
different degrees of difficulty. In steel, especially in the US and Europe,
lower demand has exposed the fragility of the steel makers' recovery during
the 1980s. The more stable chemical industry is cutting costs in a bout of
restructuring which has highlighted the strength of pharmaceuticals. In the
western car industry, the lumbering corporate giants such as General Motors
are still reeling from mounting competition from Japan.
None of the problems afflicting these industries will be eased by the
economic climate in the next year. World growth in 1992 should be marginally
stronger in the second half of the year. However, there are significant
risks of a 'growth recession' in the OECD, with the US, UK and Australia
taking longer than expected to recover just as Germany and Japan slow down.
Painful structural change within vital industries combined with slower
economic growth will make it more difficult to resolve some of the most
pressing political issues which will set the framework for industry's
development. Five political questions will be central.
The Japanese economy has grown with its industries' exports largely
protected by a political umbrella provided by US guardianship With tension
growing over trade in US-Japanese relations, is the Japanese political class
capable of ensuring the umbrella remains in place?
The US presidential elections, with the economy still mired in recession,
and the country increasingly troubled by its loss of competitiveness, will
test the strength of protectionism. The next year may prove crucial in
European economic integration, determining whether the single market
programme succeeds or is overcome by mounting tensions over economic and
monetary union. The health of the reunified German economy will be central
to the rest of Europe.
The economic disruption which will flow from the collapse of the Soviet
Union could impose heavy direct costs upon east European economies as well
as great uncertainty in the west. Perhaps the most important issue will be
the outcome of the Gatt talks to further liberalise world trade. A liberal
trading order, enforced by strengthened rules covering virtually all
countries and almost all trade flows is within the world's grasp.
However, the US is increasingly attracted to bilateral negotiations to
manage trade. In the EC and Japan agricultural lobbies are still powerful.
The significance of a failure to secure a Gatt deal would be huge. World
trade has led the growth of output through each successive economy cycle
since the 1960s, partly because of the gradual liberalisation of world
trade. A failure at Gatt might put in doubt the role of world trade as an
engine of world growth.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (2): The hangover that
persists - State of the Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHRUGGING off last year's soporific growth rates is proving hard work for
the world's leading economies. This year should deliver more vibrant trading
conditions; but only just. The world economy remains burdened by a hangover,
following the late 1980s boom, that is taking longer than expected to fade.
The world economy has probably avoided an outright recession. Back in 1982,
the last time that total OECD output fell year-on-year, both the US and
Germany were in recession. Growth was sluggish among the rest of the group
of seven largest industrialised countries except Japan.
The current downturn has been less synchronised. OECD activity reached its
trough in the first half of last year, with around one third of the OECD
countries in recession, including the US, UK and Canada. But overall OECD
growth remained positive - up 1 per cent on the second half of 1990 -
because of the still buoyant performance of Germany and Japan. The Japanese
stock market crash of 1990 was not having the negative impact on consumption
and investment that many feared. Meanwhile, the spending boom that followed
German unification was fuelling west German growth and sucking in imports,
thereby cushioning the economies of northern Europe.
This healthy divergence of economic performance among the world's three
largest economies began to turn sour in the second half of last year. The
OECD remained relatively bullish in its July Economic Outlook, forecasting
OECD output growth of 2.4 per cent in the second half of 1991 compared with
the first half, and 2.9 per cent in 1992. It expected recoveries in the US
and UK to outweigh a moderate slowdown in Japan and Germany.
Yet both the US and the UK have failed to deliver their side of the bargain,
while Japan is slowing faster than expected. By December, the OECD had cut
its forecasts to just 1 per cent growth in the second half of 1991 and 2.2
per cent growth in 1992. Since then, the Bundesbank has raised German
interest rates again, in an attempt to deflate rising wage demands in
western Germany. Goldman Sachs has since cut its forecast for OECD output
growth in 1992 to 1 1/2 per cent.
What went wrong? First and foremost, the heralded US recovery has not
materialised. The US economy, having suffered one of its shallowest post-war
recessions, is stumbling through an equally slow recovery. Consumer and
business confidence fell last autumn, following a brief recovery after the
end of the Gulf war, depressing spending and orders. The evidence suggests
that the US slipped back into recession in the fourth quarter.
This 'double-dip' US recession has occurred in spite of an aggressive easing
of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve. US real interest rates,
adjusted for expected inflation, have now fallen below 1 per cent. Yet
consumers remain burdened by unprecedentedly high levels of debt, while
banks are still accumulating bad loans.
If anything, the UK is in a worse state than the US. It has not yet
convincingly emerged from its recession, which began a quarter before that
of the US. Further comparison with the US is instructive: the UK has a
higher burden of household debt; its economy is trying to recover from a
deeper recession; it suffers from higher underlying inflation; and has an
exchange rate that is less competitive in world markets.
Most important, however, Britain's short-term interest rates remain more
than twice as high as in the US. Britain was the only member of the European
exchange rate mechanism not to follow the Bundesbank's lead by raising rates
at the end of last year. Yet real interest rates in the UK, and in France
and Italy too, remain painfully high.
The ERM will prevent any marked easing of European monetary policy until the
Bundesbank starts to cut rates. With tension between the German metal
employers and unions rising, and strike threats in the air, the Bundesbank
may not cut rates until the early summer. The result is predictable: more
slow growth across Europe, including Germany. The OECD's leading indicators
of industrial production, which are designed to predict movements in actual
output, suggest flat or falling output across Europe, the US and Japan in
the first half of 1992. The one exception is the UK, whose leading indicator
has been rising for the past 10 months. But there is little sign that UK
output is responding.
The one possible source of more robust growth in 1992 is Japan. The Japanese
economy grew by more than 4 per cent in 1991. Moreover, the Bank of Japan
has responded to growing signs that activity is weakening by cutting
interest rates three times since last July.
Yet this easing of Japanese monetary policy has been accompanied by a steady
fall in business confidence, sluggish retail sales, and rising bankruptcies,
especially among heavily-indebted small and medium sized companies. Broad
money growth has fallen to unprecedentedly low levels, reflecting the
Japanese banks' continued nervousness.
Japan may well ease policy further over the coming months. But unless these
rate cuts are accompanied by easier German monetary policy, and, more
importantly, spark a rise in lending and spending as has not been the case
in the US, the world economy could well face another miserable year.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (4): Stalled on the runway
 -Airlines and Aviation

FOR the first time since World War Two, passenger traffic suffered a decline
last year. Several well known airline names, including Pan American, one of
the most illustrious, disappeared.
Savaged by the collapse of air travel provoked by the Gulf crisis and the
economic recession and the introduction of fiercer competition as a result
of increasing deregulation and liberalisation, the weaker carriers are
struggling to survive.
Consolidation is expected to accelerate in the industry this year through
mergers, acquisitions and commercial partnerships. The latest, and
undoubtedly most significant, deal under discussion is the attempt by
British Airways to link up with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest of
the US to form a global airline to take on the new breed of so-called US
'megacarriers' and the expansionist Far East airlines.
Other airlines are scrambling to forge alliances. Air France is hoping to
link with Sabena of Belgium and has agreed to lead a consortium to acquire
40 per cent of CSA of Czechoslovakia. SAS, Swissair and Air Austria have
formed a commercial and marketing partnership.
In the US, the market has become dominated by three large carriers: American
Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have all grown by
acquiring international and domestic routes from weaker US carriers.
In the Far East, where traffic is expected to continue to show above average
growth, carriers have been seeking to expand their international networks
while consolidating their operational bases in the Asia-Pacific region.
These airlines have also been anxious to develop alliances with other
international partners.
Singapore Airlines has cross-shareholding links with Delta and Swissair;
Qantas is now seeking an international partner to take an equity stake in
the Australian carrier as part of its privatisation; Japan Air Lines and All
Nippon Airways have forged commercial links with international carriers to
bolster their international networks.
But the most immediate problem facing the airline industry is its low level
of profitability. International airline losses last year are expected to
total more than Dollars 4bn compared with a Dollars 2.7bn loss in 1990. Even
though traffic has started to pick up and the industry is expecting to see
growth eventually stabilising at around 5.5 per cent - 6 per cent a year
during the rest of the decade - yields remain under intense pressure because
of heavy and unprofitable discounting of fares.
Airlines will have to improve their overall profitability if they are to
meet their long term aircraft fleet renewal and expansion commitments.
Mr Gunter Eser, the director general of the International Air Transport
Association (IATA), has warned that traffic recovery is being bought at the
expense of yield.
'It simply is not possible with today's cut-price passengers to pay for
tomorrow's full-price aeroplanes,' he said.
The industry faces a host of other pressures. Liberalisation will intensify
competition in the European market and force cost-heavy European carriers to
continue rationalisation to enhance productivity, while improving service
and frequencies to fend off the expansion of US and Asian carriers in more
open European skies.
With the eventual recovery in traffic after last year's Gulf war aberration,
the old problem of congestion in the sky and at airports is expected to
return to the fore. Inadequate air traffic control systems in Europe and in
some other parts of the world coupled with congestion at crowded
international airports risk clipping the wings of any recovery in air
transport unless governments and aviation authorities accelerate efforts to
improve the infrastructure of the industry.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (3): Only a few stars -
The principal industries at a glance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDE range of industrial sectors are in the midst of a deeply disruptive
downturn forcing leading companies into far reaching reassessments of their
strengths and weaknesses.
Traditionally cyclical industries such as chemicals and steel were expecting
lower demand, but not the potentially severe downturn which has emerged. In
the car industry, recession in the US and some European markets has
compounded the difficulty western producers face from a mounting Japanese
challenge.
These traditional manufacturing industries established before the second
world war have been well worn by recessions since the 1970s. More dramatic
is the position of some younger industries - aerospace, aviation and
electronics. The aerospace industry is facing an historic decline in defence
spending; aviation is in the midst of a financial turmoil; the electronics
industries from computers and semi-conductors to consumer electronics are
deeply troubled, almost for the first time since their birth, by sharply
lower growth.
One of the few bright stars is pharmaceuticals, an industry which appears to
have been invulnerable to recession.
What follows is a brief guide to the worldwide state of the main industrial
sectors.
Commercial Vehicles. Commercial vehicle makers, and in particular the truck
producers, are enduring harsh challenges with sales falling in North America
and in many western European markets. Sales and production have also
declined for two years in Japan in 1989-90, though less dramatically.
In Europe, German sales, which were robust last year, are expected to weaken
this year.
Leading truck makers in the US and Europe continue to accumulate heavy
losses.
Cars. Car makers are operating in an increasingly harsh financial climate
with heavy losses particularly in the US in the face of fierce competition
and recession.
In Europe, several volume markets led by the UK, Spain and France, have been
hurt by plunging sales, while the German industry is warning that demand
cannot continue at the overheated levels of last year.
Sales have weakened in Japan after several years of buoyant growth and the
profits of some leading Japanese car makers are slipping.
The focus of the Japanese challenge is likely to shift in the next two years
from the US to Europe.
Engineering. The machinery manufacturing industries have been hit by
recession in the UK. In the US, demand has not picked up but it has stopped
falling. In Asia, the trend of demand is down but not sharply.
Sales into eastern Europe and the former USSR have come to a virtual
standstill while the Middle East has not yet recovered from the Gulf war.
Chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Differences in performance between dynamic
pharmaceuticals companies and their more sluggish chemical counterparts were
all too evident last year.
Helped by ageing populations and increasingly expensive and sophisticated
drugs, the pharmaceuticals groups have proved to be inoculated against the
insidious slowdown of the western economies.
Most top European drugs companies reported sales growth averaging about 13
per cent over the past 12 months.
In contrast, bulk chemical companies had a dreadful year and few expect much
improvement this year although cost cutting programmes should start feeding
into improved margins which have been squeezed by falling prices, lower
demand and soaring environmental costs.
Steel. Red ink is starting to flow thick and fast across the world's steel
industry.
The traditional integrated US steel makers are being severely tested again
having barely recovered from the crisis of the 1980s. Even in Japan, the
most stable and technologically sophisticated industry, profits are coming
under severe pressure.
MEPS, the Sheffield based steel consultancy, projects EC production in 1992
of about 129m tonnes, down from 132m tonnes in 1991.
Japan's output is widely expected to fall about 4m tonnes, to about 107m
tonnes this year.
US production is forecast to be about 1 per cent on last year.
Computers. The industry enters 1992 in disarray.
The major hardware manufacturers are all in difficulties. IBM, the
bellwether of the US industrial economy, had the worst year in its history -
the first time growth had fallen on a year-on-year basis since 1946 and the
first pretax loss in living memory.
The surviving European owned manufacturers, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, Bull
of France and Olivetti of Italy, all lost money last year and have put in
place wide-ranging recovery plans.
The Japanese manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC, which have hitherto
grown strongly on the back of a healthy home market, faltered as problems
with the powerful Japanese banks and hints of scandals in Tokyo shook
business confidence.
Consumer electronics. The growth of the consumer electronics industry in the
last decade has come to a halt.
The travails of the leading European producers such as Philips and Thomson
are well known. Far less familiar are the across the board cuts in capital
spending which have become the rule of the day in Japanese industry.
Aerospace. The aerospace industry is bracing itself for another unstable and
grim year as it adapts to the irrevocable decline in government defence
spending and the recession in civil aviation which has taken a heavy toll of
the fragile finances of many airlines.
Restructuring is expected to lead to more job cuts in the defence sector as
manufacturers grapple with the uncertainty of future defence programmes at
the same time as they reduce capacity in the face of defence cuts.
In the US alone, more than 100,000 people were laid off last year and the
industry expects a further 36,000 to go this year.
In Europe, the leading defence contractors are all in the throes of
restructuring programmes which are likely to be affected by a series of
important government decisions this year on the future of programmes such as
the European Fighter Aircraft.
New orders for commercial aircraft dropped sharply last year and are
expected to remain flat this year. Boeing, the world's biggest commercial
aircraft maker, booked 252 aircraft valued at Dollars 20.26bn last year
compared with a record 543 new aircraft orders in 1990. Airbus, the European
aircraft consortium, booked 101 new aircraft orders compared with 404 the
year before.
Although international passenger traffic has started to recover during the
last three months, airlines are still struggling to climb out of the
recession and continue to face grave financial pressures.
For the first time since World War Two, passenger traffic suffered a decline
last year. The most immediate problem facing the airline industry is its low
level of profitability. International losses last year are expected to total
more than Dollars 4bn compared with a Dollars 2.7bn loss in 1990.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Appointments: Pretty leaves Budgens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Rigby, one of the management troika brought into Budgens by unhappy
institutions at the end of last April, becomes group finance director
following the resignation yesterday of Derek Pretty.
Rigby, 50, a chartered accountant previously at Dunlop and BTR, joined the
board of the small food retailer - one of the pioneers of Sunday trading -
as executive director in charge of distribution.
'Now that I think we have made headway on that side, I am returning to my
own discipline which is finance,' he says, adding that he will retain
responsibilities for distribution.
Pretty, 44, had been in the post only a year when chief executive John
Fletcher was ousted by a group of shareholders. Pretty says that while the
new chief executive John von Spreckelsen asked him to stay, he found his own
position gradually squeezed; Christian Williams, who also joined in April,
was running the treasury and Rigby began to take on more of the financial
controlling tasks.
'I knew it would be a difficult job when I joined - although maybe I didn't
foresee how difficult,' says Pretty.
Rigby, who is English, is surrounded by a cosmopolitan team. Von Spreckelsen
is German, and had just turned round the troubled German retailer Kafu
Wasmund before he arrived at Budgens. Williams, who possesses dual English
and Danish nationality, worked with von Spreckelsen on the Kafu enterprise.

LOWNDES LAMBERT, the insurance broker which went public in July, has taken
steps to strengthen its senior management team with the appointment of
William Wilks as its new finance director.
Wilks, 51, is new to the insurance scene. An FCA, he was previously finance

FT  31 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Cleaning delay puts ship off-hire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BERGE SUND
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court):
Mr Justice Steyn:
December 19 1991
A TIME-chartered ship is off-hire for a 'cause preventing the efficient
working of the ship' through no 'fault' of the charterers, if she is not is
an efficient state to provide the service next expected of her in
furtherance of the voyage, in that she is necessarily delayed by a
misfortune risk due to an unascertainable cause for which neither charterers
nor shipowners are to blame.
Mr Justice Steyn so held when dismissing an appeal by Sig Bergesen DY &amp; Co
and others, owners of Berge Sund, from a decision by arbitrators that
charterers, Mobil Shipping and Transportation Co, were entitled to the
return of hire paid under the charterparty.
HIS LORDSHIP said that Berge Sund was a tanker designed for the carriage of
liquid petroleum gas.
By a time charterparty dated September 20 1979 the owners let her to
charterers for 20 years.
The charterparty provided that the master, although in the owners' employ,
'shall observe the orders of the charterers as regards employment of the
vessel'.
An off-hire clause provided that hire should cease for loss of time 'not
caused by charterers' fault . . . due to repairs, breakdown, accident or
damage to the vessel, collision, standing, fire, interference by authorities
or any other cause preventing the efficient working of the vessel'.
For 10 months after delivery the vessel carried only cargoes of butane and
propane, and did not have to be cleaned. In September 1982 she carried a
contaminated cargo to Europe. During a ballast voyage to the Arabian Gulf,
tank cleaning took place. The vessel reached Ras Tanura. On December 20 the
charterers' surveyors found that two tanks were contaminated.
Further tank cleaning was ordered. On January 1 1983 their condition was
satisfactory, but then there were problems with obtaining coolant and a
cargo nomination, and the port was closed, so the vessel was unable to load
until January 9 1983.
The arbitration dispute concerned the delay in loading. The charterers said
the vessel was off-hire and claimed back hire paid for that period.
Arbitrators found the vessel was off-hire from December 20 to January 9, and
awarded Dollars 600,002.
They found the delay at Ras Tanura arose because the vessel failed the
standard copper corrosion test. They were unable to make a definite finding
as to the cause of the failure. They identified three possible causes but
found that neither owners nor charterers were to blame.
The owners appealed.
They submitted that 'fault' in the context of the off-hire clause did not
mean blameworthiness, but meant responsibility for an untoward occurrence.
Prima facie 'fault' in a charterparty meant conscious wrongdoing or
negligence. When parties had in mind strict or absolute liability there were
well-known phrases such as 'act, neglect or default'.
It would be stretching the ordinary meaning to read fault in the off-hire
clause as signifying less than blameworthiness. The owners' interpretation
was rejected.
The charterers relied on 'or any other cause preventing efficient working of
the vessel' in the off-hire clause.
The objective of the off-hire clause was to relieve charterers of the
obligation to pay hire when they did not have use of the vessel. It did not
require that 'off-hire events' should be attributable to owners' fault. The
emphasis was on a pragmatic allocation of risk.
It was settled that 'or any cause preventing the efficient working of the
vessel' could not be construed ejusdem generis with the ill-assorted events
previously mentioned in the clause.
The arbitrators said that the fact they did not ascribe the unreadiness to
owners' negligence did not mean it fell outside 'any other cause preventing
the efficient working of the vessel'. They decided there was an off-hire
event within the meaning of the clause, and time was lost as a result.
They found that due to nobody's fault, cleaning unexpectedly became
necessary. Reading the award as a whole they categorised the problem which
arose at Ras Tanura as an accident or a misfortune risk.
Mr Moore-Bick for the owners submitted that the arbitrators applied the
wrong test. They found the vessel was not 'in an efficient state to provide
the service expected of her, namely loading'.
He said the arbitrators erred in concentrating on the charterers' subjective
wishes instead of on what was objectively needed to be done in furtherance
of the voyage.
The court disagreed. The arbitrators posed exactly the right question.
It was then submitted that the service required of the vessel was not
loading but cleaning.
Again the court disagreed. Objectively what was required in furtherance of
the voyage was that loading should commence on December 20.
The owners submitted the charterers shipped dangerous cargo which caused the
vessel to go off-hire, in breach of contract.
The arbitrators concluded the cargo was not dangerous. It merely required
the vessel to be cleaned more thoroughly.
They were right. On the facts of the case the cargo was plainly not
dangerous. That ground of appeal failed.
The owners relied on The Rijn (1981) 2 Lloyd's Rep 267 in which an off-hire
claim did not succeed. Mr Justice Mustill said with regard to 'or any other
cause', the only qualifying causes were those which were 'fortuitous and not
the natural result of the ship complying with the charterers' orders'.
The owners said the delay was caused by natural consequences of the manner
in which the charterers chose to employ the vessel.
The arbitrators distinguished The Rijn in which there was no element of
fortuity from the present case where, they said, loss of time was not 'the
natural result of loading the cargo'. They said there might have been any
number of reasons why the vessel failed the copper strip corrosion test.
It was clear that the arbitrators regarded the problem that arose at Ras
Tanura as wholly unexpected. It was not the natural result of use of the
vessel. It was a misfortune risk.
The Rijn principle, whatever its precise limits might be, was inapplicable
on the special facts of the case.
It was common ground that there was implied into the charterparty a
charterers' undertaking to indemnify owners against the consequences of
complying with their orders.
The undertaking was implied by law, because of the nature of the
charterparty and the master's obligation to comply with charterers' orders.
It was submitted that if the vessel was off-hire, the owners were entitled
to indemnity.
The arbitrators rejected the contention because first, they did not consider
it appropriate to cut down specific provisions of the off-hire clause by
reference to the more general terms of the implied indemnity; and second,
the off-hire clause had the specific limitation that it was not to apply to
loss of time caused by charterers' fault.
A term implied by law could only be excluded by contrary provision. In other
words, it would only be excluded if inconsistent with express terms of the
charterparty.
The arbitrators apparently thought the implication was inconsistent with the
off-hire clause.
Inconsistency had not been established.
The implied indemnity was not limited to matters outside the scope of other
clauses of the charterparty (The Ann Stathatos (1950) 83 Ll R 228,234,235).
It might overlap with matters dealt with in other clauses. Such overlap did
not necessarily involve inconsistency.
The implied term was left intact by the express terms of the off-hire
clause.
However, the indemnity only extended to direct consequences of complying
with the relevant orders (Ann Stathatos, 235-239).
There was no express finding that loss of time resulted directly from
compliance with charterers' orders. It was not possible on the facts to
infer that the problem at Ras Tanura was the direct consequence of their
orders or of the loading of the cargo.
The appeal failed.
An application to remit the award on the ground that the arbitrators
overlooked a substantial issue was refused. The court was satisfied that
they did not overlook the issue.
For the shipowners: Martin Moore-Bick QC and D Matthews (Sinclair Roche &amp;
Temperley).
For the charterers: Stewart Boyd QC (Allen &amp; Overy).

FT  31 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German carmakers come into the
limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARMAKERS came more broadly into the limelight yesterday as the big German
groups replaced Volvo as the centre of international investment attention,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT majored on the motor industry as Volkswagen rose DM10 to DM338 and
BMW by DM6 to DM523.50, VW and Daimler heading the active stocks list in
turnover of DM888m, and DM864m.
German stock market turnover rose from DM6.4bn to DM6.6bn as blue chips led
equities higher. After a 1.59 fall to 679.34 in the broadly-based FAZ index
at midsession, the 30-share DAX closed 8.51 higher at 1,680.91.
Mr Bob Barber, who heads the European automotive and capital goods analysis
team at James Capel, was not impressed with VW, noting that the company,
which underperformed the market last year, faced an estimated drop of 12 per
cent in new German car sales this year with 40 per cent of its own sales
going into the domestic market.
BMW yesterday confirmed that its sales and profits were higher in 1991, and
forecast higher production and sales figures for the current year.
In electricals, AEG had another of its sporadic surges, rising DM9.80 to
DM224.20 and the battery group, Varta, rose DM11.50 to DM302. It said
yesterday that final talks on a cooperation accord had begun with Japan's
Toshiba Battery, and Duracell of the US on the production of rechargeable
nickel hydride batteries.
PARIS came back from its highs after an active day's trading. The CAC-40
index slipped 5.70 to 1,873.94 in relatively heavy volume of FFr3.2bn.
Synthelabo, the pharmaceutical company controlled by L'Oreal, was unusually
active as 92,700 shares or around 1 per cent of the company were put through
the market in several large blocks. The stock fell FFr6 to FFr1,095. A
spokesman for Goldman Sachs would only say that it had placed less than 5
per cent of the company yesterday.
Dealers believed that the shares had come from the owners of companies
recently taken over by Synthelabo and had been placed with institutions.
Pernod Ricard, the drinks group, rose to an all-time high of FFr1,534 on
continued takeover speculation before closing FFr10 down at FFr1,485 with a
heavy 149,000 shares traded.
Paribas ended FFr7.50 lower at FFr347.50 with 217,866 shares traded. After
the close the bank announced that it had made a net attributable loss of
FFr200m in 1991, which came in below expectations which had already been
downgraded after the recent disclosure of heavy provisions for loans to
Maxwell companies.
MILAN weakened during the official session following the overnight loss on
Wall Street. The Comit index fell 7.26 to 537.81 in turnover estimated at
L100bn after Wednesday's L105.8bn.
Fiat fell L133 or 2.6 per cent to L5,028 in the wake of its poor 1991
results and slipped to L5,025 after hours.
The telecommunications sector came under pressure on rumours that Stet was
launching a big bond with warrants into Sip savings shares and there were
fears of heavy earnings dilution as a result. Stet slipped L13 to L2,261
while Sip savings shares fell L55 or 4 per cent to L1,320.
STOCKHOLM saw another fall in Volvo in the aftermath of the abortive
Volvo/Procordia merger. The B shares fell SKr7 to SKr378 on the day and 10
per cent from Monday's intraday peak of SKr420.
The Affarsvarlden General index dropped 6.2 to 967.5 as brokers said that
the market was also beginning to be troubled by the prospect of the Swedish
corporate results seasons which begins next week. Market rumours indicate
disappointing results from Electrolux, due to produce preliminary figures on
next Tuesday. Yesterday the B shares slipped SKr3 to SKr239.
AMSTERDAM slipped back slightly, the CBS Tendency Index shedding 0.1 to
121.00 in turnover of Fl 539.8m.
Elsevier, which announced a strong profit forecast, rose Fl 2.40 to Fl
105.40. UK interest was reported to be heavy. Elsewhere in the publishing
sector VNU rose Fl 0.5 to Fl 83.00.
MADRID's general index fell 0.07 to 253.80. Asland, the cement group, which
played down reports of possible US court action, drifted Pta40 to Pta2,065.
Volume in Iberdrola, the utility, was high at 2.7m shares: the share price
picked up Pta2 to Pta723. Telefonica continued its fall on the back of the
pension fund problems, losing Pta5 to Pta1,160.
OSLO gained in dull trading, the all-share index moving 1.5 to 445.00 in
turnover of NKr217m. Saga B rose NKr4.5 to NKr95.5 on reports that the UK
may lift a ban on imports of Norwegian gas.

FT  31 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei overcomes weak
start as futures jump

<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average overcame a weak opening on arbitrage-related buying as
well as small-lot buying by foreigners and individuals, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed 195.41 ahead at 21,557.67 after a day's low of 21,334.30
and high of 21,779.14. It lost ground at the start because of the overnight
fall on Wall Street and lower bond prices, but strength in the futures
market prompted arbitrage-related index buying.
Volume expanded to 250m shares from 180m, rising above 200m for the first
time in five trading days. Traders attributed 50m of this to block
cross-trading. Advances led declines by 704 to 266, with 151 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 13.62 to
1,598.35, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.96 to 1,229.97.
Traders said the premium over the cash market created by the jump in futures
prices had activated arbitrage buying. 'The wider spread between the futures
and cash markets is a bullish sign,' said a futures trader at County
NatWest.
Interest among individual investors was noted. News that more than 100
people had turned up for a stock investment seminar at a branch of a leading
Japanese brokerage house encouraged other investors. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'Some individuals are attracted to the current low
prices.'
Individual investors chose earnings situations. Video game makers gained on
projections of increased profits for the current year to March. Sega
Enterprises moved ahead Y400 to Y13,300, and Nintendo Y700 to Y11,300 in
Osaka.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ended Y3,000 up at Y683,000 on bargain
hunting after briefly sinking to an all-time low of Y678,000.
Electrical engineering companies firmed on reports that electric power
companies plan to expand capital spending next fiscal year. Yondenko added
Y20 at Y1,290 and Chudenko Y150 at Y4,500.
Reports of rising orders for prefabricated apartments lifted housing issues.
Taisei Prefab Construction climbed Y60 to Y2,310 and Daiwa House Industry
Y30 to Y1,900.
Showa Highpolymer advanced by its daily limit of Y104 to Y1,100. The issue
regained popularity as an environmental play, thanks to its biodegradable
plastics.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 292.51 to 23,082.21 in volume of 157.6m
shares, the highest turnover for this year. Traders said the turnover
reflected active cross-trading ahead of the March book closing in banking
issues. The Bank of Tokyo, the most active issue of the day, declined Y30 to
Y1,360.
Roundup
THE STEEP fall on Wall Street sent markets in the Pacific Rim region
generally lower.
HONG KONG took comfort from stronger than expected Bank of East Asia results
 -30 per cent profits growth to HKDollars 504m from HKDollars 387m
previously - which pushed the stock up 20 cents to HKDollars 25.20. The news
helped to reduce early losses and the Hang Seng index ended just 0.34 off at
4,571.47.
Utility and property shares were the major movers: New World declined 30
cents to HKDollars 13.10, but HK Telecom rose 10 cents to HKDollars 7.85.
Hongkong Land lost 10 cents to HKDollars 10.10.
SEOUL rallied after two days of decline in active trading. The composite
index gained 4.85 to 664.13 in turnover of Won328bn (Won363bn).
KUALA LUMPUR motor issues were hit by a rise in tax on four-wheel drive
vehicles: UMV fell 36 cents to MDollars 4.02 and Angkasa 30 cents to
MDollars 4.00. The composite index slipped 4.53 to 568.75. SINGAPORE was
quiet and the Straits Times Industrial index receded 6.79 to 1,526.04.
BANGKOK finished mixed, with heavy trading in property and finance stocks.
The SET index shed 3.87 to 764.70. Siam Cement, the second-largest quoted
company, eased Bt4 to Bt628. There was news that Thai International Airways
may be listed in April.
JAKARTA was active with the Jardine Fleming index rising 1.33 to 60.78. The
banks sector remained strong.
TAIWAN gained slightly before closing for the Chinese new year. The weighted
index firmed 1.58 to 5,391.63. The market reopens on February 7.
MANILA's composite index weakened 11.01 to 1,231.03, with the downward trend
expected to last.
AUSTRALIA showed some recovery after a weak opening, the All Ordinaries
index ending 9.6 down at 1,612.5, picking up from a 15-point fall. Volume
came to 129.5m shares. ANZ, which announced a one-for-five rights issue on
Wednesday, fell 8 cents to ADollars 4.20. Westpac was off 8 cents at
ADollars 4.02 on a downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating
agency.
NEW ZEALAND fell for the third consecutive day, the NZSE-40 losing 12.16 to
1,456.39. Telecom rose a cent to NZDollars 2.37.
BOMBAY shot up to a record high for the sixth time this month, on relentless
speculative buying. The BSE index leapt 85.55 to 2,299.77.

FT  31 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: European insurers show signs of
recovery - But some analysts are at a loss to explain the recent bounce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strange things are happening to Europe's insurance stocks, which are showing
signs of recovery after two years in the doldrums.
With profits depressed by fierce rate competition and steadily rising
claims, the share prices of many major insurance companies performed
sluggishly in 1990 and 1991, for the most part underperforming their
respective markets, after strong growth in the 1980s, when the strength of
their assets fuelled investor interest.
Yet in recent weeks insurance stocks have risen strongly, with Europe's
biggest companies, from Generali in Italy to Guardian Royal Exchange in the
UK, outperforming the market.
Figures produced by BNP Securities show the extent of the recent recovery.
After a rise of just 1.6 per cent for the whole of last year, BNP's European
insurance index - based on an index of 69 European insurance stocks - grew
by 12.24 per cent from December 23, 1991 to January 30. This compared with a
rise of 9.63 per cent for the FT-Actuaries Europe index over the same
period.
The best rises came in Norway, which gained 28.82 per cent, and France with
27.98 per cent, against respective increases of 13.31 per cent and 15.1 per
cent for the markets themselves.
Yet many of the sector's underlying problems are still there. The decline in
property values has not only weakened balance sheets: in France, for
example, it has also depressed profitability by reducing the scope for
realised capital gains. Property sales have generated a significant share of
the pre-tax profits of France's leading companies.
Declining real interest rates could benefit the asset position of those
companies which hold sizeable portfolios of bonds but, conversely, this
trend will cut investment income for non-life companies whose investment
portfolios are heavily weighted in this direction.
Meanwhile, price competition is continuing to undermine underwriting profits
in spite of rate increases - in the UK household and motor sector last year
and, more recently, promised in French and Italian motor rates.
In France a number of mutually owned companies have been winning market
share hand over fist at the expense of their bigger rivals. France's three
state-owned companies, Assurances Generales de France (AGF), Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP) and the Groupe des Assurances Nationales (Gan),
along with Axa in the private sector, have all come under pressure from the
mutuals, which enjoy considerable cost advantages.
The gradual opening up of the European market to cross-border trade is also
increasing competition. According to Mr Angus Runciman, European analyst
with BNP Securities: 'The underlying trend (of rates) is still downwards.'
All this leaves analysts scratching their heads to explain the recent
bounce. Ms Christiane Marcellier of James Capel in Paris says French
companies are undervalued compared to their Italian or German counterparts.
Market capitalisation as a percentage of premiums is only around 0.6 for
most French firms against 1.8 in Italy and Germany.
Ms Brigitte Cole of BZW in London points to the importance of a recent
announcement by the French government that it is about to introduce
legislation which will open up a private pensions market for the first time.
Life business already generates 40 per cent of the revenues of UAP, Axa and
AGF. Gan, which generates 60 per cent of its business from life insurance,
is especially well placed to take advantage of the new market opportunities.
'We think that insurance share prices will outperform the market this year,'
says Ms Cole.
Mr Runciman is not so sure: 'There is no reason why investors should jump
in. The industry is not suddenly going to start making oodles of money.'
In France, the government's intention to raise cash by reducing its stake in
the three state-owned insurers (to 51 per cent from its current level of 75
per cent) is another cloud on the horizon.
Although the privatisation would normally lift market sentiment, the
government is said to be at odds with the companies, which would prefer it
to reduce its interest by, for example, issuing new shares for cash or by
establishing cross-holdings in other European financial groups.
BNP expects the resulting tension to depress investor enthusiasm. It says
the sale could create a potential overhang of FFr22.1bn.

NAMIBIAN authorities are preparing what they hope will be an attractive
mining code for investors, a senior government official said, reports Reuter
from Windhoek.
Mr Leake Hangala, the mines and energy permanent secretary, said the
government was drafting mining legislation, a mining tax policy and a labour
code to promote mining and energy exploration.
He added that he hoped the legislation would be enacted during the current
session of the national assembly.
Only two days ago the South African company Revere Resources announced it
intended to develop a major copper mine in Namibia. Mr Hangala described
this development as exciting.
The company said it planned to spend about R280m (Pounds 48m) developing the
Haib porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit, where reserves of 1.5bn tonnes of
ore have been identified north of the Orange River border.
The mine is expected to begin initial production before the end of the year.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ lamb group short-lists UK
sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTEX, THE New Zealand lamb processing group that is seeking a site for a
UK plant, will hear submissions during March from four local authorities
competing to attract the inward investment.
Shropshire County Council said yesterday that Fortex had short-listed a site
at Craven Arms, in the lamb-producing south of the county. The other
short-listed contenders for the plant are Welshpool in Wales, Dumfries and
Galloway, and Lockerbie in Scotland.
Fortex requires a landscaped site of about 50 acres, in an area which would
provide stock for the plant and at the same time could act as a distribution
centre, the County Council noted.
The initial planned investment is thought to be between Pounds 20m and
Pounds 25m. The plant would process 2m lambs a year. It would offer full-
and part-time employment to about 750 people. Since the closure of the JP
Woods chicken-processing plant in Craven Arms, with the loss of 500 jobs,
the Shropshire authorities have been particularly anxious to attract new
industry to the south of the county.
After hearing what is on offer from the four contenders for its plant,
Fortex is expected to make a decision on its desired location by May.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders believe zinc market
squeeze is over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TECHNICAL squeeze on nearby supplies that has threatened to create turmoil
on the London Metal Exchange's zinc market seemed to be over, traders and
analysts were suggesting last night.
This was reflected in a substantial fall in zinc prices yesterday. Metal for
immediate delivery closed Dollars 21 a tonne down at Dollars 1,150 while
three-month zinc fell Dollars 19.25 to Dollars 1,144.
The LME twice issued formal warnings that it was taking an intense interest
since the squeeze began to build last December.
Traders suggest that those responsible for the squeeze had used options to
take control of between 60 and 70 per cent of the exchange's zinc stocks.
However, metal became much more freely available this week and Mr Robin
Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, said the threat of LME action might
have been responsible for the change of heart.
'While some of the technical tightness might have been rolled over to future
months, the squeeze is probably over,' he added.
There has been widespread market speculation that some zinc smelters have
been behind the squeeze, hoping that the resulting higher LME prices would
make the mining companies more willing to accept higher charges for treating
zinc concentrates.

AFRICAN OIL producers hope to expand production and so increase their
influence on world markets, Mr Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, said
yesterday, reports Reuter from Abidjan.
'We hope to increase the amount of hydrocarbons under control of APPA
(African Petroleum Producers Association),' he said at a meeting of the
11-member association in the Ivory Coast capital.
Association officials said it did not envisage creating its own oil output
quota system but tried to tailor output along the general lines of
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries policy.
'We support the efforts of Opec in stabilising the market,' said Mr Mohamed
Souidi, the executive secretary.
Mr Aminu, the current Opec president, said that in a buyers market it was
that much more difficult for African oil producers to spend on exploration
to boost market share above the 10 per cent they now control.

Silver closed firmer on the London bullion market after dipping on news of a
larger than expected fall of 5 per cent in US durable goods orders for
December. After opening 6 cents higher it reached a high for the day of 426
cents a troy ounce before retreating to its recent 411 to 422 cent range.
Comex silver futures were sharply lower at midday. On the LME aluminium
prices held relatively steady during the afternoon as renewed support
developed after a morning slump to around Dollars 1,250 a tonne for
three-month metal. Traders said the day had been active, with the recent
build-up of resistance on any rises to around Dollars 1,300 slowing the
market's upward momentum and prompting widespread liquidation. Technical
traders had been looking for a downward reaction to correct an overbought
situation, but the market will need some evidence that consumers are
prepared to pay higher prices before it retests the highs. Copper closed
steady in dollar terms. The market continues to monitor the situation in
Chile, where miners have said they will stage protests against Codelco
privatisation measures. In Chicago soyabeans were falling fast at midsession
as chart-based sell orders were triggered under Dollars 5.72 a bushel for
March.

'manifesto'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UK farm sector will not be able to sustain the rural economy single
handed in the 1990s, according to the Country Landowners Association, which
yesterday launched its Manifesto for the Countryside.
The manifesto will be distributed to all MPs and parliamentary candidates
for the coming election, said Mr John Fellowes, president of the CLA, which
has 48,000 members. It calls for policies that 'promote profits, jobs,
conservation and recreation'.
The general thrust of the manifesto calls for greater flexibility,
particularly in the areas of planning, taxation and farm tenancy
legislation. For example, land ownership is classed as not being a business,
Mr Fellowes said. Capital gains tax makes it impossible for landlords to
exchange one asset for another.
Pointing out that farm incomes had fallen by 30 per cent in the past two
years, Mr Fellowes said no-one wanted to see the countryside derelict again,
as it was in the 1930s. 'If you don't have profits in the countryside, you
don't have a countryside,' he said.

WORLD WHEAT stocks are expected to fall by the end of 1991-92 to 128m tonnes
 -10m tonnes less than at the end of last year, according to the latest
report from the International Wheat Council.
Stocks in the US will fall from 23.6m tonnes to only 10.6m tonnes, the
lowest level since 1974. But stocks in Canada are expected to rise by more
than 2m tonnes to 12.6m tonnes, the highest since 1980, following the bumper
crop last year. EC stocks, already 16.7m tonnes at the start of the year,
could soar to a record 22m tonnes, including 14m tonnes in intervention.
The main reason behind the projected fall in total stocks has been an
increase in expected consumption, now estimated at 569m tonnes. However,
this is still below the 575m tonnes consumed last year.
Food use is forecast to be 380m tonnes, 8m tonnes higher than last year,
while animal feed use of wheat is only 4m tonnes lower at 118m tonnes, in
spite of the increased price of wheat compared with feed grains this season.
Combined carry over stocks of the five major exporting countries -
Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the US - will be 47m tonnes at the
end of the year, the IWC says. This compares with 54m tonnes last year, but
is well above the 38m tonnes seen at the end of 1989-90.
South Africa, which is usually an exporter of maize, will have to import
this year because of widespread crop failure caused by drought, a senior
Maize Board official said, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
The Board's general manager, Hennie Davel, said it was too soon to assess
accurately the size of the current crop.
He added, however: 'Even if we do have crucial rains, we will still have a
deficit. That means we will have to import'.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy set to reform tax on
interest for interbank deposits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S cabinet was poised yesterday to abolish the 30 per cent withholding
tax on interest for interbank deposits, in what would be a further crucial
step in reforming Italy's capital markets.
Confirmation of the decision is due at a cabinet meeting today, according to
Mr Rino Formica, the finance minister. Mr Formica did not indicate when the
move would take effect.
Removal of the withholding tax would be one of the most significant in a
series of recent steps to liberalise and improve the competitiveness of
Italy's capital markets. However, while numerous moves have been made on the
bond side, tax reform on interbank deposits, strongly supported by the Bank
of Italy, had been consistently blocked by the Finance Ministry.
'It will be an enormous boost for the entire structure of the capital
markets,' said one leading banker yesterday.
Bankers have been lobbying for the change for some time, on the grounds that
the tax created severe distortions in the interbank market and handicapped
the lira deposit market overall. Moreover, while interest on interbank
deposits has been subject to withholding tax, such lending to corporates has
been exempt.
The result has been to make banks extremely reluctant to lend money among
themselves. Banks with excess liquidity have tended to make funds available
to the interbank market only when other avenues - such as lending to
corporations - has failed. Even then, funds have been placed on the
interbank market for the briefest possible periods. 'The interbank market
tends to be used only as a last resort, and on an overnight basis',
commented one banker. The tax makes using the market 'atrociously
expensive', he said.
Removing the tax should stimulate the creation of a much deeper interbank
market and produce a range of maturities. Those, in turn, should spur the
development of derivate products like interest rate swaps and forward rate
agreements. Such techniques have flourished in the London-based Eurolira
market - which is unaffected by the withholding tax - but been severely
handicapped domestically.
By removing the main barrier between the domestic interbank market and that
for Eurolira deposits, the tax change would also create a much bigger
overall lira deposit pool. The existence of the tax is believed to be one of
the major factors behind the delay in creating futures and options products
on Eurolira deposits at foreign derivates markets, a step that may now be
accelerated.
The lower house of the Italian parliament yesterday approved a long-awaited
new law governing minority shareholders' rights in takeover bids. With only
days before the dissolution of parliament, approval of the law, which has
been seen as one of the last crucial steps in Italy's stock market reform,
appeared increasingly doomed.
The new ruling must now be approved by the senate before becoming law.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Sterling Eurobond demand lifts interest
in new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BROAD range of borrowers, including three UK companies, raised funds in a
variety of currencies in the Eurobond market yesterday.
Pent-up demand for sterling Eurobonds boosted interest in three new issues.
Enterprise Oil launched a Pounds 100m four-year deal via Warburg which
performed strongly, meeting surprisingly firm demand from overseas as well
as UK investors.
Dealers said the deal's reception was enhanced by continental demand for
short-dated sterling bonds, as well as by the generally positive performance
of previous Enterprise deals.
The deal was considered fairly priced to yield 95 basis points above the
comparable gilt issue. The proceeds will be used to develop the company's
continental shelf assets.
A Pounds 100m issue of 11 1/4 per cent bonds by the Guaranteed Export
Finance Corporation (GEFCO) via Baring Brothers was added to an existing
Pounds 250m deal. The deal, structured as a block trade (without any
underwriting group), was considered attractively priced to yield 24 basis
points above the three-year gilts, and also benefited from firm demand for
short-dated sterling paper.
A Pounds 100m eight-year deal for Britannia Building Society via UBS was
considered reasonably priced at a spread of 115 basis points above the 9 per
cent gilt due 2000, but had to rely mainly on UK institutional demand, due
to both the maturity and the borrower.
In the Ecu sector, British Gas International launched an Ecu150m offering of
five-year bonds due 1997, priced to yield 8.45 per cent, 5 basis points
below the yield of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau's five-year deal launched
on Wednesday.
Logically, KFW, a German state agency without an explicit government
guarantee is a stronger credit than British Gas, a public company, albeit a
utility, even though both are Triple-A rated. However, dealers reported
strong demand from retail investors, many of whom still focus on name more
than credit and described placement as smooth.
The improvement of swap opportunities in the Ecu sector allowed British Gas
to achieve cheaper funding than would have been available in the sterling
market. The proceeds of the issue, which will be used to replace short-term
borrowings, were swapped into fixed-rate sterling at a level 'well under 10
per cent', according to a British Gas official. British Gas's Dollars 200m
five-year deal launched last Friday was also swapped into sterling at just
under 10 per cent.
The deals have also filled a gap in the maturity spectrum of British Gas's
debt profile as the company previously had no debt maturing in 1997. The
company may return to the Eurobond market later in the year to finance the
repayment of the last Pounds 350m tranche of its government debenture.
However, the repayment could be repaid from the company's cash flow.
In the French market, the European Investment Bank launched a FFr3bn 10-year
deal via Credit Commercial de France, priced to yield 27 basis points above
the 10-year French government bond.
Strong demand for the issue caused the spread to tighten to 23 basis points,
which comforted underwriters who have felt the EIB has been skimping on the
yield spread and fees of recent deals. (The deal was syndicated, rather than
structured as a block trade, as some recent EIB offerings have been.)
In the dollar sector, a Dollars 400m five-year offering for the
Inter-American Development Bank via Credit Suisse First Boston got off to a
rather slow start, which dealers attributed to lack of enthusiasm for dollar
securities. The pricing of the deal was considered reasonable, but not
generous, at 28 basis points above the five-year Treasury, but poor buying
interest caused the spread to widen by 4 basis points.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: An emotive topic for
international regulators - The development of capital rules for securities
traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR an esoteric subject, the development of capital rules for securities
traders raises surprisingly strong emotions.
According to one investment banker in London, the international regulators
who have been tackling this difficult question in recent days 'are living in
cloud cuckoo land - they have no philosophical background for their ideas
and no experience of running these businesses.' Another comments: 'It would
simply be a disaster if they do what they are planning to do.'
These bankers, who refused to be named, were reacting to the outline for a
common international standard for assessing the minimum capital backing
needed by securities firms, which emerged from a meeting of regulators in
Switzerland this week.
Though an international affair, between the International Organisation of
Securities Commissions (Iosco) and the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision, the meeting had a distinctly US feel. Both agencies were led by
US chairmen, respectively Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.
Though little detail of the regulators' conclusions has been revealed, it is
possible to piece together the two main conclusions. They apply both to
banks which carry on securities business on their own balance sheets and to
non-bank securities firms.
The first would force many securities businesses - particularly those in the
UK - to have more capital to support their equity exposures. Although no
figures were published after the meeting, it is understood the banking and
securities regulators reached broad agreement that securities traders should
have capital equal to 8 per cent of their net positions, with a further 4
per cent of their gross positions.
It is the 4 per cent requirement that raises the greatest passions in the
UK, which had held out for a 2 per cent rule. Securities companies claim it
fails to recognise the merits of diversification in their portfolios: they
would have to provide large amounts of capital, even though modern portfolio
theory suggests that is unnecessary.
Little theoretical justification has been advanced to support the 8 + 4
proposal - indeed, the precise numbers adopted are likely to be more the
result of what the market will bear rather than any idealised numbers. This
mirrors the discussions between banking regulators which led to the 8 per
cent ratio adopted in the Basle accord of 1988.
The second significant conclusion from this week's meeting, concerns the
ratio of subordinated debt to other capital that can be counted for
regulatory purposes. Broad agreement fixed on a ratio of 2.5:1.
That will help to appease securities firms, but has antagonised banking
regulators: the protracted talks that brought about the earlier Basle accord
had debated this issue, before finally alighting on a ratio of 1:1.
Preliminary agreement on these two contentious points merely scratches the
surface of what has become a deeply involved negotiation, aimed at reaching
a compromise between the different interests of banks and securities
companies. The list of complaints from each side is still long enough to
suggest that considerable work lies ahead:
Securities firms point out that the broad rules being proposed make no
distinction between the different risks of different types of security.
Illiquid securities, for instance, are more difficult to sell and therefore
inherently riskier than liquid ones. That would make the rules a blunt
instrument to apply - just as the internationally agreed rules on credit
risk make little distinction between different types of loans banks take on.
An international accord would not be able to allow for the many
sophisticated hedging techniques used to limit market risk. These techniques
are too complex, and are developed too fast, for international regulators to
keep pace.
For banks, the rules would relate only to trading books, not other parts of
the business.
The result: an in-built difference in the capital treatment of different
types of lending done in the same institution. This would raise difficult
questions about what should or should not be carried in a trading book. It
could also lead to greater securitisation of banks' assets, as lending is
switched into the trading book to take account of the more favourable
capital regime.
This week's agreement marked the beginning of a long process of negotiation.
The immediate result will be a consultative paper on the issue. This will be
the subject of intense negotiation, as each side attempts to tilt the
overall impact of the proposed capital regime in its favour.
These thoughts will then need to be linked to a parallel discussion underway
in Brussels, aimed at producing a Capital Adequacy Directive. Pressure to
reach a conclusion within the EC has eased somewhat, due to the failure to
reach agreement on a 'single passport' which would have allowed investment
firms to operate through branches throughout the EC.
However, other planned developments in the EC will prevent the capital
directive from falling off the agenda altogether: the development of a
consolidated supervision directive, for instance, which would bring together
the prudential regulation of all aspects of a diversified financial group's
business.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Stet plans L400bn Eurobond
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STET, the Italian state-controlled telecommunications holding company, is
preparing a L400bn (Dollars 335.28m) offering of Eurobonds with equity
warrants attached, the largest of its kind to date, according to market
sources.
The warrants will be exercisable into a total of around 250m savings shares
of Sip, the quoted telecommunications utility in which Stet has a 58.6 per
cent stake. The bonds are expected to carry a coupon of between 8 3/4 per
cent and 9 1/4 per cent, and the exercise price into the Sip savings shares
will be indicated at L1,456 to L1,540. The bonds will have a life of five
years and will be priced at par.
Savings shares in Sip fell L55 or 4 per cent to L1,320 yesterday, partly on
fears of earnings dilution when the warrants are exercised. However, a
banker associated with the deal said there would be no dilution as the
warrants will be exercised into shares held by Stet.
The bonds will be issued through Softe, a Luxembourg-based financial
subsidiary, and guaranteed by Stet. Officials at the lead manager
Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, were unavailable for comment.
Details of the transaction, which is not scheduled to be launched until
February 24, have not been finalised yet. Roadshows are planned ahead of the
issue and invitations to co-lead managers have already been sent out.

BANCO Comercial Portugues (BCP), one of Portugal's top three commercial
banks and its largest stock market listed company, yesterday announced
strong increases in assets and profits for 1991.
Total assets grew by 51 per cent from Es801bn at the end of 1990 to
Es1,206bn (Dollars 8.9bn) at December 1991.
Net profits were Es18.2bn - up 33 per cent on the previous year.
Return on equity rose from 14.4 per cent to 16.8 per cent last year, with
earnings per share, adjusted for dilution resulting from the incor-poration
of reserves in March 1990, rising over 24 per cent from Es222.4 in 1990 to
Es276.1 last year.
During 1991, the bank continued to expand its activities opening another 111
branches, bringing its branch network to 242. The physical expansion of the
bank was reflected in a strong increase in credit extended to clients, up 75
per cent to Es516bn, and in customer deposits up 59 per cent to Es932bn at
the end of 1991.
Having become one of the leading banks on the Portuguese market, BCP is
gradually developing its presence on the international markets, and earlier
this month, it joined forces with Banco Popular Espanol of Spain to set up a
new bank in France.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: EIB balance sheet total rises
to Ecu74.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE president of the European Investment Bank yesterday said the bank's role
in the long-term financing of EC integration had been 'confirmed and further
developed' by the outcome of December's Maastricht summit of EC leaders.
Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder announced that the EIB raised Ecu13.7bn on the
capital markets last year - an increase of more than 24 per cent on 1990,
when Ecu11bn was borrowed. The bank lent Ecu15.3bn, compared with Ecu13.4bn
the previous year and its balance sheet total increased from Ecu63.5bn to
Ecu74.3bn.
'The volume of funds mobilised by our bank in 1991 is larger than that of
any other international financing institution, including the World Bank,' he
added.
The majority of loans went towards promoting social and economic integration
in the EC, but the proportion of loans to non-EC countries increased from
5.3 per cent to nearly 6 per cent of the total, a record Ecu916m. Mr Broder
said the EIB would continue to co-finance projects outside the EC with the
World Bank and the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in
eastern Europe.
The EIB, which maintains a top AAA credit rating, is the world's largest
borrower and lender in Ecu. Borrowing in the European currency unit
accounted for 18 per cent of the total in 1991. Mr Broder said the approach
of monetary union and a single European currency would alter the context of
the EIB's activities fundamentally, making borrowing and lending even
easier.
The Luxembourg-based bank's priorities in 1991 were the development of
deprived regions of the EC, which benefited from Ecu8.5bn of loans - against
Ecu7.4bn in 1990 - and the setting up of an efficient European transport and
telecommunications network, for which Ecu3.8bn (Ecu3.1bn) was lent.
But the bank also supported EC energy supplies and environmental
improvements and approved global loans worth Ecu2.4bn for nearly 10,000
small and medium-sized enterprises. A further Ecu1bn was lent to industrial
companies ranging from an Andalucian oil refinery to an Italian ice-cream
manufacturer.
Italy - historically the biggest beneficiary of EIB loans - won nearly 28
per cent of the EC loans granted, with Spain, the UK and France also the
three next largest borrowers. Germany's five new Lander alone received
Ecu521m of EIB investment support.

<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak, known worldwide for its consumer photographic products, is
attempting to boost its business in office imaging products and services.
As part of a worldwide restructuring, the multinational group's UK
subsidiary will announce today that its Copy Products and Business Imaging
Systems divisions are being merged to form a new division, Kodak Office
Imaging.
Kodak intends to exploit its expertise in handling images in the rapidly
expanding electronic business information technology sector.
Kodak Office Imaging will be responsible for providing a range of products
and services spanning all areas of business document imaging - scanning,
microfilming, digi-tising, manipulation, enhancement, retrieval,
transmit-ting, receiving, printing, publishing and photocopying.
Mr Mike Mansell, who heads the new division in the UK, said: 'Kodak is
determined to enhance its customers' business performance by offering
complete,tailored solutions across the whole spectrum of office imaging.'
Kodak recognises that its commercial business has been overshadowed by its
consumer photographic business, and its previous business structure  -
around an autonomous business units - failed to fully capitalise on
commercial customer relationships.
The company is also signalling that it expects to enter into more strategic
alliances and co-operative product developments where its can build upon its
imaging expertise.
Kodak employs 7,000 people in the UK and has total domestic sales of Pounds
400m (Dollars 7240m).

<TEXT>
LION NATHAN has sold half its liquor manufacturing and distribution
business, New Zealand Wines and Spirits, to International Distillers and
Vintners, owned by GandMet, and Hiram Walker, owned by Allied Llyons.
The two UK-based international liquor groups are paying a total NZDollars
61m (USDollars 33m) and each is acquiring a 25 per cent shareholding.
NZ Wines and Spirits was the family company of Lion Nathan's managing
director and big shareholder, Mr Douglas Myers, and there was surprise in
New Zealand yesterday that he should sell.
However, Mr Myers said the money raised would be used to repay debt.
NZ Wines and Spirits would continue to be managed by Lion Nathan, and the
deal would ensure that existing brand distribution agreements would
continue, and allow access to new brands.
He added that the move was a logical step in a trend for brand owning
companies to fully or partly own regional distributors.
Mr Malcolm Don, Lion Nathan's corporate treasurer, said the money raised by
the sale would be treated as an extraordinary gain for the year to August
31. NZ Wines and Spirits was estimated to be making profits of NZDollars 20m
a year before interest payments and tax.
The new joint venture arrangement is conditional on certain approvals being
obtained, but Mr Don said no difficulties were expected.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: USX-US Steel Group expects
improvement
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Charles Corry, chairman of USX, expects the company's USX-US Steel Group
to have a better year in 1992 than in 1991, Reuter reports.
Company officials said they thought the business had a good chance to return
to profitability in the event of even a modest US economic upturn.
'I don't think this year in steel is going to be as bad as 1991,' Mr Corry
said.
For the full year, US Steel Group, the nation's largest steelmaker, reported
a net loss of Dollars 507m, or Dollars 10 a share, on sales of Dollars
4.9bn.
Mr Corry said he was reluctant to forecast when the US economy might turn
up.
But he added that USX does expect the second half of 1992 to be better than
the first half. He also said that US Steel had in recent weeks seen a slight
upturn in its orders for steel.
Despite the 1991 loss, Mr Corry said US Steel had no plans to close any of
its facilities or to set any major lay-offs.
Earlier this week, Bethlehem Steel, the second largest US steelmaker, said
it was exiting some of its businesses in a restructuring that would result
in the elimination of 6,500 jobs. It also eliminated its 10 cents-a-share
quarterly dividend.
Mr Corry noted that USX's board declared the steel group's 25 cents-a-share
quarterly dividend on Tuesday, unchanged from the previous quarter. He said
any further decision on the dividend would be made on a quarterly basis.
Early in 1991, US Steel had said it would shut down part of its Fairless
Works in eastern Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, the company said it was
closing its South Works in Chicago.
'We have nothing further in mind at this time,' said Mr Corry. 'We have
honed our operations pretty well.'

LION NATHAN, New Zealand's biggest brewer, is to buy the 50 per cent it does
not own in National Brewing Holdings, Australia's second biggest brewer and
formerly Bond Brewing, from Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL) for
ADollars 425m.( USDollars 319.5m)
The purchase was announced jointly in Sydney yesterday by Lion and ACIL,
formerly Bell Resources. They said the deal was part of a 'fall-back'
arrangement following the scrapping of an earlier deal to merge Lion and
ACIL.
This planned merger, announced in October last year, was a complex
arrangement conditional on agreement from Swiss bondholders in ACIL to swap
their scrip for new bonds issued by Lion. But ACIL said yesterday it had
been informed by Swiss Bank Corporation - as paying agent for the Swiss
franc bonds - that the proposed bond exchange was against Swiss law.
'In addition, Schroders Australia Ltd was retained by ACIL to provide an
independent assessment of the terms and conditions of the bond exchange,'
ACIL said.
'Notwithstanding that Lion Nathan was willing to increase the face value of
the capital notes from ADollars 356m to Dollars 424m, Schroders has advised
that on the basis of existing conditions it would be unable to give an
opinion that the bond exchange would be fair and reasonable to ACIL
bondholders.'
ACIL reiterated that its shareholders had agreed to a put and call
arrangement which approved the sale of the remaining half of the company's
brewery business to Lion Nathan, should the larger merger proposal not
proceed.
'Lion Nathan has advised ACIL that it will exercise the call option,' ACIL
said.
'Lion Nathan will acquire the interest from ACIL for ADollars 425m plus 50
per cent of National Brewing Holdings' 12-month earnings to June 30 1992.
The consideration will consist of ADollars 300m of Lion Nathan junior
capital stock with the balance consisting of cash and Lion Nathan ordinary
shares.'
The deal means that Lion, which bought half of National Brewing Holdings
from ACIL for ADollars 350m last year, will emerge with control of about 40
per cent of the Australian beer market.
National controls brands including XXXX, Tooheys and Swan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of East Asia, Hong Kong's largest local family-controlled bank,
yesterday exceeded market expectations when it reported a 30 per cent growth
in profits to HKDollars 504 (USDollars 65m) in 1991 compared with HKDollars
387.7m a year earlier.
The bank usually starts Hong Kong's corporate reporting season and, with
profit growth nearly twice that reported a year ago, its results were seen
as auspicious for the colony's corporate sector generally.
As is customary with the colony's banks, Bank of East Asia provided little
detail of how its profit was arrived at, although it was struck after an
unspecified transfer to inner reserves.
Analysts said they thought the declared growth in profits reflected actual
profit growth last year. They doubted, however, if the bank would be able to
maintain such a high profits growth this year.
Miss Maisie Cheung, an analyst at Baring Securities, said the Bank of East
Asia had a large slice of its business in the Hong Kong housing market. The
government, which is concerned about spiralling property prices, has
encouraged banks to rein in the lending and the longer this restraint
continues profits might be less than otherwise, she said.
The bank has been steadily expanding its operations in Hong Kong, China and
abroad. Mr David KP Li, the bank's chief executive, said the bank planned to
open two more branches in the colony this year - bringing the total to 62 -
as well a banking subsidiary in Toronto and a new office in the heart of New
York's Chinatown.
Directors recommended a dividend of 50 cents a share which, with the interim
of 25 cents, makes a total payout of 75 cents - up 20 per cent on last
year's dividend. They are also recommending to shareholders a one-for-five
bonus issue to be met by capitalising HKDollars 172.1m from the bank's share
premium account.

<TEXT>
BOEING, the US aerospace group, reported a 27 per cent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings but said it expected 1992 revenues to grow only
slightly, to around Dollars 29.5bn from Dollars 29.3bn in 1991.
The world's largest civilian aircraft manufacturer said it expected
increased sales in 1992 of its 737 and 757 commercial jets to offset a
nominal decline in sales of defence and space equipment.
The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 403m, or Dollars
1.17 a share, compared with Dollars 318m, or 92 cents, in the same period of
last year. Revenues were Dollars 7.75bn, up from Dollars 7.01bn. For the
full year, Boeing made Dollars 1.57bn, or Dollars 4.56 a share, compared
with Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 4.01, on sales of Dollars 27.59bn in 1990.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said the increase in 1991 earnings was due
mainly to better commercial aircraft sales, a lower operating loss at the
defence and space business, and a lower tax rate. This was partially offset
by higher research and development expenses, principally for its new
two-engined, wide-bodied aircraft, the 777, and lower other income.
The defence and space business, which was profitable in the fourth quarter,
had an annual operating loss of Dollars 102m, down from Dollars 418m in
1990. He expected this sector to be profitable in 1992.
Mr Shrontz said the outlook for commercial airlines in 1992 remained
uncertain, although traffic and yields appeared to be improving at the
year-end.
The economic slowdown had particularly affected demand among all
manufacturers for aircraft with fewer than 150 seats, and production rates
for Boeing's 737 jet could be subject to further reduction. However, he
added that demand for wide-bodied aircraft remained strong.
Boeing's firm order book at the end of December was Dollars 97.9bn, compared
with Dollars 97.2bn at the end of 1990.

<TEXT>
INCO, the world's largest nickel producer, suffered a fourth-quarter loss
and an 81 per cent drop in earnings for 1991 as a whole.
The setback was due mainly to lower nickel and other metal prices, and to
higher production costs. But the company also spent USDollars 31m in
after-tax severance costs last year. Earnings for the year as a whole were
Dollars 82.6m, or 74 cents, down from Dollars 441.2m, or Dollars 4.18, in
1990. Revenues fell to Dollars 3.05bn from Dollars 3.34bn.
The fourth-quarter loss was Dollars 5.8m, compared with earnings of Dollars
72.6m a year earlier. Sales and other revenues dipped to Dollars 710.3m from
Dollars 870.3m. A tax benefit of Dollars 31m was recorded in the fourth
quarter from the transfer of a 30 per cent interest in its subsidiary in
Guatemala to the Guatemalan government.
The primary metals division suffered a Dollars 5m operating loss in the
fourth quarter, compared with income of Dollars 156m a year earlier. The
company ascribed the loss to lower nickel, copper and precious metal prices,
higher production costs, and the severance programme.
Inco's unit costs rose sharply last year to an average of Dollars 2.43 per
lb of nickel, from Dollars 2.15 per lb in 1990. Production costs for copper
climbed to Dollars 1.58 per lb from Dollars 1.36 per lb. The company is
understood to have budgeted for a much smaller increase in costs this year.
Fourth-quarter nickel deliveries was almost unchanged at 125m lb, but the
average realised price tumbled to Dollars 3.55 per lb from Dollars 4.31 per
lb.

REEBOK, the US sports shoe maker, posted record sales and earnings for its
fourth quarter and the whole of 1991.
Net income for the fourth quarter was Dollars 49.7m, or 53 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 39.5m, or 34 cents, a year earlier. Sales increased 20
per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 586.6m.
For the year, Reebok had net profits of Dollars 234.7m, or Dollars 2.37, a
share, against Dollars 176.6m, or Dollars 1.54, in 1990. Sales rose 26.6 per
cent to Dollars 2.73bn.
Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said the company forecast
'plenty of opportunity for growth in this recessionary environment'.
He said the Reebok brand had gained market share in a relatively flat
market.
Mr Fireman added that the company had repaid Dollars 165m of the Dollars
215m it borrowed for a stock repurchase in 1991.

MARSH &amp; MCLENNAN, the world's biggest insurance broker, yesterday turned in
stagnant fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, writes Karen Zagor.
For the three months to December 31, the company had net income of Dollars
54.2m, compared with Dollars 54.5m a year earlier. However, fewer
outstanding shares helped earnings per share rise to 75 cents in the 1991
quarter from 74 cents the previous year.
The 1991 figures include extraordinary pre-tax gains of Dollars 10m.
Revenues were only slightly lower, at Dollars 665.9m against Dollars 668.5m
in the 1990 quarter.
For the whole of 1991, net earnings were Dollars 305.5m, or Dollars 4.18 a
share, on revenues of Dollars 2.78bn, compared with earnings of Dollars
304.1m, or Dollars 4.15, on revenues of Dollars 2.72bn.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bosch reports further decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT Bosch, the German motor components, telecommunications and
engineering group, yesterday reported a further decline in operating profit
and warned that moderate wage deals would be necessary for any improvement
in 1992.
Turnover rose 5.5 per cent last year to DM33.6bn (Dollars 21bn), with
domestic sales up 11.5 per cent to DM17.5bn, helped by the stimulation to
demand provided by unification. Foreign turnover was flat at DM16.1bn.
Bosch, owned by a foundation, gave no actual profit figures for last year.
In 1990, net profits fell by 11 per cent to DM560m.
As a big supplier to motor companies worldwide, Bosch could be a key target
 -as in the 1984 engineering strike - for selective union action aimed at
disrupting the sector. The engineering pay round has not begun, but a ballot
by the IG Metall union in the steel industry is expected to lead to a
strike.
Bosch's experience in the last strike was one reason for its decision to
locate more production abroad. Another was the high cost of German
production.
Bosch cut its world labour force by around 8,000 people (excluding the
impact of acquisitions) last year to try to improve profitability. Most cuts
were at German plants.
Bosch also announced plans to take control of two motor equipment companies
in Czechoslovakia.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: UAL posts largest quarterly loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, yesterday reported its largest
ever quarterly loss - Dollars 252.6m - and warned that it planned to cut its
capital spending by at least Dollars 2bn over the next three years because
of the sluggish economic outlook.
The capital spending cuts represent around 13 per cent of the Dollars 15.8bn
the airline has budgeted for in the period 1992-1995, but it declined to
specify just where the axe would fall.
Other US airlines have also been trimming their capital expenditure plans
for the next few years, but so far this has not impinged seriously on the
order books of Boeing or McDonnell Douglas, the two large American civilian
aircraft manufacturers.
UAL, which had repeatedly warned Wall Street about poor fourth-quarter
figures, took Dollars 130m of special pre-tax charges in the period. Some
Dollars 64m was to cover what it called 'retroactive pay and benefits
related to the settlement of labour contracts'.
The rest covered expenses for the settlement of certain disputes, the
write-down of parts due to the removal of DC-8s from its fleet, and
increased accruals for employee benefits and purchased services. A
spokeswoman would not elaborate.
The fourth-quarter losses, which the special charges augmented by Dollars
85m, worked through at Dollars 10.69 a share. That compared with a loss of
Dollars 123.5m, or Dollars 5.66 a share, in the same period of last year.
The company's previous record quarterly loss, Dollars 157m, occurred in the
first quarter of last year, when air traffic was badly hit by the Gulf war.
In 1991 as a whole, the company lost Dollars 331.9m, or Dollars 14.31 a
share, compared with net earnings of Dollars 94.5m, or Dollars 4.33 a share,
in 1990. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, said the losses were an 'exceedingly
unsatisfactory end to a very dismal year'.
Pan Am, the US airline which ceased operations in early December, announced
yesterday that it was suing Delta Air Lines for damages of at least Dollars
2.5bn.
It alleged that Delta's breach of a funding agreement between the two had
forced it to stop flying. A similar suit was filed last month by Pan Am's
unsecured creditors.

FINLAND is to have a new savings bank from September this year with assets
totalling FM100bn (Dollars 23bn), it was announced yesterday.
To be called Suomen Saastopankki SSP, it will bring together 41 of the
present Finnish regional savings banks in the country which between them
account for 80 per cent of the assets in Finland's savings bank system.
The new bank will have the largest number of deposits of any bank in the
country and it will become the fourth largest commercial bank in Finland
when it starts operations.
The chief executive officer is to be Mr Paavo Prepula, the present head of
the savings bank in the regional city of Tampere.

40% profits fall

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Solvay, Belgium's largest chemicals group, fell 4 per cent
yesterday after the company announced a 40 per cent drop in group profits
for 1991, excluding extraordinary items.
Capital expenditure, research and development spending and general overheads
will either be cut or frozen in an attempt to offset recessionary pressures,
but Solvay warned that 1992 was unlikely to be a better year for the
company.
Solvay - one of the world's top 20 chemicals groups and headed by Baron
Daniel Janssen - will publish formal annual figures in April, but
yesterday's statement indicated they would show full-year net profits of
just under BFr13bn (Dollars 398m), including some BFr2bn of extraordinary
gains, against BFr15.9bn in 1990.
Stripping out all extraordinary items, Solvay's profits apparently dropped
from BFr17.8bn to less than BFr11bn in 1991 - only just over half the
equivalent profits figure for 1989.
The group's dividend - which was increased for 1990 despite a fall in
earnings - will not be announced until April, but a spokesman pointed out
that Solvay had repeatedly said it would not cut its payout. 'I'm sure that
statement is valid today, but there is still one quarter to run between now
and when the decision has to be taken,' he added.
The group heralded a fall in 1991 profits last September, but the Belgian
market was still disappointed by the news and the shares lost BFr500 to
close at BFr12,100 yesterday. Brussels brokers were pessimistic about the
immediate future.
Solvay was hit by a fierce downturn in its plastics activities during the
second half of last year. Sales slumped following increased competition from
east European imports of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and the division barely
broke even.
The group's core alkalis sector had also suffered 'significantly lower'
profits.
Overall sales volume slipped by 3 per cent, but Solvay said consolidated
turnover was 'close to' the 1990 figure of BFr255bn.
Cash-flow was down by 3 per cent, or 16 per cent before extraordinary gains.

FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Paribas pushed into the red by
Maxwell provisions
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of the Maxwell empire contributed to FFr2.8bn (Dollars 510m) of
extraordinary provisions made last year by Paribas, the French investment
banking group, and to its slide into an estimated net loss of FFr200m for
1991 from net profits of FFr2.5bn in 1990.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday announced it was putting
Paribas' loans and long-term debt under surveillance for a possible rating
reduction. Moody's will pay particular attention to the possible
deterioration in the quality of the banking group's assets.
Paribas, like several other prominent Parisian banks including Credit
Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), made a number of loans to the
Maxwell companies through its Paribas Suisse subsidiary. It has fully
covered its exposure to Maxwell interests with an extraordinary provision of
FFr800m.
Credit Lyonnais and BNP, both state-owned banks, have far higher exposure to
the Maxwell debacle than Paribas. Paris banking analysts estimate that the
overall level of Maxwell loans owed to the French banking industry is around
FFr15bn.
The announcement of Paribas' provisions came as no surprise to the French
stock market given that Mr Andre Levy Lang, president, had warned that his
group would be making provisions on a number of large corporate loans.
Paribas later issued a statement saying it would also be making provisions
for its Maxwell loans.
Despite the high level of loan loss provisions and the competitive state of
the international banking industry, Paribas managed to increase its
operating income to FFr3bn from FFr1.6bn including minority interests in
1991, and to FFr1.7bn from FFr400m excluding minorities.
However, the group experienced a fall in income from capital transactions to
FFr800m from FFr2.5bn including minorities, and to FFr700m from FFr2.1bn
excluding minorities. Paribas said this reflected the state of the market.
The level of ordinary banking provisions rose to FFr6.6bn from FFr5.5bn in
1991. Net profits including minority interests fell to FFr1bn from FFr4.1bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ICI, the UK-based chemicals multinational, is facing possible legal action
in Spain following charges of restrictive practices made by the local
partner in its biggest Spanish joint venture, ICI-Zeltia, a producer of
agrochemicals.
Zeltia formally complained to the Spanish Ministry of Industry in
mid-December about a 'unilateral' ICI decision in 1989 to raise the prices
of the joint venture's products by up to 30 per cent 'without the slightest
justification'.
The issue could go to Spain's competition tribunal if it is not settled
amicably.
In a statement, Zeltia said the decision to raise prices had 'provoked a
drastic reduction in ICI-Zeltia's profits and reduced its competitive-ness'.
Between 1989 and 1990, the joint venture's profits slipped from Pta344m to
Pta136m (Dollars 1.35m). The company dropped from being the second largest
Spanish company in the agrochemicals sector to fourth place, it complained.
The price rises, Zeltia said, had 'also made it impossible to export'.
ICI is understood to have offered to make a one off payment to compensate
its Spanish partners but this has, so far, been rejected.
The company's products are designed to control pests, weeds and diseases.
Under the 50-50 joint venture, ICI has exclusive distribution rights inside
and outside Spain.
ICI said it was aware of Spanish press reports of possible legal action, but
did not know if a complaint had been formally made. It said it viewed the
threats of action as 'sabre-rattling' and expected the dispute to be settled
normally within the joint venture.
The group said its commitment to ICI-Zeltia, was demonstrated last year when
it agreed to use the company to distribute the products of Stauffer, the US
group it acquired in 1987.

STENA LINE, the Swedish shipping group which acquired Sealink, the UK ferry

able to buy shares in the company after next Thursday when trading in its
restricted B shares on the Stockholm bourse will come to an end.
The formal decision to seek government permission to revoke an alien
ownership prohibition clause from Stena's articles of association was taken
at last May's shareholders' meeting. In future, all Stena's restricted
shares will become unrestricted.
The company said it had decided to change its share structure because of
'the increased level of foreign inquiries' it had received, 'not least from
interested parties in the UK'.

<TEXT>
BMW, the German maker of luxury cars, expects to produce and sell even more
cars in 1992 after a year in which turnover rose by 10 per cent to DM29.8bn
(Dollars 18.6bn) and profits showed a further increase.
Despite his optimism about this year's performance, however, Mr Eberhard von
Kuenheim, the chief executive, expressed some misgivings about world
economic trends. He also called for more moderate wage and fiscal trends in
Germany as the post-unity boom slowed down.
BMW, which has benefited from high demand for the latest generation of its
compact 3-series model, lifted car output put by 6.5 per cent to 553,000
units; this was despite some disruption during the changeover to the new
model. Motor-cycle production, accounting for only a small proportion of its
total business, was 8 per cent higher at 32,000 units.
Like other domestic and foreign producers, BMW experienced a big jump in its
home market sales which increased by 21 per cent to 233,000 cars. German
demand has been stimulated by unification as east Germans have bought
western cars for the first time and many west Germans have sold their cars
into a buoyant second-hand market.
The company gave no profit figures, but said its results had improved again
last year. In 1990, pre-tax profits were 6.5 per cent higher at DM1.7bn and
net profits up by 25 per cent to DM696m, helped by a lower tax bill.

Sale Tilney has disposed of certain businesses and assets of Sale Tilney
Foods, which comprise Peabody Foods, its UK food division, to Stevens &amp;
Brotherton.
STF's dried pasta distribution business is excluded from the deal and the
board will shortly determine the future of this profitable business  - in
the 12 months to November 29 there was an operating profit of Pounds 200,000
on turnover of Pounds 1.4m.
The aggregate net proceeds of the Peabody disposal and the collection of
trade debts - after taking account of payment of trade creditors, all
associated closure and transaction costs and the sale of residual assets -
are estimated to be Pounds 6.8m. Proceeds will be applied against the
borrowings of STF.
The balance of STF's borrowings, amounting to some Pounds 15m, will be
serviced by the remainder of the Sale Tilney group.

<TEXT>
EMAP, the publishing and exhibitions group, is planning to launch its first
wholly owned magazine in the French market in March.
Responses Photo, a monthly photographic magazine with a planned print run of
150,000, will be the French equivalent of Photo Answers, Emap's successful
UK magazine.
The launch could be the first of several in France aimed at the specialist,
youth and music sectors of the market.
Mr Robin Miller, Emap chief executive, believes there is considerable
potential for specialist magazines in France.
Emap has expanded on the back of a range of specialist magazines
encompassing fishing to motor cycle enthusiasts.
Until now Emap's moves into France have been through joint ventures with
French publishers. In 1990 the company took over Le Chasseur Francais, the
French countryside and hunting magazine, in a joint venture with Bayard
Press.
The British company also publishes Consule Plus, a French computer games
magazine with Les Editions Mondiale.
Meanwhile, Emap is one of the publishers bidding for the business magazine
and exhibitions divisions of the collapsed Maxwell empire.
In the six months to September, Emap's pre-tax profits fell 28 per cent to
Pounds 9.86m.
However, operating profits of its consumer magazines increased.

<TEXT>
Interim pre-tax profits tumbled 78 per cent to Pounds 368,000 at
International Resort Holdings as the golf course and leisure group again
passed its interim dividend.
Profits would have been even lower but for a Pounds 161,000 (Pounds 214,000)
exceptional gain on the sale of the nursing home division. Earnings per
share tumbled by 3.5p to 1.5p.
Mr Stephen Alexander, chairman, said the board intended to maintain the
final dividend, as current trading levels were satisfactory.
Turnover in the period to September 30 fell from Pounds 8.08m to Pounds 3m,
partly because of the sale. However, the greatest decline came in the
development division, which builds golf courses.
Mr Alexander said development had been reined in to avoid an increase in
debt, which was Pounds 12m (Pounds 24m) at the half-year. He also warned
that the profit outlook for this division was uncertain, as necessary
development contracts had not yet been signed. Development sales fell by
Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 1.38m.
The operations division, which encompasses golf course and hotel management,
increased sales by 66 per cent to Pounds 771,000.
Mr Alexander also announced the intention to take over EGP Sports, which
would form the basis of the new merchandising and events division.
Total cost of the purchase would not exceed Pounds 1m. EGP holds a 50 per
cent stake in PGA Merchandising, a joint venture with the Professional
Golfers' Association, and 50 per cent of the English Open Golf Championship.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Increased European sales help Menvier-Swain
edge ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the continuing recession, Menvier-Swain, the emergency lighting
and fire alarms group, managed a marginal profits increase in the half year
to end-October.
Although sales fell by 18 per cent from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 19.7m -
reflecting the loss of turnover from discontinued businesses - profits at
the pre-tax level increased from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 2.77m. All the
loss-making businesses have now been sold.
Profits were helped by a reduced interest charge of Pounds 363,000 (Pounds
429,000) on borrowings down from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 4.7m. Gearing was cut
from 74 per cent to 43 per cent.
The interim dividend goes up from 2.2p to 2.7p, payable from earnings per
share of 13.3p (12.7p). Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said the
dividend had been increased to adjust the proportion of the total paid out
at the interim stage.
Mr Fletcher said the UK market remained difficult with sales of emergency
lighting and fire alarms down 19 per cent to Pounds 9.9m. However, market
share and margins had been maintained.
The fall in UK business had been offset by increasing sales of emergency
lighting in continental Europe, which now accounts for some 41 per cent of
group turnover. Sales from the Continent grew by 29 per cent to Pounds 8m
(Pounds 6.2m) and profits advanced to Pounds 1.3m.
Mr Fletcher said the French offshoot was having a particularly successful
year, with a significant contract for the Channel tunnel project, while the
group's newest acquisition, Univel, in Greece, was now contributing to
profits.
New EC safety directives covering essential safety requirements in new
buildings came into force on January 1 in the UK, and the group was well
placed to pick up any ensuing extra businesses, Mr Fletcher said.
Mr Charles Swain has retired as executive chairman. He has been appointed
Life President and will remain as a non-executive director. Mr Roy McDowell,
a non-executive director of the company since flotation in 1986, is to
become chairman.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Aviation side underpins Aim's 69% recovery
</HEADLINE>

   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIM GROUP, the South-ampton-based manufacturer of aircraft interiors,
mounted a 69 per cent recovery in pre-tax profits in the six months to
October 31.
The improvement, from Pounds 620,000 to Pounds 1.05m, followed a 26 per cent
increase in turnover to Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 20m).
The mainstay of the outcome was the aviation division, which increased
operating profit to Pounds 1.71m (Pounds 1.03m) on sales of Pounds 19m
(Pounds 14.7m).
Mr Jeff Smith, chairman and chief executive, said this reflected progress on
such projects as the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and the Saab 2000. He repeated
the statement in the annual report that the division's turnover should
double by 1994-95.
The contracting side, which installs air conditioning mainly in commercial
buildings, saw operating profit slump to Pounds 22,000 (Pounds 319,000) on
turnover of Pounds 6.18m (Pounds 5.32m). Mr Smith said the second half would
be better because more contracts were scheduled for completion.
Interest costs declined to Pounds 682,000 (Pounds 716,000). Net debt was
expected to be slightly down by the year-end to Pounds 12.5m, giving gearing
of 68 per cent (75 per cent).
Aim, which is some 53 per cent-owned by Mr Smith and fellow director Mr
Caspar MacDonald-Hall, also owes an additional Pounds 6m to its bankers
related to its property portfolio.
The group's fortunes have revived since last summer when the banks forgave
Pounds 2m of the original Pounds 8m property loan and stopped charging
interest on the remainder.
Mr Smith said Pounds 1m of property had been sold this year and the money
had been put into a realisation account ready for repayment of the Pounds 6m
in May 1994.
Earnings per share rose to 4.8p (2.8p), while the interim dividend is held
at 1.5p after a cut last year. Mr Smith said the dividend had not been
raised because of the working capital required to finance the expansion of
the aviation division.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Domino shares rise 22p as profit target
reached
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DOMINO PRINTING Sciences, the Cambridge-based manufacturer and distributor
of industrial ink-jet printers, has slightly exceeded the profits forecast
made in September with the Pounds 15.5m rights issue.
It increased pre-tax profits by 48 per cent to Pounds 9m (Pounds 6.09m) in
the year to October 31 on turnover up 31 per cent to Pounds 60.4m. The
shares closed 22p higher at 423p.
Domino benefited from changes in EC directives for food retailing, which led
to increased demand for products. There was a full contribution from
subsidiary operations in France and Spain.
Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said: 'We are especially pleased with our
performance in France, where our subsidiary increased sales of machines by
90 per cent.'
Sales of new machines were particularly encouraging, with 40 per cent more
installations than the previous year. Average selling prices reduced
slightly, reflecting increased distributor business and discounts for larger
orders. This expansion in machines installed would be reflected in higher
ink sales.
The group had net cash of Pounds 1.8m which, when coupled with proceeds from
the 98 per cent subscribed cash call, enabled it to start the year with cash
balances of more than Pounds 17m. Domino planned to use the cash for further
expansion in its core ink-jet operations and related areas.
During the year sales had grown by 19 per cent in Europe (excluding France
and Spain); by 21 per cent in the Americas; and by 35 per cent in the rest
of the world. Mr Dennis said results for the first three months of the new
financial year showed that growth was continuing, but at a lower level in
Europe, as indicated in the rights issue document.
Earnings per share rose by 40 per cent to 28.83p (20.54p). A final dividend
of 4.15p gives a total for the year of 6.25p (5.2p).

<TEXT>
SHARES OF Allied Partnership Group, the environmental contractor and
forklift truck distributor, were suspended at 9 3/4 p yesterday pending
clarification of its financial state.
The suspension comes less than four months after Mr Martyn Rose, chairman
and chief executive, said in releasing details of interim losses, that the
balance sheet had been strengthened by the Pounds 7.44m raised in a share
placing and offer.
The 3-for-5 offer, announced last June, was priced at 17p. It raised net
assets to over Pounds 30m and cut debt to about Pounds 22m.
In December 1990, gearing had reached 125 per cent and a banking agreement
had been breached. The placing document said the breaches had been waived
and the facility reconfirmed until December this year.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOODHEAD GROUP, the printing, publishing and paper company, suspended its
interim dividend yesterday as pre-tax profits tumbled 39 per cent to Pounds
429,000 for the six months to November 30, writes Peggy Hollinger.
Mr John Madejski, chairman, sought to reassure investors, saying the board
had 'every intention of declaring a final dividend'. Fully-diluted earnings
per share fell from 2.3p to 1.2p.
Mr Colin Rosser, chief executive, said each of the group's divisions was
trading profitably. This had not been the case in the second half of last
year, when the group returned a profit of Pounds 62,000 purely due to an
exceptional Pounds 782,000 gain.
Similarly, first-half profits this year were entirely due to halved interest
charges of Pounds 706,000 following the Pounds 4.5m sale of the Wiltshire
printing business in April. Debt at the half-year was Pounds 10m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 37.9m to Pounds 22.2m. Just under half of the
decline in sales was due to the Wiltshire sale, with Pounds 5.8m of the drop
coming in the paper division. The paper market remained very soft, although
profits had been helped by more spot deals, where margins are higher.
Mr Rosser said the publishing business - mainly free newspapers - had been
the hardest hit, with advertising revenues down by 30 per cent on the
previous year.
The contract printing operation, which traditionally provides the bulk of
profits, increased its contribution by 5 per cent to Pounds 700,000.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BT slips 4% to Pounds 759m in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications pleaded for fairness and flexibility in its
pricing structure being reviewed by the industry regulator, as it unveiled a
4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 787m to Pounds 759m in the
third quarter to December 31 1991.
The group brought forward the announcement of its results by two weeks to
coincide with the publication yesterday by Oftel of a consultative document
which began the review of BT's prices by the industry regulator.
This was the second successive quarter in which BT saw a profits decline
despite continuing efforts to raise productivity, said Mr Iain Vallance,
chairman.
The performance reflected, above all, the first full quarter impact of a
price cap at RPI minus 6.25 percentage points, followed by recession and
increased competition.
'As you can see the current price cap is pretty tough,' Mr Vallance said.
By bringing forward its third quarter results, BT had hoped to counter
criticism that its high prices have led to excessive profitability.
Turnover in the third quarter was 'almost flat' at Pounds 3.29bn (Pounds
3.28bn) as growth was insufficient to counter the effects of regulatory and
competitive pressures, the group said.
Earnings per share declined 5 per cent to 8.2p (8.6p).
'Near term prospects remain depressed,' BT said.
The group had indicated that staff levels would be reduced by about 10,000
but yesterday it confirmed that the cuts would be substantially more than
that at between 10,000 and 15,000.
Revenue from inland telephone calls declined slightly to Pounds 1.27bn
(Pounds 1.29bn) due to overall price reductions which were only partly
offset by the new directory enquiry charges introduced in April, it said.
International telephone call revenue fell to Pounds 442m (Pounds 447m) while
international call volume increased by 3 per cent over the 12 months to
December. However, this volume increase was more than offset by the effects
of the 9.6 per cent price reduction on international calls from the UK which
were introduced in September, BT said.
The two areas which saw revenue growth were telephone exchange line rentals
and other sales and services, a division which was boosted by the increase
in interconnect receipts from other UK telecommunication operators and a
better performance at Cellnet, the mobile communications network operator.
For the nine month period to December 31 turnover rose by just under 2 per
cent to Pounds 9.92bn (Pounds 9.75bn), pre-tax profits increased by 2 per
cent to Pounds 2.37bn (Pounds 2.32bn) and earnings per share rose by 1 per
cent to 25.6p (25.4p).
Responding to charges that BT's local call rates were the most expensive in
the world and that it was more expensive to make an international call from
the UK than to the UK, Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, said that
those were 'myths.'
Mr Hepher pointed out that the UK had a larger area covered by local call
charges than the US, Germany and France and that for a three minute call
made during business hours it was more expensive to call the UK from the US,
France, Germany and Spain than the other way round.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bass agrees real ale marketing deals with
Young's and Fuller's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the UK's biggest brewer, has agreed reciprocal marketing deals with
Young's and Fuller's, two of London's leading real ale brewers.
Young's bitter will be sold in more than 100 of Bass' managed pubs in
London, while the Wandsworth brewery's 180 pubs will stock Tennent's Extra,
Bass' premium draught lager.
Fuller's London Pride will also be offered in Bass pubs and about 150 of
Fuller's 200 pubs in the south-east will sell Carling Black Label, the Bass
brand which is the UK's best-selling lager.
Bass said the real ales could eventually be offered to all its 500 pubs in
the south-east. Most of those selected would carry both Young's bitter and
London Pride, a stronger beer, but this would be decided on a pub-by-pub
basis.
The deal marks another stage in the resurgence of real, or cask-conditioned,
ales which have been regaining popularity after years of yielding ground,
first to keg bitter and more recently to nationally-promoted lager brands,
such as Carling. Although the recession has cut overall demand for beer, UK
markets for premium lager and real ale are both growing.
Grolsch, the Dutch brewer, is currently in talks to buy Ruddles, the
Leicestershire-based brewer founded in 1858, in a deal which could be worth
Pounds 40m, according to industry estimates.
Bass said that Carling was continuing to gain market share and currently
claims about 20 per cent of the market for non-premium lager.
Bass already brews its own real ales, but said: 'These quite different beers
will extend the choice to the customer. They have such a strong consumer
franchise in the south-east that what we offer will not suffer.'
There are, however, continuing pressures towards consolidation in the
brewing industry. Fuller's said that growing demand for London Pride had
obliged it to increase capacity at its Chiswick brewery, and it had
accordingly decided to end production of K2, its own lager brand.
'K2 was a good brand, but we never set out to be a national brand. We could
never offer the discounts of the big operators,' Fuller's said.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Standard Life holds endowment bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD LIFE, the UK's largest mutual life insurance company, has
maintained bonuses on its endowment policies.
But it also sent a strong signal that bonuses could be reduced next year, by
lowering the 'interim' bonus rates which would be payable to people claiming
from the policies over the next year.
The move means that pay-outs on 25-year policies, which are widely used to
repay mortgages, are virtually static, increasing by about one third of 1
per cent from last year's figure.
This should be enough to assure that Standard Life will retain its position
as the industry's top investment performer over 25 years, and therefore the
prospect that independent intermediaries will continue to favour the sale of
Standard Life policies.
However, the office made substantial cuts in pay-outs on 10-year policies,
which were down by 8 per cent following a pronounced industry trend.
The bonus rate on Standard's new 'unitised with profits' policies was cut
from 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent.
The move is also a significant development in a broadening debate among
actuaries about how the weak returns of the last two years, and projected
lower yields over the next decade, should best be reflected in pay-outs.
Mr Scott Bell, managing director of Standard Life, said: 'Sterling's entry
into the Exchange Rate Mechanism should lead to lower inflation and lower
interest rates in coming years. As a consequence, during the 1990s, we can
expect lower nominal investment returns than those achieved in the '80s.'
He said that this was the reason for reducing interim bonuses.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Unitech declines 11% to Pounds 7.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITECH, the international electronics group, yesterday halved its dividend
to 2.1p as it announced an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
8.8m to Pounds 7.8m in the half year to end-November.
The group blamed the decline on the harsh trading conditions experienced in
all its markets.
Sales increased from Pounds 126.1m to Pounds 130.8m.
After tax of Pounds 3.59m (Pounds 3.68m) and minorities of Pounds 1.49m
(Pounds 1.32m) earnings per share came out at 4p (5.6p).
The group said slowdowns in the previously strong Japanese and German
markets adversely affected profits, while market conditions showed no
improvement in North America, the UK or France.
Minority interests reflected the reduction of the group's holding in
Nemic-Lambda KK, its Japanese power supply subsidiary, following last year's
flotation. Unitech's holding was reduced from 64 per cent to 50.6 per cent.
Exchange rate movements, particularly the strengthening of the Yen,
benefited profit by Pounds 500,000.
During the past three years Unitech has earned an increasing part of its
profits outside the UK. If this trend continues additional tax outlays could
be incurred due to unrecovered advance corporation tax.
Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said the cut in the dividend reflected the group's
difficulty in being a UK based group with an international business.
'We wanted to address the situation rather than just make artificial changes
by acquiring a UK company with good profits or rearranging our debt' he
said.

FT  31 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Tunnel builders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given that the Taylor Woodrow share price has halved in the past 12 months,
underperforming the sector by 30 per cent, yesterday's 7 per cent fall might
seem neither here nor there. Indeed, the setback is only the latest sign of
the company's fall from grace; but a wider issue for investors is the
message Taylor is conveying about the size of provisions UK and French
contractors may have to take on the Channel tunnel.
These are highly sensitive times for the 10 companies grouped together in
Transmanche Link (TML), which are not only involved in tense negotiations
about cost over-runs with Eurotunnel but are busy drawing up their 1991
accounts. Not surprisingly, therefore, this week's reliable rumours that
Taylor Woodrow is considering a Pounds 15m tunnel-related hit for 1991 plus
possibly the same again for the current year have been greeted with
ill-disguised anger and astonishment by other members of the consortium.
Judging the outcome of the Eurotunnel-TML talks, or the timing of their
conclusion, remains as hazardous as ever. But however unwelcome for those
with less robust balance sheets and uncertain dividends, the apparent gulf
between TML's claim and Eurotunnel's offer thus far suggests the Taylor
Woodrow figures are not extravagant. Or time could prove the contrary,
confirming the suspicion that Taylor is happy to throw as much bad news as
possible into 1991. The confusion will not only act as another brake on the
contracting shares. It may dampen the traditional New Year enthusiasm for
Eurotunnel.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK beer market's capacity for change is becoming slightly unnerving. The
deals announced yesterday between Bass and two local London brewers
illustrate the latest trend - the revival of real ale and the retreat of
lager. Bass is to sell old-style bitter from Young's and Fuller's in its
pubs while they sell Bass lager in exchange. From Bass's viewpoint, this may
be a pragmatic response to a shift in fashion. The wider question is how far
the economics of big brewing rely on lager holding its 50-plus per cent
share of the national market.
Given the distorting effects of recession, the underlying pattern is not yet
clear. But while premium lagers may not be losing ground, the big standard
lagers and keg bitters are. These are the brands which offer the national
brewer the biggest economies of scale and provide barriers to entry. Some
ground may therefore be lost to competition. The big brewers will still
control the channels of distribution; whether they can command the same
margins in a fragmented market is another matter.
It might be thought that the regional brewers would benefit accordingly. But
control of distribution is everything. In 1988, Marston's, another regional
brewer, did a pioneering bitter-for-lager deal with Whitbread. Within three
years, Marston's said, sales of its main brand should be up 50 per cent.
Three years on, its profits are lower than they were then. Sales through
Whitbread, it says, 'continue to be disappointing'. It seems the diversity
which is the consumer's gain is also the industry's loss.

FT  31 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors were deceived by Lonrho's example in marking Rank down so steeply
this week. There was no dividend cut after all; earnings are more than
enough to cover a maintained payment. There was no rights issue either;
gearing is high but there is no immediate pressure to reduce it. Yesterday's
8 per cent jump in the share price leaves it slightly higher than before the
scare. But there is still the question of whether the underperformance of
nearly 40 per cent since mid-1989 is now set to reverse.
Even without much help from the economy, Rank should manage a modest
increase in profit this year, while funding enough capital spending from
cash flow to maintain an edge over its competition. Disposals will reduce
gearing, though probably not to the long-term target range of 50 per cent.
That does not point to a higher dividend, but it should at least be
maintained. The yield is thus 6 1/2 per cent, a comfortable underpinning for
a recovery stock.
Any revival of consumer confidence should feed through quickly into margins.
In Rank's case the earnings benefit would be compounded by a reduction in
the tax rate, as a smaller proportion of group profits would flow from
highly-taxed Rank Xerox. The ACT problem which cost Pounds 7m should also
disappear. A prospective multiple of 13 thus looks undemanding, especially
since fears of a Mecca black hole are dying down.

FT  31 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Sir Bryan's soft farewell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,550.8 (+4.3)
It is tempting to wonder how Sir James McKinnon would have approached
yesterday's consultative paper from Oftel on BT's prices. Instead of the
thorough but uncontroversial document produced by the retiring Sir Bryan
Carsberg, the gas regulator might have thrown a brickbat or two on behalf of
consumers. As the market was quick to realise, the absence in Oftel's paper
of any severe response to BT's continued market dominance augurs well for
shareholders, less so for customers. It looks as if Sir Bryan intends to go
quietly.
Indeed, the striking thing about BT's sluggish third quarter results was the
neatness of their fit with Oftel's views on BT's proper rate of return.
Recession and the tighter price cap introduced by last year's duopoly review
have temporarily reduced BT's return on capital to just below 20 per cent.
But that is still near the upper end of the range regarded as acceptable by
the regulator. If BT can do this well in a recession, it can presumably earn
excessive returns later on. Whether it does so will be the measure of
Oftel's success in this pricing review.
It has emerged that while BT makes losses on line rentals and profits from
UK long distance calls, they are respectively much smaller and larger than
was generally suspected. As Oftel says, BT's case for a swift rebalancing of
prices to remove this cross-subsidy looks correspondingly weaker. Doubtless,
Mercury will be pleased; competing with BT's call charges is clearly not as
difficult as it should be. It should also please domestic customers, who
would bear the brunt of higher rentals.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: SIB argues that survey results not flawed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms COLETTE BOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Scurfield (Letters, January 29) casts doubt on the results of a
survey commissioned by the Securities and Investments Board into termination
rates for life assurance policies.
We commissioned the survey because of the absence of published information.
When we made the results available last December, we also published details
of the methodology used. That methodology involved calculation of
termination rates using information about premiums, rather than policy
numbers, supplied by life offices in their statutory returns to the
Department of Trade and Industry.
As the researchers made clear in their report, (and as SIB has in its
comments), there are some limitations in the figures, stemming, for example,
from the inclusion of temporary short-term assurances, the treatment of
paid-up pensions contracts and other factors. Moreover, the termination
rates quoted in the report are a 'snapshot' for 1990 which, because of the
recession, might be worse than for other years. It is also recognised that
the aggregate termination rates hide significant differences between
individual life offices.
But notwithstanding these limitations, the main message - that termination
rates are uncomfortably high - is clear. SIB therefore rejects Mr
Scurfield's assertion that the survey is 'flawed' and that no further
conclusions should be drawn from it.
If there is now to be a debate about how the industry might develop a common
methodology for the calculation of termination rates, SIB would very much
welcome this. We would also welcome greater willingness on the part of the
life offices to make publicly available information on the persistence of
life assurance policies.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: Real marginal costs of cars need taxing solution (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERALD INGRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins rightly highlighted the low marginal cost of using
cars. In the current political climate it would perhaps be more useful for
our leaders to indulge in serious discussions about ways of correcting the
imbalance.
We continually hear comments that no action is really possible until
road-pricing schemes are available, yet it seems that two specific actions
could be taken immediately to start the process.
abolish the road fund licence;
abolish special car tax.
In place of these, petrol taxes should be increased to recoup the lost tax
revenue. This would encourage people to use more fuel efficient cars and
reduce the fixed costs of motoring and it would of course reduce the
marginal cost gap between roads and railways to which Richard Tomkins
referred. Additionally it would ensure that overseas tourists/travellers who
use British roads contributed more towards the costs than they currently do.

Sir, Alex and Sue, in Richard Tomkins' article 'When fare is not fair'
(January 29), need lessons in economics. The true cost by road of their
230-mile round-trip to Birmingham from London is not Pounds 11, but Pounds
41, making rail travel at Pounds 46 almost economic,
They should consider the following: Pounds 11 for fuel, Pounds 5 for car
servicing (230 miles is 4 per cent of the 6,000 mile service interval which
will cost Pounds 120), Pounds 2 for road tax (2 per cent of 12,000 mile
annual mileage) and Pounds 23 depreciation. The depreciation charge assumes
car life of 80,000 miles while its value declines from Pounds 10,000 to
Pounds 2,000 - ie 230 miles is O28 per cent of the car's life.
On this basis, we need better education rather than further taxes on car
owners and society to make rail traffic a viable alternative on cost
grounds.

<TEXT>
Sir, Valerie Amos implies that part-time work is a second-rate option forced
upon women. Of course, some women who work part-time would prefer full-time
employment. However, survey evidence indicates that the enormous unmet
demand is for flexible part-time arrangements - and as a positive
preference, not second-best. The experience of Victoria Franklin (Letters,
January 23), offered full-time or nothing by her boss, is, distressingly,
not unusual.
Most revealing, however, is Ms Amos's disparaging comparison between
part-time 'work' and a proper full-time 'career'. The latter is an option
only for the affluent middle-class minority: yet it is their demands and
experiences that dominate the whole debate about child-care. Surely one
should expect a broader vision from the chief executive of a government
organisation funded to promote the interests of all women.

<TEXT>
Sir, Valerie Amos (Letters January 21) from the Equal Opportunities
Commission says that a 'significant proportion of part-time working women
would like to work full-time' but offers no evidence for her assertion.
The 1980 Women and Employment survey showed that more than four-fifths of
women with part-time jobs were happy with their working hours and pay. More
significant still, the 1986 Labour Force Survey shows 65 per cent of women
prefer part-time.
Moreover, these jobs which women choose to do should not be dismissed as a
second-class alternative to a 'long and successful career': the 1984 Women
and Employment survey showed levels of satisfaction with the type of work
and job security were actually higher among part-timers.
Valerie Amos should recognise that the traditional full-time employee job is
not the universal preference or aspiration of women.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: 'Spousal equivalents' benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEVEN SIEVERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Nikki Tait's account of 'spousal equivalents' being treated as spouses
in a few American employee benefit plans was interesting and informative
(Management, January 24). The reference, however, to '. . . a handful of
public sector employers, such as Manhattan's Montefiore Hospital' is thrice
wrong: it's the Montefiore Medical Center; it's in the Bronx, not in
Manhattan; and it's a private-sector (non-profit) institution, not in the
public sector.
Ms Tait also might have noted that the reason for the low take-up of the
Lotus scheme by its homosexual employees probably lies in the pattern for
health benefits generally. Partners most likely are also working, making
them eligible for their own employer-furnished benefits. Very commonly,
American workers are required to contribute to the cost of health insurance
for their spouses. If either a spouse or an equivalent is already covered
through his or her own employment, why pay for another coverage which is
secondary?

FT  31 JAN 92 / The only way to go is up: President George Bush is pinning
his re-election hopes on an upturn in the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Bush offered a timely reminder this week of the powers of an
incumbent president.
No matter that his State of the Union address to Congress promised more than
it delivered. By combining proposals for fresh reductions in long-range
nuclear missiles with a mild fiscal stimulus to the US economy, Mr Bush
showed how easily the White House can shape the debate before the
presidential election in November.
The initial judgment is that Mr Bush has read the public mood correctly. His
response to a recession which has endured longer than any downturn since the
1930s may be modest, but it suggests strongly that the president is gambling
on a recovery by early summer.
The risk is that Mr Bush waited too long, and produced too little. If so, he
may be destined to follow Herbert Hoover as the Republican president who sat
on his hands and lost his bid for re-election against Franklin Roosevelt in
1932, ushering 20 years of activist Democrat presidents.
In his fiscal 1993 budget submission to Congress, Mr Bush demonstrated
beyond doubt that he believes that government intervention at this stage in
the economic cycle would do more harm than good. This no doubt comforts Mr
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who warned Congress again
this week to avoid an election-year bidding war on tax cuts; but it also
underlines that the White House has stuck to its view that one ingredient
alone will haul the economy out of recession: confidence.
This view has remained unchanged, in spite of the clamour among conservative
Republicans, liberal Democrats and Democratic presidential candidates over
the past four months for dramatic action, such as an immediate,
across-the-board tax cut.
What was striking about Mr Bush's State of the Union address on Tuesday
night was the degree to which the president dwelt on the 'crisis of
confidence' theme. 'There is a mood among us. People are worried, there has
been talk of decline. Someone even said our workers were lazy and
uninspired,' said the president, in a sly reference to recent criticism
coming out of Japan.
In the next breath, Mr Bush invoked Neil Armstrong's moon landing, the
mid-west farmers whose granaries feed the world, and the men and women of
Desert Storm. He concluded, to thunderous applause: 'Moods come and go, but
greatness endures.'
Appeals to American identity are as old as the republic itself; but Mr
Bush's address suggests that the White House accepts the argument, prominent
among certain commentators - mainly of the conservative persuasion - that
Americans have temporarily suffered a collective loss of nerve following the
end of the Cold War.
The Democrat diagnosis is different. According to presidential candidates
such as Mr Jerry Brown of California and, to an extent, Senator Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska, Americans are disillusioned with their political institutions,
unsure about their job prospects, uncertain about the future.
Others such as Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner
when he is not seeking to escape old rumours of extramarital affairs, makes
an even more explicit pitch to middle-class Americans whose
living-standards, he says, have been squeezed during the Reagan and Bush
administrations.
In real terms, median family income has in fact remained stagnant since
1973. The difference today is that more Americans, particularly the 70 per
cent of the population who earn between Dollars 20,000 and Dollars 90,000 a
year, are worried about problems such as job security, foreign competition,
poor education and, above all, the future direction of the country.
Mr Bush addressed some of these fears in Tuesday's speech, focusing first on
triumphs past and present: the American victory in the Cold War and the Gulf
war. At times, he came within a whisker of jingoism - 'a world once divided
into two armed camps now recognises one pre-eminent power, the United States
of America' - but he ended with a clear message: 'Now we can stop making the
sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower.
Now we can look homeward even more, and move what needs to be set right.'
These words - faintly evocative of Mr George McGovern's 'Come Home America'
slogan in the 1972 presidential campaign during the Vietnam war - should not
be misread: Mr Bush is no born-again isolationist. But it does mean that he
is ready to accelerate reductions in defence spending which has seen
hundreds of billions of dollars devoured over the past 40 years in pursuit
of the arms race against the former Soviet Union.
This week, Mr Bush ordered Dollars 50bn in defence cuts, beyond those
already contemplated in the Pentagon's plan to reduce the US armed forces by
25 per cent over the next five years. Congress seems certain to push for
heftier cuts of up to Dollars 100bn; but Mr Bush noted that by 1997, he
would have cut defence spending by 30 per cent since taking office. 'This
deep, and no deeper,' he warned.
At the same time, Mr Bush announced further reductions in the US land- and
sea-based nuclear deterrent, using a combination of unilateral and
negotiable proposals. The reductions elicited an immediately favourable
counter-offer from Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who announced
that he had ceased production of several long-range weapons systems.
Further talks are planned today at the United Nations Security Council in
New York and at President Bush's Camp David retreat; prospects for an early
deal eliminating multi-warhead, intercontinental missiles, the most
destabilising first-strike weapons, are good, according to US officials.
The surprising thing was how little impact Mr Bush's nuclear proposals
created at home. This may change if the president drives home his message
that the end of the Cold War means an end to the nuclear terror and a new
security to Americans; but the fact that the president's fiscal 1993 budget
submission to Congress took precedence underlines how preoccupied Americans
have become with their domestic troubles. Economic insecurity has become
Public Enemy Number One.
The striking lesson from this year's budget submission to Congress is how
limited is the number of tools that Mr Bush has at his disposal for tackling
these fears. This is underscored by the substantial deterioration in the
outlook for the Federal budget deficit, both in the short and long-run.
This year's deficit is expected to reach a record Dollars 400bn, compared
with a projection of Dollars 281bn this time last year, and recent estimates
of Dollars 350bn. More seriously, the administration has abandoned hope of
achieving a balanced budget in the medium term: the deficit is not expected
to fall significantly below Dollars 200bn (about 3 per cent of gross
domestic product) over the next five years, according to Mr Richard Darman,
budget director.
These deficits - a substantial portion of which were run up in the 1980s
under the Reagan/Bush administration - are a crippling legacy to future
generations. They also help to explain why Mr Bush's own 'growth package' is
so modest.
Mr Bush has confined himself to proposing a few short-term measures,
including a temporary tax credit for first-time home buyers of up to Dollars
5,000; a temporary 15 per cent investment tax allowance; an increase in the
personal exemption by Dollars 500 for each child; a cut in the capital gains
tax cut, now 28 per cent, to 15.4 per cent; and an executive order to
employers to withhold less in federal taxes from workers' pay-cheques - a
move that will give the average family Dollars 350 per worker, but that will
be clawed back by the government next year.
Just before Christmas, optimistic souls at the White House hinted that Mr
Bush might be ready to support conservative Republican calls for income tax
cuts as part of a Dollars 60bn Keynesian-style reflation. The price would
have been breaking the Dollars 500bn budget deficit reduction agreement with
Congress struck in 1990; but the potential political benefit would have been
a dramatic Republican initiative to pull the economy out of recession.
In the event, the president accepted his advisers' warning that busting the
budget agreement would so unnerve the financial markets that interest rates
would rise, countering the Fed's policy of using progressive reductions in
the discount rate to lower the cost of borrowing. And so began Mr Bush's
waiting game, tempered by judicious leaks of the growth package aimed at
creating the impression of a caring, activist president.
This delay may hurt Mr Bush next month when he faces a crucial first primary
election in New Hampshire, one of the states hit hardest by the recession.
But the reality is that the president has handed economic policy to Mr
Greenspan at the Fed. Populist Democrats and Republicans may rail against an
unelected Fed running the country; but it does allow several tactical
advantages from Mr Bush's standpoint.
First, the president can cast the Democrats as the big spenders, a tactic
which has worked in three successive presidential elections.
The administration has not, as feared, lifted the discipline of the budget
agreement: caps on discretionary spending programmes remain in place
(although Mr Bush is willing to amend the act to allow defence funds to be
used as an offset if Congress objects to other cuts needed to finance the
child tax exemption).
Second, Mr Bush will play the tax-cut card with all the fervour of his
predecessor, Mr Ronald Reagan. His appeal for a cut in capital gains often
sounds hollow; he knows that the Democratic price is a tax on the wealthy
which he is not prepared to accept.
Third, the White House wants to avoid specifics, particularly on
controversial issues such as health care. 'It's the black box strategy,'
says Mr James Thurber, head of Congressional Studies at American University
in Washington DC. 'The idea is to avoid showing your hand and make Congress
deal with the detail. If things go wrong, Congress gets the blame.'
Democrats will counter that Mr Bush's rhetoric far exceeds what he has
delivered in his three years in office. Mr Bush, who calls himself the
'environment president' and 'education president' has almost as many titles
as residences in the US. Democrats, who believe that the 20 years of
scepticism about government's ability to solve problems is over, call him a
'do nothing' president.
Mr Clinton has shown himself well capable of challenging Mr Bush on his home
record, particularly on education. By contrast, Mr Patrick Buchanan, the
pugnacious conservative Republican who is standing against Mr Bush in the
New Hampshire primary on February 18, has his own retort: 'Are you better
off than you were four years ago?'
This is the question that Mr Reagan used so effectively against President
Carter in 1980. Knowing that the answer is a firm negative, Mr Bush will
play to his strengths as commander in chief of Desert Storm, the decisive
leader who still towers above his democratic rivals.
Yet the truth is that Mr Bush has staked his political future on early signs
of economic growth. Like the economy, he has only one way to go; upwards.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Leading Article: A single EC energy market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW energy directive put forward by the EC Commission is supposed to be
one of the fundamental building blocks of the European single market. But it
will have to uproot deeply entrenched interests if it is to achieve the
desirable objective of removing barriers between member states' markets for
electricity and gas.
In few areas do state monopolies maintain such dominance as energy. Few also
suffer from such distorted price structures, the result of decades of
subsidy and government manipulation. The directive challenges, head on, many
members' long-established energy policies.
The measure proposed last week by Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the Portuguese
Energy Commissioner, would open the EC's gas and electricity distribution
networks. Under the directive, large energy consumers could buy electricity
and gas from suppliers anywhere within the EC, starting next year. Three
years later, this permission would be extended to smaller consumers.
By letting competitive forces into the market in this way, the EC hopes to
expose the Community's high-cost energy producers. But merely opening taps
or throwing switches would not yield the desired results, which is why the
directive also contains provisions that would remove less visible barriers
to energy trade.
For example, the mono-polies, whether state-owned or otherwise, would be
required to unbundle their various components - generation, supply and
distribution - and make them conform to accepted accounting standards. This
should reveal cross-subsidies that give any unfair advantages. Member states
would also have to let incoming suppliers reach domestic consumers and local
fuel supplies, if necessary by building plant.
One step
It is an indication of the size of Mr Cardoso's task that only one country -
the UK - remotely approaches the kind of free market he envisages, and then
only in electricity. Yesterday's decision by the UK to lift the ban on gas
imports is only a step, if an important and belated one, in a long march
towards a liberalised UK gas market.
It is from the continental countries that the greatest resistance is
expected. In France, where the state-owned Electricite de France enjoys a
monopoly, the plan would not merely allow in competitors, but would also
expose the subsidy enjoyed by its substantial nuclear power industry,
because it does not bear the cost of future decommissioning of plant. In
Germany, electricity prices have been kept artificially high to help the
country's inefficient coal industry. Mr Cardoso's plan would force Germany
to review this policy.
Special problems
Indeed, each member state has a special set of problems, and will seek
special treatment as the directive makes its way through the Brussels
machine. Much of the resistance will come in the form of warnings about the
threat to security of supply. These should not be dismissed, but combined
with appropriate regulation an open market - stimulating trade in energy -
is potentially more secure than a closed one.
Opponents may also point to the evidence of UK power liberalisation -
limited though it is - to argue that a free market does not necessarily
bring the desired benefits. The British record has been disappointing so far
because prices have tended upwards rather than down. But this is partly
because the UK market contains vestiges of the monopolies and price
distortions which adherence to the principles behind the directive would
remove.
Apart from pointing the way ahead for the EC energy market, the plan would
create an opening for increased gas imports from Russia and reinforce the
EC's efforts in resolving that country's financial problems. Just as with
farm produce, it is not in the interest of either the EC consumer, not to
mention the desired stability of eastern economies, for the EC to resist
Russian gas imports. In reverse, a more flexible EC energy market should
also facilitate the much needed export of electricity to eastern Europe.
Mr Cardoso has launched a bold plan. It is worth fighting for.

Tut, tut. Top woman gives up Pounds 100,000 job to spend more time with her
family. It sounds a plausible tale in these stressful times and makes a good
headline. But in the case of Diana Cornish, the 49-year-old managing
director of the Brook Street Bureau recruitment agency, it is not accurate.
Having risen to the top of the employment business - she was involved with
Blue Arrow long before Tony Berry arrived - she wants a new challenge.
'Women don't get many chances at the top,' says Cornish, who makes it clear
that after a well-earned holiday, she will be looking around for gainful
employment again.
If plans for a management buy-out of Brook Street had not collapsed 15
months ago, she might have hung around a little longer. But after 18 years
in the same business she wants to prove that she can do something other than
run an employment agency. A businesswoman worth watching.

The Volvo-Procordia battle in Sweden has opened up old wounds. It is not
just the Swedish state, as Procordia's second largest shareholder, that is
upset by Pehr Gyllenhammar's bold move, but also the corporate establishment
led by the Wallenberg dynasty.
One man, in particular, 70-year-old Curt Nicolin, will play a pivotal role
in the outcome. As chairman of the nine strong privatisation commission,
Nicolin has spent most of his life working for the Asea engineering group,
one of the crown jewels of the Wallenberg empire, and remains one of the
family's most trusted advisers.
Nicolin has sound business reasons for giving the thumbs down to
Gyllenhammar's latest power play with Procordia and it would be wrong to
suggest this represents the revenge of the Wallenbergs on Gyllenhammar for
past slights. Nevertheless, the Wallenbergs must be forgiven for more than a
half smile at the predicament of Volvo's charismatic chairman after Nicolin
has rejected his offer.

No sooner has Britain's Office of Fair Trading chief Sir Gordon Borrie
handed in his notice than another good OFT man - Richard Thomas, the
42-year-old director of consumer affairs - heads for the door. Could the two
events be connected?
Thomas, like his boss, is a clever lawyer whereas Sir Bryan Carsberg,
Borrie's successor as director general, is an accountant. However, Thomas
assures me that the timing of the departures is pure coincidence. He never
regarded himself as a candidate for Borrie's job and unlike most of his OFT
colleagues, he is not a career civil servant.
He is off to join City law firm Clifford Chance as the first director of its
public policy practice. He will not be a partner but he will certainly be
earning more than the Pounds 51K-59K that his old job is being advertised
at.
It seems slightly odd that Clifford Chance wants to poach a consumer affairs
expert rather than someone like Martin Howe, boss of the OFT's competition
policy division, who should be able to command juicy advisory fees if he
ever decided to go private. But Clifford Chance partner David Reid is
confident that he has made the right choice.
Thomas will assist clients 'in dealing with the ever enlarging interface
between business and governmental bodies in the area of developing laws'. Or
more briefly, perhaps, Mr Fixit.

The copywriting flair of the original Roy Brooks, who died in 1971, charmed
up-and-coming professionals not only to pay over the odds, but to settle in
areas previously beyond the pale such as Clapham and Camberwell.
Even so, one of Observer's house-hunting colleagues is not surprised that
his firm has now followed him to the grave. His successors apparently

Why is Greek shipowner and rising media-baron Yannis Alafouzos nursing
bruises after forcible arrest by a police riot squad?
The official reason is that, as boss of the top private station Sky Radio as
well as Greece's most respectable paper Kathimerini, he was trying to set up
a 30-megawatt transmitter on Mount Hymettus above Athens when his licence
allowed only 1MW.
But onlookers suspect his real crime was refusing to behave like a
traditional Greek newspaper tycoon and toe the party line, in this case a
conservative one. The ruling New Democracy party dislikes being publicly
criticised by one of its own.
Alafouzos, in his later 30s, is open to further punishment through his plan
to start a news-centred television station, which looks likely to be refused
a licence. Broadcasting minister Sotiris Kouvelas, who would be the one to
grant it, says the Alafouzos media empire is a looming monopoly - a curious
claim when there are 80 other private radio stations in Athens, besides 15
daily papers and over 20 television stations.
Ironically, Kouvelas himself came near to a similar bruising experience a
few years ago when, as mayor of Salonica, he set up a popular city hall
radio station. The socialist government of the day threatened to send in the
riot squad to tear down the transmitter.
At the time Kouvelas was acclaimed as a champion of the right to free
speech. But Greek politicians' memories are notoriously short.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Secretive sale of BTG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL crumbs of the government's privatisation meal are proving hard to
digest. The recent debacle of the privatisation of the trust ports has
garnered much bad publicity. But similar potential problems surround the
British Technology Group sell-off. In both cases the unusual nature of the
organisations has led to an elaborate and ambiguous bidding procedure, in
which unspecified weight is attached to considerations other than price. To
make matters still more opaque, the government and Price Waterhouse, its
financial adviser on the sales of the ports and BTG, appear to be imposing
an information black-out on both.
As the successor to the National Research Development Corporation, set up by
the post-war Labour government, BTG still plays an important role in
commercialising publicly-funded research in UK universities and controls an
impressive portfolio of British intellectual property. At the same time, it
is expanding internationally under the banner of 'the world's largest
technology transfer organisation'. The public interest in BTG's fate is
greater than the estimated proceeds of the sale - Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m -
might indicate.
Last year the government gave parliament assurances that it would protect
the independence of BTG and prevent any asset-stripping. For example, bids
would be accepted only from consortia in which no shareholder had a stake of
more than 15 per cent, and trade buyers would be excluded. Strong
involvement with UK universities and existing BTG staff and management would
also be encouraged.
No disclosures
The bidding process is now well under way. The deadline for preliminary
proposals was four weeks ago and shortlisted consortia have to submit final
bids by February 19. But Price Waterhouse and the Department of Trade and
Industry have disclosed nothing about the submissions, not even the number
being considered in the final round. And, according to current plans, no
information will be released about the losing bids even when the winner is
announced - probably just before the general election.
So far, two consortia have identified themselves as second-round bidders.
One, led by BTG management and staff, offers the prospect of continued
international expansion from an independent UK base. The other, headed by
Research Corporation Technologies, BTG's leading competitor in the US, would
provide an instant Anglo-American alliance and could develop more quickly
into a global technology transfer organisation. They offer different visions
of the future that both are keen to debate in public. Yet they have been
warned to disclose no details of their investors and only the bare bones of
their business plans.
Competitive pressure
According to Price Waterhouse, the secrecy is intended to keep up the
competitive pressure on the participants, on the ground that they are likely
to make higher offers if they are not sure against whom they are bidding. In
the case of BTG, however, getting the best price is not the only important
consideration. Indeed if the government were really concerned about
maximising its return from the sale it would not have set up such an
elaborate privatisation process, in which the fees are estimated already to
have consumed more than 10 per cent of the likely revenues.
The best way of ensuring that the qualitative 'public interest' issues are
properly balanced against price is to make the bidding as open as possible.
The government should not only name the second round bidders, but also
specify clearly the weights attached to the various non-financial criteria
in evaluating their submissions. The most important criterion should be a
long-term commitment to BTG's core business, the profitable exploitation of
technology.
When the government announces the winner, it should also publish all the
shortlisted bids, at least in outline. As with the trust ports
privatisation, the BTG sale has no chance of commanding public support
unless it is seen to have been conducted fairly.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Arts: Faure's Requiem - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday's Faure Requiem was given by the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et
Romantique, (fancy name]), the Monteverdi Choir and a group of boy
choristers from Salisbury Cathedral under John Eliot Gardiner. In itself it
proved so complete an experience, so transportingly beautiful, so fully
committed to communicating the substance of this extraordinary masterpiece,
that one almost forgot an important point was being emphasised thereby.
Faure's original form of scoring for the work, for chamber forces, was
highly personal and imaginative; but it was disapproved of by his publishers
and eventually suppressed in favour of the familiar later one for large
forces more conventionally disposed. In recent years there have been several
attempts at reconstruction of the chamber Requiem (followed by notable
recordings); this latest had the benefit of a new edition (soon to be
published) by the leading Faure scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux, along with the
Roger Delage, which draws on autograph material found at the Madeleine in
Paris.
It is wholly convincing in vocal and instrumental layout, more so (I think)
than any previous effort of Faure rediscovery. Hearing the Requiem this way
exposes with new potency of impact and intensity of detail the singular,
unrepeatable greatness of its artistic conception. Too often, in all but the
most stylishly disciplined of 'traditional' performances, one feels the
musical invention being swamped by the sound, or else the players and
singers being tethered to a semi-perpetual level of polite mezzoforte in
order to allow a balance of parts to be maintained.
The fewer the participants, the greater the possibility for keen, pointed
musical attack, for unfettered involvement and a wide range of dynamics in
all the lines - and the greater the expressive power to be tapped from the
notes.
Gardiner understands the power of those notes. His reading, underpinned by a
cleanly purposeful rhythmic tread, lightly floated in its melodic lines,
entirely free of both churchy sentimentality and musicological piety, was a
marvellous example of this conductor's interpretative art. The economy and
intimacy of the music, its capacity for saying so much, so deeply, with so
little flounce or excess verbiage, seem his natural territory; the sound of
the performance and the sense of the music were made inextricable.
The choice of soloists - the admirably grave but unpompous Swiss
bass-baritone Gilles Cachemaille and Catherine Bott the bright, true soprano
 -was part of the same process. It goes without saying that a chamber-sized
Requiem places an added burden of accuracy and control on its executants,
which all here shouldered with unarguable confidence and authority.
The first half was a spread of wonderful French a capella choral music, by
Saint-Saens, Debussy and Poulenc (Un Soir de neige and the shattering Figure
humaine), wonderfully delivered by the Monteverdi Choir. Altogether, this
was a concert of exceptional richness.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Arts: Drawn back to Mantegna - Some scholarly fun at the RA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fortnight ago, fresh from Andrea Mantegna at the Royal Academy, I
described it is a 'miracle' of an exhibition. (Less understandably, I sited
Mantua on Lake Garda and not on the lagoon, for which aberration, mea
culpa.) I also noted that museums could only have justified the loan of so
many exceedingly precious paintings, drawings, and prints by this late
15th-century master, on the grounds that this was an exhibition with a
heavyweight scholarly agenda. In other words, it was not going to be enough
for the general public to have a perfectly lovely time. The experts, too,
would have to have their field day.
If I have a (mild) criticism of this wonderful exhibition it is that the
general public could well miss out on the scholarly fun. It is as though two
feasts of Mantegna are set before us in the Academy. Self-service is, of
course, delicious, and costs Pounds 4.00 for the entry fee. However, the
'menu-cards' - the labels and the printed room-by-room guide - might have
done rather more to convey the novel and, it should be said, speculative
view of Mantegna's art which lies behind this exhibition.
The only hint the casual visitor will have that this is a controversial
exhibition, is the innocent little phrase, 'here attributed to Mantegna
himself', which crops up notably often in the guide. Finding out what that
involves leaves you no choice but to up-grade from self-service to high
table Mantegna. The cost is Pounds 22.50 for the highly informative
catalogue - and a long morning's read.
What, then, seems to be the new view of Mantegna? Most strongly it comes out
in the exhibition's magnificent prints and drawings. In most Old Master
exhibitions, the room set aside for works of art on paper is the one which
visitors with aching feet will bypass. This time, it is virtually impossible
to take a painting-centred view of the artist.
Collaboration between the Academy's lighting technicians and conservators
have made it possible for prints and drawings to be hung beside the
paintings to which they relate. This technical achievement has the effect of
letting us see the world as if through Mantegna's two pairs of spectacles.
There was the world he strove, with obsessive care, to image in colour. But
that same world he also had the vision, as no one had ever done before, to
image in black and white.
David Landau, who has curated the prints, is also chairman of the
exhibition's steering committee and was responsible for the initial idea for
a major Mantegna show, conceived after mounting an exhibition of the
artist's engravings at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1979. Landau is not only a
print scholar and editor of Print Quarterly. More surprisingly, he is also
joint managing editor of Loot, London's free advertising newspaper. This
makes Landau an amateur among the art-historians, a status he values highly.
'I have the freedom to say what I think. People in academe and museum worlds
will be more cautious, because they have got a lot to lose.'
Landau's views on Mantegna as a printmaker emphasise how extraordinary it
was that the artist in his 30s and busy painting the Camera Picta in Mantua,
decided to experiment with engraving on copper. The technique was then in
its infancy, and was used principally by German artists for small, cheap
devotional images, playing cards, and the like. Mantegna, however, did not
see engraving as a technique merely to multiply images mechanically. At this
stage in his career he was well-enough funded by the Gonzagas not to bother
with that. He looked at Donatello's bronze reliefs, and at his beloved
antique carved gems and cameos of antiquity, and saw that it would be
possible to create a work of art using black, white and greys to express
tone and volume. It was, comments Landau, 'a tremendous leap in our visual
culture'.
There is no evidence Mantegna actually incised plates himself. However,
Landau's study of engravings by Mantegna and his workshop leads him to add
four to the canonical list of seven made by the artist. They include the
'Flagellation' and the 'Descent into Limbo'. For an artist who had trained
as a miniaturist (the exhibition attributes to young Mantegna a beautiful
little illumination of the infant Christ in a basket), working with tiny
strokes on copper perhaps came easily , although Landau describes Mantegna
as an artist experimenting, not getting the first engravings right.
Mantegna, a restless genius, lost interest once he had mastered engraving -
the heavenly 'Virgin and Child' represents the pinnacle of achievement. But
as he grew old, he wanted prints of his paintings and hired professional
engravers. Landau believes there was only one engraver, Giovanni Antonia da
Brescia, although the catalogue goes for two engravers, adding in a figure
called the Premier Engraver. The catalogue also reveals that one of the team
of scholars, Suzanne Boorsch, disagreed radically with Landau's views, and
argues that none of the engravings was actually from Mantegna's own hand.
Landau stresses that there is nothing remotely whimsical in the conclusions
that he, Boorsch, Keith Christiansen (paintings) and David Ekserdjian
(drawings) put forward in this momentous exhibition. A condition he set the
Academy, the Metropolitan in New York, exhibition's sponsors, Olivetti, was
that during the three years of preparation the scholar-team should together
examine as many as possible of the works which would be exhibited.
This intense collaboration, Landau and Ekserdjian agree, was unique and
extraordinarily valuable. Ekserdjian recognised that a drawing of 'Christ
between SS. Andrew and Longinus' which he found in a box of Mantegna's
prints in Munich, was no copy but an important working drawing for the
print. The artist, unsure about Christ's posture, has cut out the head and
pasted it back at a different angle. Ekserdjian also had two drawings
uncovered, one whose ghostly existence had previously been spotted (the head
of a man) and the other, a design for a candelabra, which had not. Only 30
drawings are generally recognised as being by Mantegna: adding another three
is no mean achievement.
As they travelled the world's print-rooms and galleries, the Mantegna team
evidently generated heat as well as light. Landau speaks of 'tremendous
rows', and having to argue fiercely for his four reattributions. He helped
his case by developing a new technique, superimposing enlarged
transparencies on a light-box to show exactly how the artist's drawings were
used for engravings.
I have not exhausted all the novel and controversial aspects of the team's
ideas, but at least I may have suggested why this level of academic input
makes Mantegna a deeply serious, as well as a beautiful, exhibition. Maybe
we should have seen a little more of the scholarly tail, which certainly
does not wag the dog. But if you have ever wondered whether art-historians
are not merely playing a rather pointless game of attributions and
reattributions, bear it in mind that without this scholarly tail we would
never have seen the dog.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Arts: Gormenghast - The Oxford Playhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mervyn Peake's classic Gormenghast trilogy sprawls over 1500 pages and took
13 years to write (1946-1959). A two-hour stage version seems almost beyond
the scope of ambition. Yet The David Glass Ensemble is now touring with a
play based on Titus Groan and Gormenghast. It is a brave, bold, exciting
stab at the impossible.
Peake knew the stage. His plays, The Wit to Woo and The Cave were produced
in his lifetime; he developed Gormenghast the musical, for which Benjamin
Britten wrote the score; his illustrations for the trilogy witness his dark
draftsmanship (he was a war artist at the liberation of Belsen). So he was
far from being a closeted novelist.
However, his arbitrary world works best in novel form: private imaginings
build an architectural vision rivalled only by JRR Tolkein's middle-earth
mythologies. The play condenses the first two novels of Peake's trilogy,
Titus Groan and Gormenghast. The crumbling Earl Groan and his Countess
Gertrude preside over a decaying castle; Titus, their son and 77th Earl, is
subject to the mad dictates of Gormenghast 'law', and prey to the plottings
of Steerpike the machiavel. The Groans have a Master of Ritual, a Chief
Retainer and Master Cook. An unknown Wild Thing haunts the castle's
corridors.
John Constable's script translates the frustrations of Peake's world without
the compensations of his style. The result is an evening in which moments of
excitement emerge from periods of boredom. In Peake, slabs of adamantine
prose bridge the gaps where nobody speaks, but the theatre has to show
rather than tell. Director David Glass, designer Rae Smith and choreographer
Sally Owen have opted for mime; there are breathless chases, fires and
storms delivered by slick, inventive staging.
The equivocal virtue of the production is that one needs to have read the
Gormenghast trilogy to make sense of it. Peake's characters survive, to the
last snap of the Retainer's cracking joints and the oozings of sweat from
the Cook's fetid brow. The plot, always a distraction in Peake, remains
faithful to the books. But without these pleasures of recognition, it can be
hard work to maintain contact with the stage characters.
The Ensemble acts with great poise and energy, negotiating tricky mines,
whether climbing up stairs or falling off cliffs (Sally O'Donnell as the
Wild Thing is particularly striking). John Eacott's music is a constant and
welcome support to a difficult evening's theatre.
The tour, which began last week in Bradford, reaches London (Battersea Arts
Centre), on March 17 via Cambridge, Swindon, Hexham, Worthing, Brighton,
Newark, Darlington, Glasgow, Leicester, Horsham, Carlisle and
Berwick-Upon-Tweed.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Arts: Royal Philharmonic Orchestra - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While other London orchestras are intent on establishing centres of
activity, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has been out on the road.
Yesterday it completed what is claimed to be the first tour by any arts
organisation to link all the capital cities of the European Community,
sponsored by Cellnet.
It is heartening that the RPO's Vladimir Ashkenazy, like other foreign
conductors who have held resident posts in London, has proved sympathetic
towards British music. For while the tour has done nothing to promote living
British composers, it has included a token British piece in each programme
and a few performances of Walton's First Symphony; though I note that only
in London and Dublin did the management risk the Fifth Symphony of Vaughan
Williams, a less cosmopolitan score.
Audiences abroad will have found the RPO holding on to its warm and
well-blended sound during Ashkenazy's period of tenure. Overall bloom takes
precedence over clarity and detail, or at least that is how it seemed at the
official London concert of the tour last Friday from a seat well to the side
of the auditorium.
The evening was predominantly a French one. Berlioz's Overture to Beatrice
et Benedict opened the programme and Ravel's La Valse closed it, both in
unexaggerated performances, though it was difficult to hear much of what was
going on in either. In between the soprano Jill Gomez made a soloist of
plausibly Gallic sympathies in a selection of Canteloube's Songs of the
Auvergne and two little-heard Berlioz settings, 'La Captive' and 'Zade",
where she let the words go unheard too often.
A companion concert on Tuesday, in theory outside the tour although it
repeated a tour programme, was more substantial. Ashkenazy has not yet taken
up much Vaughan Williams, but on the evidence of this performance of the
Fifth Symphony, we would benefit from his doing so. The music moved well and
the lambent lyricism which he favours in other areas of his repertoire here
found a natural outlet, with the RPO players at their best attaining just
that sense of ethereal beauty which one imagines Vaughan Williams must have
had in mind.
The symphony is dedicated to Sibelius and it was that composer's Violin
Concerto that preceded it. The soloist was Midori, the 20-year-old Japanese
violinist, who is a little pushed to find a full enough sound for this
concerto's big romantic climaxes. But as soon as speed is called for, her
spitfire energy excitingly takes command. If a balance between introspective
Nordic gloom and outgoing solo virtuosity is sought for this music, then
Midori is aware of both, although one cannot help sensing where her own
priorities lie.
In case that should leave any doubt in the matter, it must be stated clearly
that this young violinist is not only a formidable technician, but also a
musician who knows what she wants to say with every note. Whatever outcome
the GATT negotiations may bring, it is presumably safe to assume that there
will be no import barriers on violinists of her quality from the Far East.

FT  31 JAN 92 / The Property Market: Uncertain end to 1991
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year ended on a note of uncertainty with falling rents and a reversal
in the yield improvement of the previous two months, according to the latest
figures from the Investment Property Databank, a research group.
Total returns to the monthly index of the IPD failed to climb back to
positive figures after a poor month for office property in December. The
sector was doubly hit with one and a half points off both rental and capital
values.
The 1991 All Properties total return figure of -0.8 per cent concealed
continuing short term volatility and large variations between sectors, with
offices returning -8.4 per cent and industrials 6.9 per cent over the
12-month period.
The pattern of sector returns remained unchanged throughout the year.
Industrials showed the highest returns and offices the lowest. Rental values
fell in all three sectors, while capital growth and total returns continued
to improve, albeit fitfully.
The total return in the retail sector fell slightly from the previous
month's peak level. Retail property was the only sector to show positive
rental growth in December, although yields moved outwards pushing the end
year yield up from 8.6 per cent to 8.8 per cent.
Office property rents dropped by 1.3 per cent, resulting in the sector's
worst ever quarter of -3.2 per cent and year-on-year at -9.1 per cent.
Yields appear to have stabilised at around 9.7 per cent.
Industrial property produced a total return for 1991 of 6.9 per cent. The
year-on-year rental value growth has fallen to -0.5 per cent.

FT  31 JAN 92 / The Property Market: The new centre of discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shopping centre developers who laid their plans in the balmy days of the
1980s consumer boom are opening their malls in an arctic climate. For every
centre which is performing better than anyone dared to hope, there is one
staring failure in the face. Even those centres - a majority - which will
succeed eventually are struggling to find tenants.
Mr David Watt, a director of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnock, property advisers,
says that many schemes may take 30 months to let, and even then the
developer will not make any money.
The outlook for one in 10 of the new schemes is even worse. 'The very
worrying cases are those which are not getting up to 60 per cent let. Are
they going going to be white elephants?' he asks.
Developers cannot afford to allow their malls to stand half empty. They can
easily get locked into a downward spiral when a lack of tenants breeds a
lack of customers and thus mounting difficulties for the dwindling numbers
of remaining tenants.
The recession, combined with the large supply of new space, is forcing
landlords to compete for tenants which they would not have even considered
in better times.
Retailers are being offered Pounds 50-Pounds 100 per sq ft or more as an
incentive to open shops. A new generation of niche retailers - such as
cosmetics retailer Body &amp; Face, Haagen Dazs, the ice cream maker, and tea
and coffee seller Whittards of Chelsea - are expanding on the back of the
incentives, prime positions and keen rents offered by developers.
The capital contributions from developers can give the newcomers an enormous
advantage over their predecessors, many of whom had forced up rents in their
feverish competition for space in the 1980s. 'We used to have space bandits,
now we have capital bandits,' says Mr Graham Chase of Clive Lewis, chartered
surveyors.
But the trend towards giving up-front capital incentives presents dilemmas
for landlords. Is it worth paying a retailer to set up shop, if there is a
risk that it will not be able or willing to stick with a 25-year lease?
'There are circumstances where pulling in tenants even if they are only
there for a year is a worthwhile exercise. It puts some life in the centre,'
says Mr Stan Perry of Eagle Star, the insurance company. Eagle owns the
Alhambra in Barnsley, northern England, which has let about one in 10 of its
shops since it opened in October, excluding its anchor store, the Co-op.
Agents and tenants report that developers are becoming less willing to
provide capital contributions. In some cases, this is due to their own
financial pressures. In others, it is because they have become disillusioned
with their fledgling tenants.
From a standing start in November 1990, Creative Crystal, a gift retailer,
opened 30 shops last year in shopping centres throughout Britain. Half these
shops now stand empty and the company is struggling for survival. 'We are
teetering on the brink,' says Mr Arthur Brown, a director.
Creative Crystal's rise and fall is as much a measure of the state of the
shopping centre market as it is of the recession. The company admits that it
would not have expanded so fast without incentives. And with hindsight, it
believes it should have moved at a slower pace.
It is not alone. Mr Brown can point to four other undercapitalised
independents which are in a similarly precarious position after rapid
expansion.
Most struggling shopping centres will batten down the hatches and ride out
the storm. But what will happen to those that do not make the grade?
One possibility is a change of use. Sibec's failed Winter Gardens
development in Southport, Merseyside, has been bought from the receiver by
Safeway, the grocery superstore. Safeway is seeking permission to build a
superstore on the site.
Another prominent example of change of use is Tobacco Dock, the shopping
centre which was built in an old tobacco warehouse in the London docklands.
Being well off the beaten track, it failed to attract enough shoppers and
went into receivership in 1990. The receivers are hoping to complete a sale
to Mr Paul Kempin, a Leicester-based investor, who wants to turn it into a
tourist destination with a 'sea life centre'.
In some cases, a change of ownership may be enough to revive a centre. A
pension fund may be hampered by its reluctance to treat an investment as a
business requiring active management. A entrepreneurial landlord who is
prepared to bully tenants into paying their rents and help them attract
trade may get better results.
The most striking example of this is the Trocadero in London's Piccadilly,
which was built by Electricity Supply Nominees (ENS) as an upmarket shopping
mall on the advice of Richard Ellis, the surveyors, which ENS subsequently
sued.
The Trocadero's fortunes and rent roll increased sharply when Brent Walker
and Power Group, a property company, bought it and the adjoining island site
from ENS for Pounds 105m in 1987. (The site was valued at an eyebrow-raising
Pounds 250m at the end of 1989.) The new owners took the Trocadero
down-market in a way that had been barred by ENS's trustees.
Are the developers of this crop of disasters to blame? Or are they merely
victims of an unforeseeable change in circumstances? In Mr Watt's view, the
problems largely date back to the unusually buoyant conditions of the
consumer boom. 'Developers did their homework in a snap-shot,' he says.
The developers were egged on by the retailers. Obsessed by expansion, they
started to look at towns with populations as low as 20,000. Now the
credit-led spending bubble has burst, the centres' catchment area may be too
small to sustain profitable stores. Similarly, stores built in large towns
that already have a centre, face too much competition for comfort.
But unlike previous gluts in retail property, only in a minority of cases is
the poor design of centres to blame for their failure. Mostly, developers
have learned from the poor location, layout and appearance of some of the
1960s shopping centres.
Even the worst of this current crop of shopping centres is an improvement on
Birmingham's Bull Ring or London's Elephant &amp; Castle - the most enduring
eyesores of the 1960s.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Management: Hats off to mother-in-law - My Office / Lucy
Kellaway visits Ian Plenderleith, a banker who views the international
financial markets down the barrel of a popgun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's markets supremo looks ill at ease, and glances
doubtfully around his room. Urbane and self-possessed when discussing the
Exchange Rate Mechanism, Ian Plenderleith seems less comfortable talking
about the decor of his room on the Bank's inner courtyard.
'The office is a machine for working', he says briskly.
In his case, the machine is so old that one would have thought it obsolete
long ago. At the grand old entrance to the Bank in Threadneedle Street,
there are no electronic gates, no magnetic security passes. Instead four
elderly men in pink tail coats and red waistcoats with shiny silver buttons
graciously welcome visitors into the building.
Plenderleith is to be found across a wide expanse of mosaic floor and down a
dark corridor. A parlour messenger, also clad in pink and red, greets you
politely, takes your coat and sees you into a small, slightly dingy ante
room to wait while the Bank's associate director finishes a meeting.
Plenderleith's office is surprisingly small for the man who oversees all
London's financial markets. The atmosphere is heavy, traditional, frumpish
even. But Plenderleith defies you to draw any conclusions: 'The building is
old and historic, but the organisation is efficient and modern', he says.
The room is dominated by two outsize pieces of furniture, a reproduction
leather-topped desk and a scuffed grey safe with a combination lock.
Given the decisions that pass over Plenderleith's desk - when to support the
pound how to pay for the Government's latest burst of spending - there can
be no shortage of sensitive papers to fill it with.
Were it not for one or two tell-tale signs, this could be the 1950s. There
are modern-looking butts in the ashtray. There are four new telephones, one
for the outside world, one special circuit for the Bank's senior directors,
a hot line to the Treasury and another to the Stock Exchange.
But the main concession to the modern age is a bank of six large screens,
neatly boxed in a wooden cabinet in an optimistic effort to make them more
in keeping with the room. These display all the information available to any
of the market-makers in the Square Mile, including their own views of the
market. 'I read a great deal of uninspired rubbish,' Plenderleith says
crisply.
On top of the screens is a relic of the old technology, a black silk top hat
that Plenderleith wears once a month when he is playing the role of
Government Broker. Does he feel silly in it? Apparently not: 'It is a small
but worthwhile part of the tradition', he says. The hat, itself, he is proud
of: this one does not come from Bank's own stockpile of silk hats, but from
his mother-in-law's attic.
There is a British no-nonsense touch about Plenderleith, who starts work at
7.45am and does not waste a moment all day. He talks about the importance of
short lines of communication; there are sliding doors on each side wall of
his office, one opening onto the man in charge of the gilts market, the
other to the one in charge of home finance. 'It takes 17 seconds to walk
down to the market makers without hurrying,' he says.
Plenderleith is an enthusiastic caller of ad hoc meetings. 'Often during the
day I will need to get three or four people together for 20 minutes to deal
with a complex subject. It's a lot faster than exchanging memos.'
The visitors who pass through all day can expect a mixture of austerity and
luxury. They will find none of the sofas, coffee tables and plants that are
de rigueur in modern offices. Instead, the room is full of upright Regency-
style dining chairs on which guests perch while Plenderleith surveys them
quizzically from the other side of his desk.
In the morning and afternoon, a tray is brought in by the parlour messenger
with silver jugs of tea or coffee and fine white bone china cups.
With such a surfeit of tradition, there is little scope for the Bank's
employees to stamp their personalities on their surroundings. Plenderleith
has added just one touch of his own.
On his desk is his 'prize possession' a brightly coloured wooden popgun, a
present from his children to celebrate big bang. 'I often feel like pointing
it at people', he says.

Childcare / Moves to provide nurseries for the children of civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Angela Rumbold, chairman of the ministerial group on women's issues,
opened the First Steps nursery for the children of Westminster-based civil
servants in December 1991, she could claim more than just a fashionable
interest in childcare provision.
A Cabinet Office study in 1990 had shown that a central London nursery could
save the civil service around Pounds 40,000 a year if it enabled even modest
numbers of mothers to return to work after the birth of their children.
As Rumbold put it: 'More and more, employers are recognising that one way to
retain valuable staff is to help make it easier to combine career and family
responsibilities'.
The problem will become more acute for the civil service as the number of
new entrants to the labour market drops in the mid-1990s.
Like other employers which have traditionally relied on a steady stream of
school-leavers, government departments will either have to offer higher
wages to maintain recruitment or find ways to retain more of the staff they
currently have in post.
Luring back staff who have stopped work to have children is one option.
The First Steps nursery offers places for 27 pre-school children of civil
servants from five central London departments and the Metropolitan Police
Office.
Located just behind the Tate Gallery, the nursery is run by the Westminster
Children's Society under the aegis of the Home Office.
Parents pay Pounds 60 a week per child, with the rest of the cost being
picked up by the employing department.
First Steps is one of more than 20 civil service nurseries based in towns
such as Guildford and Bootle where there are large government offices. The
biggest, with 65 places, is the Sunbeam Nursery in Croydon, run by the Home
Office in the headquarters of the Immigration Service.
More are in the pipeline: the Inland Revenue which already has seven is
planning to open another nine, including a purpose-built nursery in a new
office block in Leicester.
There is no central organisation which can set up nurseries for different
departments and agencies, since provision depends on local circumstances. In
each case, a sponsoring department or local office takes the lead in setting
up the nursery, offering surplus places to other departments.
Partnerships between departments are fostered by a small unit in the Cabinet
Office which provides information to departments and acts as a clearing
house for spare nursery places.
In some parts of the country, departments and agencies have formed
partnerships with other local employers to run nurseries.
In Sheffield, two government departments share nursery facilities with
Midland Bank, the largest provider of workplace nursery places in the
private sector. Partners in other parts of the country include Sainsbury's,
county councils and local colleges.
Also popular among civil servants with children are the holiday play schemes
now running in more than 80 locations.
These provide entertainment and stimulation for children during the school
holidays, typically at a cost of Pounds 5 a day.
Stephanie Bradley, a mother of two, is enthusiastic about the play scheme
run by the Inland Revenue at Bush House in London's Strand.
'In the past, I have had to save up my leave for the summer holidays and
take unpaid time off,' she says. 'It just wouldn't be possible in my present
job as press officer.'
In Scotland, three departments participate in local out-of-school schemes
which look after children between the end of the school day and the parents'
return from work.
Other pilot schemes may be run, though they are more difficult to set up
because they must be located close to schools and home, rather than the
workplace.
Finally, the civil service has pioneered flexible working arrangements which
help staff combine parenthood with a career.
More than 27,000 women (and over 1,000 men) work part-time or as
job-sharers, a three-fold increase since 1984.
The vast majority are in clerical and administrative jobs, but more than 250
women and 150 men at the senior grades 7 and above now work part-time.
Other patterns of flexible working have been developed, including annual
hours and part-year appointments which allow parents to work during
term-time and take time off during school holidays.
Homeworking, fixed-term appointments and recurring temporary appointments
have all been used to help civil servants combine home responsibilities with
a civil service career.
'It is too soon to put a figure on the effects of childcare provision on
recruitment and retention,' according to Susan Haird, head of equal
opportunities at the Cabinet Office. 'But where childcare is available,
there is keen interest from many applicants.
'Departments and agencies tell us that nurseries and holiday play schemes
reduce absenteeism, sick leave and special leave taken because private
childcare arrangements break down.
'Resignations for domestic reasons also seem to drop and a higher proportion
of women civil servants having babies return to work at the end of their
maternity leave.'
This is one of a series of articles on childcare.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology: Reversing the operation - The job of dismantling
the world's nuclear arsenal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United States and the former Soviet republics are embarking on a nuclear
disarmament programme of a scale that no one had imagined possible until a
few months ago. It will involve dismantling at least 20,000 warheads,
ranging from tactical weapons to multi-megaton hydrogen bombs.
The process of nuclear dismantling remains shrouded in secrecy, for the
simple reason that taking apart a weapon is the reverse of putting one
together - and no one wants to risk giving useful clues to building an
H-bomb.
In the US, UK and France, nuclear weapons are designed with eventual
dismantling in mind. The western nuclear powers have been taking apart their
old warheads regularly since the 1950s and re-using the materials in more
modern ones. For them dismantling is a routine though expensive and
time-consuming process, which uses high-technology equipment for remote
handling of hazardous materials.
The former Soviet Union, on the other hand, has less experience of nuclear
dismantling and recycling. Its stockpile contains ancient warheads from the
1960s and, to make matters more dangerous, the nuclear technicians trained
to maintain them are said to be leaving their posts in droves, demoralised
by the collapse of the Soviet military system and the fact that no one is
paying them a living wage.
John Simpson, a nuclear specialist at Southampton University's Mountbatten
Centre for International Studies, says Russian contacts have told him 'that
some of their weapons were simply not designed to be dismantled. In that
case, we have to start virtually from scratch, developing ways to get at the
fissile cores'.
However the Russians do have some dismantling experience, as Viktor
Mikhailov, deputy minister of atomic power and industry, made clear in an
article published this month in Moscow. 'In fact, our factories are already
more occupied with the dismantling of warheads than the production of new
ones,' he wrote.
Dismantling has to take place in a special cell that is protected with
reinforced concrete in case of an accident. There is no risk of a full-scale
nuclear explosion but the conventional explosive used to detonate the bomb
could conceivably blow up, particularly if the warhead is old and poorly
maintained. The containment would then be needed to prevent plutonium - a
radioactive and toxic metal - being released into the environment.
In the west, the conventional explosive removed from warheads is normally
destroyed by controlled burning. But according to Mikhailov the Russians
sometimes use it for making synthetic diamonds; when detonated in a sealed
chamber it produces pressures high enough to convert graphite, the humble
black form of car According to western estimates, Russia has enough cells to
dismantle 1,500 to 2,000 warheads per year. That compares with an estimated
15,000 warheads needing destruction under current Russian plans. In addition
there are thousands of old weapons in storage, which are likely to present
the most difficult dismantling task.
The Russians will need western help to build up decommissioning facilities
if they are to get rid of their weapons at an acceptable rate. 'The obvious
way to speed up the process is to build more cells,' says Simpson. 'But
there is a Catch 22.' Cells built for dismantling could be turned round
relatively easily to do the reverse - assembling warheads - if the political
climate changes.
Given the potential instability of the former Soviet states, many
proliferation specialists believe the west should concentrate its help on
ensuring the physical security of all warheads due for elimination, rather
than dismantling them. This means moving them to properly guarded central
storage in Russia, making the warheads safe and inactivating their
detonators.
Francois Heisbourg, director of International Institute for Strategic
Studies, says full-scale dismantling of the warheads would be 'worse than
leaving them intact' unless foolproof arrangements are in place to safeguard
the nuclear materials that come out of the bombs.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, is keen to expand
its existing role of inspecting the world's civilian nuclear plants and
start to supervise the plutonium and enriched uranium removed from weapons,
making sure that they are never diverted back to military use.
One of the most vexatious issues surrounding nuclear disarmament is what to
do with the weapons-grade plutonium. The US already has an estimated 50
tonnes of unwanted plutonium, which was either removed from scrapped
warheads or produced for future military use but no longer required, and the
weapons decommissioned over the coming years will generated more.
The obvious civil use for the plutonium is to generate electricity in power
stations. But the type of reactor designed to run on plutonium, the fast
breeder, remains far from commercial development. For use in conventional
thermal reactors the plutonium has to be combined with uranium in the form
of mixed oxide (Mox) fuel.
'Looking at the non-proliferation aspects, the best use of the plutonium is
to burn it as mixed oxide fuel,' says David Kyd of the IAEA. Many people in
the nuclear industry agree but others are sceptical about recycling
plutonium in this way because it is more expensive and difficult to use than
straightforward uranium fuel.
'Plutonium recycling is simply uneconomic,' says William Walker of the
Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex. 'Most plutonium in
the world should be regarded not as an asset but as waste to be disposed
of.'
Suggestions for plutonium disposal range from entombment deep within the
earth to firing into deep space. But no one has come up with scheme that is
technically feasible, environmentally acceptable and politically
supportable.
THE IMMENSE destructive power of a modern warhead results from four nuclear
explosions - one fusion and three fission reactions - occurring within a few
millionths of a second inside its metal casing. At the heart of the weapon
is a small 'implosion-type' atomic bomb similar to the one that destroyed
Hiroshima in 1945. It is detonated by firing a spherical shell of high
explosive around a ball of plutonium (or highly enriched uranium). The
pressure squeezes the plutonium into a super-critical mass, triggering
explosive nuclear fission.
The primary explosion transmits an intense pulse of X-ray energy towards a
cylinder of lithium deuteride wrapped around a rod of plutonium. This
radiation triggers a second fission reaction in the plutonium rod and
nuclear fusion between deuterium and tritium - the main source of the
H-bomb's awesome power - in the lithium deuteride. The cylinder also
contains some tritium gas.
The cylinder has a thick outer layer of unenriched uranium (U238) metal.
This 'tamper' gives the thermonuclear explosion extra force by holding the
deuterium and tritium in place for an extra millionth of a second or so
before everything flies apart. At the same time, the intense flow of
neutrons from the fusion reaction triggers fission in the U238 itself -
adding yet more power to the warhead.
The weapon has many other components, including electronics to control the
detonator, and radiation shields and mirrors to distribute radiation from
the primary explosion evenly over the secondary cylinder.

TO PREVENT double-decker buses or lorries from smashing into low bridges,
the UK's Department of Transport is planning to instal electronic devices to
warn drivers of an impending accident.
The Overheight Vehicle Detector, developed by Coeval, of Prestonpans, East
Lothian, uses infra-red technology to detect vehicles over a certain height.
Two infra-red beams are installed on poles about 100m before the bridge at
the maximum clearance height. If the two beams are interrupted by a vehicle,
the detectors send a message to an electronic display a short distance
further on. Bright flashing amber lights then warn the driver to turn around
or take an alternative route.
The equipment will be installed in 30 sites in England by September.

FOR many small or medium-sized companies the expense and complexity of

The answer, according to Technology Concepts, of Cwmbran, could be a box
which enables the two machines to communicate over the ordinary phone line
exactly as if they were connected together using the company's own network.
The Welsh company has developed the PCC/MX unit to connect to the PC in the

Radcon No. 7, which will be sold in the UK by Nationwide Protective
Coatings, of Newton Abbot, Devon, is a water-based coating which sinks into
the concrete surface and reacts with free calcium in the concrete to produce
a hydrophoebic barrier.
The coating is sprayed on to the concrete, where it becomes sticky. Then the
surface is sprayed down three times with water at regular intervals. This
starts the biological process. Additionally, if cracking occurs to the
concrete due to thermal stress, the coating is washed into the cracks when
it rains, so sealing the fissures.

WHILE notebook PCs are frequently touted as tools for the business
traveller, in practice few have enough battery power to last through a
transcontinental flight, writes Louise Kehoe. This is especially true of
models with high-quality displays and hard discs.
Compaq Computer's latest 'notebook' computers, the Lite/25 and LTE Lite/20,
go some way to overcoming this. They use the latest Intel 386SL
microprocessors, which minimise battery drain by suspending operation of
functions that are not in use.
Compaq has also developed a low-power backlighting system for the display,
normally the most power-hungry element of a notebook. The lighting system
saves up to 50 per cent of the power consumed by earlier designs.
Also included in the latest Compaq notebooks is a battery pack with a
built-in microprocessor that monitors power use and displays the amount of
power remaining on a battery gauge.
These innovations enable Compaq's new LTE Lite/25 and Lite/20 models to run
for three to four and a half hours - a 50 per cent improvement.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Management: Missing out on appliance of science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no shortage of scientists or ideas in Britain, but industry still
has serious problems in exploiting them. Senior executives of British
companies recognise that technology is vital to success, but delegate too
much responsibility for technology management and planning.
A new survey of 80 British manufacturing companies prepared by PA Consulting
Group shows that British companies are slower than competitors to capitalise
on ideas and turn them into commercial products. Almost all senior
executives also seem dissatisfied with their own company's internal research
and development and believe that it is necessary to improve the
effectiveness of their R&amp;D effort.
The research suggests a worrying gap between the business management of
companies and the engineers and technologists. Senior managers still see
technology as being the domain of the boffin. Nearly 30 per cent of
companies admitted that nobody was responsible for technology management, 15
per cent saw it as a junior function and another 30 per cent believed middle
managers were responsible.
Speed of technological development is seen as a important business issue.
Three-quarters of companies said that process development times failed to
keep up with market demand while 55 per cent said product development also
lagged.
To overcome some of the problems, PA Consulting suggests that British
companies should learn from the Japanese and develop business and managerial
skills in their engineers and technologists.
'Two-thirds of the directors of Japanese manufacturing companies are
scientists, engineers or technologists by background,' the report notes. 'In
the UK, more than two-thirds are not. If nothing else, this creates an
environment in which the leaders of the Japanese company speak the basic
language of manufacturing.'

FT  31 JAN 92 / Standard of education criticised by inspectors
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STANDARD of education of more than a quarter of pupils in England is
unsatisfactory, the government's independent education watchdog said
yesterday.
In his annual report for 1990-91 Dr Terry Melia, the senior chief inspector
of schools, said that 30 per cent of primary school work inspected was less
than satisfactory. For secondary school work of pupils aged between 11 and
16, the figure was 27 per cent.
In further and higher education, around 90 per cent of work inspected was
satisfactory or better.
The report was based on observations of more than 50,000 lessons on visits
to 7,000 schools and colleges.
The report is especially critical of persistent underachievement by some
schools in inner-city areas. More than a third of the work observed in these
was unsatisfactory.
The inspectors found a wide range of standards in independent schools. Some
achieved the highest standards found in the country. Others offered an
'unacceptably poor provision'.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Lloyd's counters forecast of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dispute between Lloyd's of London and Chatset, the independent analysis
company, over the insurance market's 1990 and 1991 results deepened
yesterday.
On Wednesday Chatset published its own forecast and estimated that Lloyd's
faces losses of Pounds 1bn for its 1990 underwriting year and Pounds 750m
for last year. Lloyd's will report the results in June next year and the
year after.
A number of underwriters disputed the projections and yesterday Lloyd's
issued its own estimates.
They are derived from individual forecasts given by a market group of
managing agents representing about 40 per cent of the market.
Lloyd's claim that the market will register a loss of Pounds 390.5m for 1990
and a profit of Pounds 424.5m for last year.
The figures exclude investment income, expenses and the reinsurance to close
that individual underwriters will decide when closing their accounts.
They also exclude the impact of further claims emerging from business
underwritten before 1990. Chatset estimates that such claims might cost at
least Pounds 400m a year, although the figure is disputed by Lloyd's.
Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, described Chatset's figures as
'unnecessarily pessimistic and alarmist'.
The House of Lords yesterday gave Lloyd's leave to appeal on a preliminary
issue in the legal case being brought against the corporation by 33 Names
who were members of insurance syndicates managed by the Oakeley Vaughan
managing agency, now in liquidation.
The Names - the individuals who pledge their wealth to back the market  -
say their losses were due to the failure of the Lloyd's Corporation, which
provides market back-up and regulatory services, to regulate the market
properly.
Lloyd's wants the issue of whether it owes Names a legal duty of care to be
heard on technical grounds outside the facts of the case.
It appealed to the lords after losing on the same issue in the appeal court
last September.

The NAO said that the department's arrangements for staff planning and work
measurement were recognised to be generally good, but further improvements
in information systems would help managers to control resources.
National Savings products are sold through the Post Office network and the
NAO that there was no independent way to determine whether the fee paid by
the National Savings Department for the service - Pounds 50.77m in 1990-91 -
was fair and reasonable.
The NAO believes that periodic independent consumer surveys could help in

FT  31 JAN 92 / Midland to cut 300 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK is to cut 300 more jobs from its 27,000-strong UK workforce,
David Barchard writes.
The bank said yesterday that the cuts were being made throughout its
operation, but applied mainly to back-office staff. A number of managerial
posts will be among those to go. Midland hopes to keep redundancies to a
minimum by not replacing staff as they retire and by transferring staff
whose jobs are to be cut to new positions.
Last year the bank shed 4,000 jobs to cut its costs, which are among the
highest in the UK banking industry. Midland made a loss of Pounds 71m in the
first half of 1991 and is due to announce its full-year results next month.
Banks have been making large cuts in their workforces for several years
because of of the introduction of new technology.

FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Steep fall in size of wage deals
likely to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'dramatic' fall in pay deals last year continued into the final quarter
and looks likely to persist this year, possibly even breaching the 5 per
cent 'pay floor', according to pay research body Industrial Relations
Services.
The latest figures from the IRS pay databank for the final quarter of last
year, based on pay reviews for 630,000 employees, show that the median
settlement has fallen to 5.1 per cent. The figure for December 1990 was 9.7
per cent.
IRS says that nine out of 10 pay reviews in the final three months of last
year were for smaller amounts than awarded in the same period the year
before.
December's lower quartile of settlements remains unchanged from November at
4.5 per cent, while the upper quartile has increased slightly to 6.7 per
cent.
IRS says that a striking feature of pay in the 1980s was the existence of a
'pay floor' of 5 per cent, in spite of persistently low inflation during
1986 and 1987.
Public-sector pay in the financial year to March next year is expected to
increase by 7 per cent, according to a separate analysis by the Public
Finance Foundation. The PFF estimates that public-sector rises will be 1
percentage point higher than private-sector pay and 3.5 percentage points
higher than inflation.
The PFF expects that next week the pay review bodies will announce rises of
about 6 per cent for the 1.5m teachers, doctors, nurses and members of the
armed forces.
It also predicts that local-government settlements in July and September
will be 4.5 per cent and the Civil Service settlement will be 5 per cent.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Brazil's turnaround is all in the mind: Inflation is not
down, but everyone is behaving as if it was
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A MAN who eschews magic solutions, Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, Brazil's
economy minister, has performed a great conjuring trick. Without actually
reducing inflation, he has convinced an important part of the sceptical
Brazilian public that the all is under control.
So much so that an estimated Dollars 3bn has entered Brazil in the last six
weeks - much of it returning flight capital - and for the first time ever
the black market dollar exchange rate is below the official rate.
To cap Mr Moreira's success, the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday
night at last put the seal of approval on his adjustment programme with a
Dollars 2.1bn standby facility, paving the way for accords with Brazil's
creditors.
The same analysts who were predicting imminent hyperinflation just three
months ago when foreign exchange reserves had dropped to critical levels,
now say Brazil is poised for a take-off surpassing that of Mexico, Latin
America's superstar.
They point out that last year, despite the absence of a Brady debt reduction
plan or IMF accord, Dollars 11.6bn in foreign capital entered Brazil -
double that of 1990. So much money has been flooding into the stock market
this year that it has already risen 60.8 per cent in dollar terms.
But the question mark over the world's ninth-largest economy is still large.
For Brazil's monthly inflation remains around 25 per cent and Mr Moreira's
only weapons in play are a widespread confidence in his abilities and tight
monetary policy which is crippling industry and causing mass dismissals.
Moreover the volume of money entering Brazil is due less to confidence in
the economy than to its undervalued shares and high interest rates.
It is far from certain that the mild-mannered Mr Moreira will succeed in his
attempt to follow the lead of other Latin American countries to move to an
economy based on free trade, competition, and a reduced state. While
rejoicing over the IMF deal he admitted yesterday that the hard work is
still to come: 'We have had almost no significant growth for 12 years. What
is important now is tight monetary and fiscal control if we are to avoid
losing another year.'
One of the biggest uncertainties is political feasibility. President
Fernando Collor must convert an operating budget deficit of 0.6 per cent of
gross domestic product (before debt interest payments) into a 2.4 per cent
surplus by the end of 1993. To do this, he requires constitutional changes
which will mean confronting traditional politicians who jealously guard
their sources of state patronage.
He must also cow the country's powerful cartels and oligopolies which have
grown fat from protectionism and bleeding the state.
On first taking office in March 1990, Mr Collor thought his 35m votes gave
him the power to take on all these interests. Instead he found himself
blocked on all fronts and unable to muster the 252 votes in Congress which
would constitute a majority. Two weeks ago he suffered the ultimate
humiliation when even the government bloc voted against him on important
pensions legislation.
Mr Collor's stance had been valiant but counter-productive in a country
where nothing is achieved without deals. Left with few options last week he
sacked four ministers and appointed traditional politicians from the PFL, a
centre-right party, aiming to increase his political base.
He now has 125 votes in Congress but, what is more important, retains the
backing of the godfathers of Brazilian politics - Mr Antonio Carlos
Magalhaes (known as ACM), governor of Bahia and communications minister in
the last government, and Mr Roberto Marinho, head of the Globo media empire.
To seal the deal ACM's son was appointed whip.
Unable to work outside the system, Mr Collor appears now to have decided he
has to operate within it.
There is no firm evidence that the inflation rate or the rate of growth of
the money supply is coming down. Moreover the IMF programme carries some
inflationary pressures, such as a commitment to a 15 per cent real rise in
public sector tariffs, as well as a heavy social cost. Brazil is already in
its worst recession for a decade with the unemployment rate in Sao Paulo now
10.5 per cent.
The big unknown on which all hangs is the Brazilian psyche. If enough people
start to doubt the success of the programme and inflation heats up then
business will push up prices, as happened last October, fearing a new price
freeze and provoking further inflation. Mr Moreira has turned such a
situation around once - he may not be able to repeat the trick.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Fall in goods orders blights recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ORDERS for US durable goods fell by 5 per cent last month, casting doubt on
the Bush administration's upbeat budget projection of an early economic
recovery.
The fall in orders was the largest for more than a year, and much greater
than Wall Street analysts had expected. Excluding defence, new orders fell
by nearly 9 per cent.
Much of the weakness was concentrated in the volatile civilian aircraft
sector. However, excluding transportation, orders fell 1.6 per cent to
register their fifth successive monthly decline.
For 1991 as a whole, total orders were down 4.6 per cent - the biggest drop
in almost a decade.
In the budget, presented on Wednesday, the administration projected an
economic recovery from the spring. Most analysts are hoping that lower
interest rates and a budgetary fiscal stimulus of perhaps 0.5 per cent of
gross domestic product will stimulate growth in the second half of this
year.
But many remain pessimistic about the immediate outlook. 'Nothing in the
recent numbers suggests the economy is about to pick up in a big way,' said
Mr William Brown, chief economist at JP Morgan, the New York bank. He
expects GDP to contract at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the current
quarter, after zero growth in the fourth quarter of last year.
Mr Richard Berner, economist at Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street brokerage,
said the durable goods figures indicated 'continued stagnation in
manufacturing'. A fall in the volume of goods shipped also suggested slower
growth of US exports, until now one of the bright spots of the economy.
Other figures yesterday were little more encouraging. Personal income rose 1
per cent in December, in cash terms. After allowing for inflation and
distortions such as higher farm subsidies the real increase was a meagre 0.2
per cent. Personal consumption spending was flat in real terms for the
second month running.
Labour markets were weak. Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose
24,000 to 468,000 in the week to January 18. Such a level has signalled
recession in past business cycles.

ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is to supply Dollars
255m (Pounds 140.8m) of equipment for a planned high-voltage direct current
link between southern Sweden and northern Germany.
ABB has reached agreement with Baltic Cable, jointly owned by Sydkraft and
Preussen Elektra, two Swedish and German utilities, to supply two converter
stations and a 250km submarine cable.
The HVDC cable is claimed to be the world's longest and technically most
advanced of its kind.
The two converter stations will be built south of Malmo and in the Lubeck
area in Germany.
A definitive contract will depend on Baltic Cable receiving permission for
building the HVDC link.
ABB was awarded a DM40m (Pounds 13.9m) contract for the modernisation of
three 400mw turbine generator units at the Planta Centro Power Station,
200kms west of Caracas.

gear
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), linking the
US, Canada and Mexico, are moving at a rapid pace, but President Bush's
brief reference to the talks in his State of the Union message sent a signal
to political observers that he is still keeping his options open.
In an effort to secure a draft agreement before the end of the month, trade
negotiators from the three countries have planned an almost non-stop series
of meetings, culminating in a possible head-of-state reunion at the end of
February.
On Sunday, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, will head a
delegation to Mexico of congressmen and businessmen, and Mrs Hills will meet
with President Carlos Salinas. Next Tuesday, the chief trade negotiators
will meet in Ottawa, Canada; and next weekend the three trade ministers will
meet in Annapolis, Maryland. A further ministerial meeting has been
pencilled in for the end of February in Dallas, Texas.
Although the negotiators have remained tight-lipped where differences lie,
reports from Mexican newspapers suggest that negotiators have completed 15
draft chapters of the 18 in total. These 15 chapters include brackets where
important differences lie, but the hope is that most, if not all, of the
brackets will be removed at the Annapolis meeting.
The negotiators appear not yet to have drawn up drafts on energy, cars and
agriculture, reflecting the extreme sensitivity with which these sectors are
treated in all three countries. The agreement on the agriculture chapter has
been held up by the uncertainty over the Gatt negotiations - although a
decision has been reached to draft an agreement on agriculture before the
Gatt round concludes.
Cars for the US and the Mexicans are perhaps the most critical sector. They
account for 20 per cent of Mexican exports, while support of the US auto
makers for Nafta may be essential if the agreement is to pass the US
Congress.
Recent reports in the Mexican press suggest energy may have become a
sticking point.
This whirlwind of activity received only a passing mention from the
President last Tuesday - but the Gatt Uruguay Round received none.
'In our major trade negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate
tariffs and subsidies that damage America's farmers and workers,' he said.
'And we'll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the
North American Free Trade Agreement, and through the Enterprise for the
Americas Initiative.' The latter was President Bush's initiative in 1990 to
speed economic integration in the Americas, opening up the possibility of a
hemispheric free trade zone.

PRESIDENT Luis Lacalle of Uruguay has asked his cabinet to tender their

His conservative administration has been under increasing criticism from
left-wing opponents and traditional allies, including factions of his own
National (Blanco) Party.
The statement said all cabinet members had offered to quit but would
temporarily remain in office.
An aide said the president would try for a new political pact with the
liberal Colorado Party. Mr Lacalle took office in March 1990 with the
support of most of the Colorados, but the coalition crumbled as his
administration failed to beat triple-digit inflation and carry out planned
privatisations.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Democrats irked by Bush's tax cuts deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC party leaders yesterday bristled at the March 20 deadline by
which President George Bush has challenged them to pass his package of tax
cuts, reports George Graham.
'I think the president's decision to set an artificial deadline will not be
helpful. He's demanding that Congress approve, in 50 days, a proposal he's
been working on for 90 days, and he's still fine-tuning it,' complained
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
But Mr Bush's Republican supporters were enthusiastic about the prospects of
using the momentum from the President's State of the Union address on
Tuesday evening to meet the deadline.
While Democrats complain that March 20 is simply too soon to work through
all the legislation Mr Bush has proposed, some Republicans are threatening
to obstruct congressional business unless they receive a commitment that the
whole package will be put to a vote by then.
Mr Newt Gingrich, minority whip and leader of the Republicans' right wing in
the House of Representatives, has threatened to block the 10-day recess
Congress traditionally takes in February, at the time of the national
holidays commemorating the birthdays of George Washington and Abraham
Lincoln.
Republican party officials hope that, if the economic growth package fails
to pass by March 20, Mr Bush will be able to lift his re-election campaign
by attacking 'do-nothing' Democratic legislators.
A political organisation run by Mr Gingrich is aiming to raise Dollars 17m
to help Republican challengers in 170 Democratic congressional districts it
regards as winnable, hoping for a congressional majority.
Some political analysts warn, however, that this electoral strategy could
backfire on Mr Bush, who may find it hard to shift the onus for action away
from the presidency and on to the Congress.
The legislation the Democratic-controlled Congress sends to him for
signature may be substantially different from the package Mr Bush has
proposed: he would then face the dilemma of accepting measures unpalatable
to his Republican supporters, or using his veto, and risk being blamed for
obstructing efforts to do something about the recession.

FRANCE is to grant Kuwait FFr5bn (Pounds 510m) worth of export credits to

Mr Beregovoy, speaking at the end of a two-day visit to the emirate, said
France had agreed to allow the Kuwaitis to set up an investment company in
France to help channel more of its money into the French economy.
He gave no further details about the new company. Kuwaiti nationals would be
exempt from a French wealth tax to boost private investment in France in a
similar concession already granted to Saudi nationals, he said. Mr Beregovoy
said Kuwait had invested FFr8bn in France but that this was not enough.

FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Pact with power to fuel worldwide boom - A
Uruguay Round services deal could be key to expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE draft agreement on services trade negotiated in the Uruguay Round could
be as powerful a force for worldwide economic expansion as the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which liberalised trade in goods after the
second world war. (The creation of Gatt in 1947 was followed by a 20-year
boom in world trade and output.)
The draft 'final act' presented last December to the 108 governments taking
part in the Round includes a comprehensive services accord extending fair
trade rules for the first time to banking, insurance, transport, tourism,
construction, telecommunications and professional and personal services.
The deal is a remarkable achievement, given the outright hostility of many
developing countries to discussion of services when the global trade talks
were launched in 1986. There was also the need to construct a body of
coherent rules from scratch to cover services of every variety, sold across
borders or within borders and by individuals or multi-billion dollar
corporations.
However, the agreement as it stands is only a collection of rules. Still to
come are the results of crucial detailed negotiations underway in Geneva on
specific commitments by each country to open domestic services markets to
foreign suppliers. For the US in particular, big improvements in market
access for American companies are seen as essential to sell the services
deal to a reluctant Congress.
The stakes are enormous. International cross-border trade in services is
worth between Dollars 800bn (Pounds 442bn) and Dollars 1,000bn, compared
with merchandise trade of about Dollars 3,500bn. But at least as much
business again is done by local affiliates of foreign companies, whose
activities would be covered by the services accord. In addition, the
agreement includes rules on government regulation of all marketed services,
whether provided by domestic companies and firms or foreign ones. Thus it
potentially touches total commercial services production of perhaps Dollars
12,000bn worldwide, accounting for broadly half of gross domestic product
and employment in industrialised countries and a large chunk of those of
developing economies.
The agreement has three pillars:
A framework General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) which extends
Gatt-type fair trade principles to services. These include national
treatment (treating foreign and domestic service-providers equally);
transparency (an obligation to provide information on national rules and
practices governing services); and most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment
(non-discrimination between trading partners). The Gats, which would have
its own council under an umbrella Multilateral Trading Organisation, also
sets the ground rules for negotiating services liberalisation.
Four annexes which elaborate the rules for financial services, where there
is a need for prudential regulation to safeguard investors; stipulate
unfettered access to countries' basic telecommunications networks (essential
to the sale of many services); exempt for the time being aircraft landing
rights now negotiated bilaterally under the Chicago Convention; and permit
the temporary movement of workers to provide services abroad.
Country schedules incorporating specific market-opening commitments. These
initial commitments, analogous to (but much more complex than) the tariff
cuts negotiated by the original signatories to Gatt, will emerge from
bilateral bargaining but will be extended to other Gats members on an MFN
basis.
That said, the current negotiations in Geneva are not going well. Some 41
countries (the European Community counting as one), representing more than
90 per cent of world cross-border services trade, have made services offers.
But by all accounts they do not add up to much. With a deadline on March 31,
when country schedules have to be finalised to meet the Easter target of
completing the Round, negotiators are still at first base.
Matters have not been helped by industry pressure on Washington to exempt
certain sectors such as maritime transport and basic telecommunications from
Gats's MFN rule. Applying MFN, it is argued, would mean freezing US markets
open and others' markets shut, making it impossible for the US to take
bilateral measures under existing domestic legislation against countries
refusing to open their shipping or telecommunications markets. The draft
Gats accord does not permit any permanent exclusions.
But signatories can take temporary exemptions from MFN for up to 10 years,
subject to review after five.
Apart from shipping and basic telecoms, US negotiators are being urged to
exempt one or more financial services from MFN access if country commitments
do not come up to scratch. The industry wanted a sectoral non-application
clause in Gats, enabling signatories to withdraw benefits in the financial
services area alone from a trading partner with an inadequate offer on
financial services. But Gats only permits global 'non-application' of all
services benefits.
In addition, the EC wants a better deal from the US on access for its
'universal' banks, now handicapped by domestic US banking legislation.
Developing countries want greater access for their exports of traditional
services such as tourism and sophisticated services such as computer
programming, film-making and hospital management.
For all the uncertainties, the services accord has become a potent incentive
for countries to settle elsewhere in the Uruguay Round. For the EC
(including France, the second biggest services exporter after the US),
services exports dwarf those of agricultural goods. Even Mr Jacques Delors,
EC president, while criticising the Uruguay Round agriculture text, last
week invited France to draw the appropriate conclusions.
Negotiators were having trouble wrapping up the Uruguay Round, the head of
the US delegation said, warning of the risk of trade wars if they failed ,
Reuter reports from Geneva.
'I must admit, we are having our problems in finalising this agreement,' the
US ambassador, Mr Rufus Yerxa, told the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce.
'If the major players, Japan, the US and Europe, fail to come to grips with
the aggressive efforts to protect and advance their own special interests at
the expense of others, we are almost certainly going to see trade and
investment wars,' Mr Yerxa said. But he urged the various parties as well as
their constituents at home not to throw out an agreement because it was not
perfect in their eyes.
'Europe will have to acknowledge the need to curtail agricultural
subsidies,' Mr Yerxa said.
But he also recognised the need for the US, which has often taken unilateral
trade action, to be committed to multilateral rules. Developing nations
should also accept rules in intellectual property, services and investment,
he added.

FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Hungary short-lists toll motorway tenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH, Italian and Spanish companies are heading five international
consortia which have been short-listed to submit bids to build and operate
one of the first privately-financed toll motorways in eastern Europe.
The road, which will connect Budapest, the Hungarian capital, to the
Austrian and Czechoslovak borders, is expected to cost about Pounds 200m
after allowing for interest charges and inflation.
A short-list of pre-qualifying bids was published this week by the Hungarian
Ministry of Transport, Communication and Water Management. Leaders of the
five consortia are BAMEST of Italy, HASA of Spain, and GTM Grands Travaux de
Marseille, Transroute International, and Bouygues all of France.
There are no British companies in the consortia which include Austrian,
Finnish, Swedish and Danish construction groups.
Britain has little experience of operating privately financed toll roads,
while many of the large continental European toll road operators, notably in
France and Italy, are either state-owned or have the support of their
domestic governments. Hungary last year announced a Forints 320bn (Pounds
2.3bn) road construction programme, about half of which is planned as new
motorways.
It is hoped that private finance will be raised internationally to build
much of the new motorway system which is needed to support the economic
development of the country.
The first toll motorway will involve a 43km extension to the Austrian border
of the two-lane dual carriageway which connects Budapest with the city of
Gyor. The road would provide the last section of a 260km Vienna/Budapest
motorway.
A 15km spur to Bratislava, on the Czechoslovakian border, would also be
built under the private sector plan.
The Czechoslovakian government has proposed a similar programme of privately
financed toll motorways to open up its domestic markets and encourage
development.
The Hungarian authorities, which are being advised by Morgan Grenfell, the
British merchant bank, have told the five consortia that charges initially
should take account of the country's current economic situation. It
recommends that tolls should be about half the level of those charged on
west European roads.
The concession to operate the motorway would run for a minimum of 15 years
or longer, depending upon the nature of the bid.
The government plans to award the concession by the end of this year,
allowing construction to start by next spring.
The motorway is expected to be completed by the summer of 1995.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration plans to submit new banking reform legislation to
Congress in the next few days, but faces a lukewarm reception - even from
members who supported its efforts to pass a banking bill last year.
The new bill will include measures to allow banks to open branches outside
their home states, enter the securities business (from which they are
excluded by the Glass-Steagall Act), and be bought by commercial companies.
The administration is backing its push for legislation by new projections
suggesting that bank reform could save the US taxpayer more than Dollars
16bn over the next six years, through strengthening the banking industry and
reducing the number of failed banks needing to be bailed out by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
The projections strike a new note of pessimism over the outlook for the
FDIC's bank insurance fund. Without reform, the administration is budgeting
for the fund's deficit to soar from Dollars 2bn this year to a peak of
Dollars 39bn in 1996.
Reform could limit this peak deficit to Dollars 28bn in 1995, administration
officials said, just inside the Dollars 30bn borrowing limit Congress fixed
last year for the FDIC.
'It's unclear whether the banking industry could bear the full cost of
borrowing beyond Dollars 30bn; it's certainly clear that taxpayer exposure
would increase,' a senior administration official warned. He said reforms,
especially inter-state branching, would help banks to raise capital, so
enabling more border-line banks to survive and raising the value of the
failed banks the FDIC has had to take over and sell.
In Congress, however, even the supporters of banking reform believe it will
be near-impossible to pass legislation this year, so soon after an abortive
attempt last year and so close to the presidential and congressional
elections in November.

FT  31 JAN 92 / North Korea to allow inspection of nuclear facilities

NORTH KOREA signed a long-awaited agreement yesterday to allow international
inspection of its secret nuclear facilities, Reuter reports from Vienna.
Under the agreement, signed at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
in Vienna, North Korea will open all its nuclear sites to IAEA inspectors
checking for nuclear weapons development.
South Korea, the US and Japan fear communist North Korea is less than one
year away from being able to make its own atomic bomb.
However, Pyongyang denies that it is developing nuclear weapons.
'To create the openness that is necessary for confidence, regionally and
globally, these safeguards must be effective and comprehensive,' Mr Hans
Blix, the IAEA director general, said at the signing ceremony with Hong Gun
Pyo, North Korea's deputy nuclear energy minister.
North Korea signed the IAEA's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985. The
treaty requires all signatories to negotiate and sign a further safeguards
pact to open their plants to inspection.
However, Pyongyang has balked at signing the inspection agreement for years,
claiming it felt threatened by US nuclear weapons in South Korea.
On New Year's Eve, both Koreas signed an outline agreement banning nuclear
weapons from the peninsula - a few weeks after signing a non-aggression and
reconciliation accord.
Both the nuclear and non-aggression pacts are due to take effect when the
two countries' prime ministers meet for a sixth round of talks in Pyongyang
from February 19 to 21.
The nuclear agreement binds the two states, still formally at war 39 years
after the three-year Korean War ended, to establish a joint nuclear control
committee within a month of the treaty going into effect.
However, one US nuclear expert has warned that North Korea might use the
theme of Japan's potential nuclear ability to produce nuclear weapons as a
pretext to go back on the IAEA agreement.
Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, was reported to
have told a US congressional panel in mid-January that he understood a
Pyongyang official had told IAEA board members that North Korea might not
allow inspection unless Japan gave up its programme to reprocess spent
nuclear fuel.
After the signing ceremony, Chan Mun Sun, a Foreign Ministry official, said
North Korea was still worried by Japan's nuclear programme.
'Japan is in possession of large quantities of nuclear material, exceeding
the purposes of peaceful use of nuclear energy,' he said.
He added that North Korea would insist on the complete removal of all US
nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula and its conversion into a nuclear
weapon-free zone.
Chan Mun Sun gave no date for when the inspection agreement would enter into
force, saying it would take place before the next IAEA board meeting on
February 24.

<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by prominent local business groups yesterday won control of
Philippine Airlines (PAL), the biggest state company to be auctioned under
the government's privatisation programme.
The group, led by AB Capital and Investment Corporation which has links with
the Soriano family-controlled Asian Bank and runs the San Miguel beer and
food conglomerate, offered a winning bid of Dollars 368m (Pounds 205m),
including a local-currency cash component equivalent to Dollars 150m.
The AB Capital consortium includes Philippine Bank of Commerce, headed by Mr
Antonio Cojuangco, president of Philippine Long Distance Telephone and a
relative of President Corazon Aquino.
The other partners are International Container Terminal Services, controlled
by the Soriano and Razon families; venture-capital firm Hambrecht and Quist,
and the Armed Forces of the Philippines Retirement and Separation Benefits
System.
The winning group, which expects to take over management of the flag-carrier
by March, has contracted Korean Air Lines for two years to provide 'general
consultancy advice' towards improving operations. Korean Air has no equity
in the group.
Others in the bidding were Philippine Commercial International Bank, which
had American Airlines as consultant, and another group led by UBP Capital,
which had links with British Airways.
AB Capital won 67 per cent of PAL's outstanding capital stock, leaving the
government's holdings at 13 per cent. Two other state institutions,
Government Service Insurance System and National Development Company, still
have 15 per cent and 5 per cent stakes, respectively. The privatisation plan
calls for sale of 5 per cent of the remaining government holdings to PAL
employees this year.
Mr Filomeno Francisco, AB Capital's executive vice-president, said his group
wanted 'to take over as soon as possible' and 'restore PAL's position as
Asia's premier airline'.
PAL which had been incurring losses for the past 10 years, posted unaudited
net profits of 1.11bn pesos (Pounds 24m), in the April-December period last
year, reversing a loss of 1.65bn pesos the year before.
Sources in the winning consortium said a return-on-investment performance of
up to 30 per cent within two years of the group's takeover would be possible
if certain operating and supply procurement procedures were changed.
Mr Feliciano Belmonte, PAL's incumbent president, said the new group might
want to expand operations rather than retrench. Among PAL's assets are
unutilised entitlements to certain routes. Of its options of 24 flights on
the profitable trans-Pacific route, PAL uses only about half.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary and chairman of the bidding
committee, said he was 'pleasantly surprised' over the auction results.
Last-minute criticism from opposition politicians and from the state
Commission on Audit earlier threatened further to delay the privatisation,
which had been on the drawing-board since 1987.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Israel embarrassed by corruption probe into how it spends US
aid: Allegations of the siphoning off of millions of dollars are not helping
Jerusalem's quest for loan guarantees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS ISRAEL seeks to persuade the US to provide it with Dollars 10bn in loan
guarantees to buoy an immigration-burdened economy, US investigations into
corruption associated with US defence assistance to Israel are turning an
embarrassing spotlight on how Israel spends its annual Dollars 1.8bn in
military aid from the US.
'We think the US taxpayer has been getting screwed,' is the blunt assessment
of one American acquainted with the investigations.
Among the allegations recently repeated in the Israeli press - eliciting
strong denials from the Israeli Government - is that some misappropriated
money was used to fund espionage in the US.
The chief object of concern is Israel's military procurement programme which
spends the bulk of the annual US military grant aid on buying arms,
equipment and supplies from US companies.
Both the US government, through the justice department, and Congress,
through the House energy and commerce committee headed by Democratic
Congressman John Dingle, are gathering evidence of a complex network of
corruption involving the siphoning off of millions of dollars of aid
stretching back more than five years.
The issue first came to public light in late 1990 when General Rami Dotan, a
former head of Israeli Air Force procurement, was arrested and convicted of
skimming Dollars 12m from IAF purchasing programmes through bribes,
falsified contract values and links to 'front' companies to which he
directed contracts.
Last Sunday, Colonel Yitzhak Sa'ar, a former IAF quartermaster, pleaded not
guilty to charges of conspiring with Gen Dotan between 1987 and 1990 to
award contracts to companies in return for Dollars 3m.
According to Israeli prosecution documents, in one Dollars 250m deal in 1986
to buy engines for IAF F-16 fighters from General Electric, Gen Dotan used a
secret association with a US consultant advising GE to persuade GE to place
an engine-testing contract with an Israeli company run by another associate
of Gen Dotan's which owned only an empty warehouse at the time. The deal
allegedly netted the conspirators more than Dollars 7m.
Investigators working for the Dingle committee believe that the extent of
corruption extended well beyond that revealed in Israel's prosecution of the
Dotan case.
Much of their attention has focused on Israel's military procurement mission
in New York and suspicions that malpractice among its employees has become
endemic over the years. On Sunday three Israelis were charged in a Tel Aviv
court with running a bribery operaffice.
Mr David Felder and Mr Mordechai Markovitz, both former employees in the
mission who left in 1985 to set up a military marketing company called
Rotair, were charged with illegally obtaining information from Mr Ya'acov
Meringer, a procurement mission officer, about contract bidding.
US investigators are also probing a number of US companies - notably GE and
Pratt and Whitney - to discover to what extent their officers were aware of,
or involved in, the corruption. 'There was knowledge of this going up to
some level, but how high we don't know,' said one.
Investigators suspect that the corruption network may have been used by
Israeli intelligence bodies operating in the US to fund covert operations
there, but no firm evidence has yet been produced.
Mr Moshe Arens, the Israeli defence minister, stated flatly this month that
Israel did not spy on the US - at least not since the uncovering of US naval
officer Jonathan Pollard, who was caught supplying secret documents to
Israel in 1985.
Even without that added complication, the corruption scandals have become an
embarrassment for Israel. The defence establishment's blushes were deepened
last month when, on top of the procurement scams, it was disclosed that the
Israeli head of a US-funded programme to produce an 'Arrow' ballistic
missile interceptor had been sacked for doing private defence sector
consultancy work contrary to his contract terms with Israel Aircraft
Industries.
Clearly, revelations of serious malpractice in the use of US financial
assistance could have a damaging effect on Israel's case for continued US
defence and civilian aid worth Dollars 3bn a year and its request for loan
guarantees.
But an overriding concern is the damage done domestically to the military's
hitherto cherished reputation for honesty and integrity.
'That is what has shaken the military establishment,' says Mr Dore Gold, a
senior staffer at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies.
Mr Arens is balking at allowing US investigators free access to pursue their
inquiries in Israel, as the Dingle committee is seeking. But he told the
Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee this week that the country
could not live with corruption in the defence system. He said he was
studying recommendations made by two internal investigations on how to stop
such things happening.
A senior opposition MP, Mr Rafi Edri of the Labour Party, has been pressing
in the Knesset for an overhaul of the whole procurement structure, in
particular the traditional practice of staffing the New York mission with
former military officers augmented by inexperienced Israeli students.
The practice of senior military men proceeding immediately from the armed
forces to top jobs in military industries has been well established for
years, but transparently prone to corruption. Among Mr Edri's suggestions
are for much stricter civilian controls over the procurement system,
including the stricture that no-one involved in procurement within the armed
forces should be able to work in any procurement role for three years after
leaving the military.
'Unless the equivalent of root canal work is carried out in terms of an
internal investigating effort, (the scandals) will cast a shadow over Israel
in the future,' says Mr Gold. But he believes this will be done and does not
see lasting damage to Israel's intimate military relationship with the US.
US investigators insist that they have no political motive to that end - as
some in Israel have suggested. From their point of view the main lesson may
turn out to be the inadequate control the US government has exerted over its
Israeli aid programme. Unlike other countries, Israel gets its aid up front
and is largely free to spend it as it sees fit, beyond strictures on the
amount that must be spent in the US.
'There is no doubt the initial finding is the US government's lack of
oversight over the money we give to Israel. Its a joke,' declared one
congressional official.

Signatories of the R500m (Pounds 106m) trust fund said it was founded
following concern among certain industries about the education crisis and
the widening gap between schooling and requirements of the workplace.
The state is estimated to spend five times more on each white child than on

FT  31 JAN 92 / Stronger security role urged for CSCE
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA and Germany yesterday urged foreign ministers at the Prague
meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to
strengthen the forum's institutions and allow it to play a more active
political mediation and military peace-keeping role in member states.
The Conference, which groups 36 European states, the US, Canada, the Baltic
states, and 10 former Soviet republics, has no legal or political powers to
enforce agreements.
However, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, said it was
time to expand its role among member states in the field of security, as
well as to change the rules of consensus.
'The CSCE should provide for the possibility of creating CSCE 'blue helmets'
and CSCE 'green helmet' missions to safeguard peace and the environment,' he
said.
Officials also discussed the possibility of changing the decision-making
process to a consensus minus one. Such a mechanism would also allow members
to condemn one member state.
Under the unanimity principle, Yugoslavia has refused the admission as
members of Slovenia and Croatia, which were recognised as independent states
by the European Community countries, among others, on January 15.
Slovenia and Croatia were instead granted temporary observer status.
Officials said that membership would be considered at the Helsinki meeting
which is due to take place in mid-July.
Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak president, had earlier suggested the
creation in the CSCE of a body similar to the Security Council of the United
Nations.
This new council would be vested with certain executive powers from members
states in the security sphere.
'If the CSCE is to be a guarantor of the inviolability of frontiers, the
security of its member states and the protection of their democratic
constitutional systems, it must have instruments enabling it to perform this
function,' he said.
The US however, reacted against such proposals. 'The most dangerous thing
for the CSCE is to launch a series of ideas to which members are not ready
to subscribe and which will therefore prove unworkable,' a senior US
official said.
The extent of the CSCE's role in monitoring peace settlements has been a
topic of discussion all summer as senior officials met regularly to issue
declarations on the Yugoslav crisis.
A possible new role for the CSCE was further highlighted yesterday after 10
former Soviet republics were admitted as full members.
Some of these republics, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have waged a
virtual war over the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh. Mr Raffi
Hovannisian, Armenia's foreign minister, said he would welcome CSCE
peacekeeping missions in his republic.
The 10 republics were granted admission yesterday after Russia took over the
seat allocated previously to the Soviet Union.
Only Georgia, at the grip of a civil war, did not apply for membership.
Admission of the former Soviet republics brings to 48 the number of member
states. Concern was voiced that such a large body would become ineffective
under the CSCE's unanimity rule.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC governments yesterday received the final version of the Maastricht treaty
on European union for signature next week, after vain Dutch and Irish
attempts to alter aspects of the controversial social policy protocol agreed
by Britain's 11 partners.
Negotiated at last month's Maastricht summit, the 'treaty on union' is
likely to be signed on February 7 in Maastricht at a meeting of foreign and
finance ministers.
The past month, spent in cleaning up the text for signature, has produced a
treaty whose substance is virtually identical to that agreed by EC leaders
on December 11.
But it has also revealed some Dutch and Irish nervousness about the social
protocol, designed to bypass the UK government's rooted objection to passing
more EC labour rules by majority verdict.
First, the Dutch tried to write into the 11-country protocol some of the
compromises they floated during the Maastricht summit when they were still
trying to get Mr John Major, the British prime minister, on board. These
changes would have slightly curbed the scope for social policy action by the
11 countries.
Second, the Irish sought to rectify a quirk in the protocol's voting weights
which will make it harder to assemble a blocking minority among the 11.
Dublin privately shared a few of the UK government's reservations about EC
social policy. With unanimity required for any amendment, it was enough for
Belgium and Italy to object to the Dutch and Irish suggestions.
Curiously, Britain's partners all seem ready to put their pens to their
social protocol without first settling some of the wider legal questions it
gives rise to. But Mr David Williamson, the Commission's secretary general,
said this week that any laws passed under the 11-country protocol would be
standard EC law, and would have to be accepted by countries joining the EC.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Luck finally runs out for the great survivor of Irish
politics: A scandal too many led coalition partners to pull rug from under
Haughey - The downfall of Ireland's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'LIKE HIM or loathe him, it was impossible to ignore him. Irish politics
will certainly be duller without him as Taoiseach.' The 38-year political
career of Mr Charles Haughey, 12 of them as leader of his Fianna Fail party
and four times elected prime minister, was thus summed up yesterday by one
of Mr Haughey's arch opponents, Mr Prionsias de Rossa, the leader of the
Worker's Party.
The 'great survivor' of the Irish political scene, a self-made man who
seemed to thrive on controversy, Mr Haughey finally ran out of luck this
week, when a telephone-tapping scandal from nine years ago came back to
haunt him.
A former justice minister, Mr Sean Doherty, told an astonished press
conference last week, that Mr Haughey had been fully aware that two
journalists' telephones had been illegally bugged in an attempt to trace
cabinet leaks. Mr Haughey has always denied the allegations. But for the
Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in his coalition, the truth of
the allegations were no longer relevant. The government's credibility was at
stake, and they demanded he resign or face an election.
The incident was the culmination of a succession of scandals in which close
associates of Mr Haughey became embroiled in property and share-deals
involving state-run companies. Barely a week has gone by since last
September, without Mr Haughey having to defend himself against vitriolic
opposition attacks in the parliament over his alleged involvement. At one
point, an opposition deputy described him as 'looking like a lawyer
defending a poor brief'.
Last week the Progressive Democrats decided they had had enough.
Backbenchers and ministers in his party were equally nervous at the prospect
of an early general election. In the five elections since Mr Haughey became
party leader in 1979, an absolute parliamentary majority has eluded him,
forcing him into coalitions with which he has never been really comfortable.
Mr Des O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, praised the 1992 budget
presented on Wednesday by Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister. Mr Ahern is
a strong candidate to succeed Mr Haughey, and whether he decides to
challenge Mr Albert Reynolds, a former finance minister who is considered
the strongest candidate, or to throw his support behind him, the future of
the coalition is guaranteed.
Like Mrs Thatcher, with whom Mr Haughey crossed swords in 1985 over the
Anglo-Irish agreement (which he described as 'a sad day for Irish
nationalism), he will not be a comfortable figure on the backbenches. Last
year, following intense pressure to resign, he said 'growing roses is not
the same as a political career'.
He was even to adopt Thatcherite economic policies in the late-80s when he
regained the premiership, admitting that borrowing and budget deficits 'make
matters worse'. He hands on a financially-sound government. As a pragmatist
rather than an ideologue he even came to accept the Anglo-Irish agreement as
the framework for progress on Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, has sold its remaining 20 per cent
stake in Hollandse Signaalapparaten (HSA), the Dutch defence electronics
manufacturer, to Thomson-CSF of France, which bought an 80 per cent stake in
the company two years ago.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The price of the remaining 20 per cent
stake was fixed by both companies when the original deal was struck in 1990.
Philips said the transaction would not produce an extraordinary gain for its
1992 accounts because it had already booked the full value of HSA in the
first quarter of 1990 on the assumption that it would later divest the rest
of the subsidiary. In that quarter, the Dutch electronics group recorded
total extraordinary gains of Fl 330m, including not only HSA but also the
proceeds from divestments of the company's Belgian, French and German
defence interests.
HSA, based in the Dutch town of Hengelo, is a leading maker of military
telecommunications equipment and claims to be the European market leader in
naval command and control systems. It currently has an annual turnover of Fl
800m (Dollars 445m) and a workforce of 4,000. Two years ago, it generated
sales of Fl 900m with a staff of 5,300.
The sale of HSA completes Philips' full withdrawal from the European defence
electronics sector. Its only remaining defence electronics subsidiary is
Magiec of the US, which has an annual turnover equivalent to more than Fl
1bn. Despite several years of active searching, Philips has failed to find a
buyer for Magiec.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSIAL forestry agreement, signed last September by Honduras and
the Chicago-based paper company Stone Container Corporation, is in trouble
following a wave of protest.
The agreement was to have been ratified by the Honduran Congress today, but
the protests, from environmentalists and others, have caused worries in the
ruling National Party.
A supplementary agreement designed to answer protesters' concerns is under
discussion, but is unlikely to go to Congress before March.
Stone is expected to launch today a belated publicity campaign to try to win
support from sceptical Hondurans.
The agreement, still officially secret but widely leaked, involves a 40-year
concession to exploit between 125,000 and 1.6m hectares of pine forest in
the Mosquitia region of the undeveloped east for woodchip production. This
would supply Stone's US paper mills. It also contemplates construction of a
pulp mill in Honduras.
The government hopes the deal will generate Dollars 2m a year in export
revenues and up to 3,000 local jobs. The state-owned land is to be ceded
rent-free, with infrastructure provided. In return, Stone will supply
technical assistance to the government on sustainable forest exploitation
and pay normal logging fees.
Environmentalists are concerned that clear-cutting on the fragile hill
slopes will cause soil erosion and river silting, and that the possible
development of related paper production industries could bring chemical
pollution, undermining the potential of Mosquitia for ecotourism.
The deal represents a shift away from Honduran forestry policy of
privatising state sawmills and and promoting sustainable exploitation
through fiscal incentives to private operators.
Other legislation before Congress would scrap a requirement for 51 per cent
local participation in forest exploitation.

Amnesty International yesterday accused Cuba of threatening to increase
executions of political opponents and urged the government to abandon the
death penalty, Reuter reports from London.
'Over the last few weeks senior members of the (Cuban) government have been
suggesting that they may execute people they consider
'counter-revolutionaries',' the human rights group said in a statement.
One man had already been executed by firing squad this year after being
found guilty of planning to carry out acts of terrorism and sabotage, it
said. The man was believed to have been executed on January 20, just 23 days
after his arrest. The case was 'rushed through a legal system that makes
scant provision for adequate defence or impartial review of appeals', the
group said.
It said Vice-President Raul Castro had threatened to bring back
revolutionary courts, which sent scores to firing squads after the
revolution.

NEGOTIATIONS on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), linking the
US, Canada and Mexico, are moving at a rapid pace, but President Bush's
brief reference to the talks in his State of the Union message sent a signal
to political observers that he is still keeping his options open.
In an effort to secure a draft agreement before the end of the month, trade
negotiators from the three countries have planned an almost non-stop series
of meetings, culminating in a possible head-of-state reunion at the end of
February.
On Sunday, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, will head a
delegation to Mexico of congressmen and businessmen, and Mrs Hills will meet
with President Carlos Salinas. Next Tuesday, the chief trade negotiators
will meet in Ottawa, Canada; and next weekend the three trade ministers will
meet in Annapolis, Maryland. A further ministerial meeting has been
pencilled in for the end of February in Dallas, Texas.
Although the negotiators have remained tight-lipped where differences lie,
reports from Mexican newspapers suggest that negotiators have completed 15
draft chapters of the 18 in total.
These 15 chapters include brackets where important differences lie, but the
hope is that most, if not all, of the brackets will be removed at the
Annapolis meeting.
The negotiators appear not yet to have drawn up drafts on energy, cars and
agriculture, reflecting the extreme sensitivity with which these sectors are
treated in all three countries. The agreement on the agriculture chapter has
been held up by the uncertainty over the Gatt negotiations - although a
decision has been reached to draft an agreement on agriculture before the
Gatt round concludes.
Cars for the US and the Mexicans are perhaps the most critical sector. They
account for 20 per cent of Mexican exports, while support of the US auto
makers for Nafta may be essential if the agreement is to pass the US
Congress.
Recent reports in the Mexican press suggest energy may have become a
sticking point.
This whirlwind of activity received only a passing mention from the
President last Tuesday - but the Gatt Uruguay Round received none.
'In our major trade negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate
tariffs and subsidies that damage America's farmers and workers,' he said.
'And we'll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the
North American Free Trade Agreement, and through the Enterprise for the
Americas Initiative.' The latter was President Bush's initiative in 1990 to
speed economic integration in the Americas, opening up the possibility of a
hemispheric free trade zone.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Machinery and plant orders rise in west Germany

<TEXT>
ORDERS for west German plant and machinery rose last month for the first
time in a year, the VDMA manufacturers' association said yesterday. Export
demand was 3 per cent higher and German orders were 4 per cent up in real
terms on December 1990, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn.
The aggregate 4 per cent rise was one bright spot in a year in which the
value of orders fell 8 per cent. However, the VDMA said it was too soon to
say if the decline, especially in overseas markets, had stopped. Foreign
demand for the year was 17 per cent down in real terms.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Final text agreed of EC union treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC governments yesterday received the final version of the Maastricht treaty
on European union for signature next week, after vain Dutch and Irish
attempts to alter aspects of the controversial social policy protocol agreed
by Britain's 11 partners.
Negotiated at last month's Maastricht summit, the 'treaty on union' is
likely to be signed on February 7 in Maastricht at a meeting of foreign and
finance ministers.
The past month, spent in cleaning up the text for signature, has produced a
treaty whose substance is virtually identical to that agreed by EC leaders
on December 11.
But it has also revealed some Dutch and Irish nervousness about the social
protocol, designed to bypass the UK government's rooted objection to passing
more EC labour rules by majority verdict.
First, the Dutch tried to write into the 11-country protocol some of the
compromises they floated during the Maastricht summit when they were still
trying to get Mr John Major, the British prime minister, on board. These
changes would have slightly curbed the scope for social policy action by the
11 countries.
Second, the Irish sought to rectify a quirk in the protocol's voting weights
which will make it harder to assemble a blocking minority among the 11.
Dublin privately shared a few of the UK government's reservations about EC
social policy. With unanimity required for any amendment, it was enough for
Belgium and Italy to object to the Dutch and Irish suggestions.
Curiously, Britain's partners all seem ready to put their pens to their
social protocol without first settling some of the wider legal questions it
gives rise to. But Mr David Williamson, the Commission's secretary general,
said this week that any laws passed under the 11-country protocol would be
standard EC law, and would have to be accepted by countries joining the EC.

FT  31 JAN 92 / Italy lets Sud Tyrol have more autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918 may well be viewed
by historians as one of the main causes of today's violent ethnic conflicts
in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
But a decision yesterday by the Italian government to allow the
German-speaking Sud Tyroleans more autonomy may inject a glimmer of hope
into the belief that disputes over ethnicity and autonomy can be solved
peacefully.
Indeed, the civil war in neighbouring Yugoslavia might have provided Rome
with the impetus to settle at least one of its ethnic disputes.
Until 1919, when the Paris Peace Conference supervised the break-up of the
Habsburg Empire, the German-speaking region, which at that time had only
8,000 Italians, was ruled from Imperial Vienna.
After 1919, Sud Tyrol was annexed to Italy, which tried to populate it with
southern Italians. Today, over 70 per cent of its 440,000 inhabitants are
German-speaking.
Yet despite economic prosperity, coupled with Rome's decision to extend
autonomy to language, newspapers, schools and courts, the Sud Tyroleans
never quite got used to the idea of Italian rule. Nor did they like the idea
of paying their taxes to Rome.
Above all, the Sud Tyroleans resented Rome's refusal to allow their autonomy
to be guaranteed internationally. That, at least, was what agreed in 1946
between Vienna and Rome on the understanding that Sud Tyrol would not claim
the right to self-determination if its autonomy was internationally
recognised.
Italy saw the issue as a purely bilateral affair, Austria said it would be
the protective power of Sud Tyrol in every respect, while the Sud Tyroleans
flung bombs at Italian targets in the 1960s to press home their case.
That made Rome sit up. Under an agreement reached with Vienna in 1972, and
to be implemented by 1974, more autonomy was extended. Barring the
recognition that its autonomy would be internationally recognised, Rome
yesterday made further concessions.
A peaceful outcome might well disabuse the pessimists that ethnicity,
nationalism and autonomy does not necessarily lead to bloodshed, or the
violent break-up of states.

FT  31 JAN 92 / 'Slow bills' cited by bankrupt Euro Disney sub-contractor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTINUING row over sub-contractors' claims that Euro Disney has been too
slow in paying their bills came to a head yesterday, with one of the
claimants filing for bankruptcy. Roiret, a Lyons-based business specialising
in electronics and audiovisuals, alleged the bankruptcy was precipitated by
unpaid bills, notably from Euro Disney which plans to open the Euro
Disneyland theme park on April 12.
Roiret's collapse comes only a week after Le Tendre et Sautiere, a
Saint-Nazaire-based construction company, sued Euro Disney for the FFr10m
(Pounds 1.02m) it claimed it was owed for its work at the park.
It also follows the formation of a lobby of 16 disgruntled Euro Disney
sub-contractors, claiming to represent 300 different companies, to try to
extract better terms of payment from the company.
For its part, Euro Disney claims the complaints are unfounded. It issued a
statement yesterday denying responsibility for Roiret's problems, adding
that it hoped to find an 'amicable solution' with its sub-contractors.
The sub-contractors' troubles are linked to the depressed state of the
French construction industry, where small and medium-sized companies are
finding life particularly tough. Moreover, the French press has seized upon
any rumblings of discontent at the theme park with even more than its usual
ferocity.
The lobby group has threatened to step up its campaign, possibly by staging
demonstrations, unless it reaches an agreement with Euro Disney by the
middle of next month.

FT  30 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Initial losses in equities soon
reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market bounced back from early losses yesterday, with firmness
in sterling and a promising start on Wall Street helping offset the mild
disappointment which had greeted President Bush's State of the Union
message. Equity trading in London remained unimpressive but UK opinion polls
continued to favour the electoral prospects of Mr John Major's government,
and the late improvement in sterling revived optimism for an early cut in
domestic base rates.
The FT-SE Index closed at 2,546.5, with the final loss of 5.5 on the day
representing a two-thirds recovery from the initial setback. Equities gave
ground in early trading in London, brushing off Wall Street's peak close
overnight, which had preceded President Bush's speech.
While the UK market was keeping a close eye on Wall Street, investment
confidence also continued to suffer from the pessimistic tone of the latest
business opinion survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which
indicated a big fall in confidence among UK businessmen.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew commented that the survey implied that weakening in the
supply side of the UK economy 'bodes ill' for the trade performance when
domestic activity recovers. Nor was there any relief yesterday from the
steady flow of corporate profits downgradings for leading UK companies by
City analysts.
The big investment funds backed off from equities yesterday, and the Seaq
network reported volume of 549.7m shares, little changed from Tuesday's
551.8m; retail volume on Tuesday totalled an unexciting Pounds 952m.
The reduction in institutional demand for UK equities is believed to reflect
the uncertainties introduced by the apparent opening of the UK election
season, which has brought increased focus on day to day opinion poll
readings.
Utility stocks, seen as at risk in the event of a Labour election victory,
again responded strongly to the apparent improvement in the government's
opinion ratings. However, many international blue chips were held back by
weakness in the US dollar in which many of their profits are recorded.
The exception was Fisons, the pharmaceutical group whose shares have traced
an erratic pattern recently but have now attracted speculative support
again. Elsewhere among the drug stocks, Wellcome provided one of the few
firm spots, while Glaxo continued to react from the strong performance
during the early sessions of this year.
The Footsie Index was held back towards the close by a dull showing from the
leading oil stocks, with Shell running into a bout of international selling
in late dealings.
However, sluggish turnover in the stock market in no way inhibited the
institutions from activity elsewhere in the City of London. Both First
Leisure, Britain's largest leisure industry company, and Medeva, the
pharmaceutical group, featured in strongly attended presentations to fund
managers hosted by UK brokerage houses.
Stock market analysts continued to pursue policies of stock and sector
selection, rather than trying to predict the general outlook for equities.
At Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, Sushil Wadhwani recommended a high
relative yield strategy and recommended food retailing, life assurance,
aerospace and electronics stocks.

FT  30 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities follow fall in bonds
on Fed chairman's remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER investors had largely ignored Tuesday night's State of the Union
address, a big decline in bond prices knocked US stock markets out of their
stride yesterday, leaving share prices sharply lower, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 47.18 at 3,224.96.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 retreated 4.62 to 410.34, while the Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks ended 4.98 off at 616.31. Turnover on
the New York SE was a substantial 249m shares.
Expectations had been high that Mr Bush would unveil a range of economically
stimulating measures in his speech to Congress, but in the event the package
of reductions in defence spending and tax cuts proved a disappointment.
After opening lower, however, prices gained ground steadily throughout the
morning and by early afternoon blue chips were in record territory. But a
sudden plunge in bond prices, prompted by comments from the Federal Reserve
chairman which appeared to rule out further interest rate cuts, sparked a
rush of selling in mid-afternoon.
Computer program trading added to the downward pressure, and by the close
the market had recorded its biggest one-day setback since the strong rally
began more than a month ago.
Most of the leading stocks which rose in the morning were swamped by the
late wave of sellers and ended lower. Philip Morris was a case in point.
Having climbed more than Dollars 2 at one stage on news of a healthy
increase in fourth-quarter earnings, the shares eventually stood Dollars
1/2 off on the day at Dollars 75 3/4 .
Du Pont also suffered a turnround, closing a net Dollars  1/8 easier at
Dollars 48 5/8 in the wake of a fourth-quarter 36 cents a share loss, which
included a series of restructuring-related charges totalling more than
Dollars 700m.
Bethlehem Steel, which has benefited in recent weeks from heavy demand for
cyclical stocks, dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 13 3/4 on news of a big
fourth-quarter loss, the omission of its 10 cents quarterly dividend, and a
plan to reduce the workforce by 6,500. In the same sector, Armco tumbled
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 4 7/8 after revealing a fourth-quarter deficit in
the wake of charges and warning that it may lose more money in 1992.
Black &amp; Decker initially rose more than Dollars 1 in the wake of a 'buy'
recommendation from securities house Salomon Brothers. Several Wall Street
analysts had posted positive comments about B &amp; D after the company
introduced a new line of power tools to the investment community in New York
on Tuesday, but the shares succumbed to selling and finished Dollars  1/8
off at Dollars 21 3/4 .
Russell Corp was a rare stock to buck the trend, climbing Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 38 5/8 on reports that analysts have forecast that the athletic wear
producer has plenty of room for further growth and that its share price will
continue to post solid gains throughout the year.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices moved down in unison with the afternoon Wall Street
setback. The composite index closed 24.6 off at 3,598.6 as declining issues
outnumbered advances by 319 to 297. Volume amounted to 27.8m shares.
Inco fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 36 7/8 after reporting a fourth-quarter
loss of USDollars 5.8m, or 7 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net
of Dollars 72.6m, or 68 cents.
American Barrick, off CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 31 1/2 , said it and Newmont
Gold have agreed in principle to co-operate in developing their common areas
in the northern sector of the Carlin Trend in Nevada.
Bramalea eased CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 5 1/8 . Dominion Bond Rating
Service downgraded its senior debentures, preferred shares and commercial
paper.

FT  30 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses retreat as Bush speech
fails to impress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BOURSES moved lower yesterday on profit-taking, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT made a technical correction. After a 1.65 decline to 680.93 in the
FAZ at midsession, the DAX closed 10.68 lower at 1,672.40 as volume rose
from DM5.9bn to DM6.4bn.
Carmakers lost what they had gained on Tuesday, since the State of the Union
speech from the US president, Mr George Bush, contained nothing of the
rumoured repeal, or cut in the US tax on luxury cars. Daimler fell DM5.70 to
DM746 and Porsche by DM16 to DM595.
Deutsche Bank also lost what it had gained in London after hours on Tuesday,
after it raised its dividend from DM14 to DM15. It closed at DM700, down
DM4.50 on the day and DM7.70 from its London price on Tuesday.
Chemicals were weak after a recent improvement, while steels fell by more
than average as they awaited strike ballot news. Retailers were mixed, with
some authorities expecting first-half stagnation and others saying that the
winter sales, which started on Monday, were going well.
ZURICH extended Tuesday afternoon's adverse London reaction to the
downgrading of Credit Suisse long-term debt by Moody's, the ratings agency,
which also put Swiss Bank Corp on its watchlist.
The SPI index fell 10.4 to 1,108.7, and bearer shares in SBC topped the
active list as they fell SFr19 to SFr292. CS Holding, the parent of Credit
Suisse, had already discounted the downgrading and its bearers fell SFr5
from the London overnight price to SFr1,905.
STOCKHOLM dropped after the cabinet's rejection of the proposed
Volvo-Procordia merger. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 9.6 to 973.7
and Volvo B by another SKr5 to SKr385. A story that the deal was a precursor
to a merger between Volvo and Renault of France hit general sentiment.
Ericsson B fell SKr5 to SKr124 and Electrolux B by SKr6 to SKr242.
The forestry sector was the biggest loser, down 2.2 per cent. Dealers
attributed the decline to the fall in the dollar, which affects the
profitability of exported paper and pulp.
PARIS tried to turn higher after a mixed start but was hit by an uncertain
opening on Wall Street. The CAC 40 index fell 10.96 to 1,879.64, in turnover
of FFr2.4bn.
Paribas, which is backing the construction company Fougerolle's bid for SAE,
fell FFr12.50 or 3.4 per cent to FFr355. Lagarge-Coppee fell FFr7.6 to
FFr323 on rumours of a costly dispute with minority shareholders in its
Spanish subsidiary Asland.
Takeover speculation in the drinks sector lifted Pernod-Ricard by FFr40 to
FFr1,495.
MILAN closed little changed as early gains inspired by Tuesday's record
close on Wall Street were wiped out by profit-taking. The Comit index eased
0.24 to 545.07 in turnover estimated at close to Tuesday's L87bn.
Olivetti fell L70 or 2.6 per cent to L2,665 in thin volume, in response to
news of a partnership between France's Bull and IBM.
Fiat hardly reacted to its 1991 preliminary results announced after the
close on Tuesday. Its ordinary shares closed L41 higher at L5,161, but then
tumbled to L5,070 after hours. Fiat's results prompted some analysts to
issue sell notes. James Capel said that there was a real risk that the
dividend would be cut, and that with a 1991 earnings multiple of 41.5 and a
probably unsustainable historic yield of 7.1 per cent, the shares looked
substantially overvalued.
AMSTERDAM fell back in moderate trading, with the CBS Tendency Index down
0.9 to 121.1. DAF rose Fl 0.60 or 2.5 per cent to Fl 24.80 on car industry
talk that the truck manufacturer was a possible takeover candidate. Elsevier
rose Fl 1.80 to Fl Fl 103.00 as some analysts took a view that the publisher
was undervalued. Nedlloyd pulled back Fl 1.20 to Fl 58.70 as the fun sparked
by Tuesday's supervisory board appointments wore off. Fokker closed
unchanged at Fl 30.0 in spite of earlier activity on reports that one of its
aircraft was being considered by SAS.
MADRID firmed during early trading but closed weaker, the general index down
1.19 at 253.87. Asland, the cement group, shed Pta100 to Pta2,105 on rumours
of a dispute. The construction group Ocisa put on Pta350 to Pta4,550 on news
of the takeover bid for SAE in which it holds a 15 per cent stake.
ISTANBUL fell slightly in a continued correction after gains on Monday when
the index rose above 5,100. The 75-share index closed at 4,983.25, down
36.35.

The 225-issue Nikkei lost 28.26 to 21,362.26. A higher futures market and
the overnight strength on Wall Street encouraged buying at the start, and
the index firmed to the day's high of 21,581.02 on small-lot bargain
hunting. However, buying interest failed to continue, and index-linked
selling by arbitrageurs later pushed the Nikkei to the session's low of
21,218.06.
Volume rose slightly to 180m shares from 160m, but remained below 200m
shares for the fourth consecutive trading day. Overall advances led
declines, however, by 469 to 408, with 218 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks was left with a minor gain of 1.26 at 1,584.73,
and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.29 to 1,222.04.
Foreigners turned net sellers, but some traders said European fund managers
were waiting to commit funds into the Tokyo market. 'Foreign investors want
to see an end to the volatility before they come in,' said Mr Chris Newton
at James Capel.
Bio-technology issues were sought on a government survey released on Tuesday
indicating the number of people infected with Aids in Japan grew last year
by 2.5 times the previous year's level. Revived popularity in companies
developing Aids drugs pushed Meiji Milk Products ahead Y17 to Y897 and Meiji
Seika up Y47 to Y845.
Buying spread to other pharmaceuticals, with Takeda Chemical firming Y10 to
Y1,260 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical appreciating Y30 to Y1,380.
Mitsui, the trading company, gained Y10 to Y690 on news that it had won a
contract to explore and develop oil and gas reserves off Sakhalin with two
US concerns. Other resource-related issues were also firm, with Teikoku Oil
advancing Y19 to Y754 and Arabian Oil Y120 to Y5,160 on reports of their
acquisition of oil deposits rights in Vietnam.
Some high-technology issues were lower on profit-taking. Sharp, a component
stock of the Nikkei 225, dipped Y30 to Y1,320 on arbitrage unwinding.
Hitachi fell Y9 to Y911 on light selling by foreign investors.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, climbed Y300 to Y12,900. Investors
were encouraged by the company's estimated 60 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits for this fiscal year. Nintendo rose Y200 to Y10,600 on the Osaka
market.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 84.80 to 22,789.70 in volume of 133.4m
shares. Buying of small-capital issues pushed up the index, but turnover
jumped due to heavy cross-trading ahead of the March book-closing.
Roundup
HONG KONG remained active, while other Pacific Rim markets were mixed.
Australia was affected by inflation figures.
HONG KONG took heart from a statement by Chinese premier Li Peng that China
was proceeding with economic liberalisation, although this was not reflected
in the market's close. The Hang Seng index ended 15.20 off at 4,571.13 after
an early rise was reversed by profit-taking.
The banking sector was lifted by strong fourth-quarter results from Marine
Midland Bank, a US subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, which added
50 cents at HKDollars 37.25. Bank of East Asia results are due today, with a
22 per cent profits rise expected.
AUSTRALIA had the All Ordinaries index down 3.8 at 1,622.1. The bond market,
weak for the last two weeks, was sold lower in spite of news that December's
consumer price index rose only 0.9 per cent, taking the annual rate to 1.5
per cent, the lowest increase for 28 years. A portfolio of some ADollars
50m, 15 to 20 per cent of total turnover, also hung over the market. The
banking sector weakened after ANZ announced its long-awaited rights issue:
it dropped 17 cents to ADollars 4.20, while Westpac declined 7 cents to
ADollars 4.10.
SEOUL fell again on profit-taking. The composite index dipped 6.68 to 659.28
in turnover of Won363bn (Won417bn). Trading was quiet ahead of next week's
Chinese new year.
KUALA LUMPUR saw interest in Telekom Malaysia which pushed the composite
index up 3.44 to 573.28. Telekom rose 30 cents to MDollars 10.50.
BANGKOK finished mixed, although there was heavy buying in property shares
which pushed the SET index 1.84 higher to 768.57 in turnover of Bt6.32bn.
The banking sector was also active, with two banks reporting better than
expected annual results.
TAIWAN was boosted by a strong financial sector. The weighted index moved up
77.38 to 5,390.05 in turnover of TDollars 53bn, after TDollars 49.8bn. The
plastics sector was active on news that a petrochemical project had been
approved.
NEW ZEALAND was untouched by Wall Street's gains. The NZSE-40 was down 8.25
to 1,468.55. Fay Richwhite, which is backing New Zealand's America's Cup
entry, rose 4 cents to NZDollars 98.
BOMBAY recorded its fifth record high this month. The BSE rose 42.11 to
2,214.22.
JAKARTA closed sharply higher on a strong industrial sector. The Jardine
Fleming index gained 2.9 or 5.1 per cent to 59.45. KARACHI continued to
fall, the 100-share index dropping 46.57 to 1,395.74.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar weak on economic woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar continued to trade lower yesterday on the foreign exchange
markets as dealers digested the contents of the US budget package and the
bleak outlook for the US economy, writes Simon London.
Having closed sharply weaker in New York following the release of poor
consumer confidence indicators on Tuesday, the US currency fell further
overnight in the Far East. By the end of Tokyo trading the dollar stood at
DM1.5895, from DM1.5997 in New York, and Y125.17, from Y125.79.
In European trading, the dollar appeared to regain its poise, rising from
early lows at DM1.5840 and Y124.75. But poor economic figures again
contributed to a negative tone, preventing any sustained rally.
US gross domestic product rose by just 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of
last year, from 1.8 per cent in the third quarter, underlining the weakness
of the economy.
Details of the US budget package for the next fiscal year underlined that
lower interest rates rather than tax cuts or government spending hold the
key to recovery. The budget contains reflationary fiscal measures amounting
to Dollars 20bn to Dollars 25bn, rather than the Dollars 50bn injection
which some economists had called for.
The US currency closed in London at DM1.5900, from DM1.5965 on Tuesday;
Y125.40 from Y125.60; and Dollars 1.8065 against sterling from Dollars
1.7955. In New York the dollar improved to finish at DM1.6020, Y125.75, and
Dollars 1.7980 per pound.
Elsewhere, the D-Mark continued to rally against the yen as traders unwound
holdings of the Japanese currency built up last week, ahead of the meeting
of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial
countries. The G7 meeting was widely expected to declare in favour of a
controlled appreciation of the yen, but no concrete exchange rate policy
emerged.
The German currency rose to a peak just above Y79, having hovered at around
Y77 for most of last week. By the close in London the D-Mark was trading at
Y78.95.
In addition to technical strength, the German unit is also attracting buyers
on the basis of high interest rate differentials with the US. Money supply
figures released on Tuesday and hard-line comments by Bundesbank board
member Mr Otmar Issing have dispelled any worries about an early reduction
in German interest rates.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the peseta remained the
strongest currency and sterling the weakest. But the peseta did not carry
forward its recent appreciation against the D-Mark and traded around the
Pta63.00 level for most of the day.
This left sterling's floor, determined by its maximum permitted divergence
from the peseta, little changed. The UK currency maintained a buoyant tone,
with dealers encouraged by the publication of an opinion poll showing a
slender lead for the government. The pound ended at DM2.8725, from DM2.8675
on Tuesday.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates edge down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK MONEY market conditions were easier again yesterday, as the heavy
taxation payments which drained funds from the financial system earlier in
the month subsided, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of just Pounds 100m early
in the session, revised up to Pounds 200m later but very low compared with
daily shortages of over Pounds 1bn for most of the year to date. The main
factor yesterday was maturing assistance, draining Pounds 678m from the
market. However, Exchequer transactions added Pounds 690m.
There was no clamour for funds in the slacker market conditions and the Bank
of England refrained from early assistance. Later in the morning it
purchased Pounds 40m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Late assistance amounted to Pounds 10m, bringing the total liquidity
injection for the day to Pounds 50m, which was Pounds 150m less than the
forecast shortage.
The unsecured overnight money rate was steady at around 11 per cent for most
of the day and it finished at 10 7/8 - 5/8 per cent.
Longer rates were also little changed. Three months inter-bank funds traded
at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent, slightly easier than the 10- 9/16 per cent seen on
Tuesday. One month interbank money was 10- 5/8 per cent, also a touch
easier.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange closed at 89.81, virtually unaltered, implying base lending
rates of 10.19 per cent by the spring.
In Frankfurt, call money rates moved higher again, continuing the trend set
earlier in the week. Call money touched 9.70 per cent but settled at around
9.60/70 per cent for most of the day.
The Bundesbank again used special powers to transfer funds held on deposit
for the public sector to commercial banks. Similar action was taken on
Tuesday and last Friday as the authorities attempted to hold down rates.
Pension payments are draining cash from the market this week and putting
upward pressure on rates.
In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan injected Y900bn funds in the face of a Y1,000bn
liquidity shortage. As a result call money traded up to 5 3/4 per cent, from
5 9/16 on Tuesday.
Three months certificates of deposit traded at around 5.10 per cent,
climbing from the 4.95 per cent seen at the end of last week.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders bearish on outlook for
cotton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COTTON FUTURES prices, after two days of hovering near life-of-contract
lows, saw a tiny rally after yesterday morning's open at the New York Cotton
Exchange. But with the market virtually awash with cotton and world demand
diminishing, the outlook was for continued downward pressure on prices.
The March spot month contract at NYCE rose yesterday morning to 53.65 cents
a lb, up from Tuesday's close of 53.38 cents a lb. The May contract crept up
to 55.55 cents from its previous close of 55.37 cents. The rises were
considered to be technical with a little bit of profit taking.
Some market observers were waiting to see how much cotton American farmers
would place in the US Department of Agriculture's loan programme. The USDA
takes farmers' cotton, paying them a set amount as a interest-free loan and
storing the cotton for ten months without charge. Farmers can redeem the
cotton if prices rise or forfeit it if they do not.
If a lot of US cotton had been put into the loan programme, it would have
created an artificial tightness in the market, prompting prices to rise a
little. But only 4.3m bales are currently in the programme out of a 17.5m
bale crop, and this has had virtually no effect on market sentiment.
International market factors are perhaps weighing on prices even more
heavily, say cotton analysts. China, which has its second largest crop ever
in 1991-92, has switched from being a net importer to being a net exporter.
According to the secretariat of the International Cotton Advisory committee,
China, which had been a net importer of 280,000 tonnes last year, is
expected to become a net exporter of 60,000 tons this year. Cotton is also
pouring on to the market from the republics of the former Soviet Union,
which need hard currency. They have also been supplying cotton in barter
deals with trading companies, the committee reported.
The Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union and Paraguay have
also aggressively and repeatedly cut cotton prices since last summer,
according to Ms Sharon Johnson, a cotton analyst with Cargill Investor
Services.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trade row looms over US
dolphin-friendly tuna policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US appears set on a collision course with Japan and the European
Community over its restrictions on tuna imports.
A San Francisco federal court called this week for strict enforcement of a
ban on the import of tuna caught using methods that inflict heavy casualties
on associated dolphin, a ruling that will highlight the controversy over
whether the US has the right to interfere with trade in this way and sharpen
the conflict between trade and environmental priorities.
It is also bound to fuel the fierce opposition of US environmental groups to
proposed reforms in world trade being negotiated in the Uruguay Round of
trade negotiations.
The US Department of Commerce, which is trapped between US law that insists
on the ban and a ruling by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that
outlaws it, has asked for a stay of the court ruling.
An initial ban in February last year included both primary exporters of tuna
to the US - mainly Mexico, Venezuela and Vanuatu - and a list of 27 other
countries which buy tuna and resell it to the US.
Mexican tuna fishermen, unlike their US counterparts, fish in the eastern
tropical Pacific, where for unknown reasons, schools of yellowfish tuna swim
below dolphin herds. US tuna boats fish near New Guinea, where dolphins stay
apart from the predominantly albacore and skipjack tuna.
The Earth Island Institute, which has been responsible for pressing the
issue into US courts, claims that the Mexican tuna boats killed about 50,000
dolphins this year. US officials say 15,000 is nearer the truth.
The institute brought the latest action because enforcement of the ban on
secondary countries, who are accused of 'laundering dolphin-unsafe tuna',
has been lax. The San Francisco federal court has given these countries
until Friday to provide certificates proving they were not re-exporting
Mexican or Venezuelan tuna. Prominent among the new targets are Japan,
Italy, Spain and France.
The ban is anyway outlawed by a Gatt panel ruling following a complaint from
Mexico to the Geneva-based international trade body.
Mexico's argument that the US action was an unfair obstacle to trade was
upheld by the Gatt - not out of a callous unconcern for the plight of
dolphins, but because of the 'extraterritorial' nature of the action: Gatt
said the US 'may not restrict imports of a product merely because it
originates in a country with environmental policies different from its own'.
The ruling inflamed a wide range of environmental groups in the US, who saw
the action as symptomatic of an inherent conflict between the demands of
free trade and a country's right to enforce strict environmental standards.
Environmental lobbyists are also becoming increasingly alarmed at the
prospect of hard-won protection being undermined by the decisions of what
they see as anonymous trade officials in Geneva who are not answerable to
any elected body.
These concerns have led a coalition of 28 US environmental groups being
formed to call for the rejection of the Uruguay round of proposed world
trade reforms. A fiercely-contested draft agreement was released in late
December after six years of tortuous negotiation.
An irony as the tuna war erupts afresh is that Mexico, which launched the
initial protest against US action, has dropped actions against its northern
neighbour, and has acted to change its fishing methods to reduce the danger
to dolphins. The Mexican government is anxious to seal a free trade
agreement with the US and Canada, and was unwilling to see this row
undermine the prospects of success.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Central bank sales 'may weigh
down gold market'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD PRODUCERS should not rely too heavily on the present fall in mine
output to push the price up from current levels. Much will depend on the
future action of the Central Banks who between them hold 35,619 tonnes,
equivalent to 17 years' production of the indestructible metal.
It is reasonable to expect the banks to become net sellers of about 700
tonnes a year from the mid-1990s, suggests Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the
Union Bank of Switzerland, in his latest quarterly Precious Metals Outlook.
He points out that gold's monetary role is 'now history for private
investors and central banks. Selling gold would be just part of a day's work
for a central bank, not an admission that the financial world as investors
know it was about to end'.
Mr Smith says that if the eight countries which between them account for
more than 85 per cent of central bank gold were to sell all their gold and
reinvest the proceeds in interest-bearing paper, the combined annual return,
in perpetuity, would be Dollars 21bn.
'On a per capita basis, the annual dividend would be impressive enough to
catch the eye of even the most well-to-do taxpayer,' he adds.
There is no suggestion that central banks would take this course but they
are certainly under increasing pressure to include gold sales in their 'gold
mobilisation' policies, says Mr Smith.
For example, as part of a recent revised treatment of US net international
indebtedness, the US Commerce Department revalued that country's gold
reserves at market prices rather than the still official Dollars 42 a troy
ounce. 'Clearly, an unrealised asset value of over Dollars 80bn has not
completely escaped US official attention.'
Mr Smith also points out that, if the course towards true European monetary
union runs smooth, before the year 2000 a single European central bank will
control 40 per cent of the world's official gold reserves - 11,600 tonnes
now in EC members' vaults plus nearly 3,000 tonnes in the European Monetary
Co-operation Fund.
'A single European currency reduces the principle need for reserves of any
kind - intervention in currency markets. A Eurobank could economise on all
reserves,' he adds. 'Seeing this, EC member states could even make
pre-emptive strikes, liquidating gold and currency reserves to the benefit
of taxpayers before the ink is dry on Eurobank statutes.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barrick and Newmont agree on
development of Nevada deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN BARRICK and Newmont Gold, after failing to consummate a merger last
year, have signed an agreement in principle to co-operate in developing
their properties in the northern sector of Nevada's rich Carlin Trend gold
deposit. The chief executives of the two companies said yesterday that the
agreement 'effectively realises many of the benefits' identified during last
year's abortive merger talks. Final details of the pact are expected to be
completed soon.
It includes development of the Deep and Lower Post ore body adjacent to
Barrick's Goldstrike mine, as well as exploration and development along
common property boundaries, and sharing of Newmont's bioleaching technology.
The Post body straddles the border between the two companies' properties and
contains an estimated 9m troy ounces of gold. Barrick has agreed to expand
its existing Betze pit at Goldstrike to include Deep and Lower Post. The
expanded pit will be known as the Betze-Post pit.
Stripping of the expanded area is due to start next year, and mining of most
of the Deep and Lower Post ore will begin in 1997.
Mining of the Post body will also give access to 580,000 ounces of gold from
near-surface material on Newmont land.
Until now, neither company has shown gold from the Deep and Lower Post body
in its production forecasts. Newmont owns 5m ounces of the Post deposit,
while Barrick's share is about 4m ounces.
The companies plan to share the costs of mining the Deep and Lower Post
reserves in proportion to benefits received. Production costs will thus be
the same for both companies.
They said that an agreement for joint exploration and sharing of data will
enable 'rapid and economic development' of new discoveries along common
boundaries.

bond offering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
COCA-COLA Enterprises (CCE), the leading US bottler of Coca-Cola which is 44
per cent owned by the parent company, yesterday sold Dollars 1.5bn of bonds,
one of the largest US corporate bond issues of the past 12 months, writes
Alan Friedman in New York.
Salomon Brothers, the sole manager of the bond offer, said Dollars 550m of
the proceeds will be used in a tender offer to buy back senior and
subordinated notes issued by Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling, a unit of CCE. The
remaining Dollars 950m will be used to redeem other CCE debt.
The CCE offer, priced yesterday, was supposed to consist of Dollars 1bn of
10 and 30-year notes. Strong demand resulted in the issue being expanded to
include Dollars 500m of 10-year notes, Dollars 250m of 20-year paper and
Dollars 750m of 30-year bonds.
The 10-year paper, with a 7.875 per cent coupon, was priced at par, as was
the 20-year issue, with a coupon of 8.50 per cent. The 30-year bonds, was
priced at 98.83 to yield 8.61 per cent.
These pricings represent, respectively, spreads of 68, 78 and 89 basis
points above US Treasury bonds of comparable maturities.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries sharply lower as hopes of rate
cuts fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMENTS from US Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan which appeared
to dash hopes of further interest rate cuts left bond prices sharply lower
yesterday at the end of a volatile day's trading.
By the late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 31/32
at 102 15/16 , yielding 7.742 per cent. The two-year note was also lower,
down  1/16 at 99 17/32 , yielding 5.108 per cent.
After worrying Mr Bush might announce extensive tax cut proposals in his
State of the Union speech to Congress on Tuesday night, bond investors were
relieved that the measures outlined were relatively modest, and by midday
prices were higher across the board. The realisation that Mr Bush's fiscal
fine-tuning would still leave the Federal deficit at a record Dollars 399bn
in 1992, was not so warmly received.
The market took a sudden downturn mid-afternoon after Mr Greenspan told the
Senate Banking Committee that monetary policy was probably loose enough
already to produce an economic recovery. Prices were also pressured by a
fresh injection of corporate debt. Investors and dealers have been loaded
down with new corporate debt recently, leaving them with less of an appetite
for Treasury securities.
ACTIVITY in the UK government bond market yesterday was dominated by the
Bank of England's auction of Pounds 1.8bn of 10-year gilts.
The average accepted bid for the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 was 102 5/32 ,
yielding 9.42 per cent, while the lowest accepted bid was 102 3/32 ,
yielding 9.43 per cent. Bids amounted to Pounds 3.64bn, giving a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2.02. Traders said the demand was better than
expected, particularly from foreign investors keen on buying the 10-year
sector.
The Liffe bund futures contract slipped from its opening of 97.20 to 97.17
while the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 was unchanged on the
day at 115 15/16 .
THE German government bond market fell as bondholders took profits and
switched out of short-dated bund issues.
The market kicked off on a firm note, taking its cue from the US Treasury
bond market which was strong overnight. But, the Liffe bund futures contract
later fell from its opening of 88.55 to trade at 88.36 by late afternoon, as
traders noted some switching out of short-dated issues on fears that German
interest rates are likely to remain high for some time. The announcement of
western German cost of living figures also prompted some profit-taking. The
cost of living was 0.5 per cent higher in January and was up 4.0 per cent on
January 1991.
The Dutch Ministry of Finance closed its latest offering of the 8.25 per
cent 15-year tap issue after raising Fl 5.5bn. The Finance Ministry said the
average price of the 15-year bonds in the offering was 99.58 with a yield of
8.30 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds ended firmer, taking their lead from the strength
of the US Treasury bond market.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 bond moved from its opening level of 5.25
per cent to close at 5.23 per cent, despite a rise in short-term interest
rates. The rate on three-month certificates of deposit rose to 5.10 per cent
from 5.07 per cent on Tuesday, while the unsecured call money rate rose by
5/32 to 5 23/32 per cent.
The Finance Ministry sold Y472.64bn of 5.5 per cent 10-year government bonds
at an average price of 100.82 yielding 5.373 per cent. Although a total of
Y800bn of the 10-year issue was offered for sale, as usual 60 per cent is
placed through the auction while the remainder is sold through the
underwriters' syndicate.

INCO, the world's largest nickel producer, suffered a fourth-quarter loss
and an 81 per cent drop in earnings for 1991.
The setback was due mainly to lower metal prices and higher production
costs. The company spent USDollars 31m in after-tax severance costs last
year. Earnings for the year were Dollars 82.6m, or 74 cents a share, down
from Dollars 441.2m, or Dollars 4.18, in 1990. Revenues fell to Dollars
3.05bn from Dollars 3.34bn.
The fourth-quarter loss was Dollars 5.8m, compared with earnings of Dollars
72.6m a year earlier. Sales and other revenues dipped to Dollars 710.3m from
Dollars 870.3m.

Unisys and Motorola have expanded their collaboration in chip technology
development, manufacturing and design by entering a semiconductor technology
alliance, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
Motorola, the largest US semiconductor manufacturer, is a main supplier to
Unisys, the US computer group. Under the agreement Unisys and Motorola will
jointly define new chip production process and design technologies for
customised chips for Unisys mainframe computer systems.
Unisys said it would phase out its last chip-making operation, in
California, making the it the largest computer manufacturer to rely entirely
on outside sources for its semiconductor supplies.

A DECLINE in advertising revenues, especially in classified advertisments,
was yesterday cited by Knight-Ridder, the third largest US newspaper chain,
as a key reason for the 11.4 per cent decline in its 1991 net income, to
Dollars 132.1m, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The net profit, struck on total 1991 revenues 2.9 per cent lower at Dollars
2.2bn, reflected the US recession, according to Mr Robert Singleton,
Knight-Ridder's chief financial officer.
The last quarter of 1991 saw an improving trend, with net profits 10.4 per
cent higher at Dollars 46.4m, on unchanged revenues of Dollars 588.5m.
*****
RECORD fourth-quarter and year-end results were reported by McDonald's, the
world's biggest chain of fast-food restaurants, writes Our Financial Staff.
Net earnings for the final three months of 1991 increased to Dollars 200.4m,
or 54 cents a share, from Dollars 186.2m, or 51 cents, in the same period of
1990. This lifted the year's earnings to Dollars 859.6m,or Dollars 2.35,
from Dollars 802.3m, or Dollars 2.20, in 1990.
Full-year revenues increased to Dollars 6.7bn from Dollars 6.64bn.

NINE Canadian telephone utilities are forming a new company to co-ordinate
their move into international markets and to oversee research and marketing
of domestic telephone services, writes Bernard Simon.
The new company, Stentor Resource Centre, comprises all but one of the
shareholders of Telecom Canada, the alliance which administers Canada's
domestic long-distance system. Stentor is expected to start operations next
January with about 2,500 employees.
*****
ASARCO, one of the leading integrated producers of non-ferrous metals, has
recorded a steep fall in its 1991 net earnings, writes Barbara Durr.
Lower prices for the company's principal products of copper, lead, silver
and zinc brought the results down. They also suffered from lower prices for
specialty chemicals. Earnings in 1991 fell to Dollars 46m, or Dollars 1.12
per share, from Dollars 149.1m, or Dollars 3.60. Sales were Dollars 1.9bn,
down from Dollars 2.2bn in 1990.
The decline prompted the company to halve its quarterly dividend.

issue

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has been hit by bad real
estate loans, yesterday moved to shore up its finances by virtually halving
its dividend and announcing plans to issue Dollars 500m of new stock.
Both of the Westinghouse board's actions had been widely expected on Wall
Street because of problems at Westinghouse Credit, its financial services
subsidiary, which has been reeling from poor investments in speculative real
estate and highly leveraged buy-outs in the late 1980s.
Westinghouse took a Dollars 1.68bn charge in the third quarter to cover
problems at the finance company and is trying to sell many of its assets to
bolster its balance sheet and reduce debt.
The recession has hit the company's other businesses, which range from power
systems to broadcasting.
The dividend cut reduces the payout due on March 1 from 35 cents to 18
cents.
Mr Paul Lego, the chairman, said this would both provide capital and reduce
the amount of equity the company needed to raise.
The equity will take the form of preferred equity redemption cumulative
stock, one of the most popular new instruments on Wall Street.
Mr Lego said these measures, together with the company's recent
establishment of a Dollars 6bn line of credit, a Dollars 200m cost-cutting
programme and strong cash flow from operations, 'are sufficiently
far-reaching to provide a sound capital structure and meet our financial
needs.
'Nevertheless, we will continue the orderly reduction of assets at our
financial services subsidiary.'
Separately, he announced that the adoption of a new accounting standard for
retirees health benefits, which is hitting the balance sheets of many
American companies, would have no impact on Westinghouse shareholders'
equity.
It would be offset by the beneficial effects of a new tax accounting
standard and the improved performance of the group's pension fund, he said.

OCCIDENTAL Petroleum, the energy group which has undergone a significant

cover the shake-up, writes Martin Dickson.
However, Occidental's oil and gas divisional earnings were only Dollars 54m,
against Dollars 124m before charges in 1990, due to lower oil prices.
Natural gas transmission earnings were unchanged at Dollars 86m and chemical
divis -ion earnings dipped from Dollars 126m, before charges, to Dollars

<TEXT>
PHILIP MORRIS, the US food, drink and tobacco group, yesterday unveiled a
21.2 per cent rise in underlying 1991 profits, to Dollars 4.29bn.
However, large charges for an accounting change and restructuring
contributed to an overall decline, leaving net income for the period down
15.1 per cent at Dollars 3bn, or Dollars 3.25 a share.
During the 1991 fourth quarter, the group took a Dollars 1bn non-cash charge
for the accounting change and an additional Dollars 275m charge for
restructuring its worldwide food business.
As a result, net income in the fourth quarter dropped almost 13 per cent to
Dollars 767m, or 83 cents a share. Operating revenues eased 3.7 per cent in
the quarter to Dollars 13.7bn, reflecting the impact of currency
translations and a decline in revenues from the group's North American food
operations.
Stripping out the one-time items in the 1991 fourth quarter, pre-tax income
advanced 15.7 per cent while net earnings rose 21 per cent.
Philip Morris said that its real estate and North American food businesses
were the only units that did not post improved profits in the quarter.
Mr Michael Miles, who replaced Mr Hamish Maxwell as chairman last summer,
said the company's earnings and cash flow grew strongly in 1991 in spite of
the US recession.
'Although we expect consumer packaged goods companies to face extremely
competitive conditions in a weak economic environment during most of 1992,
we are well-positioned for continued earnings and cash flow growth.'
Operating profits in the domestic tobacco division rose 14.3 per cent to
Dollars 4.8bn for the year in spite of a shrinking US market, where industry
volume fell 2.4 per cent in the year. International tobacco profits rose 24
per cent to Dollars 1.7bn.
Food earnings rose 14.4 per cent to Dollars 3bn on revenues that grew 8 per
cent to Dollars 28.2bn. The comparisons are distorted by the inclusion of
Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolate and coffee company, which Philip Morris
acquired in the autumn of 1990 for Dollars 4.1bn.
Most of the growth came from the group's overseas businesses. North American
food saw a 7.7 per cent improvement in operating income to Dollars 2.1bn.
Beer earnings advanced 13.3 per cent to Dollars 323m on revenues which grew
14.8 per cent to Dollars 4.1bn.
Shares in the group rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 78 1/8 at mid-day
yesterday in New York.

<TEXT>
R. H. MACY, the big US department store chain which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection on Monday, yesterday received bankruptcy court
approval to use Dollars 60m of its Dollars 600m debtor-in-possession
financing from Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust.
The company, which will use the funds to pay suppliers and keep merchandise
flowing into its stores, said the Dollars 60m was sufficient to meet its
immediate financial needs.
At the next court hearing, scheduled for February 13, Macy will ask approval
for the balance of the financing commitment.
After yesterday's hearing, Mr Myron Ullman, vice-chairman and chief
operating officer, said the company was encouraged by the reaction of its
suppliers. He said there were no plans to sell any assets. The company did
not expect to make any significant management changes following the Chapter
11 filing.
Mr Ullman would not speculate on how long Macy might be in Chapter 11.
Emerging from bankruptcy, however, can take a long time.
Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, which filed for bankruptcy
protection in January 1990, expect to emerge from Chapter 11 next week. The
groups, which include Manhattan's Bloomingdale's, have closed about 40
stores since the bankruptcy process started. The company said there had been
no significant management changes, apart from a new chief executive who was
appointed shortly after the Chapter 11 filing.
Macy, like Federated &amp; Allied, is a casualty of the leveraged buy-out craze
of the 1980s.
Macy was taken private in a Dollars 3.6bn management-led buy-out in 1986,
and later increased its debt load by Dollars 1.4bn when it acquired
Federated's California stores. The company's debt burden is estimated at
about Dollars 3.7bn.

Suncor

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONTARIO government is to sell its 25 per cent stake in Suncor, one of
Canada's largest oil producers, in the latest of a string of ownership
changes in the Canadian energy industry.
Suncor said it planned a secondary offering of up to 45 per cent of its
shares held by its two shareholders, Sun Company of Philadelphia and the
Ontario Energy Corporation, a provincial government agency. The offering
will be made in Europe and the US as well as Canada.
Sun Company plans to cut its holding to below 55 per cent, from just under
75 per cent. The Ontario government bought its stake at the height of the
1981 oil crisis to get a window on the producing side of the energy
industry.
About 1 per cent of Suncor's common shares are traded over-the-counter in
Canada. Yesterday's bid price of CDollars 20 a share indicates a market
value of about CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.7bn). But Mr Denis Mote, analyst at
Maison Placements in Toronto, said the price of the thinly-traded shares did
not necessarily reflect market value, especially at a time when a large
number of oil and gas properties were up for sale.
Ontario is unlikely to recoup its original CDollars 650m investment in
Suncor. The province has been eager to sell its stake for some time to help
fund a spiralling budget deficit.
The pace of mergers and acquisitions in the Canadian oil industry has
accelerated in the past few years as larger companies, many of them burdened
by heavy debts, have sought to rationalise their assets. UK-based Lasmo
wants to sell those businesses in Canada it acquired when it took over
Ultramar. Petro-Canada and Amoco have been among the other active sellers.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the US aerospace group, yesterday reported a 27 per cent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings but said it expected 1992 revenues to grow only
slightly, to around Dollars 29.5bn from Dollars 29.3bn in 1991.
The world's largest civilian aircraft manufacturer said it expected
increased sales in 1992 of its 737 and 757 commercial jets to offset a
nominal decline in sales of defence and space equipment.
The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 403m, or Dollars
1.17 a share, compared with Dollars 318m, or 92 cents, in the same period of
last year. Revenues were Dollars 7.75bn, up from Dollars 7.01bn. For the
full year, Boeing made Dollars 1.57bn, or Dollars 4.56 a share, compared
with Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 4.01, on sales of Dollars 27.59bn in 1990.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said the increase in 1991 earnings was due
mainly to better commercial aircraft sales, a lower operating loss at the
defence and space business, and a lower tax rate. This was partially offset
by higher research and development expenses, principally for its new
two-engined, wide-bodied aircraft, the 777, and lower other income.
The defence and space business, which was profitable in the fourth quarter,
had an annual operating loss of Dollars 102m, down from Dollars 418m in
1990. He expected this sector to be profitable in 1992.
Mr Shrontz said the outlook for commercial airlines in 1992 remained
uncertain, although traffic and yields appeared to be improving at the
year-end.
The economic slowdown had particularly affected demand among all
manufacturers for aircraft with fewer than 150 seats and production rates
for Boeing's 737 jet could be subject to further reduction. However, he
added that demand for wide-bodied aircraft remained strong.
Boeing's firm order book at the end of December was Dollars 97.9bn, compared
with Dollars 97.2bn at the end of 1990.

REEBOK, the US sports shoe maker, yesterday posted record sales and earnings
for its fourth quarter and the whole of 1991, writes Karen Zagor.
The strong results sent Reebok's shares climbing Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 30
3/4 in very active trading.
Net income for the fourth quarter was Dollars 49.7m, or 53 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 39.5m, or 34 cents, a year earlier.
Sales increased 20 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 586.6m.
For the year, Reebok had net profits of Dollars 234.7m, or Dollars 2.37, a
share, against Dollars 176.6m, or Dollars 1.54, in 1990. Sales rose 26.6 per
cent to Dollars 2.73bn.
Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said that the company
forecast 'plenty of opportunity for growth in this recessionary
environment.'
He said the Reebok brand had gained market share in a relatively flat
market.
Mr Fireman added that the company had repaid Dollars 165m of the Dollars
215m it borrowed for a stock repurchase in 1991.

TOPDANMARK, the Danish insurance and banking group, is to dismiss about 400
employees, some 13 per cent of the staff, as part of a programme to
streamline the organisation and improve earnings. Nine branches of the
group's bank, Aktivbanken, will be closed this year, the group said.
Topdanmark's 1991 results are expected to be negative following an increase
by DKr200m (Dollars 161,000) in loss provisions for the bank following an
increase in provisions policy by the Danish supervisory authority. The
bank's loss provisions in 1990 were DKr169m; group profit was DKr52m.
Earlier, the group predicted profits of DKr50m to DKr75m for 1991, by it
said yesterday that 'results will be reduced by an amount equal to the loss
incurred by Aktivbanken'.
Topdanmark is negotiating an alliance with Sweden's Wasa, AVCB of the
Netherlands, and the UK's Friends Provident. The Danish group said that its
streamlining programme will mean fewer levels of management and less
bureaucracy.
The purpose is to create a state-of-the-art organisation for the sale of
banking and insurance services.

<TEXT>
PERRIER, France's leading mineral water company, yesterday fired a salvo in
its defence against the FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) hostile bid from Nestle
and Banque Indosuez.
Mr Jacques Vincent, president of Perrier and Exor, the French property group
that controls 35 per cent of the mineral water company and itself the
subject of a FFr5.6bn friendly bid from Italy's Agnelli family, said Perrier
was determined to 'say 'no' to this strange adventure'.
He was particularly critical of Indosuez, the banking subsidiary of France's
Suez Group which owns 10 per cent of Exor. Mr Vincent, who is a board member
of Suez, said he was confused about its participation in the bid.
The fight for Perrier began 10 days ago when Nestle, the Swiss food group,
and Indosuez unveiled their bid.
Perrier's defence against Nestle is based on the claim its mineral water
interests should remain intact. Nestle has agreed to sell Volvic, one of
Perrier's waters, to BSN, the French food group which had been regarded as
an ally of the Agnellis.
Perrier has taken legal action to try to nullify the deal between Nestle and
BSN by filing a complaint with the Conseil de la Concurrence, the French
competition authority.
If Nestle's plan to sell Volvic to BSN was blocked, its bid might face
monopoly problems. Nestle has mounted a legal case against the recent
FFr1.5bn sale of 13.8 per cent of Perrier to Saint Louis, the French food
and packaging group.
Mr Vincent yesterday defended the decision to introduce Saint Louis as an
investor, saying it formed part of Perrier's diversification strategy. Mr
Bernard Dumon, president of Saint Louis, said his company had agreed to take
an initial 13.8 per cent of Perrier with the aim of raising its holding to
20 per cent.
Societe Generale, the French bank, pledged its support to Perrier, of which
it owns 0.5 per cent.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: The ass brays over the silence of the lamb
 -Kevin Maxwell's lost appeal for privilege against self-incrimination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COURT of Appeal's decision yesterday on Mr Kevin Maxwell's right to
remain silent about the missing Maxwell millions has gone some way towards
clarifying when a person facing possible criminal charges can invoke the
privilege against self-incrimination in order to refuse to answer
investigators' questions.
It is now clear (in the absence of a successful appeal to the House of Lords
by Mr Maxwell), that - in investigations involving legislation, such as the
1986 Insolvency Act or the 1985 Companies Act under which Parliament has
either expressly or by implication removed the privilege against
self-incrimination - the mere fact that a person's answers might incriminate
him is not enough by itself to make it unfair that he should be required to
answer.
In private actions not involving legislation which has removed the privilege
and where the individual concerned fears prosecution for conspiracy, the
privilege can be invoked by individuals concerned as justification for
refusing to answer questions in civil proceedings.
The central issue in Mr Maxwell's appeal was whether he could invoke the
privilege to refuse to answer questions put to him by the provisional
liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed Maxwell
pension funds, under the 1986 Insolvency Act.
The Maxwell case is the latest in a long line of similar cases which have
left the law on privilege in a state of uncertainty.
The High Court has been divided on the issue. In July 1990, in a case
arising out of the Barlow Clowes affair, the court ruled that a person being
questioned under section 236 of the Insolvency Act (the same section under
which the provisional liquidator of BIM wishes to question Mr Maxwell) was
entitled to invoke the privilege. An appeal is now pending.
In October last year, however, in an application arising out of the Levitt
case, the court reached exactly the opposite conclusion. An appeal is also
pending in that case.
This was followed in November 1991 by a case involving Farr, in which the
same question came up again before the judge who had heard the Barlow Clowes
case. This time, however, he decided to follow the decision of the judge in
the Levitt case.
In the Maxwell case, heard by the High Court just before Christmas, Mr
Justice Hoffmann also decided to follow the decision in the Levitt case,
resulting in the present appeal.
In the Barlow Clowes and Levitt cases, however, unlike the Maxwell case,
criminal charges had already been brought against the individuals involved
before the court was asked to rule on the availability of the privilege.
Those appeals therefore will raise a further question, namely: if the
privilege is not available because it has been removed by legislation, would
it nonetheless be oppressive and unfair to allow questions under the
Insolvency Act when criminal proceedings are pending?
This question has already been dealt with once by the Appeal Court at the
end of last year in a case involving a former director of London United
Investments, the failed insurance group.
The Appeal Court's answer was no. Although the Insolvency Act does not
expressly remove the privilege, it is nevertheless by implication not
available to a person questioned under the Act since otherwise the obvious
purpose of the legislation would be defeated.
The fact that the answers might incriminate him was not enough on its own to
make it unfair that he should be required to answer, particularly in view of
the fact that the position of the person involved meant he was more likely
than anyone else to know the answers to the questions and, because of that
position, he owed a fiduciary duty to the companies at the centre of the
investigation.
The Appeal Court yesterday faced the additional complication that in several
recent cases involving investigations under legislation which has by
implication or expressly removed the privilege, the individual concerned has
been protected by a safeguard in the legislation which provides that nothing
said by him in response to such questions is admissible as evidence in any
subsequent criminal proceedings.
The Criminal Justice Act 1987, for example, extends that safeguard to
suspects being questioned by the Serious Fraud Office.
They must answer the SFO's questions but what they say cannot be used as
evidence against them in any subsequent prosecution.
The safeguard is not, however, contained in the 1986 Insolvency Act, and in
the absence of the specific imposition of such a safeguard by Parliament, it
has long been established that civil courts have no jurisdiction to impose a
condition on the use of such answers by the prosecution as evidence in
criminal proceedings.
The court ruled that as, following decisions in earlier cases, the
Insolvency Act had by implication removed the privilege against
self-incrimination - because to decide otherwise would clearly frustrate the
purpose of the legislation - Mr Maxwell's appeal must be dismissed.
The issues in the cross appeal by MGN against Mr Justice Hoffmann's ruling
that Mr Maxwell was entitled to invoke the privilege in respect of a private
action brought by MGN were by comparison far simpler.
MGN's case was that, under the general common law, the privilege was not
available to a defendant if immediately before the time of the alleged fraud
which was the subject of the action, the defendant was a fiduciary, servant
or agent of the plaintiffs bringing the action, and the purpose of the
action is to recover money or property for which the defendant, as a
fiduciary, was accountable to the plaintiffs.
The court was not persuaded by MGN's proposition that where someone agrees
to act as a fiduciary to a company he, by implication, contracts not to
invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in any case brought by the
company to enforce his fiduciary duties.
It said the privilege against self-incrimination was so deeply entrenched in
English law that any decision to curtail it or make it not available had to
be a political decision taken by Parliament in the public interest.
The Maxwell case has, however, pointed up one glaring anomaly in the present
state of the general common law on the privilege against self-incrimination.
It can be invoked by a person who fears prosecution for conspiracy to
defraud but is not available to a person who expects to be prosecuted for
fraud under the Theft Act.
This is because the Theft Act provides that a defendant cannot refuse to
answer questions or disclose information in civil proceedings on the grounds
that this might incriminate him of a Theft Act offence. In recognition of
this however, the Act specifically provides that nothing said by the
defendant in reply to such questions is admissible in subsequent criminal
proceedings against him.
Conspiracy however is not a Theft Act offence.
This, the Appeal Court noted yesterday, is logically indefensible. Fear of
prosecution for conspiracy has effectively robbed these Theft Act provisions
of their effect in civil cases.
The Court will not be alone in thinking that Parliament must act quickly to
correct this.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Administrators rule out any early disposal
of controlling stake in MGN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY sale of a con-trolling interest in Mirror Group Newspapers was last
night ruled out by the administrators of Mr Robert Maxwell's private
interests.
In an apparent attempt to end speculation, Mr John Talbot, one of the
administrators, said last night that the late Mr Maxwell's controlling 51
per cent stake was not for sale at present. The stake is effectively owned
by banks such as Midland and National Westminster because they were pledged
as collateral to cover Maxwell debt.
The administrators said they have received a considerable number of
approaches for the MGN stake from groups not yet publicly identified.
Last night's statement said that the administrators were co-operating with
the board of MGN 'and will give consideration to the timing of any sale of
the shares, if appropriate, when comprehensive information is available from
the board.'
This implies that no decision is likely for a matter of months. Audited
accounts for 1991 are not likely to be available before April.
'The administrators are working closely with banks who have taken security
over MGN shares and who have indicated they support the course of action
being taken by the administrators,' the statement added.
The announcement came as a disappointment to Sir Peter Parker, chairman of a
management buy-out group at MGN which includes Mr Richard Stott, editor of
the Daily Mirror.
The group was pressing for an early sale on the grounds that delay and
uncertainty would damage MGN.
Last night the group said: 'It is not clear who this delay benefits but we
have not withdrawn our interest.'
Hambros Bank has also said it is interested in putting together a consortium
to bid for MGN.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Bethlehem Steel to shed 6,500 jobs in restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BETHLEHEM STEEL, the second largest steel producer in the US, yesterday
announced a restructuring to stem its losses, including a 24.5 per cent cut
in its labour force, the sale or closure of several businesses and the
omission of its quarterly 10 cent-a-share dividend.
The package means a Dollars 575m (Pounds 318.6m) charge against
fourth-quarter earnings, producing a net loss of Dollars 638m. The moves
will cut jobs by 6,500 to around 20,000 over the next two years.
Bethlehem, which two months ago abandoned plans for a joint structural steel
venture with British Steel, has already experienced years of restructuring,
and after pulling back from near bankruptcy in 1986 it become one of the
US's most successful integrated steel manufacturers.
However, it has long acknowledged that it requires several more years of
reshaping to be fully profitable, and the need for action has been
intensified by the current US recession.
Weak demand for steel products has hit all the integrated companies hard, as
has intensifying competition from low-cost mini-mills, which have been
taking an increasing share of the market for less sophisticated products.
Yesterday's plan includes selling as a whole or in parts Bethlehem's
division making bar, rod and wire - a market now dominated by mini-mills and
low priced imports.
Bethlehem had been discussing a possible modernisation of the loss-making
division, which employs 2,600, with the United Steelworkers' union (USW) for
more than a year. But the two sides failed to agree on a new labour pact and
Bethlehem said its deteriorating finances now made modernisation out of the
question.
It will also sell or close its loss-making railway track switch plant and
put up for auction its coke-making operations at Lackawanna, in New York
state, which it said was complementary to its recently announced plan to
sell most of its coal operations.
Bethlehem's Dollars 638m loss for the quarter, which worked through at
Dollars 8.47 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 515.8m, or Dollars
6.91 a share, in the same period of last year, when it took a Dollars 550m
charge in connection with the British Steel venture. Sales dipped from
Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.03bn. For the full year it lost Dollars 767m,
against Dollars 464m.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Carmakers corner the wholesale sector: VW's plan to control
UK importing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Operating a national franchise for one of the world's leading carmakers can
be a lucrative business, but the openings are closing fast.
Volkswagen's determination to take eventual control of its UK VW/Audi
importer/distributor operations from Lonrho is part of an established
pattern, as car manufacturers seek to extend their influence over key parts
of their wholesale operations.
In the UK, Toyota and Nissan have recently taken expensive steps to acquire
control of their importer/distributor operations from independent
franchisees.
Fiat has taken control of the Alfa Romeo and Lancia operations in the UK.
Such moves are nothing new to Lonrho, either. SEAT, the Spanish subsidiary
of Germany's Volkswagen group, took over its UK distributorship SEAT
Concessionaires (UK) from Lonrho in early 1990. At the time SEAT said that
it planned an immediate equity injection of Pounds 4m into the company and
announced ambitious plans for expanding its presence in the UK with a
doubling of marketing expenditure to Pounds 11m.
This week Lonrho also said it will sell to MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, Germany's
second largest truckmaker, the UK MAN distribution activities.
Faced with increasingly fierce global competition most car producers have
decided this sensitive part of their operations is too important to leave to
independent operators in main markets.
In the UK, apart from VW and Lonrho, there is only one exception, namely
Volvo Concessionaires, a subsidiary of Lex Service, which holds the Volvo
franchise in the UK and has built it into one of the most important markets
worldwide for the Swedish carmaker.
For Volkswagen, the priorities of its commercial strategy in large volume
markets are clear.
'Towards the end of the 1980s we formulated the strategy that in the car
producing countries of the world the manufacturer must also be in the
wholesale business. That was and is our strategy,' said Mr Hans-Jorg
Hungerland, sales director for the VW and Audi marques worldwide, in an
interview late last year.
'You must be in control of the big markets. In Europe the leading five
markets (Germany, Italy, France, the UK and Spain) account for 83 per cent
of the total volume.'
VW already controls its wholesale operations directly in Germany, France,
Italy and Spain. The Italian importer/distributor, Autogerma, was fully
acquired in mid-1985, while the Spanish operations were established under
VW's direct control in the wake of its progressive takeover of SEAT, the
Spanish carmaker, in the second half of the 1980s.
Volkswagen, Europe's leading carmaker, has evolved different strategies for
the big volume markets in Europe on the one hand, and the small and
medium-sized markets on the other.
In smaller markets, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and
Austria, VW is happy to retain independent importers and distributors. 'We
do not want to engage ourselves there in wholesale or retail operations,'
said Mr Hungerland.
But VW believes in a different strategy in the main car producing countries.
'The pressures in the big five countries will grow the fastest,' said Mr
Hungerland.
'There is a different climate that leads to different pressures in terms of
production and pricing.'
Nowhere is this more true than in the UK, which is in the frontline of the
Japanese assault in Europe.
The first three Japanese car plants in Europe are all being developed in the
UK, where the three leading Japanese carmakers Toyota, Nissan and Honda will
have a combined assembly capacity for more than 600,000 cars a year by the
mid-1990s.
Both Toyota and Nissan have decided that with such big strategic investments
in the UK - Pounds 840m by Toyota and Pounds 850m by Nissan in the engine
and assembly plants alone - they must also control the wholesale operations.
Most importantly this offers control of:
overall sales and marketing strategy;
the extent of financial incentives to be used in sales support;
the relative emphasis on retail and fleet sales;
selection, training and co-ordination of the dealer network; and
advertising, image and market positioning.
The means to the end can be very different, but the end remains the same. VW
and Lonrho insisted yesterday that the details of their contract
relationship were confidential.
Toyota chose to take control amicably. In early 1990 the group reached
agreement with Inchcape, the international motor distribution and motor
retailing, services and marketing group, to eventually take a 51 per cent
stake in Toyota (GB), its British distributor and an Inchcape subsidiary for
Pounds 61m.
It currently holds a 5 per cent stake in Toyota (GB) and this will rise to
51 per cent by 1998. At the same time it awarded Toyota (GB) an 18-year
exclusive distribution contract for Toyota vehicles.
Nissan was forced to take a different route to the same vital goal. Unable
to negotiate a friendly takeover of Nissan UK, the privately-owned
importer/distributor of Nissan vehicles in the UK controlled by Mr Octav
Botnar, Nissan took drastic action at the end of 1990.
It terminated the NUK contract with 12 months' notice, landed in a
protracted legal battle and took on the onerous task of setting up an
alternative dealer network within 12 months.
Less publicly, but also under heavy strategic pressures, Fiat of Italy has
set about taking direct control of its franchises in the UK. It bought out
the Alfa Romeo franchise from TKM in January 1990 and took over the Lancia
franchise from Heron Corporation in May 1989.
It has appointed new senior executives and has announced plans to invest
around Pounds 100m over the next three years in order to strengthen the
ailing UK dealer networks.
In the era of the single European market from 1993 direct control of key
national wholesale operations is vital for the big carmakers, as they seek
to rationalise operations across Europe.
With the concentration of the industry the Volkswagen group now has four
marques in Europe, VW, Audi, SEAT and Skoda.
It will take time but Mr Hungerland is determined gradually to wring more
synergies out of the wholesale operations of the four marques across Europe.
At a retail dealer level Skoda and SEAT will be kept entirely separate from
VW/Audi, but at the wholesale level he said he expected large savings to be
possible through shared facilities - such as parts depots - and shared
book-keeping.
Such synergies demand a unified control.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Maxwell used MCC funds for large French property investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Maxwell used money from his main public company, Maxwell
Communication Corporation, three years ago to support his political and
commercial ambitions in France, according to MCC's auditors.
This is the first time Mr Maxwell's vigorous attempts to win influence with
the French government in the late 1980s have been linked to MCC and to
secretive Liechtenstein trusts.
It emerged yesterday that MCC had invested heavily in 1988 in La Defense,
the prestigious business development west of Paris.
MCC's initial investment of Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m was through a joint
venture called SAGA in which MCC held 62 per cent and Caisse des Depots, the
French state financial institution, the balance.
SAGA agreed to invest in the ground floor and basement of the Grande Arche,
a striking white marble cube, which is the focal point of the district.
There is no suggestion the MCC deal is connected with the recent financial
investigation into some of La Defense's backers. Mr Christian Pellerin, a
property developer who managed the constructions around the arch, was
charged two weeks ago with aiding and abetting financial irregularities.
Yesterday he denied the charges. He has applied to have them annulled.
It is now clear that MCC sold its stake in SAGA to Hesto Stiftung, a
Liechtenstein foundation. Board directors of MCC and its lawyers, gave
written assurances to Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte that Hesto was independent
of Mr Robert Maxwell, the auditors said yesterday.
The transactions - Pounds 22m in 1990 and Pounds 23m in 1991 - were booked
as profit by MCC, but payment was deferred for several years. There is no
suggestion this was not a normal commercial deal, but it is not detailed in
the accounts. According to Coopers, Hesto is included in MCC's debtors in
the audited accounts for those periods. All but Pounds 1m to Pounds 3m of
the Pounds 45m had been repaid by June 1991. However MCC is still owed
Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m by Corry Stiftung, a second Liechtenstein foundation,
used for many of MCC's overseas transactions.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Lonrho slips 8p amid loss of contract worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S share price fell by 8p to 115 1/2 p yesterday after the Financial
Times reported that the international trading group is to lose control of UK
import and distribution of Volkswagens and Audis from the end of 1993. The
business accounts for more than a fifth of the group's worldwide turnover.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's joint deputy chairman, said in a telephone
interview that the FT report was 'inaccurate'. He said: 'We have not been
advised by the factory that we are to lose control.' He told news agencies
'we would seek to renegotiate to extend the contract as we have done in the
past'.
Lonrho did not issue any official statement yesterday.
Mr Spicer said on Tuesday that Lonrho did not reveal the financial
performance of its individual subsidiaries.
'We must provide the information for our shareholders all at the same time
on February 26, when we publish our annual report,' he said.
Financial analysts were surprised to discover yesterday, however, that ahead
of publishing its annual report Lonrho had already filed a return for VAG
(United Kingdom), the subsidiary that runs the VW/Audi operations in the UK.
It shows that VAG (UK) achieved a turnover (including related companies) of
Pounds 1.02bn in the 12 months to September 30, 1991, an 11 per cent fall
from 1989-1990.
The subsidiary's pre-tax profit fell 11.1 per cent to Pounds 20.0m from
Pounds 22.6m a year earlier, accounting for 9.7 per cent of Lonrho's total
pre-tax profits of Pounds 207m.
After-tax profit totalled Pounds 12.3m, but VAG (UK) paid a dividend of
Pounds 14.8m to its shareholders.

FT  30 JAN 92 / WH Smith profits rise 44% to Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP decline in interest charges helped WH Smith, the book and music
retailer, lift pre-tax profits by 44 per cent from Pounds 34.9m to Pounds
50.1m in the half year ended November 30.
The improvement came in spite of weakness in the music market and a
substantial decline in the contribution from Do It All, the group's
do-it-yourself joint venture with Boots the chemists, which suffered from
intense price competition.
Interest charged fell to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 15.6m) as borrowings were
brought down with the help of a rights issue and the disposal of the TV and
travel interests.
The charge was likely to be higher in the second half because of
acquisitions the group expected to make, mainly in the US.
On higher earnings of 13.7p (11.1p) the interim dividend is being raised to
4.3p (4p).
Turnover was up to Pounds 1bn (Pounds 936m), with an 11 per cent increase in
retailing sales offsetting a 9 per cent fall in the DIY operations. However,
retailing did not fare as well in terms of trading profits which fell 4.5
per cent to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 39.3m) mainly because of the slump in the
recorded music business.
Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director, blamed the relatively new CD
market, the recession affecting young consumers and a perception among
consumers that CD prices were too high.
The Do It All joint venture with Boots suffered from difficulties in
integrating the products and systems of the constituent businesses, as well
as strong price cutting by competitors. Sales dropped to Pounds 97.9m
(Pounds 107.9m) and WH Smith's share of profits fell to Pounds 100,000
(Pounds 3.1m).
'The sector has been severely depressed and there has been no improvement in
the housing market,' Sir Malcolm said. Efforts had been made to improve the
product range and Do It All expected to be number two in the market.
WH Smith's distribution business, including news and magazine wholesaling
and office supplies business, increased sales and trading profits.
In the US, which contributed about 5 per cent of turnover at Pounds 59m
(Pounds 39.5m), trading profits rose 27 per cent to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds
1.5m). The group had acquired long-term leases of 27 shops in Hyatt Hotels
for Pounds 17.5m.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Yeltsin ready to match US arms cuts: Russian leader responds
with plan to eliminate more than 2,000 nuclear warheads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for early agreement between the US and Russia on eliminating
long-range, multi-warhead missiles rose yesterday when a wide-ranging
proposal for nuclear arms cuts was unveiled by President Boris Yeltsin.
His offer came in response to proposals by President George Bush in his
State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday, offering substantial cuts
in US air, sea and land-based nuclear forces.
The two leaders are scheduled to hold talks on Saturday at Camp David, and
senior US officials expressed confidence that an agreement could be reached
covering multi-warhead missiles, the most dangerous first-strike weapons.
The Russian leader called for an international agency to oversee disarmament
and said he would bring to Washington proposals for eliminating thousands of
warheads from long-range rockets. 'Proposals have been prepared for deep
cuts in strategic offensive weapons . . . up to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads on
each side,' he said, without specifying which rockets could be eliminated.
Mr Bush said in his address to Congress if Russia and the other
nuclear-armed former Soviet republics scrapped all land-based multi-warhead
ballistic missiles, the US was ready to reciprocate by eliminating the MX
Peacekeeper missile, cutting the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to
one, and reducing by a third the number of warheads on submarine-based
missiles.
The proposed cut in the number of nuclear warheads on Trident submarines is
significant since the US has jealously guarded its technological superiority
in this area.
The US proposals and Mr Yeltsin's offer were widely welcomed in Europe. Mr
Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said it was 'a further far-reaching
step in building a more peaceful, freer and significantly safer world'.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, praised Mr Yeltsin's response - he is
due to meet the Russian leader in London today. Mr Major and Mr Tom King,
the UK defence secretary, emphasised that any cuts would not deter Britain
from going ahead with plans to deploy new Trident ballistic-missile
submarines.
In a BBC interview Mr Yeltsin later extended his vision of widespread arms
cuts by saying he wanted Russia to become a full-blooded member of the EC
and called on the UK, as well as France and China, to join Russia and the US
in cutting nuclear arsenals.
Mr Yeltsin said he would discuss with Mr Major the possibility of pointing
the nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union away from the UK.
Mr Bush had announced unilateral changes in the US strategic nuclear force.
He said he would halt production of the troubled B-2 Stealth bomber after
completing 20 aircraft, cancel the Midgetman missile, cease production of
new warheads for sea-based ballistic missiles and halt purchases of advanced
cruise missiles.
The US move would scrap more than 2,000 US nuclear warheads and between
4,000 and 5,000 nuclear warheads in former Soviet republics.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Anger over Pounds 3bn loss forecast for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORECASTS that insurance losses at Lloyd's of London could amount to more
than Pounds 3bn over the next three years provoked consternation at the
insurance market yesterday.
It had been expected that the 1989 year, for which Lloyd's will report
results in June, would produce losses above Pounds 1bn. But the scale of
1990 and 1991 losses forecast yesterday by Chatset, the independent research
group, surprised market insiders.
Chatset suggested that total losses for the 1989, 1990 and 1991 years may
exceed Pounds 3.1bn, which compares with deposits and reserves of around
Pounds 4.4bn at the end of 1990.
Names, the individuals whose assets make up the market's capital base,
deposit with Lloyd's an amount equivalent to 30 per cent of their stamp
capacity - the amount of premiums they are allowed to accept under Lloyd's
rules.
Losses of this scale would damage the market's solvency, although Lloyd's
can still call on the personal wealth of its 22,500 Names to meet claims.
'Lloyd's is going to need a massive injection of cash,' said Mr Charles
Sturge, the co-editor of Chatset's reports.
Chatset suggested that urgent action was needed to bolster the the market's
central fund, out of which claims are paid if Names are unable to meet
commitments. The fund currently totals some Pounds 450m. The group's grim
predictions came as the market's leadership grappled with the implications
of implementing wide-ranging reforms recommended by a task force just over a
fortnight ago.
The figures produced an angry response from underwriters on the market who
believe they exaggerate the size of 1990 and 1991 losses.
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association
representing more than 150 Lloyd's agencies, described the 1991 predictions
as 'completely and grossly inaccurate. By any stretch of the imagination
they are crystal ball gazing.'
Mr Archard took issue with Chatset's estimates for 1990 (a loss of more than
Pounds 1bn compared to a forecast loss of Pounds 1.35bn in 1989) and 1991 (a
loss in the region of Pounds 750m).
Chatset's forecast that Lloyd's may need an average of between Pounds 400m
and Pounds 600m each year to top up reserves for US asbestosis and pollution
claims is also hotly contested by insiders at the market.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK construction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An election has to be in the offing when a government minister needs to
exclude commercial property and make five-monthly comparisons to derive any
satisfaction from the latest construction figures. That said, there is
plausible evidence of a modest pick-up in construction orders from the
private industrial sector between July and November last year. That is
certainly consistent with the idea that companies will not wish to be left
with outdated plant and equipment when a strong recovery finally
materialises.
Unfortunately, these tidings bring little comfort for investors in quoted
contractors. As the Building Employers Confederation made clear over the
weekend, many of its members are undertaking work on zero or negative
margins as they compete fiercely for the dwindling volume of new commercial
work. Returns on the civil side are more encouraging for the moment, but
this will not necessarily last if everyone dives into the same market place.
Any increase in orders is not to be sniffed at. But just as increased demand
in the mortgage market will be slow to feed through into bigger profits for
the housebuilders, so the contractors will have to wait awhile for better
margins.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Intangibles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The issue of goodwill and brands in UK balance sheets is starting to rumble
again. Today, the new Accounting Standards Board has its first session on
the topic. Earlier this week, a detailed study backed by the UK's leading
finance directors pressed for the valuation of intangibles. The battery of
techniques is becoming ever more complex and more lucrative for its
practitioners. In terms of basic principle, it is all built on sand.
Brand valuation is open to at least two fundamental objections. First, a
brand name has different values in different hands. The Savoy name would be
worth rather more to Mr Rocco Forte than it would be attached to a boarding
house in Blackpool. Second, all brand valuations are based on applying a
multiple to the brand's cash flow or earnings. As Mr David Damant of MAP
Securities argues, international accounting theory now says that accounts
are there to allow the user to judge future cash flows. If assets are valued
on the basis of future cash flows in the first place, the process becomes
circular.
Much of the stimulus for the debate came from the Rowntree takeover, which
was taken to show that Rowntree's brands constituted hidden value. A more
up-to-date example might be the now worthless Maxwell Communication, whose
latest accounts showed net assets of Pounds 1.3bn thanks to intangibles
valued at Pounds 2.9bn. It might be objected that Mr Robert Maxwell's
accounting practices were scarcely typical: but it is just such cases which
call for conservative accounting standards.
In other countries besides the UK, the rationale of the balance sheet has
become a matter of deep confusion. In the UK, there is a pragmatic solution:
that the company making an acquisition should simply record the purchase as
an asset at full cost. The tangible assets would then be depreciated and the
balance checked annually for diminution of value. This would avoid the
rooted objection of British companies to amortising goodwill. In that
respect, it would go against international practice and perhaps the EC's
Fourth Directive on company law. If that could somehow be addressed, the
whole nonsense about brands could go out of the window.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: WH Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by their own long-term standards, shares in WH Smith have been
unusually strong of late. Since last May's Pounds 148m rights issue, they
have beaten the market by 30 per cent and are at their highest ever against
the retailing sector. Judging by yesterday's interim results and increased
dividend, the market has been right to put a premium on the group's
defensive characteristics. The question is whether Smith will maintain its
rating once the economy picks up.
Granted, the interim figures depended heavily on the rights issue cash,
which brought down the interest charge to less than Pounds 3m against five
times that in the same period last year. The underlying trading performance
was still respectable, particularly in the WH Smith chain itself. The only
real worry remains Do It All, which may complete its integration just in
time for a price war among the big chains. With recovery in the housing
market still a distant prospect, it may be left to the group's other
specialist retail brands to make the running. Investors might deduce that
although Smith is as well positioned to prosper as any of its high street
rivals, the shares look fully valued.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
5.5)
Since it is now clear that UK economic recovery will come too late to help
the government win the election, the budget has assumed singular political
importance. The art will be to give enough away in bribes to the voters
without destroying the government's reputation for fiscal rectitude. The
City will surely allow the chancellor some leeway if the result looks a
winner, though it will also be doubly vindictive if the effort is
unconvincing.
As it happens, the weak economy bestows a cloak of respectability on further
fiscal stimulation, especially given the exchange rate constraint on
monetary policy. But the room for manoeuvre is limited by the government's
commitment to balancing the budget over the cycle. As the Institute for
Fiscal Studies points out, growth must already average 3 per cent just to
balance the public sector borrowing requirement by the end of the next
parliament, let alone finance a cut in the standard rate to 20 per cent.
The political imperative is thus for a budget which uses its limited
resources to make a Labour vote even more expensive for the relatively
affluent voters of marginal seats in the south-east. A clear conclusion  -
though one which the IFS is reluctant to draw - is that a cut in the
standard rate would be of greater electoral advantage than raising tax
thresholds, because the benefit is tilted more towards the top 30 per cent
of wage earners. This is not the only case where the more electorally
beguiling options also make more dubious fiscal policy. It will be
interesting to see where Mr Lamont's choice falls.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Russia issues economic union ultimatum
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday issued an ultimatum to other former Soviet republics either
to join a trade, banking and currency union or face a dangerous regime of
trade restrictions and higher prices.
Mr Vladimir Mashits, the newly appointed minister for relations with other
republics, said Russia had already agreed with Kazakhstan and Belarus to set
up a single economic space and rouble zone. Kirghizia would be next on the
list.
'With whom else will we sign such an agreement? . . . We'll see,' he said.
'We are ready to have one close group of friends and another not so close.'
He said a preferential regime would be open to republics which:
Dropped plans to issue their own currencies or surrogate money; Agreed on a
system of consultation among their central banks;
Resisted re-exporting cheap Russian energy for hard currency.
The veiled threat of economic warfare if they did not comply reflects, in
part, Russia's desperate need for a clearly defined currency and banking
zone to strengthen the rouble.
Mr Mashits used the tense relationship with Ukraine to illustrate the
dangers of a trade war. He said if Ukraine insisted on charging a new high
price for its coal of Rbs1,600 per tonne (as opposed to Rbs200), 'you can
imagine what our retaliatory price will be for oil'.
Alternatively, Russia could withhold sales of oil to Ukraine, but 'that
would ruin her economy and we will stop getting metal, coal and chemical
products'.
He said his new ministry would deal with a host of practical problems
resulting from the union's collapse. These included dividing up Baltic Sea
fishing waters, formerly open to all former Soviet citizens.
The tough stance also appeared to be aimed at public opinion, which not only
bitterly resents the government's harsh economic reforms, but complains that
Russia is subsidising other republics with cheap oil while their neighbours
plot to wreck the rouble with separate currencies.
The combative announcement followed claims by Lithuania on Tuesday that
Russia had cut off oil supplies. Although he partially denied the claim, Mr
Mashits said that Lithuanians had enough oil, accused them of demanding hard
currency for deliveries of fertiliser to Russia and attacked their attempts
to take over Soviet army property while demanding the evacuation of homeless
troops.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Traffic wardens brought to book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POPULAR image of traffic wardens as a ruthlessly efficient machine for
persecuting motorists takes an unprecedented bashing today, writes Richard
Tomkins.
As neglected by their employers as they are unloved by the public, traffic
wardens emerge as a badly managed crew which spends less than half its
average working day sticking tickets to motorists' windscreens.
A highly critical report by the Audit Commission portrays them not as petty
Hitlers, but as the Cinderellas of law enforcement, neglected by the police
forces and local authorities which employ them.
In what amounts to a 24-page ticket of violations against management of
parking enforcement, the commission paints a dismal picture of indifference.
Objectives are 'vague and unquantified' and day-to-day management is often
'languid'.
Many motorists might view the identified management failings as a blessing
in disguise.
The commission says, for example, that traffic wardens spend up to 45 per
cent of their working day walking to and from their beat. With morning
parades and tea breaks added in, less than half the working day is spent
productively.
Among the report's other indictments of the service are:
Supervision of wardens on the streets is minimal or absent, and no analysis
is undertaken to check how they spend their hours on duty.
Sickness levels average 30 days a year - double the level of police officers
in the same forces and four times the UK average for manual workers.
Working hours are inflexible. In one town centre where waiting restrictions
apply until 6.30pm, all wardens leave the streets at 4.30pm, just as the
evening rush hour starts. The number of tickets issued daily by wardens
varies. It is four times as high in some forces as it is in others.
The proportion of unpaid tickets written off by police forces outside London
varies from 3 per cent to 13 per cent.
In the 30 years since the creation of the traffic warden service, the police
have failed to devise an appropriate measure of performance.
Traffic warden numbers tend to be based on historic decisions, not justified
by the economies of substituting wardens for police officers.
The report concludes that a well-managed and efficient service would save
money and reduce inconvenience.
'If it is worth the police service spending Pounds 50m a year on traffic
wardens, it is worth managing them well,' it says. 'If the subject is not
worth this expenditure, then it is worth reviewing it to identify the scope
for savings.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Some arithmetic for the UK Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Benjamin Disraeli was one of the few political leaders who had to be cajoled
into becoming chancellor of the exchequer. For, unlike his arch-rival
William Gladstone, he did not think that fiscal arithmetic was his
particular metier. He was finally persuaded by an old pro who said: 'They
give you the figures.'
Nowadays, they still give some figures to the chancellor. But the Treasury
gives very skeletal indications to the public at large. So the annual Green
Budget* produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in conjunction with
Goldman Sachs, is a godsend. For full value, it should be read together with
the new Goldman Sachs UK Economics Analyst.
The documents give chapter and verse for the case for some discretionary
fiscal stimulus over and above the automatic recession-induced Budget
deficit, which I outlined without commitment in last week's Viewpoint. The
argument is that the strain of German unification requires unusually high
interest rates on the part of the Bundesbank, to which Britain is held by
the ERM. This special situation is said to justify some departure from
medium-term guidelines.
How is all this translated into terms of Budget arithmetic? The authors
assume that there will be discretionary tax relaxations of Pounds 1bn to
Pounds 2bn in the March 10 Budget - based not on any fine economic
arithmetic but on a balance between what is politically required to resist
pressure to leave the ERM or devalue and the need not to upset financial
confidence.
Over and above these somewhat modest tax adjustments, the Green Budget
forecasts some upward slippage in public expenditure plans. The net result
is expected to be an increase in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
from nearly Pounds 12bn in 1991-92 to Pounds 23bn in 1992-93, rising to a
peak of Pounds 26bn in the following financial year, even if there are no
further relaxations.
How worried should we be about such deficit numbers? In terms of sterling,
they are much higher than the ones which horrified the International
Monetary Fund in its bail-out operation in the middle 1970s. Expressed as a
proportion of gross domestic product, the picture is, however, different.
The PSBR during the last year of the Labour government came to 5.5 per cent
of GDP. According to the present projections, it will reach a peak of 4 per
cent in 1993-94 before turning down towards 3 per cent in the following
year.
Thus the Conservative aim of a balanced Budget seems out of reach over the
next parliament - although not necessarily over the whole business cycle, if
we are back with old-fashioned cycles lasting a decade.
The Green Budget attributes to Labour the aim of a 3 per cent PSBR. Even
with this latitude, a Labour government would have the greatest difficulty
in making net additions to public spending (above those financed by tax
increases) at least until the last half of a new parliament.
Whether it arises because the Conservatives are boxed in, or because Labour
has freely chosen it, is a 3 per cent PSBR outlook sustainable?
Paradoxically, the more credible the exchange rate mechanism parity, the
more choice a government can have in how much to borrow before facing a run
on its currency. Nevertheless, not all choices are equally sensible.
To keep the public-sector debt to GDP ratio stable over the medium term, the
PSBR should, on Green Budget arithmetic, be no higher than 2 per cent of
GDP. To achieve the more prudent objective of a stable level of government
net assets, privatisation proceeds should not be counted. This leaves a PSBR
aim of 1 per cent of GDP on present definitions - nearer to Conservative
objectives.
The Green Budget draws comfort from the fact that even with a 3 per cent
PSBR, public sector debt levels would not rise rapidly and start from
relatively low levels. But that is hardly a reason for moving off in the
wrong direction. More borrowing now means higher taxes later for a given
real national income.
These debt servicing considerations would, however, deserve to be laid aside
if more government borrowing allowed a sustainable increase in the real
national income which we could not otherwise have. Would it? The Green
Budget argument needs some unravelling here.
The underlying logic seems to be the following. In the authors' very
considered view, the present savings ratio is likely to fall. Nevertheless,
the authors admit that they may be wrong. In that case, an attempt to slash
government borrowing, even in the medium term, 'could well leave the economy
very short of demand'. This is the core of the economic argument for a
sizable and continuing fiscal stimulus.
But is it valid? Like most fiscalist arguments, it leaves out at least two
other possibilities. First, it ignores the likelihood of monetary policy
coming to the rescue in the medium term. The need for high real interest
rates in Germany is not permanent. Eventually the Bundesbank will have to
reduce rates to nearer normal levels.
But there is a more specific UK point. If a country or region has a surplus
of savings relative to requirements, the normal outlet is overseas
investment. This means a current payments surplus to finance a capital
outflow. That is how Japan and the old German Federal Republic managed to
maintain high employment even when savings were also high. Anyone who
supposes that the UK could never run such surpluses, or could never do so
without devaluation, is quite excessively time-bound and has forgotten the
payments surpluses as recently as the early 1980s, which were then
attributed to oil.
* * *
What would I do? I am still not reconverted to fiscal tuning. But if some
action has to be taken, it should be directed towards investment, private or
public, and any tax cuts should be strictly temporary with a built-in
cancellation date.
How should such tax cuts be allocated? It would cost Pounds 2bn just to
reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p. In my view, this would be the
worst possible option. There is no comparison with a similar 1p tax cut made
before the 1987 election when the public sector was moving towards surplus
rather than large deficit. Even in political terms, there would, as the
Green Budget says, be the risk of the government 'appearing to panic and
attempting to buy votes'.
For about the same amount, personal tax allowances could be increased by
some 10 per cent over and above indexation. It would also bring far more
benefit to people with lower to middle incomes. The IFS points out for good
measure: 'Labour would find it politically hard to reverse such a change.
But if it did not, it would find its scope for increasing public spending
thereby reduced.'
The IFS rightly goes out of its way to take a swipe at Labour's favoured
idea of a reduced rate of tax band. 'It cannot be written too frequently if
the objective is to reduce the tax bills of the least well off, raising
allowances is always more effective: it is better to be taken out of tax
altogether rather than face a reduction in the amount of tax paid.' It is a
defect of an unreformed two-party system that Labour is taken much too much
at face value as friend of the worst-off.
The Green Budget concludes that relief on non-domestic rates would do more
faster for hard-pressed businesses than any further cuts in corporation tax.
But better than either would be strictly temporary measures to encourage
investment. If the expiry date were taken seriously it would not interfere
with the structural changes in the 1984 Budget designed to remove
distortions.
Neither the Green Budget nor anyone else is saying much about indirect
taxes. This is hardly surprising, as a 1 percentage point cut in VAT would
cost Pounds 1.7bn. The 'Regulator' allows the chancellor to vary indirect
taxes at any time. Unfortunately, when used in the 1960s and 1970s, nothing
was said about later reversals. An indirect tax reduction would, however,
have its maximum effect in encouraging spending in the shops if consumers
knew it was to expire soon - perhaps before the end of the calendar year. I
would keep it in reserve as an emergency measure.

Sir, Mr John Smith, speaking on behalf of the Labour party on the Today
Programme (January 28), said that he thought it was unfair that people
earning more than Pounds 405 per week should not have to pay national
insurance contributions on their full earnings whereas people earning less
than that did have to.
Mr Smith should be made aware of the fact that those earning more than
Pounds 405 a week earn no state pension in respect of that excess.
People earning less than Pounds 405 a week do earn a state pension in
respect of those earnings.
An increase in National Insurance contributions for those earning more than
Pounds 405 per week is a straight income tax of 9 per cent on that excess.
There is no state benefit given in return.

<TEXT>
Sir, Anyone concerned for the economic future of the nation in the light of
a possible Labour victory should ponder carefully the thoughts of Mrs
Margaret Beckett, the shadow treasury minister, as enunciated in your
Personal Finance Supplement ('A real top rate of 59 per cent', January
24-25).
Savers, it seems, must suffer the additional burden of national insurance
contributions along with so-called high earners since, says Mrs Beckett, the
money they have invested may or may not have been worked for. In other
words, if you choose to defer spending by saving, and create a nest egg for
your retirement, that - in the eyes of the ingenuous Mrs Beckett - is tough,
and another convenient tax source. There are others now whose needs are
greater than yours (or, more realistically, with greater voting power).
Perhaps we might be told whether this diktat is to apply to National
Savings, which, as a vehicle for harbouring investment, is as indifferent as
any other to the means by which it was accrued.
The truth is, that despite the camouflage of the red rose, nothing has
changed in the political dictum of the Labour party, which remains as always
'from each according to his income, to each according to his vote'. Paul

FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: The re-design that changed the original nature of
Milton Keynes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Colin Amery's acute review of Milton Keynes after 25 years ('Milton
Keynes, the view from the grid', January 27) is a telling diagnosis. But he
is wrong to say that 'what you see derives strictly from the plan created in
the late 1960s . . .'
The actual development departed from the initial plan right from the outset
in some crucial respects - which helps to explain why it is not '. . . of
the calibre needed to make it a city'.
The plan envisaged that the densities of housing and services would be at
their highest along the grid roads. Every kilometre or so, at the points
between the main intersections, you would come to dense housing, bus stops,
schools, shops, bars and other services and feel you were moving through a
city. Main road traffic would go at about 30mph so it would be safe to pull
up. Built areas would only be separated from the roads around (noisy) main
junctions.
One of the first things the development corporation did was to redesign the
roads for high speeds. This entailed more noise (thus the hills and forests
to absorb it) and made it too noisy and unsafe for buildings to adjoin roads
or for kerb-side parking. Thus housing and work areas are cocooned in hills
and forests, local commerce is largely invisible to passers-by and Mr Amery
misses an urban feeling. He is not alone.
Some of us who worked in the original planning team remonstrated against
this change, but to no avail. Perhaps we can try again in the Thames
corridor.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Book Review: Military leader, not a moralist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE HUNDRED DAYS: The Memoirs of the Falklands Battle Group Commander By
Admiral Sandy Woodward (with Patrick Robinson) HarperCollins (Pounds 18)
It was George Orwell who remarked that in England 'all the boasting and
flag-waving, the 'Rule Britannia' stuff, is done by small minorities'.
Writing more than 50 years ago, he noted that popular war writing always
concerns tales of disaster and retreat. British military heroes have a
tendency to remove themselves from the limelight after the main event, which
makes this book an unusual contribution to the large Falklands library, as
the 10th anniversary of the war fast approaches.
At a superficial level Admiral Sandy Woodward, commander of the British task
force, gives the lie to the view that the Falklands experience was simply an
accident of history with no wider application.
It is a celebration of a military victory won against enormous odds,
asserting, to quote Mrs Thatcher who wrote the preface, 'the massive sense
of justice ever-present in the minds of the (British) men who fought in the
South Atlantic'.
Not for the first time we are reminded, in some detail, of the extraordinary
logistics of the South Atlantic war. The book also notes the military
co-operation between the UK and the US, which was to be echoed eight years
later in the Gulf war and which saved men like Woodward from the
consequences of UK defence cuts.
Its pages record the courage, military skills and professionalism of some of
the men involved, while not attempting to ignore the extent to which events
often turned on luck.
The opening chapter, ghost-written by author Patrick Robinson, describes the
loss of HMS Sheffield - sunk by a French-made Exocet - in the staccato
rhythm of the comic strip war hero. The style, however, settles down and
there is enough material - including extracts from his own personal diary -
to justify Admiral Woodward's reputation as the most controversial senior
commander on the spot.
Take his first reaction to the Falklands, for example: 'Twenty degrees
warmer and it would be the yachting centre in the world. As it is, bloody
awful, . . . definitely not a jewel in the Queen's crown.'
Woodward was an admiral in the Thatcherite mode: non-traditional, vaguely
classless and often ruthless. During the war, he told journalists on the
command ship, HMS Hermes: 'South Georgia was the appetiser, now this is the
heavy punch coming up behind . . . This is the run-up to the Big Match which
in my view should be a walkover.'
Most of the criticism that followed came from those who considered him too
confident. The Royal Navy lost nearly half of the ships it had started with
and played little part in the final military defeat of the Argentine army.
It is the British army commanders, not Woodward, who deserve credit for the
recapture of the islands.
Being remembered as a nice man or a moralist does not rank high in
Woodward's list of priorities. Nor does he want to be remembered as a
politician or a diplomat. He does want to be seen as having helped lead
Britain into war in the only way that had a chance of military victory.
The loss of HMS Sheffield is blamed on a mixture of bad luck and a
succession of military lapses by officers under Woodward's command.
But the most controversial of the naval episodes, the sinking of the
Belgrano, was in Woodward's view a necessary means to an end. He confirms
that the enemy's cruiser was moving away from the task force when it was
hit, but insists that its speed and direction were irrelevant. 'What counts
is his position, his capability, and what I believe to be his intention.'
The Belgrano had been involved earlier in a pincer movement and, as far as
Woodward was concerned, it could have become so again.
The book reveals how the conduct of the campaign was dictated by this kind
of military logic. It was the navy that convinced Mrs Thatcher to send the
task force, and the navy that convinced her to change her rules of
engagement to make the sinking of the Belgrano possible. Once the islands
had been reached, the war entered an irreversible military momentum.
To that extent, it is a chilling reminder of the subservience of politics in
times of war, and the ease with which a minor incident can develop into a
bloody conflict.
And yet Woodward was no Admiral Anaya or General Galtieri, the repressive
junta chiefs for whom the invasion was a political necessity.
Returning to his office after the war, Woodward opened one of his first
official letters. It was the navy's Pay and Pensions Department, advising
him that his entertainment allowance was being trimmed.
Woodward comments: 'That letter brought me down to earth with a considerable
thump. This country really does have its own wonderful way of ensuring that
no one gets too big for his boots.' It is a pity that Mrs Thatcher didn't
write that into her preface too.
The reviewer is the author of The Land that Lost its Heroes: the Falklands,

FT  30 JAN 92 / Leading Article: The president sits it out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET verdict on US President George Bush's State of the Union message
and budget proposals was eloquent: equities and the dollar weakened, while
government bonds rose - until their advance was upset by comments of Mr Alan
Greenspan on the constraints on interest rate movements. This implies that
in the absence of any other than shop-soiled proposals to revive the US
economy, the Federal Reserve will, over time, have to do what it can by
cutting rates; but no quick results are expected. US economic policy remains
paralysed by the burden of federal debt, while the private sector is equally
crippled by debts of its own.
It is little wonder that Mr Bush's popular standing continues to slide. In a
poll taken on the eve of his budget, no less than 73 per cent of the voters
said that they thought the country worse off than five years ago - a
substantially worse reading than that which drove President Carter to
complain of a national malaise. Only 9 per cent saw any hope of short-term
improvement. Meanwhile the current president is seen passively waiting for a
deus ex machina, in the form of a cyclical consumer-led recovery, to rescue
both the economy and his own hopes of re-election.
The latest economic readings are not encouraging. Real domestic final demand
fell at an annual rate of nearly 2 per cent in the last quarter of 1991, so
the real growth rate of 0.3 per cent was sustained only by the improving
trade balance. The administration expects this improvement to taper off as
growth among US trade partners slows, so its forecast of 1.6 per cent real
growth this year rests on a domestic turnround. The source of this is not
the proposed budget, which is claimed to add only 0.6 per cent to demand,
but monetary policy: 'The moderation of inflation provides the Federal
Reserve ample room to ease interest rates further if this appears
warranted.'
Old favourite
The Fed might in fact have to offset the effects of the Bush proposals, in
the unlikely event that Congress passed them. Both parties favour higher tax
breaks and social spending, financed by defence cuts - Dollars 50bn over
five years under the Bush plan, but much more if the Democrats get their
way. This approach is obviously a more sensible use of resources than
building unwanted weapons, but its economic effects would be slow, and
initially might well be deflationary. Jobs and incomes will be lost in the
defence sector, but tax cuts - and especially the president's unpopular old
favourite, a large cut in capital gains tax - would go partly to restore
personal savings. Very necessary, again; but no short-term stimulus.
Growing danger
However, policies in an election year are framed in the short term, and in
this time frame America's trade partners can only pray that the
administration's forecasts prove more impressive than its budget proposals.
If the economy remains depressed, there is a growing danger the next
election will see a rebirth of the sort of populism which gave us the
Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the 1930s. The poll showing such poor support for Mr
Bush also showed hunger for more public spending - with a fiscal deficit
projected at Dollars 399bn - and a forbidding 56 per cent in favour of a
protectionist approach to saving US jobs.
Protectionism has been publicly favoured only by a part of the Democratic
leadership until now; but the president has shown in the past that when the
shot is flying he, like the Duke of Plaza-Toro, is happy to lead from
behind. The short-sighted EC stance on farm issues at the Gatt, bitterly
offending the traditionally free-trade US farm lobby, can only encourage
chauvinist voices in both parties. Partners who find the idea of an
isolationist US forbidding should reflect that their macroeconomic policies
may encourage the result they fear. Mr Bush's dilemma confirms what has been
clear since his election - that the US, the traditional locomotive of world
economic growth, is out of steam and in sad need of an overhaul. If we are
to rely on more than crossed fingers to lead a US revival, the motive power
may have to come from outside.

From meat-purveyor to meet-promoter. Having retired from running the
Dewhurst butchers' shops in the much indebted Vestey empire, Colin Cullimore
has saddled himself with the contentious role of director of the newly

One of his schemes to whip up support is to show that the sport is not just

cent of hunt-followers, he says.

<TEXT>
Britain's official bumfpushers are using an amended version of Omar
Khayyam's famous line as their watchword for elaborating on the Citizen's
Charter. In their case, 'The moving finger writes; and having writ, writes
more.'
Already this week the Benefits Office's customer's charter has been followed
by the Customs &amp; Excise traveller's charter. But although the first has been
dubbed the scrounger's charter, it would be in appropriate to nickname the
second the smuggler's charter, because it has somewhat strayed from the
point of the original exercise.
Whereas the idea behind such documents was to set out what users of a
service have a right to expect from the officialdom running it, the latest
effusion concentrates on the responsibilities the traveller owes to the
customs.
For instance, Point 2 instructs: 'Your first step is to decide if you have
anything to declare . . . .' By Point 5 you're told that it is only when you
haven't that you should enter the green channel.
Point 8 is more permissive, however, in providing for duty to be paid not
just in Pounds sterling, but by cheque or credit card. And Point 12, while
stating that travellers must unpack and repack luggage if so asked, concedes
that customs officers will help with repacking unless 'operational
circumstances' prevent it.
What next? A police charter telling us to uphold the law, with perhaps a
reminder that 'operational circumstances' may oblige us to sign any
statement put before us?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to believe there is such a thing as a Finnish double of News
Corporation's Rupert Murdoch, but it looks as though the digger has just
recruited one to his board.
The 59-year-old Aatos Erkko, chief executive of The Sanoma Group for the
past 20 years, is nowhere near as well known as Hamish Maxwell, the former
chief executive of Philip Morris who has also joined. But our man in
Helsinki reports that he is a very big wheel. He owns Finland's biggest
selling daily, Helsingin Sanomat, and has extensive interests in magazines
and cable TV.
In the past his family has provided several politicians, but the
publicity-shy Erkko does not interfere editorially in his papers. He also
differs from Murdoch in that he does not need to borrow from banks and has
no heirs. Part of the attraction, perhaps?

How does the recipient of a Pounds 250,000 salary make it sound as if he's
setting a trend in modest executive rewards?
Alan Bowkett, new chief at Berisford, explains that by putting in over
Pounds 1m of his own money - subscribing for 6m new shares at 19p, a 2p
premium over Tuesday's close - he's more than covering four years' salary.
But is that quite the point?
Bowkett, famed for flogging United Precision Industries to the Japanese at a
vast profit in 1990, may be showing faith in his ability to breathe new life
into the Berisford shell.
But the up-front investment has also secured him a very nice options package
if all goes well: 6.25m shares under the company scheme at a price of 16p
(attractive even if all goes only passably well); and a further 16m shares
under certain favourable conditions if the share price tops 50p in the next
two or three years.
He was off to a propitious start yesterday with the shares closing at a high
of 20p.

Don't talk to Sid Shaw about your aid to the former Soviet Union. For two

He began looking for opportunities there after funding a trip to Graceland

Now, 14 visits later, the fog-bottling negotiations for a joint-venture

undone, we're registered and ready to trade,' he says. 'We've 2,000 feet of
modernised floor space. The profit potential is good.'
So off he goes to the City of London looking for a 'few hundred thousand
pounds' to start up . . . and you've guessed it. All he gets is the
brush-off. 'As soon as you mention Russia to the banks, the iron curtain
goes down.'

LIFE ON A STRING ICA
BLACK ROBE (15) Plaza, MGM Trocadero
HORS LA VIE (15) Screen on the Hill, Cannon Tottenham Ct Rd
MY GIRL (PG) Odeon Leicester Sq
ZERO DE CONDUITE (U) and BOUDU SAVED FROM DROWNING (PG) Renoir
To tell you that Life On A String is a Chinese film about the search for
wisdom will not, I realise, cause a stampede to the box office. To many
Westerners Chinese wisdom has much the same appeal as Chinese water torture:
insistent, timeless, litanistic; wearing down resistance by its metronome
certainty.
Chen Kaige's film is, as it happens, masterly. But many filmgoers at Cannes
last year felt stupefied, including the festival jury who left it prizeless.
The maker of the ground-breaking Yellow Earth here gives us an old
minstrel-saint and his young apprentice, both blind, leading each other
across mountains, valleys and burnished terracotta deserts. They are in
quest of - what? Our only clue is in the surreal prologue, set in an
azure-hued limbo hung with white funerary tatters, in which the old man as a
youngster receives his old master's dying wisdom. Something about the
thousandth string breaking on his lute. Something about his only then
finding the true way to sing.
But this string is a long time a-breaking. 'Sixty years later,' as the
caption tells us introducing the main story, the now ageing songster and his
pupil are still only on about string 990 and their trek across China sets
new standards for the word picaresque. One moment they are lingering by a
waterfall-side cafe where a village idiot, a pretty girl and Buddha-like
boss sketch archetypal figures we will meet and re-meet later. The next
moment the two heroes are dots in a ravishing pattern of rift valleys. Later
still they fetch up at a village where the boy's romance with a local girl -
she giggles, she tumbles him in a haystack, she crumbles sunflowers over his
head - plays havoc with the religious responsibilities of his calling.
But it is those responsibilities that are on trial in Kaige's film. When the
'truths' that guide us through the story are finally revealed as fraudulent,
we are as startled by this moral handstand as we are by the one in Mozart's
Magic Flute. There, you recall, the man character-assassinated in Act 1 by
the lady with the show-off aria turns out to be all-wise and good in the
following acts.
Life On A String, like the rival Chinese masterworks of Kaige's compatriot
and one-time cameraman Zhang Yimou (Red Sorghum, Ju Dou), has caused
flutters in the neo-Maoist hen coop now occupied by those responsible for
Tiananmen Square. The film is a fable about dying dogmas - for religion read
communism - and about the senility that passes for wisdom among those who
legislate over our lives. The measured pace is vital to the movie's
strategy. By spreading the glow of 'eternal truth' over so many miles and
man-hours it lulls us with the opiate assurance of (seemingly) immutable
dogma. Then with a snapped string all its own it shows the boy betrayed, the
girl thrown to her doom and the old man, his own last mental chord broken,
chirping into the void.
There are some longueurs, though the film has been tightened by eight
minutes since Cannes. And Eastern symbolism is not always accessible to
Western powers of assimilation. But even to the most floundering Occidental
such as myself, the film has a piercing beauty of image and richness of
purpose.
Black Robe is also about the faith that betrays. As directed with sombre
majesty by Bruce Beresford of Driving Miss Daisy, novelist Brian Moore's
tale of a 17th century Jesuit priest and his companions crossing 1,500 miles
of Indian territory to relieve a far-flung fellow missionary is given a
scenic ride through coldest Canada. Amid snowscapes that howl around our
ears the scarce-known cast - only Lothaire Bluteau, formerly Jesus of
Montreal, is familiar as the saint-faced hero - stumble across historic
North America towards meaning or meaninglessness.
Moore's novel was a Pilgrim's Progress for the post-Conradian age. For this
group of men God was not waiting at the end of their journey: only a variety
of Kurtz-like demons embodied in the snowstorms, the white-water rivers and
the tribal savages who capture and torture them.
The book could have made a rousing Hollywood romp with Richard Gere, say,
swashbuckling in Jesuitic black against back-projected winterlands.
Beresford instead plunges into the real wilderness and gives the story a
lyric nastiness worthy of Werner Herzog. In a calm woodland an Indian arrow
suddenly pierces a white man's neck. A capering yellow-faced dwarf rattles a
charm instrument at our hero. An aged Indian has a prophetic vision of the
island we will soon see him die on. And everywhere the scenic textures are
rough as sackcloth when not white as death.
Perhaps the final icy laughter of Aguirre, Wrath Of God does not ring out.
And whenever it seems about to, we are warmed by the gorgeous chords of
Georges Delerue's music. But Black Robe is a brave film: not just for the
physical daring of taking the story into the wild, but for the moral daring
of questioning God, doubting grace and giving us pre-Kevin Costner Indians
who are every bit as mad, bad and unpredictable as record rather than
revision suggests.
With a loud bump we come down to Maroun Bagdadi's Hors La Vie. This
French-Italian-Belgian movie about hostage-taking is an assembly-kit
political thriller. In a moment of madness the Cannes jury that ignored Life
On A String gave it a Special Jury Prize. Perhaps they liked the telegraphic
simplicity of its story, wherein a young French reporter (Hippolyte
Girardot) kidnapped by Arab terrorists in Beirut is passed from one safe
house to the next while we tick off director Bagdadi's shopping list of
Essential Scenes.
These include the hero horrified by the cries of an unseen fellow prisoner;
the video message he is forced to record for the world; the leaden,
tendentious exchanges between East and West ('You're a lucky man - you've a
pretty girlfriend, you're rich, handsome, French'); and the frequent dashes
from house to house, with the hero in one instance dressed as a woman.
I found myself wishing the woman were Sally Field and we were back with the
gutsy melodrama of Not Without My Daughter. Though based on real-life
photographer Roger Auque, this hero and his story are played and scripted
with no vitalising particularity at all, as if he were Everyman in
Every-Troublespot.
In My Girl an undertaker's little daughter (Anna Chlumsky) comes to terms
with life and death in early-1970s Pennsylvania. Judging from the audience
around me on the film's opening day in Los Angeles, you will need 300 soft
tissues as little Miss Chlumsky loves and loses little Master Macaulay
Culkin (Home Alone's hero, here introspective in specs) and comes to realise
that her father Dan Aykroyd is a human being too, even though he spends so
much time in the basement beautifying corpses.
Set in the era of Nixon, Vietnam and the sexual revolution, the film
counterpoints the girl's early discovery of life's dark side with her Dad's
belated discovery of its fun side. He falls for cosmetologist Jamie Lee
Curtis, who flirts and giggles with him and tells him caringly 'Life isn't
just death, Harry.'
The audience is not sure where life ends and creative death begins. You need
wellington boots to wade through the film's slushy music and you goggle in
disbelief at Master Culkin's wet and winsome cameo, which must be an early
bid to outwit the typecasters by the now Dollars 4m-a-picture superbrat.
Some touching truths do slither into prominence late in the film and I did
some eye-dabbing myself around scene 167. But the film melts in the mind
soon after it has melted parts of your heart. Laurice Elehwany wrote the
screenplay; the director was Howard Zieff.
Why not a classic French double-bill instead? Two influential films for the
price of one. Jean Vigo's poetic hymn to schooldays and anarchy Zero De
Conduite inspired Lindsay Anderson's If and Jean Renoir's Boudu Sauve Des
Eaux, in which an endearingly disgusting tramp (Michel Simon) upends the
lives of a rich couple, went to Hollywood to become Down And Out In Beverly
Hills. If you liked the copies, the originals are even better.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With the best will in the world, it is very difficult to find much good to
say about The Cotton Club, the latest in a line of musical derivatives to
land on the London stage. Indeed I am coming to the conclusion that the
genre is not for theatre critics who expect more from a show than a bit of
song and dance. I shall try my best, however, to be kind.
In one respect, The Cotton Club is an improvement on Sophisticated Ladies,
the celebration of Duke Ellington that arrived at the Globe Theatre earlier
this month. It has at least some dialogue and elements of a story line.
Millie Gibson, the singer, is on drugs and is destroying her career as a
result. The rising star at the Club, Dinah Andrews, admits to having an
affair with the manager.
There is occasional talk about the difficulties of being a black star in New
York in the early 1930s. It is better to stay in the Club because if you go
on a road show, half the time you're hungry and have to sleep in the van
since the hotels won't serve you. Yet in the end the dialogue and the story
simply peter out.
Like Sophisticated Ladies, the show is full of hits. Few people would deny
the merits of 'I'm just wild about Harry', sung by the fetching Debby Bishop
as Dinah Andrews, as a song. The same goes for 'There'll be some changes
made', sung in a startling change of dress by Joanne Campbell as Millie, and
a string of others. There is also some stunning tap-dancing by Marcel Peneux
as Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson.
Questions arise, however, about whether the theatre is the right place for
what is essentially extended cabaret. On the whole, theatre-goers expect
something to happen. Those who go to cabaret at least have other diversions,
like eating or drinking. Over 2 1/2 hours of song and dance in the theatre
can be a strain.
As for tap-dancing, there was a very good example of it in Sophisticated
Ladies. Marcel Peneux is clearly at the top of his profession, yet the
fascination lasts for about five minutes. I have seen enough tap-dancing
this month to suffice for the rest of the year.
It is possible that such shows can be redeemed by brilliant settings and
brilliant costumes. It is not the case with either. I reported that
Sophisticated Ladies was anything but sophisticated. Some of the sets and
costumes in The Cotton Club are distinctly tawdry.
Audience participation might help as well. On the first night it did not
really come off. It was not helped by an invitation for white folks to show
that they have rhythm being apparently deliberately aimed at the stately
theatre critics of The Times and The Guardian. That cast a damper.
Still, some people obviously enjoy this kind of show and rumour has that
there is more of the genre to come.
The Cotton Club is directed and choreographed by Billy Wilson.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Accountancy Column: Tangible difficulties of measuring
intangibles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTMAS may be gone, but the season of 'goodwill' is only just beginning.
The members of the Accounting Standards Board, who today start to address
the questions of intangibles and goodwill, could come in for a roasting as
the debate progresses.
Goodwill is defined as the difference between the net assets of a company
and the price paid by its purchaser.
Intangible assets, which may make up a large part of any goodwill on
acquisition, are those non-physical elements of a business like brands and
licences which can generate future earnings.
There is nothing new about goodwill. As long ago as 1934, a court appeal
made the distinction between 'cat' goodwill, which is loyal to the business
and stays if it is sold, and 'dog' goodwill, which is loyal to the owners,
goes with them and hence is lost to the business.
Nor is the presence and continued value of intangible assets like brands a
recent phenomenon. Croft and Gilbey, the alcoholic drink brand names, were
registered as trademarks in 1876, for example, while Cerebos salt dates from
1894 and Hovis bread from 1895.
But the debate came to the fore in the late 1980s, with the activities of a
number of food groups. In early 1988 Nestle made a bid for Rowntree worth
more than twice the company's market capitalisation at the time. Later that
year both Grand Metropolitan and Ranks Hovis McDougall started capitalising
brands that they owned or had acquired.
Any attempt to cut down on the use of intangibles is likely to result in
fierce opposition from businesses such as these, and from a growing army of
accountants and other professional valuers. As a result, there is no doubt
that the treatment of non-physical assets is one of the most controversial
items currently on the ASB's agenda.
The existing uncertainty is also causing difficulties to those involved in
preparing company accounts. For the year to August 31 1991, the balance
sheet of Blenheim Exhibitions, the exhibitions organiser, shows net
liabilities over assets of Pounds 81.3m. However, the goodwill reserve
contains Pounds 296.8m, much of it representing exhibition rights that have
been acquired. The directors make a point of saying that they will not
include these intangibles in the balance sheet while the ASB is developing
its proposals.
As the role of service industries with a large number of intangible assets
continues to rise, the issues can only become more important for a larger
number of companies and the users of their accounts.
Mr David Nash, finance director of Grand Metropolitan, argues that the
common practice in the UK of ignoring intangibles by writing off goodwill
immediately on acquisition distorts the impression of gearing, return on
capital employed and the value of the business making the purchase.
'The balance sheet presupposes that the intangible assets are worthless,' he
says. 'In the majority of cases this does not reflect the underlying
economic reality of the situation.'
At the same time, pressure is mounting from other parties. Arthur Andersen
produced a report* on Tuesday that addresses the valuation of intangible
items. It suggests that a consensus is emerging on how to value them using
rigorous methodologies.
A paper++ is also circulating from Mr David Damant, chairman of MAP
Securities, a stockbroking and corporate finance house. He argues that
assets need to be valued at cost, not on the basis of future earnings
generated by the assets. Otherwise, the logic is circular, since the valuer
has to use a valuation of the assets in order to estimate these future
earnings. Purchased goodwill, he adds, is simply a consolidation difference
and not an asset in its own right.
Meanwhile, not to be outdone, the ASB has commissioned a team of five
academics led by John Arnold, professor of accounting at Manchester
university, to consider the issue on its own behalf.
The board has already started some tentative work with a pronouncement from
its Urgent Issues Task Force in late December, which specified how goodwill
from acquisitions that had been consolidated should then be written off on
disposal. Under the ruling, the goodwill element must be passed through the
profit and loss account, and not quietly dissolved through a movement in
reserves. But the greatest efforts are yet to come. The task force has
merely offered an interim statement to one pressing case. The ASB must now
look at the issue of drafting and consulting on accounting standards to
cover the topic both comprehensively and democratically.
'It's quite handy that all these things are coming at once,' says Mr David
Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, diplomatically. 'We are all trying to work at
this problem.' He suggests that the growing importance of service
industries, and hence the intangible items that go with them, means the
issue is going to become more important, and something the ASB can no longer
wait to tackle.
He says that the ASB is likely to draft statements of principles by Easter
on both the definition of assets and liabilities in the accounts, and on
their recognition. A further statement considering valuation of assets is
likely to follow later in the year.
A report on accounting for brands prepared by the London Business School in
1989 argued strongly that they should not be included on the balance sheet,
or they could contribute to a 'potentially corrosive' effect on the whole
basis of financial reporting. It says that their inclusion represents a
controversial shift in what the balance sheet shows, from costs to values.
It also highlights a series of problems with the valuation of intangibles:
the methods used are inconsistent, subjective, and often theoretically
questionable; the results are difficult to audit; and little information on
how valuations are conducted is disclosed, which makes their assessment for
a user of accounts impossible.
This week's Andersen report argues that many of these objections have been
overcome. Mr Hugh Collum, chairman of the 100 Group of finance directors of
leading British companies, which supported the research, is keen to stress
that the findings are only a preliminary step in the debate.
Nevertheless, it hardly helps that the new study makes little effort to back
up its suggestion of growing consensus with any figures. Nor that many of
the organisations interviewed - and the sponsors of the report  - already
rely heavily on brand valuations.
Andrew Likierman from the London Business School, one of the authors of the
1989 report, remains unconvinced.
'This is an interesting contribution to the debate,' he says. 'I'm glad they
have set out the issues, but it still leaves many of the basic questions
unanswered.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Nellist, the Coventry South East MP expelled from the Labour party
last month for alleged links to the Trotsykite Militant Tendency, last night
said he would fight the seat as an independent.
He told supporters in his constituency that yesterday's decision by Labour's
national executive committee to start the candidate selection process had
left him with no option.
Earlier, Mr Terry Fields, Labour MP for Liverpool Broad Green, who was
expelled with Mr Nellist last month, confirmed he would also stand as an
independent.
At the 1987 election, Mr Nellist had a majority of 6,653 and Mr Fields one
of 6,047.

IRAQI SUPERGUN: British customs was not told of the Iraqi supergun project
until April 1990, one day before it seized eight metal pipes destined for
Iraq at Teesport, MPs heard yesterday.
Mr Alexander Russell, a customs commissioner, told the Commons trade and
industry committee that it would have been 'desirable' for information to be
given to his department earlier.
Government departments including the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office
and the Department of Trade and Industry are known to have been aware of the
Iraqi project the previous autumn.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour fears over election
resources - Party finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HECTIC pace of recent campaigning has aroused fears that Labour has been
forced to dip into funds set aside for the general election, raising fresh
questions about its capacity to finance up to five more months of flat-out
electioneering.
The party's concerted attempts to regain the political initiative have meant
it has overshot projected spending levels, according to one senior party
official.
Although the statement was dismissed as 'not true' by Mr Jack Cunningham,
Labour's campaign co-ordinator, other senior party figures admitted that
hard decisions would soon have to be made.
Labour said last month its campaign war-chest exceeded its Pounds 6m target,
but this is likely to be dwarfed by a Tory fighting fund estimated at Pounds
20m.
In 1990 - the latest figures available - Labour withdrew Pounds 570,000 from
its general election fund, using the money mainly to employ 'temporary'
organisers 'covering areas of the country crucial to our success at the next
general election'. This did not prevent the fund more than doubling in size
to Pounds 2.6m from Pounds 1.26m a year earlier.
However, the party's general fund clocked up a 1990 loss of Pounds 289,000
against a projected break-even.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Political Notebook: The rail cost of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is only one manifesto commitment the Conservatives could make that
might be as damaging as their 1987 poll tax pledge. That would be a promise
to inject voters with bubonic plague.
That view, offered only half-jokingly by one of the leading players in Mr
John Major's cabinet, is understandable enough. Ideology was the driving
force behind the poll tax. The party now is led by a careful man who puts
common sense before abstract credo. His manifesto will preach caring
Conservatism, not permanent revolution. The logic seems impeccable. The
conclusion could prove misplaced.
The debate over how the Conservatives should privatise the railways -
assuming of course they win the election - has obscured a more basic
political reality. As a handful of Whitehall insiders are beginning to
realise, the break-up of British Rail has the volcanic potential to make the
poll tax look like a small tremor.
The government will fight the election committed to privatisation. Mr
Malcolm Rifkind plans to publish a white paper sometime before then. The
transport secretary had hoped to produce it in December. He presented the
prime minister with what seemed then to be a plausible blueprint.
Briefly, the network would be opened to competition; InterCity and the
freight operations would be sold; the loss-making Network SouthEast and the
other regional services would remain in state ownership but their operations
would be franchised out to private companies.
That model did not win instant approval in Downing Street. On one level, Mr
Major's policy unit thought not enough detailed work had been done. How
would the new system be regulated to ensure that operators ran essential
services, how would subsidies be fixed, who would own the stations?
On another level, Mr Major preferred the more romantic notion that the
pre-1948 regional companies could be re-created.
To complicate things, Mr Peter Lilley wanted much greater competition,
throwing the Department of Trade and Industry's weight behind the idea of a
separate rail-track authority on which operators would compete for business.
The latest talk is of a hybrid solution: InterCity might be sold off intact,
with regional companies revived and given permission to use its tracks.
But some ministers have begun to stand back from the argument over detail to
take a broader view of the political risks. They do not like what they see.
Westminster gossip has it that Mr Chris Patten is among those arguing that
the white paper should confine itself to general principles.
British Rail is unlike any previous privatisation. It is a monopoly in which
the customer travels on the production line. It loses vast amounts of money.
It has no real prospect of making any. Even those parts - such as InterCity
 -which are notionally profitable on paper would not survive real accounting
criteria.
Theoretically the network could be made profitable if fares for commuters in
the south-east were raised by 50 per cent or so, the regional networks
slashed, and the loss-making 'ends' chopped from the InterCity network.
Those are hardly options, unless Mr Major wants to be certain of losing the
election after next.
Fares will go up. That is the most obvious lesson of all privatisations. But
unless still more passengers are to be driven on to clogged roads or the
government is ready to raise sharply the cost of motoring, the network will
not survive without large state subsidies. The private-sector ethos and
semblance of competition provided by franchising will not be a sufficient
substitute for the taxpayers' money needed to make up for decades of
under-investment.
Nor is franchising as simple as it sounds. A glance at the mess made of the
auctioning of commercial television licences provides ample evidence of the
capacity for mistakes. It hardly matters if there is nothing new on TV-am
for 12 months or so. Commuters from Tunbridge Wells would feel rather more
aggrieved if a rail franchise operator decided to take a few trains from its
schedule if its contract were not renewed.
Such problems could be solved with enough money. But enthusiasts for
privatisation have not paid enough attention to the Treasury agenda.
Whitehall's most powerful department has a simple objective - to stop
spending money on the railways. It usually gets its way.
The Treasury's refusal to spend more money ensured the poll tax was
destroyed before it started. Mr Major might reflect that voters felt the
impact of that mistake once a year. If rail privatisation went wrong,
millions would be reminded of his error twice a day.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Waldegrave calls upon spirit of NHS
founder - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday invoked the spirit of Aneurin Bevan, the Labour
minister who founded the National Health Service, in support of their claims
that the NHS reforms are working.
Mr Huw Griffith, a consultant neurosurgeon and a nephew of Mr Bevan, came to
Tory Central Office to say that he did not believe the health service would
be safe in Labour's hands, and that his uncle would have supported the
government's reforms.
His conversion came, he said, during battles between ministers and the
medical profession on the reforms four years ago, when he saw Mr Kenneth
Clarke, then health secretary, 'treated very much as my uncle was in 1946.'
Calling himself a former Labour supporter, but refusing to say how he would
vote at the election, Mr Griffith emphasised how the changes were
facilitating innovation. Within the NHS, he added, the reforms were
increasingly supported by 'people like myself, on the shop floor or the coal
face'.
Support for his assessment of Mr Bevan's likely reaction was not, however,
forthcoming from elsewhere in the Bevan family. Mrs Arianwen Norris, Mr
Bevan's sister, said she was horrified by the way the Tories were trying to
claim her brother's support for 'the terrible changes to the NHS'.
Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, cited Mr Griffith's views as
evidence that leaders of the health service professions were coming round to
the reforms: the government had won the intellectual argument, he said.
Further proof of his confidence on the issue came as Mr Waldegrave revealed
he had given up private health insurance on gaining his present post because
he 'did not think it was necessary to have it'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, said: 'If William Waldegrave
believes that the spirit of Nye Bevan supports his changes to the NHS then
there is a wheel missing from his Ouija board.
'Nye Bevan would not have supported two-tier waiting lists or opted-out
hospitals. His whole life was dedicated to taking health out of the market.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown criticises Labour-Tory tax
conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liberal Democrat leader, dismissed as 'irresponsible' the
Labour and Tory clashes over taxation and instead set out how the end of the
Cold War should lead to lower UK defence spending and restructuring of the
United Nations, Ralph Atkins writes.
Sticking to his pledge not to be distracted from his own agenda for
campaigning - even it it means taking a lower profile - Mr Ashdown called on
Mr John Major to play a constructive role in creating a 'new world order'.
Mr Ashdown criticised Mr Major for ruling out this week an increase in VAT,
saying such firm commitments on fiscal policy limited options within the
European exchange rate mechanism. Anybody who promised never to put up taxes
was 'either a fool or a fibber,' he said.
Mr Ashdown also called for the UN security council to be restructured -
possibly with Britain or France replaced as permanent members by the
European Community.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash on taxation and
benefits - Election campaigning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO biggest parties yesterday struggled to hold the media spotlight with
Labour switching its campaign to pensions and benefits and the Tories
concentrating their fire on the opposition's tax and spending plans.
At rival briefings in Westminster, Labour fielded Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor, to challenge the government's record on child benefits and
pensions while officials at Tory Central Office issued a new dossier
entitled Labour's Tax Shambles.
Mr Smith used his platform to contrast his commitments to increased benefits
with the claim that the government's efforts to hold down child benefit had
cost a family with two children Pounds 404 since 1987.
Touching on this week's row over value added tax, he claimed that 1988
figures showed indirect taxation meant the poorest fifth of pensioner
households paid nearly 40 per cent of their gross income in tax while the
richest fifth of non-retired households paid just 34 per cent of their
income in tax.
Commending Labour's commitment to increase pensions by Pounds 5 for single
people and Pounds 8 for couples and to increase child benefit to Pounds 9.95
a week, he said the differences in the tax burden were a direct consequence
of 'bizarre and deeply unfair' Tory policies.
He was backed by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow health minister, who claimed that
government neglect had meant one in four British children lived at poverty
levels - double the figure that the government had inherited in 1979.
Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, presented an eight-page
assault on Labour's past statements on tax and spending.
Claiming that Labour's charge that the government would lift VAT from 17.5
per cent to 22 per cent was a 'scare' story intended to distract the voters'
from its own confusion on tax, he argued that 'the shambles' over the past
few weeks had destroyed Labour's credibility.
His attack was echoed by Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, who
claimed his Labour shadow, Mr Michael Meacher, had committed his party to
Pounds 15bn of unfunded expenditure on benefits.
On National Insurance, Mr Smith would not say whether the removal of the
ceiling on contributions would be immediate or phased. The decision could be
taken only after the Budget or when Labour saw undisclosed Treasury figures
after a general election.
He went on to reject Tory claims that repayment of NI contribution
overpayments to those earning below Pounds 21,000 would be costly or
complicated.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Anger as schools bill guillotined -
Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last night curtailed debate on its Education (schools) Bill,
accusing Labour of trying to delay its progress, David Owen writes.
The guillotine means that the bill, which includes controversial provisions
for schools to start choosing their own inspectors, will return to the
Commons to complete its report stage today.
Labour responded furiously to the move, claiming it revealed that the
government was desperate to 'get the bill into the House of Lords' to meet
its election timetable.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow Commons leader, challenged the government to
'just announce the election date now.' He said it was 'complete nonsense' to
charge Labour with filibustering when there were 31 government amendments on
the order paper.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, said the Opposition had never
asked for more than a single day's debate on the measure.
What had happened, he said, was that well into the debate there was an
indication that Labour was not prepared to see it through in one day.
The bill now displaces a scheduled discussion on the 1992-93 revenue support
grant orders for local councils. This debate will be delayed until next
week.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Zurich jet service brings boost for City airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON City Airport yester-day received a further boost with the
announcement that Crossair, the Swiss regional carrier controlled by
Swissair, will start operating two daily flights between Zurich and the
Docklands airport from March 30.
Crossair also said it was dropping its current daily service from London's
Stansted Airport to Basle next month because of inadequate demand.
The move will mean the first use of the British Aerospace 146 regional jet
at London City Airport. This follows the recent extension of the airport's
runway.
In November Crossair will take over the Basle-London Heathrow service
currently operated by Swissair. It is also considering starting a service
from Geneva to London City.
Confirmation of the services at London City came hard on the heels of Air
France's announcement on Monday that it would operate up to seven daily
services a week from the airport using ATR 42 turboprop aircraft.
Air France also said it was suspending its services from Stansted from the
end of March.
The decision of the two airlines to suspend their Stansted services is a
blow for the image of the Pounds 400m Stansted Airport complex which BAA,
the former British Airports Authority, opened last year.
While conceding that it was a 'public relations blow', Stansted Airport
emphasised that the decision of the two airlines was not a 'business blow'.
It said the Air France and Cross-air services accounted for 3 per cent of
passenger traffic at Stansted, which has continued to grow steadily since
the opening of the terminal complex.
Nearly 1.7m passengers used the airport in the 12 months to the end of
December, compared with 1.1m for the 12 months to the end of March last
year.
The start of jet services at London City is expected to lead to an expansion
of services from the loss-making airport, which is owned by Mowlem, the
construction group. Only about 170,000 passengers used the airport last year
but it needs about 450,000 passengers a year to break even.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Home repossession action increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOME repossession orders issued by county courts in England and Wales
increased by 35 per cent to 74,079 last year from 54,718 in 1990, the Lord
Chancellor's office reported yesterday.
Applications for orders by lenders rose from 145,317 in 1990 to 186,786 last
year.
The hardest-hit areas include south London, with 2,306 orders issued in
Croydon alone. Other badly affected areas were Birmingham, Portsmouth and
Southend-on-Sea.
The figures were broken into quarterly totals by the Council of Mortgage
Lenders, which reported a marked change in the fourth quarter of last year.
Applications for orders by lenders dropped to 42,888 from 51,031 in the
third quarter. Orders made fell to 18,171 in the last quarter after rising
through the year to a peak of 20,218 in the third quarter.
The Building Societies Association said that it expected the 1991 total for
repossessions to be 80,000, but Mr Mark Boleat, its director-general, said
that the figures for the last quarter 'confirm the impression from lenders
that the increase in repossessions has stopped and is hopefully on a
downward trend'. The BSA said there were 43,890 repossessions for the whole
of 1990 and 36,610 in the first half of last year.
A repossession order does not always lead to action against the householder.
Many repossessions also go ahead without a court order. As many as half of
last year's repossessions were voluntary, such as when the owner hands in
the keys of the property.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
stock-broker, said: 'Voluntary repossessions are a unique feature of this
housing recession.'
The acceleration in repossessions last year prompted the government to
announce a mortgage-rescue scheme last December and to suspend stamp duty on
purchases of under Pounds 250,000 until August.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said of the figures: 'This
puts to rest the claim by John Major that his government has stopped
repossessions. If the current trend continues, up to half a million people
could be faced with repossession in the two-year period to the end of this
year.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / MPs told of watchdog's pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chief executive of the National Rivers Authority agreed a Pounds
125,000 compensation deal with the authority's board after resigning last
year, a committee of MPs heard yesterday.
Mr John Bowman left the water watchdog in June following serious financial
weakness for which all board members were ultimately responsible, the MPs
were told.
The board decided Mr Bowman should leave after an internal inquiry
discovered lax management controls had led to overspending of at least
Pounds 1m of taxpayers' money on a new headquarters building. Two senior
managers were disciplined.
However, a memorandum by the National Audit Office, the public spending
watchdog, shows that the Department of Environment had told the NRA that
principle responsibility for effective financial management lay with the
authority's board as well as the chief executive.
It reveals that, as well as informing Mr Bowman of his responsibilities, a
letter about the line of responsibility had been sent to Lord Crickhowell,
the NRA chairman.
Mr John Wheatley, the new NRA chief executive, told the Commons' public
accounts committee that the board decided Mr Bowman should leave the NRA on
'agreed terms'. The Pounds 125,000 was in compensation for the unexpired
part of his five-year contract.
Mr Wheatley, a board member at the time, said there had been 'no
justification' for dismissing Mr Bowman. Asked if the board had agreed to
pay compensation in order to conceal its own shortcomings, he replied: 'That
was not in our mind.'
The NRA, which monitors the state of the water environment in England and
Wales, decided to relocate its head offices from London to Bristol in
October 1989 at an estimated cost of Pounds 1m.
To save time the NRA, without the chief executive's knowledge, decided to
negotiate a contract with Corporate Design and Construct (CDC) rather than
putting it out for tender. The National Audit Office report also shows how
costs rose, without the board's approval, to Pounds 2.65m.
The NRA's internal inquiry found tendering and contractual failings and weak
financial controls and procedures. It encouraged CDC to ensure that Pounds
1.4m was spent on the project by March 31 last year in order to prevent the
loss of any government grants unspent before the end of the financial year.

MEASURES to speed up clearance through customs for people entering the UK

The charter sets out the standards to which customs officers will work, and
promises surveys of performance. A training programme has been created to
ensure that service is 'courteous and helpful'.
Among moves to speed up travellers are a target of a maximum of 10 minutes
waiting time to declare goods.
Ministers are also arguing for an increase in the value of duty-free goods
which can be imported from countries outside the EC.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Radio-link residential telephone service licensed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE MILLION British homes could have telephone aerials on their roofs by
early next century if a service licensed by the government yesterday is as
successful as its promoters claim.
Ionica, a new enterprise set up by telecommunications industry executives,
has developed a technology based on radio links which it believes will
provide a low-cost alternative to the telephone service currently provided
by BT. It will be targeted at residential and small-business customers.
Since last year's government review of telecommunications policy, most parts
of the market have been open to competition. The market for providing phone
lines to residential customers is still almost a total BT monopoly, although
cable television companies have recently been making inroads.
Mr Nigel Playford, managing director of Ionica and founder of paging company
Cognito, said: 'We intend to undercut BT on price across the board.' He said
that the service would be available to half the population within two years
of its launch and that his Cambridge-based company planned to win at least
five per cent of the residential market in its first 10 years.
The Ionica system uses a radio link from the exchange to a six-inch aerial
on the customer's roof. The use of radio rather than a cable would cut costs
and allow rapid installation of the service, Mr Playford said. He added that
the technology would allow a higher quality of service than that provided by
the cellular system, which is also based on radio links.
Ionica is backed by a group of private investors and advised by Robert
Fleming, the merchant bank. It refused to say how much money it would need
to launch its service or how it would be financed.
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, said Ionica's approach 'offers
the chance to receive the full benefits of a telephone service without the
need for wires to be installed either above or below ground.'
Ionica is to be allocated part of the radio spectrum near the 3GHz frequency
band now used by the armed forces. Ionica may have to share the waveband,
although there is apparently no danger of the calls being mixed up.
There is bound to be some scepticism over whether Ionica's plans are viable
following the failure of telepoint, a radio-based telephone service licensed
by the government in the late 1980s.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Falls in construction orders point to continued recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEP recession in the construction industry shows little sign of
abating, according to figures published yesterday by the environment
department that show a further fall in contractors' order books.
The department said the value of construction orders at constant 1985 prices
during the three months to the end of November fell by 6 per cent compared
with the corresponding period last year, and by 5 per cent compared with the
previous three months.
Orders at the end of the first 11 months of last year were more than a tenth
lower than during the same period in 1990 and almost a quarter down on that
period in 1989.
Mr John Smith, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said on
Monday that competition for work meant that at least half of building
contracts won recently were either loss-making or had a zero margin. He
warned that construction output was expected to fall by about 5 per cent
this year to the lowest level since 1986, and was likely to lead to the loss
of a further 50,000 jobs.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said the order figures for the period from
July to November showed an increase in housing and industrial orders on the
corresponding period in 1990. 'I welcome this latest evidence that orders in
much of the construction industry are showing signs of recovery,' he said.
Miss Joanne Cutler, economist at the confederation, said Mr Yeo's comments
on recovery conflicted with what companies were telling her organisation.
The environment department's most recent figures, for September, October and
November, showed that orders compared with the corresponding period in 1990
were falling or flat in every sector except public housing, she said.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Separatism poll jolts Scottish businesses

SCOTTISH business leaders were gradually recovering their composure
yesterday after an opinion poll suggested that 50 per cent of Scotland's
electorate favour independence.
The ICM opinion poll, for The Scotsman newspaper and Independent Television
News, shows a departure from the pattern of the past four years in which
about 45 per cent of polled Scots have said they would like a devolved
Scottish parliament and 35 per cent have opted for outright independence.
Support for devolution dropped to 27 per cent in the latest poll, while
backing for the status quo was unchanged at 19 per cent.
Mr David MacLehose, director of the Confederation of British Industry in
Scotland, said: 'I don't think if we had an election today we would end up
with a result like that. But the pendulum is definitely swinging towards
separatism.'
Several business chiefs took comfort from the fact that backing for the
Scottish National party, the only party that offers independence, was 26 per
cent. Although this marked a jump of 7 per cent, putting the SNP at its
highest level since 1989, it suggested that only just over half those who
want independence would actually vote for it.
Members of the Scottish business, professional and administrative class
accept with varying degrees of enthusiasm that some form of Scottish
assembly is likely after the general election. A tax-raising Scottish
parliament has been promised by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, while the
Conservatives, in spite of repeated denials, are widely expected to offer
some kind of assembly if they win.
The SNP has gained support from British Steel's decision to close the
Ravenscraig steel plant in Lanarkshire, and from the performance of Mr Alex
Salmond, the party's leader, in a televised public debate on Scotland's
constitution. It has also been helped by the decision of the Scottish
edition of The Sun newspaper to support independence.
The poll put Labour's share of support at 41 per cent, one point less than
it won in Scotland at the 1987 general election. This raises the possibility
that Labour might not win extra Scottish seats from the Conservatives in the
election. Instead the Tories, who stood at 23 per cent, one point less than
in the 1987 election, might lose some seats to the SNP.
Yesterday Mr Malcolm Bruce, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, did
not rule out independence completely. He said: 'What is really needed now is
a united front behind a Scottish parliament as a first step. A further step
to full independence can be argued over once the Scottish parliament is
secured.'
