FT  30 JAN 92 / Insurers unwilling to back investors' scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS are no longer willing to provide cover for the investors'
compensation scheme, a safety net for private investors set up under the
Financial Services Act.
The unwillingness of the insurance market to back the scheme, which pays out
up to Pounds 100m a year, is one of the reasons for a review of the
compensation arrangements which was announced yesterday by the Securities
and Investments Board, the chief investment watchdog.
Privately regulators have told the life assurance and unit trust industries
they will have to pay an additional Pounds 14m into the scheme for the
1991-92 fiscal year. The payment is to help the independent financial
advisers regulated by Fimbra to meet their contribution, which can be up to
Pounds 19m. Earnings of these independent advisers are modest compared with
those of the life assurance and unit trust industries which are regulated by
Lautro.
Regulators believed the high cost of running the compensation scheme would
drive the independent advisers out of business.
The lack of insurance cover for the scheme's next financial year, which
begins in April, does not mean that investors will be unprotected. However,
it leaves investment firms liable for the full Pounds 100m in any one year -
a potential liability that has led to the review of the three-year-old
scheme.

THE INLAND Revenue yesterday invited comments on two draft clauses for the

The clauses deal with the tax treatment of insolvent groups of companies and
are designed to close loopholes on rights to profits for shareholders when a
company is being wound up, and on charges to companies which leave a group
during insolvency proceedings.
The new legislation follows the defeat of the Revenue last year in a Court

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Sainsbury staff face Sunday pay cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. SAINSBURY, Britain's largest food retailer, yesterday announced new pay
rates for Sunday which will mean cuts for some staff.
Double-time overtime rates now paid for Sunday working will be replaced by
premium payments at up to 37p an hour less.
The move was attacked by Usdaw, the shop workers' union, which opposes
Sunday trading.
Usdaw fears the lower rates, which will come into effect in mid March, will
prompt other stores opening on Sundays to cut payments to their staff.
Sainsbury said that Sunday working would remain voluntary. However, it had
decided to change payments for those who chose Sunday as one of their five
working days in a week.
In some cases staff would receive more under the premium payments system,
the company said. Check-out operators with less than six months' experience
in central London would be paid more than double their normal hourly rate on
Sundays.
However, adult checkout operators in central London will receive Pounds 7.17
an hour instead of Pounds 7.54 under double time - a Pounds 2.22 loss for a
six-hour day.
Sainsbury said that it believed the new system was a much better arrangement
for all staff because it reflected how Sunday working would be part of a
scheduled five-day week.
Mr Terry Sullivan, Usdaw national officer, said the premiums would have been
lower but for union pressure. The voluntary nature of Sunday working was
threatened once Sunday was treated as part of the normal working week.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Knapp demands limit on working hours
at BR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of the largest rail union yesterday called for a mandatory limit
on the hours British Rail staff can work after it was revealed that
thousands of staff worked longer than permitted by safety guidelines.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail union, said that -
according to BR's own figures for last year - staff worked more than 72
hours a week on 3,100 occasions, and that on 6,700 occasions staff worked
shifts of more than 12 hours.
Last year BR issued guidelines which laid down a maximum of six days or 72
hours per working week, and a maximum of 12 hours per shift following the
independent inquiry into the Clapham rail disaster in 1988, in which 35
people died. The working of excessive overtime was criticised by the
inquiry.
He added that BR was not even meeting targets that the union regarded as
minima. He was also concerned that the figures disguised the true weekly
picture of hours worked because some workers were carrying over hours worked
in one week to the next.
Mr Knapp expressed concern that signals and telecommunications staff - those
involved at Clapham - are not meeting the safety guidelines, according to
the figures. He said there were 172 occasions when signals and
telecommunications staff worked more than 72 hours in one week in November.
He also called for more government funding so that BR can meet the current
guidelines.
BR said yesterday that the amount of excessive hours worked by staff had
been significantly reduced.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: Judge gives ruling on investment
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTRACT between the Barlow Clowes investment company and its clients
did not permit an alternative investment policy to keeping funds in
government stocks, the trial judge told the Old Bailey jury yesterday.
Mr Justice Phillips, beginning his summing-up, ruled that the contract
between the company and investors only authorised placing funds on deposit
elsewhere while waiting for the right moment to buy or reinvest in gilts.
The jury might conclude that the company was in breach of this contract, but
it did not follow that a criminal offence had been committed. The central
question was whether the defendants had acted dishonestly, he said.
Mr Peter Clowes, Mr Guy Cramer, Mr Peter Naylor and Mr Christopher Newman
are accused of stealing Pounds 16.9m from investors in offshore funds.
Mr Clowes, Mr Naylor and Mr Cramer are also jointly charged with conspiring
to contravene section 13(1) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act,
which deals with false statements made to induce people to invest. Mr Clowes
alone is accused of eight offences under the subsection. They deny all the
charges.
The judge also warned the jury not to convict because of the defendants'
luxurious lifestyles. The 1980s was a time when some people grew very rich,
in most cases perfectly honestly, he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Plan to bypass unions dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL has withdrawn plans to bypass unions in the new bargaining
structure it is discussing with the rail unions, David Goodhart writes.
It has, however, won provisional agreement that a number of individual
grievances traditionally covered by collective bargaining, such as regrading
claims, should be dealt with by BR management and the individual concerned.
BR proposed early last month that a large number of industrial relations
issues should no longer be discussed at the Railway Staff's National Council
but at the 30-plus profit centres and five BR businesses.
The unions say they are not in principle opposed to a devolution of
bargaining.
There is concern, however, about the provision which makes it impossible to
refer matters up from a profit centre to business or national level.
Mr Richard Rosser, general secretary of the TSSA white-collar rail union,
wrote in the last edition of his union's journal that BR's commitment to
industry-wide bargaining was restricted to general pay awards and one or two
general conditions of employment.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence yesterday denied it had climbed down over plans to
derecognise unions affiliated to the Labour party which represent security
guards.
The TGWU and GMB general unions said Mr Kenneth Carlisle, under-secretary of
state at the MoD, told them yesterday that he was prepared to consider the
principle of whether security guards, who are being moved from blue-collar
to white-collar status, could belong to unions affiliated to Labour.
The MoD told the unions last week that it was the government's view that
political affiliation by a union was counter to the need for the political
neutrality of non-industrial grades in the Civil Service.
It also said that the TGWU and GMB could no longer be involved in the talks
on pay and conditions for the 2,400 security guards who are to be
reorganised and who will join non-industrial grades of the civil service in
April. The MoD and the unions agreed that the ministry had climbed down over
the immediate issue of negotiating new terms and conditions.
Mr Danny Bryan, a TGWU national officer, said: 'The minister said he was
prepared to consider the principle of whether non-industrial grades in the
civil servants could belong to a trade union affiliated to a political
party.'
The MoD said it was happy to consider a paper from the unions, but added:
'Our policy still stands on political affiliation.' It said Mr Carlisle
would consider representations, but was just one junior minister in one
department and could not overrule government policy.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Budget tax reduction of up to Pounds 2bn forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, is expected to announce a small net
reduction in taxes of between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn in his Budget on
March 10, according to a joint study published yesterday.
In their 1992 Green Budget, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies and
Goldman Sachs International, the London-based arm of the US securities
company, say the chancellor is likely to reduce the burden of income tax,
but argue that he should concentrate on helping the business sector.
Their report predicts that the Budget deficit, or public sector borrowing
requirement, for the 1991-92 financial year will total about Pounds 11.8bn
and exceed the government's Autumn Statement forecast of Pounds 10.5bn. It
forecasts a 1992-93 PSBR of Pounds 19.5bn on unchanged government policies,
and says that will constrain the government's scope for a giveaway Budget.
Mr Andrew Dilnot, IFS director, said Mr Lamont would probably delay his tax
decisions until the weekend before the Budget because of electoral
considerations.
Adding to the uncertainty is the weak state of the economy. However Mr Gavyn
Davies, chief UK economist with Goldman Sachs, said he believed the economy
should recover slowly this year. Real economic growth could turn out at
about 1.5 per cent for the year, reflecting the easing of monetary policy in
the past 15 months, an anticipated fall in the personal-sector savings ratio
and an improvement in the financial position of the corporate sector.
In spite of better company finances, the Green Budget - so called because it
is meant to be a discussion document - urges the chancellor to help the
business sector. It advocates action to halt increases in national
non-domestic rate payments by businesses. Planned increases will affect many
companies, especially in the recession-hit south-east of England,
irrespective of whether they make profits or not. By contrast, changes in
corporation tax only affect those businesses which pay tax.
On income tax, Mr Lamont has the option of cutting the basic rate of tax or
raising tax allowances by more than inflation. Both moves are expensive - 1p
off the basic rate costs about Pounds 2bn, while a 10 per cent rise in
allowances above inflation costs Pounds 2.2bn - and, according to the IFS,
will probably need to be offset by tax rises elsewhere in the system.
Mr Dilnot yesterday emphasised that the chancellor's final decision on
income tax will be a political judgment. He will have to weigh the merits of
easing the tax burden of a large number of low income earners through a rise
in allowances against the simple headline attractions of a cut in the basic
tax rate.
The IFS-Goldman Sachs study assumes that the British economy will grow at a
2.25 per cent annual rate over the medium term. If true, each main party
will be hard-pressed to fulfil its economic policy promises if elected. The
Conservatives would be unable to cut the basic rate of income tax to 20p
from 25p while balancing the budget. Labour would have little scope to go
beyond its short-term spending commitments until 1994-95 without increasing
taxes more than already indicated.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Shortage of gas raises pressure to liberalise market: An
imminent change in policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's expected move to break down barriers against gas imports
from Norway will be welcomed by the power industry as going part-way to ease
an anticipated tightness in supply over the next couple of years.
British Gas warned this week that there may be a shortfall in supply of as
much as 2bn therms a year by 1994, which could force the company to cut
supplies to large industrial users.
The Department of Energy's defence of 'Fortress Britain' on gas imports
coupled with its strong push for more competition in the domestic market has
become increasingly difficult to justify.
In addition, the UK will face growing EC pressure to open its market to
outside competition as Brussels presses ahead with liberalising the
community's internal energy market.
The UK has been one of the strongest supporters of a freer EC energy market
and could be seriously embarrassed if it maintains restrictions on foreign
participation.
The government's expected softening of its stance on imports follows the
conclusion of the first export deal by a UK company late last year. Then
Ultramar, the oil and gas group that has since been taken over by rival
Lasmo, reached agreement to export gas to the Netherlands from its Markham
field which straddles the border of the British and Dutch sectors of the
North Sea.
The Department of Energy has retained an unwritten ban on gas imports since
it vetoed a deal by British Gas to import supplies from Norway's Sleipner
field in 1985.
The government was concerned that the free movement of gas into the UK would
discourage development of some of its own more marginal North Sea gas
fields.
Last year in evidence to the Office of Fair Trading, which was looking into
the development of competition in the gas industry, the department repeated
its belief that excess UK gas supply could easily be soaked up by increasing
demand.
However, the OFT was unconvinced and came down strongly in favour of opening
up the UK market in order to weaken British Gas's monopoly grip on domestic
supply.
The only Norwegian gas that is imported into the UK comes from the Frigg
field as part of a long contract with British Gas. The company imports about
600m cubic feet per day of Frigg gas, but the field is declining, and, while
the contract accounted for 25 per cent of British Gas's needs when it
started nearly 15 years' ago, it now fills eight per cent of the company's
requirement.
Tight UK gas supplies and rising demand have pushed up prices in the past
year. British Gas has been forced to increase prices for gas it sells to
power station customers because of the huge and largely unexpected growth in
demand for new gas-fired power generation.
However, Norwegian gas is unlikely to bridge completely the immediate supply
gap that is looming for the middle of the decade. Norway will have little
spare capacity before the start-up of its giant Troll development in 1996.
At the same time, Norwegian imports are unlikely to be cheap. British Gas
recently broke off talks with the Norwegians because of the high price of
supplies - believed to be 21p to 22p a therm compared with the average rate
of 18p a therm in the UK.
Mr Nick White, gas industry specialist at Arthur D. Little, the management
consultants, said: 'We believe prices will rise by 20 per cent in the next
two years if the UK maintains a closed economy.' Mr White said that imports
could keep prices more stable towards the end of the decade, but will not
stop them increasing.
At the same time, a cross-Channel pipeline link could suck gas out of the UK
and bring UK prices into line with continental rates, which are now slightly
higher. The Channel link could provide access to cheaper gas from former
Soviet republics in the new Commonwealth of Independent States.
BRITISH GAS is overcharging large customers, the Major Energy Users' Council
said yesterday. The council sent a letter of complaint to British Gas last
week about price rises announced in January.
It said: 'Once again British Gas is abusing its monopoly.' The council
argued that the company was increasing prices to industry because Ofgas, the
industry watchdog, would not allow it to overcharge domestic customers.
British Gas said: 'We spelled out quite clearly that the increase of 1.5p a
therm would mean percentage rises of 3.8 to 6.2 per cent.'

BREACHES OF computer security cost business at least Pounds 1.1bn per year,
according to a survey published yesterday.
More than half the 900 companies surveyed said they had suffered a
significant security breach, either through accident or malice, in the past
five years.
The most serious incident reported involved a fire and flood in a finance
company that destroyed all its computers. The immediate cost was Pounds 8m
and the long-term total Pounds 24m.
The survey was conducted by the National Computing Centre with support from
ICL, the computer manufacturer, the Department of Trade and Industry and
Elsevier Publications, the Dutch publishing group.
Companies are still reluctant to inform the police about losses. The average
cost to a company of a hacking incident was Pounds 23,000; the largest
reported cost recorded in the survey from hacking was Pounds 50,000.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Disarmament Race: Sense of urgency prompts Bush to adopt
unilateral tactics - US-Soviet control of nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the six months since the US and the Soviet Union signed the Start treaty,
agreeing for the first time to cut their long-range nuclear arsenals, the
whole context of nuclear arms control has been transformed.
That treaty set reductions of about 30 per cent over seven years. When it
was finally signed, after protracted negotiations, US officials had become
dubious about prospects for continuing the process and about the ability of
the Soviet system to absorb more cuts.
The August coup attempt in Moscow brought the first change to that outlook.
Seizing what many thought could be a last opportunity, President George Bush
announced a range of proposals mixed with unilateral gestures in September.
Having previously staved off negotiations with the Soviets on short-range
nuclear weapons deployed with armies in Europe, the US moved to scrap the
weapons altogether.
Other measures included removing tactical nuclear weapons from ships and
standing down from alert the US Air Force's strategic bombers and missiles
due to be scrapped under Start.
Tuesday's proposals reflect this new approach of unilateral and reciprocal
measures in place of negotiations. They are motivated by a clear sense of
urgency. Stockpiles built up to achieve security through a balance of
destructive power have become, in the former Soviet Union, a source of
potential insecurity.
The US has long wanted to tackle the Soviets' multiple-warhead
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), especially the SS-18, the
biggest weapon in either country's armoury.
Under Start, the number of SS-18s is due to be halved. Mr Bush proposed in
September an agreement to ban land-based ICBMs with multiple warheads
altogether, and his latest proposals are aimed at achieving that.
The SS-18s, based in silos with 10 independent warheads each, are seen as
the most 'destabilising' of weapons, because their launch sites would be
prime targets and the commanders in charge of them would be likely to fire
them off as soon as possible to avoid their destruction.
By contrast, in the US view, submarine-launched weapons, hidden in the
depths of the ocean, are ideal for wielding the threat of riposte to a
nuclear aggressor and are therefore 'stabilising'.
However, this position appeared disingenuous, given that the Soviets held
superiority in land-based ICBMs and the US both numerical and technical
superiority in submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The US deploys 160
10-warhead Poseidon missiles and 480 eight-warhead Trident C-4 and D-5
missiles, making a total of up to 5,440 strategic warheads. Mr Bush's offer
to cut these by a third would bring these numbers roughly into line with
Russia's submarine firepower.
However, the proposed cuts would give the US submarine force a greater
relative weight than now in the nation's 'triad' of nuclear forces - air,
land and sea - all of which are affected by the proposals.
If Russia accepts the proposals, they would mean eliminating 1,500 of the
2,450 warheads on US land-based ICBMs. Plans to deploy the 50 modern MX
Peacekeeper missiles on rail-cars had already been stopped. Now these
10-warhead missiles, able to target different cities, would be eliminated.
The 500 Minuteman III missiles would have their warheads reduced from three
to one, effectively doubling the reduction that was expected under the Start
treaty. Some strategic bombers would be converted to non-nuclear use.
These proposals are in addition to unilateral measures: curtailing the very
expensive B-2 stealth bomber programme, scrapping development of the new US
single-warhead missile known as Midgetman, and halting warhead production
for the Trident D-5.
The main aim of the proposals is to secure the elimination of the SS-18s
based in Kazakhstan and Russia and the modern SS-24s in Russia and Ukraine.
These weapons, known in Nato parlance as 'Satan' and 'Scalpel', amass a
total of more than 4,000 warheads, 1,400 of which were already due to go
under the terms of Start. Also covered would be the more lightweight SS-19
and SS-17, which like the SS-18 were introduced in the mid-1970s, with some
2,000 warheads between them.
Some of Mr Bush's measures, however, are simply a matter of facing up to
hard realities. The cost of Northrop's B-2 bomber had made it a principal
candidate for budget cuts. Planned numbers had already been trimmed from 132
to 75. The production run is now set to stop at 20, resulting in an
estimated cost per aircraft of Dollars 2bn.
The stopping of Trident warhead production - which means that the US will,
for the first time since it has had nuclear weapons, no longer be producing
any warhead - follows a two-year shutdown of the facility at Rocky Flats,
Colorado, where the plutonium cores are produced, pending resolution of
environmental and safety problems.

FT  30 JAN 92 / IMF gives Dollars 2.1bn loan to Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the International Monetary Fund last night approved a Dollars
2.1bn stand-by loan for Brazil which should pave the way for accords with
the country's creditors, report Christina Lamb in Sao Paulo and agencies.
There is, however, doubt over the government's ability to meet the economic
targets needed to secure later disbursements under the loan. The money is to
be disbursed in seven equal quarterly instalments, the first to be released
now there is board approval and later tranches dependent on economic
perfomance.
In its letter of intent, Brazil has pledged to turn its fiscal deficit into
a surplus of 2.4 per cent of GDP, and to bring down monthly inflation (24
per cent last month) to 2 per cent by year-end. Latest indicators, though,
show inflation rising again.
The loan should shore up the position of Mr Marclio Marques Moreira as
economy minister.
He is to fly to Europe tonight to meet members of the Paris Club of official
creditors, some of which are unhappy about Brazil's continuing moratorium on
its Dollars 20bn Paris Club debt. Since last January, it has been paying
commercial creditors 30 per cent of due interest.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Greenspan sees more growth in second quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy remained flat in the fourth quarter of 1991, but Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said he still expected
growth to pick up in the second quarter.
Figures yesterday from the Commerce Department showed that US gross domestic
product grew at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last
year. During the full year, however, the US economy contracted by 0.7 per
cent, shrinking for the first time in nine years.
Mr Greenspan told Senate banking committee confirmation hearings into his
re-appointment that the economy was not declining, merely flat. He
acknowledged, though, that there was 'no bounce.'
Arguing that lower interest rates were beginning to take effect on the
economy, by allowing consumers and businesses to borrow more cheaply, the
chairman also urged Congress not to indulge in tax cuts or spending
increases that would increase the federal budget deficit.
The estimated annual growth rate of 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter,
subject to two subsequent revisions, reflected a surge in exports and
greater home construction, offset by weakness in consumer spending and
business investment.
The Commerce Department said personal spending fell at an annual rate of
Dollars 9.0bn in the fourth quarter, having risen by Dollars 18.8bn in the
third; non-residential fixed investment fell by Dollars 3.1bn after a
Dollars 4.8bn drop in the third quarter.
Net exports of goods and services provided most of the buoyancy in the GDP
numbers, having grown at an annual rate of Dollars 22.8bn in the fourth
quarter after a decline by Dollars 18.8bn in the third.
Economists cautioned, however, that the breakneck pace of US export
expansion might be difficult to sustain because of the weakness in many
overseas economies.
Mr Greenspan defended himself for not having acted sooner to stimulate the
economy, warning senators that the Fed was constrained in cutting its own
short-term interest rates by the need to keep long term interest rates down.
He acknowledged the US economy was suffering from 'a severe bout of
disinflation', but said the Fed's decision in December to cut its discount
rate by a full percentage point to 3.5 per cent 'should be sufficient.'
The chairman's comments triggered a sharp fall in US government bond prices,
as investors concluded he was unlikely to lower interest rates further, at
least for several months.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 47.18 points lower at 3,224.96, on
volume of 247m shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The US Treasury
30-year bond lost more than a point to 102 7/8 , to yield 7.75.

MR Hernando de Soto, top adviser and personal representative of President
Alberto Fujimori of Peru, resigned this week amid accusations of government
involvement in drugs-related corruption, reports Sally Bowen in Lima.
Mr de Soto had been Mr Fujimori's principal, if informal, link for some 20
months in negotiations with the US, initially over re-establishment of
Peru's international financial relations and later on the bilateral
anti-narcotics agreement signed last May.
More recently he had been developing contacts with Europe-based
multinational corporations to secure assistance for an ambitious programme
to cultivate other sub-tropical crops in place of coca, which yields
cocaine.
Mr de Soto alleged, in a hard-hitting resignation letter, that officials in
Peru's coca-growing zones are co-operating with drug traffickers. This
allegation, made at such a high level, will severely embarrass the president
and further jeopardise US aid related to combatting drugs.
Elsewhere in his letter, Mr de Soto said Latin American stabilisation
programmes in general, and Peru's in particular, had benefited only those
close to power.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Disarmament Race: Deployment of submarines to go ahead -
Britain and Trident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ARMS cuts proposed by US President George Bush will not deter
Britain from going ahead with plans to deploy Trident ballistic-missile
submarines, with much greater potential firepower than its current Polaris
system, Mr Tom King, defence secretary, said yesterday, writes David White.
The Bush proposals, which include cutting submarine warheads, would not
affect the UK's plans for obtaining Trident II missiles from the US.
However, he did not specifically rule out the possibility that Britain's
Trident force, due for deployment in the mid-1990s, might go to sea with
less than its full load of warheads.
The new submarines - three under construction and a fourth due to be ordered
soon - will carry up to 16 missiles, with up to eight British-made warheads
each, compared with two or three on the current system. This means a maximum
of 128 warheads per boat.
Mr King said that the UK needed the full fleet of four submarines for
'operational security'. They would carry 'the minimum load necessary' - he
did not say what that would be.
Britain had to pose a credible threat of unacceptable damage to an
aggressor, he said, arguing that such a threat was not in the same league as
that of the US or the former Soviet Union.
However, Britain has previously felt obliged to conform with the spirit of
US-Soviet nuclear arms agreements. Plans for an air-launched missile were
geared to a range of under 500km, for instance.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Department of Commerce approved nearly Dollars 60m worth of
militarily useful US exports to Iran in the 12 months to last September,
including equipment that could help make nuclear weapons, says a report
released yesterday by the Washington-based Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms
Control.
Professor Gary Milhollin, project director, yesterday said the Commerce
Department had approved some of the licences, in spite of opposition from
the Defence and State Departments.
Restrictions applied to exports of militarily useful equipment to Iran
because of its status, under US export law, as a backer of terrorism.
The approvals were of dual-use equipment - items that could have civilian or
military applications. Hence, the shipments would not have been illegal.
A similar series of shipments of such dual-use equipment to Iraq occurred
after Commerce Department approval of exports between 1985 and 1990.
Prof Milhollin said that among the exports approved were items that could
clearly be used for the making and testing of nuclear weapons.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that it had not seen the Milhollin
report but wished to note that 'all of these licences were decided in
accordance with export control policies, following inter-agency review and
with Congress being informed.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia returned to the international arena with
typical flamboyance yesterday, after his mysterious disappearing act.
He unveiled a series of Russian disarmament proposals, which were seen as
the president wanting to 'nail down his position as the man in the driving
seat,' said Mr Andrei Kortunov, a researcher at the Moscow-based Institute
for USA and Canada Studies.
However, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, not all the foreign
policy and defence levers are in Mr Yeltsin's control. He recognised as much
when addressing western anxieties as to who would ratify the Start treaty on
long-range nuclear arsenals, originally concluded by the US and the then
Soviet Union.
Making a start at least, he said that the Russian parliament would ratify
the treaty, and he invited the parliaments of Kazakhstan, Belarus and
Ukraine to follow suit.
Mr Yeltsin's greatest room for manoeuvre lies in his promises to cut the
research into, and production of, missiles and other military hardware,
since Russia controls most of the purse strings in the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
Speaking for other republics, he also announced that Russia, with Kazakhstan
and Kirgizia, would reach agreement with China to cut forces on their common
borders.
Mr Yeltsin, who is to arrive in London today before departing for the US,
also sought to reassure western opinion about fears of a dispersal around
the globe of the former Soviet Union's nuclear scientists and materials. But
he was issuing a statement of Russian intent rather than an overall promise
on behalf of the former Soviet Union.
He said Russia would adopt domestic regulations to limit exports of
materials and equipment that could be used to build nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons. But that will not stop Tajikistan, for instance, from
selling nuclear materials.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Bush Budget: Push to stimulate short-term growth - Tax
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE budget proposes an array of tax changes intended to boost short-term
economic growth, writes Michael Prowse. Biggest surprise is a Dollars 25bn
(Pounds 13.8bn) cut in the amount of personal income tax to be withheld by
employers this year. This will boost the disposable income of the average
taxpayer by about Dollars 350. The move does not need congressional
authorisation.
Lower withholding of taxes should take effect by March 1, if not before. But
total tax liabilities will not be reduced over time, because tax refunds due
next year will be correspondingly reduced. Other temporary measures that do
require congressional approval include:
Temporary tax credit for first-time home buyers of 10 per cent of purchase
price up to Dollars 5,000, if buying before January next year. Those selling
houses at a loss would be able to deduct losses in excess of 10 per cent of
income.
A temporary investment tax allowance, equivalent to 15 per cent of purchase
price of assets (not real estate) if purchased before next January and put
in service by June 1993, in addition to existing depreciation allowances.
Proposed permanent tax code changes include:
An increase in the personal exemption, now Dollars 2,300 a person, by
Dollars 500 for each child under 18, to take effect from October 1. The
relief would be phased out for families earning more than Dollars 157,000.
A cut in the maximum tax on capital gains, now 28 per cent, to 15.4 per cent
for assets held for more than three years, 19.6 per cent for assets held for
two years and 23.8 per cent for assets held one year.
A new Flexible Individual Retirement Account (FIRA). Individuals earning up
to Dollars 60,000 (couples Dollars 120,000) would be able to contribute
Dollars 2,500 per person. No tax deduction up front but interest would
accumulate tax free if deposit held for seven years.
Liberalisation of existing Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Waiver of
penalty on withdrawals to fund medical and educational expenses. First-time
home buyers can also withdraw up to Dollars 10,000 for deposits on homes.
Permanent extension of R&amp;D tax credit. A 20 per cent tax credit for selected
R&amp;D spending had been due to end this June.
Allowing developers and renovators of houses to deduct 'passive losses' on
real estate transactions; Allowing a tax deduction for interest on loans to
pay for college or post-secondary vocational education.
Repeal of luxury tax on boats and aircraft but not other items. Health care
reform plans also call for a tax credit for poor families of up to Dollars
3,700 to help finance health insurance premiums.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Bush Budget: Cheney concedes ground on costly and
controversial programmes - Defence spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE US recession bites deeper, the clamour for a 'peace dividend' after
the end of the Cold War has grown, writes George Graham.
Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, has held the line against radical
cuts in military spending. He has warned repeatedly that nuclear missiles
continue to be produced and deployed on the territory of the former Soviet
Union, and has cautioned against leaving the US with a hollow military
structure to face an uncertain future.
In his spending proposal for the 1993 fiscal year, Mr Cheney has come up
with a request for Dollars 267.6bn (Pounds 147.8bn) of budget authorisation,
cutting 7 per cent in inflation adjusted terms from the 1992 budget.
'The disintegration of the Soviet Union has reduced the threat to US
interests and eliminated the urgency for producing several advanced weapons
systems,' Mr Cheney said yesterday. 'We can now afford to be more deliberate
in the pace at which we modernise our armed forces.'
Mr Cheney has agreed to abandon some costly and controversial programmes,
such as the Seawolf submarine or the B2 stealth bomber. The nuclear arms
reduction proposals now being discussed by President George Bush and
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia offer a further opportunity to cut
spending on the strategic component of the US forces.
In particular, the Pentagon plans a new approach to defence acquisition,
concentrating on research and development and allowing protoonly when it can
be demonstrated they work and are needed. This approach could help avoid
some of the costly white elephants the Pentagon has been burdened with in
recent years, but it terrifies defence contractors, who argue that even if
military technology is preserved, the industrial base necessary for eventual
production will be lost.
The Pentagon has barely adjusted its plans for a reduced conventional force
structure since Mr Bush unveiled the Base Force concept in 1990 - after the
fall of the Berlin Wall but before Operation Desert Storm and before the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
The Base Force already envisaged a 25 per cent reduction in the US force
structure over five years.
The plan built on strategic deterrence coupled with a new effort to protect
against nuclear missiles through the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI);
forward US troop presence in Europe and the Pacific; the ability to respond
to crises such as in the Gulf war; and the capacity to reconstitute forces
in the future should some need arise.
General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, argues it would
be dangerous to cut below the Base Force level of 12 active and six reserve
Army divisions, 12 Navy carrier battle groups, and 15 active and 11 reserve
Air Force fighter wings.
'The plan for downsizing and reconfiguring our forces to the Base Force
level is both prudent and fiscally attainable. Faster reductions risk
destroying the cohesion, morale and military effectiveness of today's
forces,' he warned in his 1992 military strategy assessment, issued
yesterday.
Mr Cheney describes the demands of Congress for faster and deeper cuts as
'hogwash', but the Dollars 50.4bn of savings his plan will bring over the
next five years seem unlikely to satisfy even fellow Republicans.
But Congress itself has shown reluctance to cut troop levels, in particular
reserves, which would have produced quicker spending cuts. Individual
members can be expected to fight tooth and nail to preserve weapons
programmes that are built in their districts.
AMONG programmes affected by planned budget savings are:
The B2 bomber. The Pentagon has for years demanded 75 of the stealth bombers
built by Northrop Corp in California, but Mr Cheney has now agreed to halt
the programme at 20 aircraft, saving Dollars 14.5bn (Pounds 8bn) over the
next five years.
Congress, however, may continue to demand an immediate halt to the B2,
limiting the Air Force to the 15 aircraft already under construction.
SSN-21 Seawolf submarine. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
Pentagon has agreed it no longer needs this new class of nuclear attack
submarine, whose prototype is under construction at General Dynamics'
Electric Boat division in Groton, Connecticut. Savings over five years
should total Dollars 17.5bn.
Comanche helicopter. This light-armed scout helicopter was under development
by Boeing and Sikorsky, but the Army will now make do with its Apache and
Kiowa fleet, upgraded with the new Longbow fire control radar system.
Efforts will be shifted to prototype development, yielding five-year savings
of Dollars 3.4bn.
ADATS missile system. The limited air threat to US ground forces from anyone
but the Soviet Union has led Mr Cheney to end the Air Defence Anti-tank
System under development by Martin Marietta in Florida.
The army will use existing Patriot, Hawk and Stinger missile systems and
develop an improved aircraft tracking system, saving Dollars 1.7bn over five
years.
Other savings should come from the cancellation of the Midgetman small
inter-continental ballistic missile, but these will be partially offset by
spending on an improved guidance system for the Minuteman III ICBM.
The Pentagon also plans to defer development of the Army's Block III tank
and the Losat infantry anti-tank weapon; forego engineering and
manufacturing development for the Amraam air-to-air missile, which is due to
replace the Sparrow; and limit spending on the Navy's fixed distribution
system underwater surveillance network to research.
The cuts spare the F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter programme managed by
Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas's C-17 transport aircraft, and the
administration is asking for a 31 per cent increase in funding for the
anti-ballistic missile Strategic Defence Initiative to Dollars 5.4bn.
Overall, savings in programme budget authorisation for 1993-97 should total
Dollars 50.4bn, although savings in actual outlays are expected to total
only Dollars 27.4bn over the same period.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Bush Budget: White House approach signals break with
Republican past - Budget analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET represents a significant retreat for President George Bush from
past Republican policies.
For the first time in years, the administration is not projecting budget
balance in the medium term. Meanwhile, the welter of tax cuts proposed to
combat recession in the short run contradict the spirit of the Reagan tax
reform act of 1986, which tried to reduce distortions and create a level
fiscal playing field.
The administration expects economic growth to resume this spring and
accelerate through the year.
The main forces spurring recovery are lower interest rates and the budget's
mild fiscal stimulus. The projections show gross domestic product growing by
2.2 per cent between the fourth quarters of last year and this year and then
averaging about 3 per cent until 1997.
Consumer price inflation is expected to stabilise at just over 3 per cent.
Unemployment is forecast to decline slowly, from 6.8 per cent this year to
5.3 per cent in 1997.
The short-term projections are roughly in line with private sector
forecasts. The longer-term projection of 3 per cent growth, however, is
relatively optimistic. The Congressional Budget Office, an independent
adviser to Congress, recently forecast growth of about 2.6 per cent a year
after the immediate recovery from recession.
The administration attributes the difference to the president's growth
package which it says will raise the real growth rate by 0.4 percentage
points per year.
Most of the tax measures are expected to be inexpensive. Excluding the
change in withholding rules, the total impact is to reduce receipts by about
Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 2.87bn) this year.
The biggest revenue loser is the temporary investment tax allowance for
companies, which will cost Dollars 6.1bn. The capital gains tax cut is
forecast to raise Dollars 600m this year, rising to Dollars 3.8bn next year.
Over time the most costly proposal - the planned increase in the personal
tax exemption for children - does not take effect until fiscal 1993, when it
is projected to cost Dollars 4.4bn.
The budget nevertheless reveals a substantial deterioration in the outlook
for the federal deficit, both in the short and long run. This year's deficit
is expected to reach a record Dollars 400bn, compared with a projection of
Dollars 281bn this time last year and recent estimates of about Dollars
350bn.
More serious, the administration has abandoned hope of achieving budget
balance in the medium term.
The deficit is not expected to fall significantly below Dollars 200bn (about
3 per cent of GDP) in the next five years. This time last year, Mr Richard
Darman, the budget director, projected a modest surplus by 1996.
Mr Darman, however, says this budget is prudent. The administration has not,
as many feared, abandoned the discipline of the 1990 budget enforcement act.
The president has not raised the caps on discretionary spending programmes,
nor transferred spending between different sections of the budget - for
example between defence and domestic programmes.
He points out, however, that as a matter of arithmetic the proposed defence
savings of about Dollars 50bn up to 1997 are roughly sufficient to offset
the cost of the proposed Dollars 500 per child increase in the personal tax
exemption, which is the most costly of the president's permanent tax
changes.
The administration is willing to amend the budget enforcement act to allow
defence cuts to be used as an offset if Congress objects to other cuts
needed to finance the child tax exemption.
Mr Darman claims that the president's policy proposals, by stimulating
faster growth, will more than pay for themselves. Relative to business as
usual, they would reduce the deficit by a total of Dollars 66bn by 1997. Why
then has the deficit outlook deteriorated?
In the short term, the recession is to blame. Over the longer run, Mr Darman
singles out the explosive growth of spending on mandatory or 'entitlement'
programmes. Total mandatory spending is projected at Dollars 767bn next
fiscal year, more than half the total federal budget.
The biggest programmes are pensions and health care for the elderly and
poor. Mandatory spending is expected to rise at an annual rate of 7.2 per
cent over the next five years.
Mr Darman says that if growth of mandatory programmes were restricted to
compensate only for inflation and population growth, cumulative budgetary
savings of nearly Dollars 390bn over the next five years would be possible.
He therefore proposes to remedy a 'fundamental flaw in the present system of
budget discipline' by introducing a specific cap on growth of mandatory
programmes akin to the caps on discretionary programmes agreed in 1990.
Under his proposed cap, mandatory spending would be permitted to grow 2.5
percentage points a year faster than population plus consumer price
inflation. If comprehensive health care reforms were introduced, this
ceiling would be reduced to 1.6 percentage points in excess of population
growth and inflation.
The administration says tougher controls of mandatory spending are
'inescapable' if deficits are to be controlled in the future. It remains to
be seen, however, whether curbs on highly popular entitlement programmes
will prove politically possible. In an election year, the answer is almost
certainly 'no'.

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Bush Budget: Commander lacking firepower against
recession - President sets out to lift public confidence and avoid damage to
economy with modest mix of measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT WAS a beautifully crafted, politically astute speech. But at the end of
his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night, it was clear
President George Bush had delivered not so much a tour de force as a tour
d'horizon.
Despite heavy advance billing, Mr Bush offered an unexceptional message to
Americans worried about their jobs and their country's future: sit tight and
stay the course.
His long-awaited growth package turned out to be a modest mix of measures
designed as much to avoid damage to the economy as to bolster public
confidence in an early recovery. This minimalist response to a recession
which has endured longer than any downturn since the 1930s matches the
president's instincts. His cautious approach points to one conclusion: he
has placed his bets on a recovery by early summer as the platform for
re-election in November; a restoration of confidence remains the key in his
view.
Henry Adams, the great essayist, wrote that the president resembles the
commander of a ship at sea. 'He must have a helm to grasp, a course to
steer, a port to seek.'
In the past six months, few people have had much idea where Mr Bush wished
to steer his country. The longer than expected recession caught him
off-guard; the lack of an effective response sent his approval rating into
free-fall. This week, polls showed Mr Bush at 43 per cent, half of the
(admittedly unrealistically high) level achieved after the Gulf war. In his
speech to Congress, Mr Bush took the political offensive by playing his
tested role of commander-in-chief. He invoked the images of an America
triumphant in the Cold War and the Gulf war, the pre-eminent power in the
world.
Mr Bush then alluded to the benefits gained from the victorious struggle
against Soviet communism. He spoke of the prospect of an end to the nuclear
stand-off, through further significant reductions in long-range nuclear
forces on land and at sea. He also proposed cutting a further Dollars 50bn
(Pounds 27.6bn) in defence spending over the next five years, beyond the 25
per cent cut in US armed forces already planned. The Democratic majority in
Congress is looking at cuts of up to Dollars 100bn as part of a 'peace
dividend', but Mr Bush noted that by 1997 he would have cut defence by 30
per cent since taking office in 1989. 'This deep, and no deeper,' he warned.
It took Mr Bush 17 minutes before he mentioned the country's domestic
difficulties. His admission that the economy was the nation's 'primary
problem' was immediately accompanied by a call to arms similar to the days
of Desert Storm. 'I know we're in hard times, but I know something else,' he
said. 'This will not stand.'
Those four words, of course, were the same used to put President Saddam
Hussein on notice that he should withdraw from Kuwait or face the full might
of the US military. On Tuesday night Mr Bush soon revealed that he possesses
a good deal less firepower to deal with the recession.
The overwhelming reason - but one which Mr Bush skirted - is the federal
budget deficit which ballooned in the 1980s and has exploded under his
administration.
Yesterday, in his fiscal 1993 budget submission to Congress, Mr Bush
revealed that the deficit is likely to reach Dollars 399bn in the current
fiscal year - a crippling legacy to future generations and one which
constrains his actions.
In fact, Mr Bush's principal growth measures were not only trailed in
advance by a White House anxious to capture maximum publicity in advance of
the New Hampshire primary election on February 18; they are also modest in
scope.
The biggest surprise is an executive order to employers to withhold less in
federal taxes from workers' pay cheques - a move which the White House
estimates could give a Dollars 25bn stimulus to the economy. The effect
would be to give the average family Dollars 350 per worker to spend this
year; but that amount will be recouped by the government next year when
refunds will be smaller or taxes due will be higher.
Other proposals, which he termed 'short-term', include a Dollars 500 a child
increase in the personal exemption; a Dollars 5,000 tax credit for homes
purchased before the end of the year; a tax credit of up to Dollars 3,750 a
year for the poor to buy health insurance; extension of federal unemployment
benefits; a new 15 per cent investment tax allowance; and a call for a
phased cut in the capital gains tax cut to 15.25 per cent.
This last proposal is likely to run into stiff resistance on Capitol Hill.
Mr Bush raised the stakes by calling on Congress to pass his package by
March 20 - an unrealistic deadline raising the prospect of trench warfare in
the run-up to November, with Mr Bush railing against a 'do-nothing' Congress
just as President Harry Truman did in 1948.
The Democrats will counter that Mr Bush is a 'do-nothing' president, at
least when it comes to falling education standards, health care reform and
other domestic ills. Their case rests on a belief that Americans want a more
activist leader in the White House, that the age of scepticism about
government's ability to solve problems has passed.
By contrast, Mr Bush demonstrated faith in American optimism, the belief
that once the recovery begins the majority of Americans will regain their
confidence, spend money and vote Republican.
'Moods come and go, but greatness endures,' said Mr Bush, 'and maybe for a
moment it's good to remember what in the dailyness of our lives, we forget:
we are still and ever the freest nation on earth - the kindest nation on
earth - the strongest nation on earth.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / The Bush Budget: Proposals steer clear of details - Health
care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush plans to put forward a comprehensive plan to reform
the US health care system next month, but in his State of the Union message
on Tuesday and in yesterday's budget he put forward only the bare outlines
of his scheme.
The plan aims to guarantee access to health care for all poor families
through a transferable health insurance voucher, which the administration
says will be large enough to buy basic coverage: Dollars 3,750 (Pounds
2,106) for a family.
Middle-class families, the administration says, will be allowed to deduct
more of their health care expenses. The administration also aims to solve
the problems small businesses are facing in obtaining affordable health
insurance for their employees by pooling arrangements to give them the same
buying power as large corporations.
Mr Bush explicitly rejected two of the reform proposals adopted by the
Democratic opposition: either a Canadian-style government-managed system or
the 'play or pay' system whereby companies would have to choose between
providing health coverage for employees or paying towards a state scheme.
He called for greater use of managed health plans, a streamlining in
paperwork and a reform of medical malpractice law as ways to control the
soaring cost of health care.
But critics said these measures appeared inadequate in the face of medical
inflation topping 10 per cent a year for the last five years.
The budget also includes Dollars 1.3bn in federal funding for primary and
preventive health care, including more money for community health centres
and for children's vaccination programmes; Dollars 99m for breast and
cervical cancer screening; and Dollars 565m for Aids treatment.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Leaders under arrest but Algeria's opposition battles on:
'There are plenty more people to take over'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SET of cramped rooms on the first floor of a downtown office has become
the last remaining formal presence in Algiers of the Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS).
Here, amid a constant flow of bearded supporters, party officials defiantly
await the next move from the authorities. Last Wednesday Mr Abdelkader
Hachani, the party's acting head, was arrested, joining more than 500
supporters arrested since the military coup on January 11. Mr Abassi Madani
and Mr Ali Ben Hadj, the two main leaders, have been held in detention since
last June.
Since the party won a majority 48 per cent vote in the initial round of the
country's first multi-party elections a month ago, and the annulment of the
second round on January 16, the military-backed government has sought to
neutralise the leadership. By enforcing exclusive religious use of the
mosques, the authorities are also hoping to deny the FIS its most potent
propaganda vehicle.
'There are plenty more people to take over,' declare party officials, who
angrily blame the authorities for moving the political goal-posts by
annulling the elections and defrauding them of victory. 'A movement backed
by the people like ours will not just disappear.'
The authorities calculate that their measures will play on existing
divisions within the FIS, isolate hardliners and give the electorate a pause
to ponder whether they wish to see the party realise its declared aim of
Islamic rule. Such tactics risk a radicalisation of the FIS and a
marginalising of the moderates who have dominated the leadership.
Mr Hachani, represented the movement's moderate face, was willing to work
out a deal with the military-dominated establishment, including Mr Chadli
Bendjedid, the president who was forced to step down on January 11. Indeed,
Mr Chadli's downfall was largely a result of the military's perception he
would make a deal but then be too weak to combat creeping annexation of the
state by Islamic power.
Party elements had also initiated discreet contacts with western governments
and multinational companies, the latter of which were assured their
investments would be respected. Mr Hachani carefully offered a tolerant
version of Islam, rejecting comparisons between religiously mainstream
Algeria and radical Iran.
But events now favour the radicals who have long argued that the imposition
of a western-style democracy was inimical to Islamic rule. This has been the
message coming from those mosques, where the party has its most articulate
imams.
Attempts by police yesterday to arrest an immam at a mosque in eastern
Algiers led to clashes with young militants in which one person was killed
and seven wounded.
According to Mr M'mida Ayachi, author of the first Algerian study of the
Islamic movement in Algeria, the radical side of the party has been in a
minority in Algerian society, which is divided above all else by regional
loyalties and the allegiancies forged during the bitter struggle for
independence from France.
Operating in semi-clandestinity since the early 1980s as an Islamic
movement, the FIS was one the first to take advantage of the February 1989
legislation that permitted a multi-party system. Its main external
inspiration has been the Moslem Brothers in Egypt, says Mr Ayachi.
However, the FIS has exploited Algerians' confused cultural identity, caught
between the French-speaking, western-orientated intellectual tradition
(particularly espoused by the left) and the new nation's declared aim of
being Arab and Islamic. The late President Houari Boumedienne, himself the
product of an Islamic education, encouraged Algeria's Islamic identity and
ensured the state took control of religion to counter the weight of the left
in the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN).
He established an Islamic university in Constantine, changed the weekend to
Thursday and Friday, promoted an extensive mosque building programme and
accelerated Arabisation in schools through the import of Egyptian teachers,
many of whom were Moslem Brothers.
Mr Chadli continued this process by establishing a national network of
Islamic cultural centres, although state-sponsored Islamicisation was
abruptly halted in the mid-1980s when he realised the movement was
undermining the hegemony of the ruling party and conflicted with modern
economic development.
The subsequent confusion over how to deal with this hydra the authorities
had in part created allowed the FIS to emerge as the authentic exponent of
an Islamic society. This was made easier by its infiltration of the mosques.
The movement possesses no recogniseable ideologist and its vaguely worded,
Koran-inspired platform is almost three years old, but the party is
well-organised and well-funded, often with private Saudi money.
Neighbourhood committees provided social services and food for the poor,
and, when legalised, the party offered street-level promises of jobs and
housing to a population suffering from chronic housing problems and youth
unemployment of more than 30 per cent. And it constantly presents itself as
the populist champion of clean government.
The FIS has thus filled a vacuum created by the combination of an
inefficient corrupt bureaucuracy, a one-party system which has failed to
represent the interests of the urban under-privileged and an economic
development programme whose jobs favoured the western educated.
The party's appeal to the urban poor and disgruntled lower echelons of
government administration seems to go beyond Islam. This is borne out by a
study of the Algerian national research centre which found that only 50 per
cent of FIS voters wanted Islamic rule. But in a 25m population of whom 60
per cent are below age 30, 41 per cent of the voting youth supported the
FIS. Such support will remain as long as the grievances are unremedied.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Israel to sell chemicals company stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S slow-motion privatisation programme is poised to take an important
step forward, following unanimous approval by the Knesset finance committee
yesterday for the public flotation of a 25 per cent share in Israel
Chemicals Limited.
The committee has an effective veto over the sale of state companies.
An attempt in 1989 to sell to foreign investors a 50 per cent stake in
Israel Chemicals, always regarded as the premier privatisation prospect
among the state's 150 companies, was blocked by the finance committee,
throwing the privatisation plans into disarray.
The delay has taken on added significance recently, becoming a principal
element in US criticism of the state-heavy economy as Washington assesses
Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.57bn) in loan guarantees to aid
Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union.
The 1989 Knesset committee decision forced the government to adopt a less
ambitious programme, based initially on share issues on the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange.
Minority stakes in companies such as telecoms monopoly Bezeq have been sold
this way. But the failure fully to divest control of any significant company
has led to criticism that genuine privatisation has been thwarted.
After the initial sale approved yesterday, the government intends to go on
to sell a total of 72 per cent of the company, said to be worth up to
Dollars 1.4bn, by the end of this year, including private placement of a 15
per cent block.
Mr Avraham Shochat, a prominent member of the finance committee, said
yesterday that events had proved its 1989 decision correct because, at the
time, the company had been undervalued by the government - and because among
the leading bidders at the time was the late British publisher, Robert
Maxwell.
'We can only imagine what would have happened if (the) shares had gone the
way of the rest of Maxwell's assets,' he said.

<TEXT>
HOPES that Bank of Credit and Commerce International's Hong Kong subsidiary
could be sold to a local bank lessened yesterday after it emerged that the
Abu Dhabi owners of BCCI had not yet provided a guar-antee promised last
Nov-ember.
Abu Dhabi had promised to guarantee the unrecorded liabilities of BCCI Hong
Kong (BCCHK) for an unlimited amount of money and for an unlimited time.
According to businessmen familiar with the negotiations, the Abu Dhabi
owners' position has changed over the past two months and to date the
guarantee has not materialised.
However last night Abu Dhabi claimed that the negotiations on the sale were
proceeding in an orderly manner.
In November the Indonesian-owned Lippo Group, through its subsidiary,
Hongkong Chinese Bank, undertook to create a new banking company, into which
the assets and recorded liabilities of BCCHK would be transferred.
Mr John Lee, managing director of Lippo Group, said yesterday: 'If the
unrecorded liabilities problem is solved, we are ready to take over the
bank.'
It is understood that the receiver has not discovered a 'bank within a bank'
in BCCHK, as have other investigators of BCCI's affairs around the world.
However, BCCHK is believed to have a 'considerable' exposure to other units
of the BCCI empire as well as being subject to numerous holding claims from
interested parties both within and outside Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, 100 angry BCCHK depositors held a rally yesterday outside the
offices of the government-appointed provisional liquidator, Mr Noel Gleeson,
demanding he make a determination on the bank's future by noon tomorrow.
Mr Gleeson said he would have news for depositors 'quite soon.'
It is highly unlikely, however, that by tomorrow he will be able to tell
them whether the bank is to be liquidated or placed under a sell-off
arrangement.

MIDDLE East disarmament, economic development, water resources and
environment are to be discussed by working groups this spring in Europe, the
Middle East, Japan and the US.
The agreement on more detailed talks about regional issues involving Israel,
its neighbours and the international community was reached yesterday during
the second and final day of Middle East talks in Moscow.
The Palestinians, who did not take part in the talks, have asked that the
issue of Jerusalem and human rights also be addressed in multilateral
working committees.
Meanwhile, India said it was establishing full diplomatic relations with
Israel for the first time, completing the Jewish state's links with Asia's
two most populous nations, after China's similar decision last Friday,
writes Hugh Carnegy.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, noted this week that a long period of
diplomatic isolation for Israel was ending.
In the past few months, most Arab countries have engaged Israel in peace
talks and the former Soviet Union, as well as China and India - all key
backers of the Palestine Liberation Organisation - have established full
ties despite Mr Shamir's unyielding policies towards the Palestinians.
Mr Shamir agreed in principle with the opposition Labour party to hold a
general election on June 23, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Ms Sarah Doron,
head of the Likud parliamentary faction, said: 'It was agreed for 23 June'.
However, a Labour party spokesman said agreement on the date would have to
win approval from Labour leaders today.

IRAN yesterday denied reports alleging it was recruiting scientists from the
former Soviet Union for a covert nuclear weapons programme, Tehran radio
reported, AP-DJ reports.
The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying the reports were 'totally baseless'.
British newspaper reports suggested at the weekend that Iran was offering
Dollars 360,000 (Pounds 200,000) to former Soviet nuclear scientists to
develop an alleged nuclear arms programme. Earlier reports alleged the
Iranians had bought nuclear bombs from the newly-independent republics. Iran
denied those allegations.
The Iranian spokesman stressed that Iran was a signatory to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that it was 'also one of the most active
non-aligned countries concerning proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction'.
Iran has two nuclear power plants, a small research reactor bought from the
US before the revolution installed at Tehran University and a second
research reactor recently bought from China. The country is believed to be
about a decade away in being able to build an atomic weapon.
Iran's non-oil exports more than doubled in the last nine months of 1991,
the Iranian news agency IRNA reported yesterday, Reuter reports from
Nicosia. The agency, quoting Mr Abdolhossein Vahhaji, the commerce minister,
said exports rose 110 per cent to Dollars 1.85bn (Pounds 1bn) in the
nine-months to December 21.

FT  30 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Fears over 'Gattzilla the trade monster' -
US greens lead a growing lobby worried about loss of sovereignty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE list of US opponents to the proposed reforms for the Uruguay Round -
the textile, clothes and film industries, organised labour and family
farmers - add the environmentalists.
The Green view of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) is
succinctly expressed on thousands of anonymously produced posters littering
the streets of Paris, Tokyo and Washington, featuring a monstrous Gattzilla
devouring the globe, smashing the Capitol building, spilling DDT with one
hand and squeezing a dolphin to death with the other.
The environmental lobby was split over the North American Free Trade
Agreement, but on the Gatt it is presenting a near-solid front. Twenty-eight
environmental and consumer groups have sent letters to every member of the
US Congress opposing the proposed sanitary and phytosanitary standards in
the draft agreement produced by Gatt director-general, Mr Arthur Dunkel.
The US lobby's lawyers warn that the language in the draft threatens federal
and state environmental regulations if they are more stringent than the
international standards set out in the Rome-based UN commission Codex
Alimentarius. The opposition - in an election year when every politician
from George Bush on down tries to campaign as an environmentalist - could do
great damage to the support for any agreed Gatt package. Fears concerning
loss of sovereignty over the environment in addition to those on national
dumping laws might, at the very least, doom the Multilateral Trading
Organisation (MTO), which has been designed to strengthen Gatt enforcement
of trade rules.
Almost 50 congressman have signed or plan to sign a resolution sponsored by
Mr Richard Gephardt, the majority leader in the US House of Representatives,
which says that under the Dunkel plan 'national sovereignty to set domestic
environmental, health, safety and labour standards will be given away to
foreign countries'.
US environmentalists are still steaming over a Gatt panel's rejection of the
US ban on Mexican tuna, designed to protect dolphins. While trade purists in
Geneva may have welcomed the ruling for its assertion that the US has no
right to exert extra-territorial authority, Washington viewed it with alarm.
What may seem crusading and sanctimonious to some is regarded by
environmental activists as a US duty to exercise leadership and to use its
large market to protect the environment. Just as it would prohibit the
import of cars which pollute or clothes made by slave labour, Ms Lori
Wallach, a lawyer form Ralph Nader's Public Citizen organisation, says the
US should be able to dictate the process by which fish are caught. No
effective environmental or social regime can be established through the use
of moral persuasion alone, she contends.
Ms Wallach and other environmentalists were alarmed by Mr Dunkel's speech
last week in Bangkok, which suggested that rules initiated by countries
under international environmental agreements could be subject to Gatt
challenge. There was little reassurance in his contention that a country
'may' be permitted to place public health or safety or conservation goals
ahead of trade restrictions or that the environment could be recognised only
as 'possible' justification' for regulatory standards.
Environmental lawyers have held countless meetings with US officials to
explain their concerns, only to have every objection ignored.
They have found themselves closer to European Community positions than to
their own government's, supporting the EC effort to win approval for health
and safety measures designed for social objectives like animal welfare.
While the Washington-based Worldwide Fund for Nature has yet to express
itself against the Dunkel draft, when its staff met to discuss its
implications, members were in agreement on one point: ceding US sovereignty
to an MTO was too important a move to be attached to the fast-track
mechanism, which provides for limited debate. Mr Stewart Hudson, a spokesman
for the National Wildlife Federation, said his organisation has also been
dubious about the MTO, but opposition in Congress is already so strong that
the question of getting an MTO approved is now 'almost moot'.
The National Resources Defence Council supported the US administration on
the North American Free Trade Agreement and it worked hard to try to get a
Gatt pact. However, it said it cannot accept, among other things, a
requirement that technical regulations should 'not be more trade-restrictive
than necessary'. The Gatt was not to be left 'to determine whether
particular conservation or public health measures are the preferred or the
only means of achieving protection'.
Along with these concerns, environmentalists have a distaste for what seems
to them the undemocratic Gatt practice of behind-doors negotiation. Ms
Wallach says these talks shut environmentalists out of the decision-making
process, while their business opponents are heavily represented on advisory
groups.
'We see the Gatt as fundamentally flawed,' she said. 'It looks only at the
side of business interests who think only of trade liberalisation. We
represent other values, but we don't even get to see what the US is doing.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / Irish budget ushers in sweeping tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TAX-CUTTING Irish budget was presented yesterday as Mr Charles Haughey,
still under opposition pressure over his alleged role in a phone-tapping
scandal, spent what many expect to be his last full day as prime minister.
Fending off renewed questioning in parliament, he said only that he expected
the Progressive Democrats (PD), minority partners in his coalition
government, to support the budget when it went to a vote late last night.
The PD issued an ultimatum last week, calling on him to resign after the
budget.
The budget was presented by Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, whose
next announcement is widely expected to be whether he intends to enter the
leadership race.
Mr Ahern introduced sweeping tax reforms in the budget, involving a
significant shift from direct to indirect taxes, elimination of many tax
reliefs and loopholes, and simplification of the tax structure.
Calling it a 'pro-jobs tax reform,' he announced a reduction in the basic
rate of income tax from 29p to 27p in the punt, and the elimination of the
upper 52 per cent rate, leaving only a single higher rate of 48 per cent.
Thresholds are also to be raised, amounting altogether to some IPounds 168m
(Pounds 156m) in income tax relief.
Social welfare spending is to be increased by 4 per cent, marginally above a
forecast 3.75 per cent inflation rate for 1992. Mr Des O'Malley, the PD
leader, said last night he was 'extremely pleased' with the budget, calling
it 'a watershed in equity. Income taxes are down and social welfare is up'.
To balance this, revenue is to be increased by, among other measures,
raising the lower 12.5 per cent VAT rate to 16 per cent on a wide range of
goods and services, and increasing excise duties on cigarettes by 16p a
packet.
Overall, government current spending will rise by 6 per cent this year,
necessitating an exchequer borrowing requirement (EBR) of 2.4 per cent of
gross national product, or IPounds 592m, compared to IPounds 501m in 1991.
The rise is within the 2.5 per cent of GNP target set by Mr Ahern last year
and is likely to be well received by the financial and business community.
Tax revenue will also rise by 6 per cent under the new reforms. GNP is
forecast to grow by 2 per cent this year, as are real disposable incomes.
The EBR target slipped last year from 1.9 per cent of GNP as the recession
cut tax and excise revenues and increased social welfare spending. Mr Ahern
now hopes to achieve a target of 1.5 per cent next year.
The public sector pay bill will increase by 9 per cent this year thanks to
awards agreed with civil service unions under the 1990 programme of economic
and social progress.
The motor industry has been given special attention with a 1.7 per cent cut
in car excise duties and a 9p a gallon reduction in petrol taxes. Vehicle
road taxes, however, are to be increased by 20 per cent.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Maxwell told to answer questions on pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kevin Maxwell appears to have lost his legal battle to remain silent
about the whereabouts of Pounds 450m missing from the Maxwell pension funds.
The appeal court ruled yesterday that he must tell investigators all he
knows about the funds.
The court said he could not rely on the long-established privilege against
self-incrimination to justify refusing to answer questions. These have been
put to him under the 1986 Insolvency Act by the provisional liquidator of
Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), which managed Maxwell pension
funds. It was clear that parliament had by implication intended the
privilege should not be available to people facing questions under the 1986
act, the court said.
Mr Maxwell claimed the right to remain silent because of the risk that he
might incriminate himself in the face of possible criminal charges.
In a separate appeal in a private action brought by Mirror Group Newspapers,
the court said Mr Maxwell did not have to comply with an order made last
December requiring him to disclose information about Pounds 170m missing
from MGN.
The action did not involve legislation in which parliament had expressly or
by implication removed the privilege against self-incrimination. It had long
been established in English law that a person facing possible criminal
charges could rely on privilege to avoid answering questions that might
incriminate him, the court said.
The court refused both Mr Maxwell and MGN leave to appeal to the House of
Lords. Last night Mr Maxwell was still considering whether to apply directly
to the law lords for leave to appeal.
The appeal judges also refused to suspend a High Court order made last year
requiring him to answer the provisional liquidator's questions, pending the
outcome of any law lords hearing.
Mr Maxwell, who also faces questioning by a Commons select committee on the
same matter, refused to comment. Mr Monty Raphael, his solicitor, said:
'Obviously Mr Maxwell is disappointed with the outcome and will review his
position today.'
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Maxwell's legal battles are being at least
partly funded by a mystery benefactor. The existence of the 'funder', as he
was referred to in court, came to light in an affidavit of means.
AN EARLY sale of Mirror Group Newspapers was ruled out last night by
administrators to the late Mr Robert Maxwell's private interests. Mr John
Talbot, one of the administrators, said Mr Maxwell's 51 per cent stake was
not for sale at present.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Tories to confront Scottish separatism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday moved to confront Scotland's mounting independence
movement by convening the Scottish Grand Committee for three days of public
debates next month on the country's constitutional future.
The initiative came in the wake of an opinion poll showing 50 per cent of
Scots now favour outright secession from the Union with England and Wales.
As Labour leaders' gave their backing to a system of proportional
representation for a Scottish parliament, a jubilant Mr Alex Salmond, the
Scottish Nationalist leader, said his party was finalising plans to spell
out the economic benefits of independence at the forthcoming general
election.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, indicated that the Grand Committee
debates would answer criticism that the government has ignored a surge in
nationalist sentiment north of the border.
By convening the committee - comprising all 72 Scottish MPs - the Tories aim
to squeeze Labour devolutionists by claiming that Scotland faces a choice
between the Union or the full-blown independence advocated by Scottish
Nationalists.
The committee will meet for one day in Edinburgh and two days in
Westminster. It has no powers to take any decisions. Mr Lang, who yesterday
released a four-page statement defending the government's economic record in
Scotland, is also planning an open letter to Scottish businessmen, calling
on them to spell out the consequences of devolution or independence for the
economy.
In Westminster, Scottish MPs were still reeling from the findings of the
ITN/Scotsman opinion poll that showed 50 per cent favouring full
independence and a slump in support for devolution from 41 per cent to 27
per cent.
The poll also put SNP support up by 6 points to 26 per cent, while Labour
and the Tories fell back 2 points to 41 and 23 per cent respectively.
Both major parties made light of the findings claiming the result was merely
a protest vote. Privately, however, several MPs agreed that the Scots'
disenchantment with Westminster was now reaching crisis proportions.
Labour yesterday moved to promote its plans for a Scottish parliament with
legislative powers by announcing that its ruling national executive had
agreed to back proportional representation for the new body. The proposal
for the adoption of the alternative member system for Scotland and some form
of PR for its proposed Greater London Authority was widely greeted as a
breakthrough by advocates of electoral reform.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Wakeham to lift gas import ban: Approval of UK-Norwegian
deals linked to plans for cross-Channel pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to remove its longstanding ban on gas imports. The
announcement may come as early as today when Mr John Wakeham, energy
secretary, is expected to give the go-ahead for two import deals in a
statement to the Commons.
The decision to sanction imports will represent a significant policy switch
for the government which has resisted moves to open the market since it
vetoed a bid by British Gas to buy Norwegian gas supplies seven years ago.
It comes as the EC Commission presses ahead with plans to liberalise the
Community's energy market. The plans have been supported by the government.
However, the removal of the import ban is unlikely to make up for the supply
shortfall which British Gas believes will hit the UK market by 1994. Norway
has little spare capacity available for export before the mid-1990s.
Mr Wakeham is believed to be linking his approval of the import arrangements
to the construction of a cross-Channel gas pipeline which would allow the
export of UK gas to the continent. He is expected to announce a feasibility
study into the Pounds 200m-Pounds 300m project soon.
Mr Wakeham's statement on imports will sanction an agreement between BP and
two Norwegian energy groups, Statoil and Norsk Hydro, to form a company that
will challenge British Gas in the UK's industrial gas market.
The joint-venture project, which will be headed by a Statoil executive, will
rely on the import of substantial amounts of gas from Norway later this
decade.
At the same time, Mr Wakeham is expected to give the go-ahead for a Pounds
150m deal between National Power, the privatised electricity generator, and
Statoil, Norway's state oil and gas company, to import 2.2bn cu ft of gas a
year. The 15-year pact will provide National Power with enough gas to fuel
two gas-fired power stations.
Under the agreement between BP and the Norwegian companies, and Norsk Hydro
will buy into BP Gas Marketing, which has been supplying industrial users
for 18 months.
The company currently supplies some 25m cu ft of gas a day to about a
hundred customers, but its expansion has been hampered by the lack of
available gas supplies in the UK. The Norwegian gas will enable it to
increase its presence in the UK market where the government is trying to
encourage competition.
BP will hold 50 per cent of the venture, with Statoil taking a 40 per cent
stake and Norsk Hydro 10 per cent. The financial details have yet to be
finalised and depend on the price of recent gas supplies acquired by BP.
In return for government approval of the venture, BP is understood to have
agreed to contribute to the study of the Channel pipeline. The link will
allow UK producers to take advantage of growing competition in Europe's
energy market as the Commission moves to liberalise the energy market.
In the long term, it could also provide access to the UK for cheap gas from
the former Soviet states.
The UK subsidiaries of two major US oil companies, Chevron and Conoco,
signed an agreement yesterday to go ahead with the development of one of the
UK's largest gas discoveries.
The Britannia field is estimated to contain 2,500bn to 3,000bn cu ft of gas
and could enter production in late 1997. The field is expected to have a
life of 30 years.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Bush budget seeks to stimulate US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday offered a mild fiscal stimulus to the
stagnant US economy and held out the prospect of an economic recovery by
spring.
In his Dollars 1,520bn (Pounds 839.7bn) fiscal 1993 budget, Mr Bush proposed
a welter of tax incentives and challenged the Democrat majority in Congress
to pass the measures within 60 days.
The White House strategy relies heavily on a turnround in consumer
confidence over the next few months before the presidential election in
November, with the option of laying the blame on Congress if growth fails to
resume.
Leading Democrats criticised both the budget package and Tuesday evening's
State of the Union address. They vowed to 'stand their ground' and attacked
Mr Bush for failing to provide details of his proposed health care reforms
and showing lack of vision in his approach to longer-term social and
economic problems.
The administration's hopes for an early recovery received cautious support
from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
Testifying before Congress, he pointed to 'very subtle signs' of improvement
and urged lawmakers not to cut taxes to spur growth.
On Wall Street, his remarks were seen as reducing the chance of a further
cut in interest rates. Bond and share prices fell sharply with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closing 47.18 down at 3224.96. Bond investors were also
unsettled by the prospect of higher budget deficits.
The budget projects an increase in this year's federal deficit to a record
Dollars 400bn, the result of the recession and changes in tax withholding
rules which will inject some Dollars 25bn of purchasing power into the
economy this year.
The administration expects economic growth to resume in the spring and
accelerate through the year. Gross domestic product is expected to rise 2.2
per cent between the fourth quarters of last year and this, rising to about
3 per cent in subsequent years.
Figures from the Commerce Department yesterday, however, showed that the
economy was stagnant in the fourth quarter, with GDP growing at an annual
rate of a meagre 0.3 per cent, despite a stronger housing and exports.
Mr Bush's growth package includes a temporary tax allowance worth Dollars
6bn this year to boost business investment, a temporary Dollars 5,000 tax
credit for first-time home-buyers as well as a cut in the maximum capital
gains tax to 15.4 per cent.
In the longer term, the most costly measure is a Dollars 500 per child
increase in personal tax exemptions, to take effect from October.
The order to lower individual tax withholding rates this year does not
require Congressional approval. It provides only a temporary stimulus since
the relief would be clawed back next year.
Mr Bush's proposals for Dollars 50bn cuts in defence spending go beyond the
reductions already planned over the next five years, and involve cuts in
major weapons systems such as the B-2 bomber and the Seawolf submarine.
Mr Richard Darman, budget director, forecast that the defi cit would not
fall significantly below Dollars 200bn over the next five years. The main
reason was uncontrolled growth of federal entitlement programmes such as
pensions and health care for the elderly. He proposed a new cap on
entitlement spending similar to the controls on discretionary spending
introduced in 1990 under the budget enforcement act.
Mr Bush's budget sticks to the provisions of the act, which imposes separate
caps on defence and domestic programmes, but the president signalled that he
would be ready to use modest defence savings to offset the cost of the child
tax credit.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (12): Subsidised security -
Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continued appearance of thousands of perfectly formed wheat circles in
the deserts of Saudi Arabia has economists baffled.
Unlike the corn circles which appear magically in southern English fields,
there is no mystery to these circles' proliferation. The swathe of wheat
circles in the Hail and Qassim regions of Saudi Arabia, the kingdom's wheat
belt north-west of Riyadh, derive directly from the government's policy of
heavily subsidising agriculture to assure a prudent level of food
self-sufficiency.
What raises the economists' eyebrows is the level of support the government
is willing to commit to this policy.
King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, this month authorised payment to the country's
wheat farmers of no less than Dollars 2.1bn for their record 1991 wheat crop
of four million tonnes. On average, agriculture experts reckon, this
amounted to payment of upwards Dollars 480 a tonne for Saudi wheat, compared
with world prices of just over Dollars 100 a tonne.
Since the government embarked on its subsidised path to food security in the
mid-1970s, farmers in their thousands have turned to a low technology
irrigation system using a central pivot and rotating watering pipe,
pioneered in California in the 1940s, and greened the desert with crop
circles - some covering more than 100 hectares each.
The highly subsidised scheme has led to successive bumper harvests and a
large grain surplus. Saudi Arabia's 152,000 farms were already producing
enough wheat by 1984 to meet domestic demand of about 1m tonnes. The
government's largesse since has led to a series of surplus harvests: enough
to fill available Saudi storage capacity of 1.4m tonnes and turn the kingdom
into the world's sixth largest exporter.
Saudi Arabia has exported a total of 9m tonnes of wheat since 1986 to 40
countries, while the subsidies have helped cut food imports by half from 87
per cent of total needs in 1980.
But economists are prone to raise eyebrows at the full and indirect costs of
Saudi wheat production. The direct subsidies are only a part of government
support packages for farming which also include such inducements as 80 per
cent interest-free loans for agricultural enterprises.
More crucial, however, is the cost to the nation's limited water supplies.
Agriculture accounts for at least 90 per cent of the kingdom's annual water
consumption - more than 14bncubic metres. This, since desalinated water is
both too limited in supply and too saline even after purification for
agricultural use, is running down reserves of fossil water which, according
to the best available estimates, have a lifespan of 15-25 years at present
rates of depletion.
'The present wheat policy is little short of a heavily subsidised way of
exporting water,' is one diplomat's gloss on the subsidised programme.
The government, which treats information about water security with the
secrecy it accords information on national security, disputes there is any
dangerous threat to water reserves, maintaining that more aquifers will be
discovered in time. Moreover, it stands solidly behind a policy which,
whatever its economic cost, is also seen to reap vital political profit.
The agriculture programme's impetus came from threats issued by some US
politicians during the 1973 Arab oil embargo that western countries should
retaliate with a food embargo of their own. The kingdom swiftly turned its
prodigious oil wealth to try to counter any such threat through the subsidy
programme. Domestically, moreover, the subsidies also provide affluence and
jobs in the north-western interior which had won few direct economic
spin-offs from the country's oil boom and which is a strongly conservative
Islamic heartland.
Such considerations make the kingdom unlikely to abandon agricultural
support. Since Saudi Arabia is not a member of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, there will also be no external obligation for it to cut
support.
Nevertheless, the government has sought to restore some kilter to
agricultural output by requiring wheat farmers to apply for certificates to
produce the crop - and by adjusting the subsidy to promote cultivation of
barley, of which the kingdom produces 400,000 tonnes a year to feed camel
and sheep, but of which it still imports 3m-5m tonnes a year.
As last year's record wheat harvest indicates, the policy has so far had
limited effect. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia is witnessing elsewhere a growing
and increasingly diversified farming economy. Agriculture is expected by the
government to grow by 7 per cent a year to 1995 by when it is expected to
account for 9 per cent of GDP.
According to figures released last year by the agriculture ministry,
domestic agricultural production rose 40 per cent between 1984 and 1988,
with the value and volume of food imports falling 31 per cent and 41 per
cent respectively over the same period. In the five years to 1990,
agriculture increased its share of GDP from 3.4 per cent to eight per cent,
with employment in the sector rising to 569,000.
So far, the kingdom is truly self-sufficient only in wheat, eggs and dates
of which it is the world's biggest producer with output of 542,000 tonnes
last year.
Heavy - and again heavily-subsidised - investment in dairy farming has
brought the kingdom on the verge of self-sufficiency here too. And, here
too, the farming is on a gigantic Saudi scale. As an illustration, the Al
Safi dairy farm 70km south of Riyadh proclaims itself the world's largest,
with a herd of 20,000 Holstein cattle and a parlour which milks 1.25 million
litres a day.
But here again the cost of producing milk from a desert dairy can be
measured in an expensive use of water. Some agriculture experts in the
kingdom estimate that to produce one litre of milk - taking into account
water used to irrigate the feed, plus that sprayed on the animals to keep
them cool, that which is used to clean the dairy equipment and the gallons
used to water the cows themselves - requires no less than 1,500 litres of
water.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (11): Steady growth - The private
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Saudi private sector will always be something of a tic bird living on
the broad buffalo back of the country's state-run oil industry.
It is a bird the government has eagerly fed to fatten over the past 15 years
with heavy investment in infrastructure, cheap loans, industrial cities, and
other incentives. But, as one Riyadh banker remarks: 'If you add up all the
private sector initiatives in the context of the Dollars 45bn Saudi Arabia
earned with oil last year, it's never going to amount to very much.'
To be strictly accurate, the non-oil sector of the Saudi economy makes up 80
per cent of GDP. However, once the government and the service sector - much
of which itself depends directly on the government - are stripped out, along
with the hugely subsidised agricultural sector, the residual private sector
makes up just over 20 per cent of national income.
And it is this area of the economy - essentially privately run industry -
which the government is most interested in nurturing. The last three
five-year plans have all set as a priority the expansion of the kingdom's
private manufacturing and industrial base, both as a diversification from
oil earnings alone and as an employer for the large cohort of young Saudis
now joining the work force.
To this end, the government has created the now-self-financing Saudi
Industrial Development Fund to offer interest-free lending to industry, and
has built from scratch the two industrial cities of Yanbu and Jubail. It has
also fostered the recent growth of private joint stock industrial investment
companies.
Behind these initiatives lies the government's desire, having done the
ground work by paying for the kingdom's well-developed but highly expensive
infrastructure, to devolve to the private sector the means and
responsibility for its own independent organic growth.
The result so far has been one of steady growth. The kingdom now has more
than 2,000 working factories and is seeing up to 50 new units open annually.
But under the latest five-year plan, which began in 1990, the government
wants to see this rise to up to 80 new factories a year.
If this target can be achieved by sheer enthusiasm alone, it should be
easily attained, given the gung-ho post-war mood among Riyadh's bankers and
businessmen. 'The profits are good, performance is good - people are just
bullish,' says Sheikh Suleiman Olayan, chairman of the large Olayan
industrial group.
There is no question that Saudi Arabia's private sector had a good war. The
influx of more than 800,000 people during the crisis did wonders for
consumer goods, car and property markets last year, particularly in the
Eastern Province. Supplying Kuwait's immediate reconstruction needs also
provided a fillip for Saudi construction companies, which have seen lean
times since the booming early 1980s.
Moreover, seldom has the private sector been more liquid. Banks alone have
some SR200m in liquid assets on their books and money has flowed back into
the kingdom since the war. 'It's a lot to do with sentiment and the feeling
that Saudi Arabia came out of the crisis a more confident and safe place,'
says one diplomat.
However, Saudi Arabia is one of six countries in the limited Gulf market all
pursuing identical policies to encourage manufacturing, all of them heavily
public sector-backed. In each, after nearly 20 years of exploring all
avenues of viable import substitution, the scope for further growth is
becoming tighter.
Moreover Saudi investors generally prefer their money to make fast returns
and stay liquid. The risk and longer-term returns of direct industrial
investment have not traditionally made it the first port of call for most
Saudi investors.
In addition, banks which are still seeing off the painful effects of some
dubious direct investment in the mid-1980s are deeply cautious about making
fresh domestic business lending. Furthermore, given Saudi Arabia's small
population, many bankers reckon that profitable opportunities are in any
case thin on the ground. 'With little more than 7m Saudis, you can only
manufacture so much toothpaste,' says one banker.
To bridge the gap between reluctant Saudi investors and such opportunities
as exist, the government has placed particular emphasis on the growth of
joint stock companies designed specifically to seek and nurture promising
enterprises.
The first such company, National Industrialisation Company, was set up in
1984 and has since invested in 45 companies across a spectrum from aircraft
repair companies, glass manufacturers, canning companies and foundries to
petrochemical groups. Much like a venture-capital company, NIC, which
declared a 1990 profit of Dollars 4.8m and expects Dollars 8m for 1991, in
most cases takes a minority share in a company and appoints a representative
to the board.
According to Mr Khalid al-Thukair, NIC's general manager, the company is
taking a lead the banks should follow. 'You can't blame them for their
caution after the mid-1980s, but now we need more courageous steps from
them,' he says.
Mr al-Thukair is among a growing group of Saudi businessmen who believe the
country can offer not just a broader industrial base but even an expert
springboard for the whole Middle East.
The kingdom's advantages, he argues, are an unmatched infrastructure, cheap
transport and energy, the availability of interest-free loans from the SIDF
for up to 50 per cent of the project and cheap expatriate labour from Asia.
However, these are exactly the same advantages claimed by the kingdom's
neighbours. It is also fair to say that such advantages can be temptingly
sustained only through strong public sector support, which comes down
finally to sustained strong oil revenues.
Nevertheless, as an example of how these factors can combine to make even
the unlikeliest-sounding product a runner in Saudi Arabia, Mr al-Thukair
cites the example of a NIC-sponsored scheme to set up a newsprint factory in
the kingdom. The SR1bn project, due for completion in 1994, will import wood
chips bought on the world market to supply the paper pulp and, he argues,
the plant will supply not only all Saudi Arabia's needs but also export
throughout the Middle East.
NIC's lead in developing manufacturing industry has since been followed by
subsequent joint-stock companies, notably the Saudi Industrial Export
Company, set up in 1989, and the Arabian Industrial Company, a year later.
Allied to these groups are offset contractors, such as British Aerospace,
the lead contractor for the al-Yamamah arms deal, and Hughes Corporation,
which heads up the US Peace Shield arms programme, both of which are
scouring the kingdom for viable industrial joint ventures to fulfil their
reinvestment obligations under their respective arms deals. Since the
BAe-led programme got under way in 1988, 14 projects have been proposed and
11 have won official approval to proceed with full feasibility studies and
business plans.
These projects range from proposals to manufacture drugs, vegetable oils,
military trucks, acrylic products, to the establishment of an aluminium
smelter using locally available bauxite and caustic soda.
No project is yet under way. This is partly because the offset programme has
not yet been able to establish a 'fast track' through the Saudi bureaucracy,
which even well-connected Saudi businessmen often find to be foot-dragging.
But it is also partly, according to some executives in the offset programme,
difficult to find manufacturing opportunities to the scale of the expected
investment.
The British offset deal, for instance, is aimed to see Dollars 1bn invested
in joint projects within 10 years, a sum which will be matched by Saudi
investors. But the total capitalisation of the 140 British-Saudi joint
ventures set up over the past 25 years is only Pounds 328m.
'You often wonder if the Saudis are not trying to develop their
manufacturing too fast,' says an executive in the programme. 'And you also
wonder whether there really are that many opportunities out there in the
first place.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (10): Soaring prices set the pace -
Stock market
</HEADLINE>

THERE is no better measure of Saudi Arabia's business buoyancy than its
stock market. Prices have soared in the past year, doubling the market index
to 175.5 points by the end of 1991.
Moreover, new share issues are generating the kind of excitement among Saudi
investors which is the stuff of misty-eyed nostalgia in London - along with
the market practices which are bringing tears to the eyes of the Saudi
Arabian Monetary Authority (Sama), the market's regulator.
In October, for example, Savola, the successful vegetable oil company, saw
an offer of 1.2m shares to raise capital from SR120m to SR300m subscribed 14
times with 1.6m applicants applying for a total of 15m shares.
After having enthusiastically advertised the offer, Savola found itself
sitting on a rather handy SR4.8bn of pre-payment and was forced urgently to
launch a scheme to return the surplus cash to applicants until a means of
share allocation was decided upon. Some unkind critics suggested at the time
that the urgency of the scheme was not entirely Savola's idea.
The latest new issue, and the biggest in Saudi Arabia's history, is an 8m
share offering by Riyad Bank to increase its capital tenfold to SR2bn. The
offer closes at the end of this month, by which time the bank is confident
that it will have been subscribed three or four times over.
This should be no surprise, given that the shares issue price is SR475
against a going rate for the rest of Riyad Bank shares of more than SR5,000
at the time of issue.
Moreover, although Sama has sought to clamp down on sharp trading practices
by limiting the sale of shares to buyers over the age of 15, bankers in the
kingdom nevertheless report some fairly impressive 'stagging'.
One banker claims that a single investor walked into a bank branch in the
capital to apply for Riyad shares carrying a sheaf of no less than 10,000
photocopied identity cards to support 10,000 applications. Another investor
is said to have turned up with 4,000 photocopied identity cards.
In so far as a donor consents to giving his name to a keen investor, there
is little Sama can do about this practice. Among the sophisticates of
Riyadh, the going rate for the sale of a name is apparently SR250. However,
more crafty investors with a four-wheel drive vehicle are said to make trips
deep into the desert where a clutch of bedouins can be persuaded to hand
over their name, for investment purposes, for the price of some coffee and
dates.
With the soaraway stockmarket such an attractive magnet for funds which
Saudis seem increasingly keen to bring back into the kingdom, Sama is
keeping a close eye on the market - for which all trading takes place
on-screen and exclusively in bank branches.
The market's 50 listed companies have a total market capitalisation of some
SR50bn, although the bank's investment departments which handle the trading
claim that only 10 per cent or so of outstanding shares are actually traded.
'Saudis with big holdings in companies tend to like to hold on to them,'
says one bank trader.
The market is closed to direct foreign investment. Brokers outside the
banking system are also prohibited. Nevertheless, bankers say they are
growing used to a small number of individual investors who seem to have been
particularly active and liquid market players over the past year.
For the first two weeks in January, the market saw an average of 600-700
trading daily with a daily turnover of about 100,000 shares. And prices
continue to boom.
According to Riyad Bank figures, for the first week in January, for example,
the worst performing of the 11 listed bank shares, one of the strongest
sectors, was Arab National Bank, up a paltry 77 per cent on a year earlier.
Riyad Bank itself led the way with a 180 per cent rise on the year in a
sector which averaged share price rises of 124 per cent.
Utilities, with dismal single-figure price rises over the year, presently
lag the market which is now led by National Shipping Company, shares in
which rose 405 per cent over 1991.
But given the huge surplus of cash available to Saudi investors to spend on
domestic stocks - aside from bank deposits they hold an estimated SR40bn in
cash outside the banking market - bankers and regulators are watching the
markets climb very closely indeed.
Saudis do not have to look further than Kuwait to see what happens when a
surging stock market whets the appetite of enthusiastic Gulf investors -
never ones to turn down the chance of a big, quick return. The informal
Kuwaiti Souq al Manakh stock market soared gaily skywards during the early
1980s only to plummet during the oil price slump, leaving total paper debts
of no less than Dollars 94bn.
The Kuwait government is even today mulling over plans finally to write off
the remainder of that debt - a move which will cost the emirate's stretched
exchequer a tidy Dollars 7bn.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (9): An intriguing question - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE kingdom's banks surprised themselves in 1991. Despite the trauma of the
Gulf crisis, which prompted an immediate run on deposits of between 10 to 14
per cent after Iraqi tanks rumbled into Kuwait, the country's 12 commercial
banks have emerged into 1992 for the most part highly profitable and
extraordinarily liquid.
With the 1991 reporting season getting underway, most banks are expected to
announce strong income growth in a market which quickly and adeptly managed
the Gulf crisis traumas and has become increasingly buoyant since. 'It's
been a bit of a surprise quite how well we've all come out of it,' said one
Riyadh banker.
In fact, the initial scramble for dollars and travellers' cheques with which
Saudis greeted the Iraqis' invasion of Kuwait abated soon after August,
1990. Once the air war started, Saudis were quickly convinced that the
allies would win a swift and decisive victory and bankers reported already
seeing a return of funds.
This, combined with handling of the crisis by the Saudi Arabian Monetary
Authority (Sama), the central bank, which bankers are unanimous in
applauding, left many bankers congratulating themselves on a financial
system few of them had believed could prove so robust.
The story since has been one of growth and superabundant liquidity. By
October, 1991, the consolidated assets of Saudi banks, at SR302bn, were 12.5
per cent up on December 1990, and banks were seeing not only the return of
flown deposits, but a further accretion.
'An amazing amount of money has flowed back,' says the chief executive of
one bank which has seen a 25 per cent rise in deposits since March, 1991.
The inflow of funds is well short of a wholesale repatriation of
privately-held Saudi funds overseas, which some estimates put at Dollars
80bn. Nevertheless, bankers say it is at once a reflection of declining
returns in overseas financial markets and a desire by some Saudi investors
to stash funds securely at home where they are exempt from exchange rate
risks and tax complications.
'A lot of Saudi investors got burned during the market movement in the Gulf
crisis,' says one banker. 'They're looking for a breather.'
The upshot has been to leave Saudi banks knee-deep in liquid funds - a
staggering consolidated total of SR200bn of cash, interbank money and
short-term investments at home and overseas. Another reflection of this
influx of money is a recent rise in property prices and a stock market boom,
which by the end of 1991 had doubled the market index to 175.5. The
government, which foresees a SR30bn deficit in this year's budget, has
rushed to embrace the large domestic borrowing potential this liquidity has
opened up. In addition to raising Dollars 4.5bn last year in an
international syndicated loan, the government also drew Dollars 2.5bn from
its home banks - an offer most bankers say they were given little choice but
to accept.
In November, the government also introduced fortnightly offerings of
Treasury bills to supplement their fortnightly offering of development
bonds. Banks have swallowed offerings of both whole and without blinking,
and no bankers doubt the government's ability to finance this year's
deficit. In addition, the government has encouraged state-run subsidiaries,
particularly Sabic, the giant industrial holding company 70 per cent owned
by the state, to finance their ambitious expansion plans through domestic
borrowing.
Ibn Zahr, a Sabic petrochemicals affiliate, is presently raising Dollars
600m from the home market to finance its MTBE expansion scheme. Hadeed, the
Sabic steel group, raised Dollars 500m last year, and al-Sharq, the ethylene
producer, Dollars 600m, to list only some projects.
These lending opportunities have also been warmly welcomed by Saudi banks
which, since the bad loans crisis precipitated by the oil-price slump in the
mid-1980s, have been increasingly chary of lending to the domestic private
sector in a market where good lending opportunities are anyway limited.
Banks typically hold only 30 per cent of their assets as loans and advances.
For most banks, the tedious, complex and time-consuming process of
recovering the bad debts of the 1986 slump - a procedure conducted
essentially by face-to-face negotiations with each debtor - is behind them.
The effects of the debt crisis are not yet entirely over, however. Some
provisioning continues: Saudi Cairo, for instance, last year transferred all
of its SR36m profit into provisions and Saudi British Bank raised its
quarterly contribution to provisions last year from SR6m to SR9m.
Some banks are also looking to boost capital, partly to banish any residual
debt problems and partly to catapult themselves into faster growth still.
Riyad Bank, in the most spectacular recapitalisation, earlier this month
issued 8m shares to raise its capital tenfold to SR2bn. United Saudi
Commercial Bank also said this month it will double its capital to SR500m
with an SR250m transfer from reserves. Saudi Cairo is also understood to be
contemplating a SR300m rise in its capital to SR900m, while Bank Al-Jazira,
the kingdom's most troubled with losses in 1990 of SR33m, has also won
Sama's approval to boost capital from SR100m to SR400m.
The biggest question-mark hangs over the privately owned National Commercial
Bank, Saudi Arabia's best-connected and biggest bank, with assets in 1989 of
SR84bn. The bank's accounts were qualified in 1987, 1988 and 1989 under
articles of the banking control law banning lending to a client in excess of
a quarter of reserves and prohibiting some types of credit without security.
The bank has still, unaccountably, not produced figures for 1990, amid
unconfirmed rumours of internal wranglings over management control. The
bank, which has a branch in London, is known to be concerning the Bank of
England which is understood personally to have communicated its concern to
NCB's owners.
Elsewhere, however, the greatest problem facing most banks has been what to
do with their surplus money. For many, the answer has been to invest liquid
funds in a mixed investment portfolio, much of it held overseas. Again
excluding NCB's figures, the result has been to give banks an average 18 per
cent return on equity in the 10 months to October, 1991.
Prospects for domestic business lending, given Saudi Arabia's small
population of about 14m people, of which only about half are Saudis, are
severely limited. 'Even if we threw credit control to the winds, we still
wouldn't be able to get rid of all our funds,' says Mr Andrew Dixon, the
managing director of Saudi British Bank.
Consumer lending is also fraught with uncertainty in a land where the
influence of conservative Islam makes the matter of interest rates deeply
sensitive and where, with Islamic Sharia law the sole formally acceptable
code of conduct, no commercial law containing legally enforceable concepts
of security over loans either exists or appears likely to be promulgated.
Banks are creeping gingerly into what they describe as this 'virgin
territory,' however, by examining ways of offering consumer loans by
guaranteeing payment directly from a borrower's salary - a method widely
used elsewhere in the Gulf.
The banks' success in exploiting this untapped retail lending market will be
an important indicator of how far banks can advance with western-style
products under the eye of the country's influential religious leaders. 'The
big question over the whole banking market is the extent to which these
people are allowed to influence the system,' says one close analyst of the
Saudi market.
So far, the government has been able to borrow both overseas and
domestically at straightforwardly western rates of interest and introduce
Treasury bills without any religious groups crying foul that this is
unacceptably un-Islamic. Louder voices of opposition were recently raised,
however, over the Riyad Bank share issue, which some influential religious
leaders have condemned.
However, Saudi bankers are well used to working within the kingdom's
religious confines. Islamic banks, such as the highly profitable al-Rajhi
Bank, which pay no interest on their large deposits and earn money through
various accepted forms of Islamic trade finance, do particularly well within
these confines. Non-Islamic banks have also managed well enough so far by
quietly referring bad debt cases, where debtors have claimed Islamic
principles as the reason not to repay, to a special and increasingly
effective Sama committee.
The extent to which Saudi banks can grow beyond these religious confines,
however, will be the intriguing question of the decade. But many businessmen
believe that the Saudis, who were once highly suspicious of any form of
banking, are over any such worries.
'If you took the banks from people, they'd scream,' says Sheikh Suleiman
Olayan, a leading Saudi businessman. 'They need banks like they need
electricity or water.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (8): Rulers under pressure - Domestic
consequences of the war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOMESTIC consequences of the Gulf war with Iraq and the presence of
several hundred thousand non-Moslem troops in Saudi Arabia are still being
played out nearly a year after the fighting ended.
The military conflict served to put the ruling elite under pressures which
they had not experienced before, while providing opportunities for activists
at the edges of Saudi society to press for more emphatic changes in the way
the country is run.
Saudi society and its closed family-oriented political structure is
ill-equipped to respond quickly to demands for change. There is no public
debate and very little official information. The role of the media and the
ministry responsible for information appears designed to support that
objective. The royal families and the technocrats who serve them in
government much prefer to resolve issues privately and to act decisively
only when majority opinion appears to demand it. It is a measure of such a
society that the two issues which have most gripped public attention during
the past 18 months are both at the limits of western comprehension, but at
the heart of Saudi Arabia's social and political evolution.
First was the decision in November, 1990, by 45 Saudi women, many of them
graduates, to drive in 15 vehicles through the centre of Riyadh in protest
at the continuing ban on women drivers. It was a public challenge to
authority, an almost unheard-of event in the kingdom. The women were
detained, interrogated, forced to pledge never to repeat the protest, and
dismissed from their jobs. Some have since been allowed to return to work.
Second, came the backlash from the other end of Saudi society, the religious
right. Already disturbed by the sudden influx of so many non-Moslems -
including no small number of American women soldiers who not only drove
vehicles but carried guns - the mutawwa, the civilian enforcers of strict
adherence to Islamic behaviour, began to hit back.
During the last three months of 1991, they made the most simple aspects of
daily life outside the home increasingly irritating for both nationals and
expatriates. The dominant topic of conversation at expatriate gatherings
was, and probably still is, the latest reported excesses of the mutawwa in
harassing women deemed to be incorrectly dressed, or men failing to observe
prayer-time.
Their activities reached such a peak, particularly in the capital, that many
people stayed at home and shopkeepers reported a sharp decline in business
during the traditionally buoyant sales period leading up to December 25.
At this point, the authorities intervened. Precisely how, it is not clear,
but the number of mutawwa on patrol dropped sharply. Diplomats interpreted
the official response as part of a wider move to dampen the activities of a
growing group of younger clergy whose ambitions appeared to go beyond
traditional limits.
Saudis have been aware for some time of the emergence of younger ulema
(preachers) who had been better educated than their predecessors and were
far more aware of the religious implications of Saudi Arabia's international
action. 'They are not very sophisticated people, but, unlike the old men
before them, they have made it their business to know about oil policy and
they watch things like our relations with the US and how this ties in with
the Palestinians and Israel,' said a local businessman.
International human rights organisations have reported that two or three of
the more politically challenging ulema have been detained and several have
been warned or prevented from preaching on Fridays. The religious
establishment has also weighed in with a series of statements issued by
Abdel-Aziz bin Baz, the country's leading cleric, reaffirming Islam's
traditional role.
The longer-term significance of the challenge by the militants is unclear.
Some Saudis insist that it is part of a cyclical pattern and will quickly
fade. Others are less confident and predict that Saudi Arabia's rulers will
have to contend with increasingly less pliant clerics who have already shown
that they reject the line that was previously thought to have been drawn
between religious and political activities.
They also stress that the challenge is not coming as had been expected from
the historically more militant Shia minority in the eastern province, but
from within the Sunni majority.
The hatred expressed by Saudi Shias for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, both
as a result of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war and because of the way their
Iraqi co-religionists were subsequently crushed by Baghdad, is said to have
made them among the most committed government supporters during the past 18
months.
King Fahd has simultaneously faced renewed demands from the country's
liberals, often western-educated graduates, for a more open system of
government that better reflects the changes that are taking place in the
kingdom and in the outside world.
Petitions from such groups in the past year appear to have spurred the King
into announcing a firmer commitment to creating a Consultative Council,
something he has been promising since his accession to the throne a decade
ago. Most Saudis now believe that details will finally be announced before
the end of February and consider that a further postponement would not be
easily accepted.
There is no indication yet as to the likely size of membership, from what
sections of society it will be drawn, or what the role of the council will
be. However, it is assumed that an attempt will be made to balance the
different political and social forces at play and where grievances can be
aired without making any commitment to initiate policy changes.
Liberals would prefer to see it, however, as the first step towards a
properly elected assembly which, while not directly rivalling the authority
of the ruling family, might eventually take greater responsibility for the
daily administration of the nation.
'No one in Saudi Arabia can ignore the fact that we are becoming more, not
less, like other countries,' said an economist employed in the private
sector. 'We are never going to be so rich again. The budget is in persistent
deficit. We are having to borrow internationally. Hard decisions will have
to be made in the future, and, if the people are to support them, then they
will require explanations.'
Saudi Arabia's planned consultative council is in line with trends elsewhere
in the Gulf. Of the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, Kuwait
consistently led the way until it dissolved parliament in 1986. It has
promised free elections in the latter part of this year.
King Fahd's announcement seems to have been well received by the extended
ruling families, difficult though it is to make such assessments. Among the
ultimate arbiters of power in Saudi Arabia, there is no indication that they
feel their grip on power may be weakening. As one elderly family member
patiently explained, the only real threat to the House of Saud would come
from divisions within, not challenges from without.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (7): Changing attitudes - Foreign
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ'S invasion of Kuwait posed immediate foreign policy choices for Saudi
Arabia which it had always sought to avoid. None of the western defence
experts who watched Saudi Arabia's military response to the armoured threat
poised on its border in August 1990 doubt that the correct political
decisions were made, despite the continuing discomfort felt by the country's
rulers.
Had Iraqi President Saddam Hussein chosen to make a substantially larger
gamble by invading Saudi Arabia, the forces which could have been quickly
assembled to challenge a thrust into the eastern province would almost
certainly have been unequal to the task.
Indeed, during the first two weeks of the crisis and probably for much
longer than any generals would care to admit, it is debatable whether Riyadh
could have been successfully defended.
Many Saudis have expressed their pride at the manner in which particularly
their air force and National Guard subsequently performed, but little
appears to have happened to dispel the anxiety that was generated over the
reactions and determination of the country's main armoured units.
The consequence was one that US military planners had long prepared for: a
massive military deployment to secure the industrialised world's oil
supplies in Saudi Arabia, followed by the reduction of the external military
threat. So effectively was the Iraqi threat dealt with that, against most
predictions, US and other allied forces were able to begin withdrawing
immediately after the liberation of Kuwait and the conclusion of
hostilities.
The reaction of the rest of the world, and especially the Arab nations, to
the fall of Kuwait has done much to shape and change Saudi attitudes. A
natural member of the moderate and conservative majority within the Arab
League, Saudi Arabia's previous diplomatic initiatives had been mainly
confined to searching for and sometimes financing compromises between
disputing members. With the occupation of Kuwait, it found itself for the
first time in the front line and the key player in the crisis.
The Gulf Co-Operation Council (GCC), which links Saudi Arabia with Kuwait,
Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain, had been formed a decade
before, in response to the war between Iraq and Iran. Although the GCC's
public purpose was to create a loose economic grouping, there had even then
been voices on the edge of the inaugural conference warning that the
eventual winner of the Iran-Iraq war would be unlikely to return its troops
immediately to barracks. It was also apparent that the best the GCC members
could ever do militarily would be to deter a threat long enough for their
western friends to come to the rescue.
For once, events in the Middle East unfolded according to character. Arab
governments, especially those most closely involved with Iraq, sought to
find a solution within the Arab League and failed.
Saddam Hussein's most implacable enemy, Syria, offered its forces to help
punish him. Egypt remained firmly alongside the US, the Palestine Liberation
Organisation headed off in the opposite and wrong direction, while Iran's
desire to see Iraq crushed was qualified by the build-up of US forces in the
Gulf.
Like most inter-Arab disputes, divisions are rectified either by time or by
the emergence of a greater common threat. Saudi Arabia's initial sense of
betrayal was most sharply directed at Yemen - whose workers were told to
leave the kingdom, at King Hussein of Jordan, and PLO chief Yassir Arafat.
Individual members of the royal family still refer to King Hussein in the
most bitter terms, although relations between the two governments are slowly
improving. Some economic assistance has been resumed to Jordan and there is
considerable common ground between the two countries in their support for US
efforts to build on the slight progress towards a Middle East peace
settlement.
Saudi Arabia should also have drawn its own conclusions from the level of
popular support that Saddam Hussein's aggression initially attracted in
North Africa and among the Palestinians. In those economically deprived
areas, there was little hint of sympathy for the people of Kuwait and, as
the first round of voting in the aborted Algerian elections demonstrated,
there is enthusiasm for those campaigning under the banner of Islam.
The enthusiasm with which Iran has backed the politicisation of Islam in
North Africa could yet threaten its rapprochement with Saudi Arabia, which
has seen the resumption of diplomatic relations and is awaiting an official
visit to the kingdom by President Hashemi Rafsanjani. The competition in
Tehran between the advocates of a consistently militant foreign policy and
those who wish to lay greater emphasis on pragmatic economic co-operation
makes future relations between Iran and its closest neighbours even more
difficult to predict.
For Saudi Arabia, and more especially for Turkey, a new dimension has
recently been added by the emergence of six new Islamic republics in what
was the Soviet Union. Iranian delegations have been busy in all six
republics, and it has plans to open embassies in three of them. Saudi Arabia
is moving along similar lines and the US is being spurred to take a greater
interest because of the substantial nuclear arsenal sited in Kazakhstan.
Initial indications are that the five predominantly Sunni Moslem republics
are most likely to adopt secular, free market policies oriented to the west.
Iran, however, may feel it has a particular advantage in Tajikistan where
the language is closer to Farsi.
The common interest of the six GCC countries, Egypt and Syria in rolling
back the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and now in seeking to counter the use of
Islam as a political tool has not, however, produced many more practical
results.
The Damascus agreement on regional security, signed by the eight nations in
March, seems unlikely to be taken much further. Saudi Arabia believes it
paid generously for the involvement of Egyptian and Syrian battalions in the
Gulf war, but officials say that there was never any possibility of them
being stationed for any length of time in the kingdom. Explanations for this
range from doubts about their military efficiency to the tensions that might
arise over the vastly superior pay rates of the Saudi forces.
Hazardous though it is to draw broad conclusions too soon after momentous
events, the challenge of Saddam Hussein does appear to have confirmed two
trends. First, those countries sheltering under the protection of the US
have more emphatically reaffirmed that choice, rather than seeking a broader
Arab consensus. Officials in Riyadh speak of their country as America's main
strategic ally in the region and further substantial military expenditure in
the years ahead is designed to underline that status.
Second, Islam seems certain to be used increasingly as the rallying point
for the politically and economically deprived and in opposition to US allies
in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's reluctance last September for its bases
to be used to exert further US military pressure on Iraq emphasised that,
despite its strategic choice of a defensive partner, it would again prefer
American troops to remain out of sight.
The virtual withdrawal of the Soviet Union as an influential player in the
Middle East should provide Washington with a unique opportunity to work for
a more durable political order, or just as easily the excuse to turn its
attention to other issues.
US President George Bush and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, have
shown a desire to satisfy some of the Palestinians' political aspirations
and are supported in this by Saudi Arabia. But if the US backs away from the
issue in the face of determined Israeli opposition, the rulers of Saudi
Arabia may be made ever more aware of the hard choices forced on them by the
aggression of Saddam Hussein.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (6): Curbs on funding emerge -
Defence procurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY the time of the war against Iraq a year ago, Saudi Arabia had become the
world's biggest importer of arms.
The crisis over Kuwait could only reinforce its arms-buying ambitions. To
Saudi Arabia and the other countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council the
war brought home a hard reality: that however much they had already spent on
defence, they still could not match the threat.
However, the conflict has not given way to the spectacular weapons buying
spree that some had expected. Several changes have taken place affecting the
country's arms supply relationships.
One is the emergence of funding constraints. A report on the arms trade by
the US Congress's Office of Technology Assessment last year spoke of the
Saudi Arabia's' 'virtually unlimited amounts of cash'. But, after payment of
its own and the allies' war bills and its excursion into government
borrowing, funds are not as unlimited as they were.
Secondly, the Saudi authorities have clearly given priority to the expansion
and improvement of base installations including hardened shelters to receive
aircraft in the event of a renewed crisis. The availability of large modern
harbour and airfield facilities was crucial to the ability of the US and
other allies to assemble forces after Kuwait was invaded.
At same time, western defence companies, having enjoyed only a short-lived
boost from the war itself, are facing sharp cutbacks in their domestic
markets after the end of the Cold War in Europe. Suppliers are competing
desperately against each other for export business. The Saudi market is all
the more important to them now that Iraq is completely excluded as a
customer. Saudi Arabia is also increasingly seen by suppliers as an
essential first foothold for supplies elsewhere in the region.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI),
Saudi Arabia was second only to India and Japan as a customer for big
conventional weapons in the period from 1986 to 1990. In the last year of
that period it overtook both those countries to become the biggest single
customer, with imports, calculated at constant 1985 prices, of Dollars
2.55bn. Over the five years its total purchases of Dollars 10.8bn (still at
1985 prices) were bigger than Iraq's and more than a tenth of arms purchases
by the developing world.
The modernisation of Saudi defences began in earnest during the post-1973
oil boom and created a field for all-out competition between the US, Britain
and France.
France secured its place in the early 1980s with a naval deal including four
frigates and with sales of the Shahine, a version of the Crotale
anti-aircraft missile mounted on tanks. The French have since kept a foot in
the door with sales including coastal defence helicopters and, shortly
before the war, a further FFr3bn (Dollars 550m) worth of air-defence
missiles.
In the mid-1980s, Saudi Arabia was poised to purchase French Mirage 2000
interceptor fighters to complement additional supplies of F-15 combat jets
it was seeking from the US. But US unwillingness to allow it to have the
long-range strike version of the F-15 prompted it to switch to the
Anglo-German-Italian Tornado instead, to fulfil both interceptor and
ground-attack roles. Around that choice was built the wider Anglo-Saudi Al
Yamamah agreement, paid for through the revenue from a dedicated share of
Saudi Arabia's crude oil output.
The initial deal, which also included trainer aircraft and support, was
bolstered by another framework agreement in 1988, the fruits of which - in
terms of equipment supplies - are still awaited. The deal has a potential
value of some Dollars 40bn, but the funding system has proved to be an
obstacle, making it difficult to accumulate a lump sum sufficient to cover
new contract for supplies on the Saudi 'wish list'. This list has included
some 48 more Tornado strike aircraft, about 60 more Hawk jet trainers, six
minehunters and 88 armed helicopters to be made under US licence, as well as
a big new air base at Al Sulayyil, 300 miles south of Riyadh, and other
infrastructure projects.
So far, however, the only military equipment items ordered under the second
phase of the deal have been three of the minehunters, of which one has
already been delivered. How much of the remainder the Saudis will buy, and
when, has been uncertain. Confidence in the Tornado sale, which had been
called into question before the war, was bolstered by the aircraft's
performance and British Aerospace's support during the campaign against
Iraq. But Tornado production in the UK is being run down and re-starting it
threatens to be costly.
The Saudi authorities are expected to keep seeking a diversity of sources
because of continuing restraints on their access to some US weapons. A
request for 72 more F-15 jets, including the two-seat F-15E strike version
denied to them in 1985, is being held up. McDonnell Douglas, the
manufacturer, needs the order to keep its F-15 production line at St Louis
open beyond 1994. Saudi Arabia is the only Middle East country other than
Israel fo possess the F-15. Pressure from the pro-Israeli lobby in Congress
led to a limit of 60 aircraft, but this was lifted after the invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 when 24 were supplied from the US Air Force inventory.
Deliveries of another 12 new aircraft already on order are progressing.
US contracts in the 1980s also included Awacs early-warning aircraft and
refuelling tankers, and a sophisticated command and control system under the
Peace Shield programme.
After complaining of delays in this project, which involves setting up six
underground command centres, the Saudis cancelled the bulk of Boeing's
Dollars 1bn contract just before the outbreak of hostilities against Iraq,
and subsequently brought in Hughes, its rival, instead.
A series of package deals were agreed with the US in 1990, including, before
the invasion of Kuwait, 315 of the latest M1A2 Abrams tanks and, after the
invasion, emergency supplies from US stocks and more than Dollars 7bn of new
equipment including more Abrams tanks, thousands of wheeled vehicles,
Patriot air-defence missile batteries, multiple-launch rockets, Apache
helicopters, transport and tanker aircraft. But a second stage to this deal,
which would have brought the total value to more than Dollars 20bn, was
suspended by Washington.
General Dynamics is hoping to sell a further 235 M1A2 Abrams to the Saudis,
bringing its total sales there to 700. Production of the tank was to have
been halted next April as a result of US defence budget cuts. Saudi orders
so far are enough to keep it going for another three years. The additional
order, the company says, depends on 'evolving national policy towards the
Middle East.'
Vickers of the UK is competing to meet the same Saudi requirement with its
new Challenger 2, being promoted outside the framework of the Al Yamamah
agreement. Saudi officials attended UK trials of the tank in the autumn and
hot-weather trials are planned in Saudi Arabia this summer. If Vickers'
hopes materialise, the company would be producing significantly more of its
new tanks for the Saudis than for the British army.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (5): Gargantuan ambition - Refineries
and petrochemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BECAUSE Saudi Arabia tends not to do things by half, it should perhaps only
be expected that just as the country is engaged in raising oil output
capacity to 10m barrels a day, it is meanwhile busy with a complete overhaul
and expansion of its oil refining and petrochemicals industry.
And, as with the upstream plans, the scale of cost and ambition for the
downstream plan is gargantuan. Including Saudi Aramco's plan to lift oil
production, oil analysts reckon the kingdom is on track to spend more than
Dollars 33bn on developing all aspects of its oil industry by the end of the
decade. This figure includes at least Dollars 10bn on upgrading its domestic
refineries, Dollars 6bn on the petrochemical industry, and nearly Dollars
2bn on extending its oil tanker fleet.
The expansion plans follow a rationalisation of the kingdom's downstream
industries since the arrival in 1986 of Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil minister,
in the seat vacated by Sheikh Zaki Yamani.
The expansion is aimed at making Saudi Arabia the world's largest producer
of unleaded petrol, to lock as much oil into partly-owned refineries in its
main market so as to guarantee demand, and to increase and diversify the
kingdom's petrochemicals catalogue.
Both the refining and petrochemicals expansion are already in progress
although Saudi officials stress that the full programme will not be complete
before the end of the decade. And there are additional plans by Saudi
Aramco, already the world's biggest oil company, to expand its shipping
fleet. Thus, the kingdom expects by the year 2000 to fully integrate its
domestic oil industry, and lock its production firmly into western and East
Asian markets.
The principle behind this integration is 'reciprocal security' between the
kingdom as supplier and its main markets. 'It's widely held that where
there's more integration in the oil markets, there's more stability,' says
one Saudi official. 'Saudi Arabia is looking for stability.'
Mr Nazer began by making organisational sense of the country's upstream
interests, gathering the previously independently managed domestic refinery
under the umbrella of Samarec, which was formed in 1989 to market and refine
the kingdom's oil.
Lubricating oil companies were similarly gathered under the wing of another
new creation, Petrolube, and the Ministry of Oil and Petroleum, which acts
as the holding company for these new concerns, is busy with plans to create
a further group to manage mining and minerals. For this prospective company,
the government is understood to be interested in finding foreign
joint-venture partners.
Once rationalised, Samarec began its expansion plans in 1989 and suffered
only temporary interruption during the Gulf war. In July last year, Samarec
awarded to Foster Wheeler, the US heavy engineers, the project management
contract for upgrading the kingdom's three main domestic refineries at
Jeddah (capacity 90,000 barrels a day), Riyadh (134,000 b/d) and Yanbu
(170,000 b/d). Phase one of the project, to be completed by 1996, will cost
Dollars 2bn and later phases an extra Dollars 8bn. Both joint venture export
refineries, with Mobil at Yanbu (250,000 b/d) and Shell at Jubail (250,000
b/d) will be similarly upgraded.
Samarec's primary aim is to upgrade 'bottom of the barrel': enabling its
refineries to produce higher octane petrol from the kingdom's heavier crude
oil. Samarec is also boosting production of octane enhancers, notably Methyl
Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), a lead substitute for petrol, to enable the
kingdom to meet the domestic imperative announced by King Fahd, the Saudi
ruler, of meeting domestic petrol needs of 500,000 b/d entirely with
unleaded petrol by 1994.
Ras Tanura, the country's biggest refinery, with capacity of 530,000 b/d, is
also to be overhauled in a project expected to cost as much as Dollars 2bn
for the first phase of upgrading. Saudi Aramco, which runs the refinery, in
an apparent and unexplained exception to the Samarec reorganisation, has
signed Brown &amp; Root as project managers for the six-year first phase with
options for two three-year extensions. Should the latter be taken up, the
final bill p more than Dollars 10bn.
The country's other main refinery, the 325,000 b/d Rabigh plant, which is
jointly owned by Samarec and Mr John Latsis, the Greek investor, Saudi
officials say they prefer not to discuss. Officials say the costly refinery
is too basic to fit in with their upgrade plans and that the investment was
just the sort of thing they hope in future to avoid with the newly
rationalised Samarec.
The kingdom's domestic refining plans are only a part of a global strategy
to expand downstream operations. Since Saudi Aramco signed a 50-50 joint
refining deal with Texaco, the kingdom has sought to guarantee market access
for its crude in its main consumer market through participatory ventures.
Under the Star agreement, Texaco receives up to 600,000 b/d of Saudi heavy
crude for its East Coast refinery in the US. This guarantees a market for
the Saudi oil and pleases Texaco by giving them a secure flow of the same
type of crude, enabling their refineries to fine-tune and yield higher
quality petrol.
In August last year, Mr Nazer confirmed a second deal with the Ssangyong Oil
Refining Company of South Korea, under which, Aramco acquired 35 per cent of
the group's equity and an agreement to supply up to 300,000 b/d of oil to
the Korean group's two refineries and petrochemical plants.
This month, feasibility studies on a third such deal were announced with
Japan. Saudi Aramco, in tandem with Nippon Oil, Nippon Mining and Arabian
Oil Company of Japan, is to study investment in 450,000 b/d of refining
capacity in Japan, while studying plans for a further 300,000 b/d refinery
in Saudi Arabia. Neither costs nor dates for the project have yet been
outlined. Saudi officials say there is also 'the intent' to forge a similar
deal in Europe although there have been no decisions reached on where.
Officials say there is no 'magic figure' for the amount of Saudi crude oil
they wish to see locked into these overseas deals. Some oil analysts say the
kingdom may be trying to assure overseas markets for up to half of total
crude production by the end of the century.
Further downstream, the kingdom is also investing heavily in extending its
petrochemicals industry, its fastest growing manufacturing sector. The
industry grew by 3.9 per cent a year between 1984 and 1989 and comprised 3
per cent of GDP in 1990.
Sabic, the state-run industrial company, is well into a Dollars 6bn
expansion plan designed to double its capacity from the present 10m tonnes a
year of liquid petrochemicals, plastics, resins, steels and fertilisers by
the mid 1990s, including more than doubling the output of MTBE to 1.2m
tonnes a year.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (4): An era of self-confidence -
Saudi oil policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOWHERE since the Gulf war has Saudi Arabia demonstrated greater
assertiveness and self confidence than in its oil policy.
Since the last pre-war meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (Opec) in July 1990, the kingdom has boosted oil production by 57
per cent to 8.5 million barrels a day (b/d), raised its share of the
cartel's output from less than a quarter to more than a third and has
embarked on a five-year plan to give it sustainable capacity of 10m b/d and
surge capacity of up to 12m b/d.
Saudi Arabia, which with 259 billion barrels of oil holds a quarter of the
world's known crude reserves, now proclaims that its days as Opec's swing
producer are dead. The kingdom is determined to use its dominant position in
the organisation to enforce its long-term strategy of price moderation and
security of supply - a mix which Saudi rulers are well aware is popular with
the US and its other western protectors. In the phrase of one appreciative
western diplomat it is a policy of 'muscle and moderation'.
It is a position Saudi Arabia needed some muscle to achieve. When Iraqi
tanks in Kuwait and the world's subsequent embargo against Baghdad deprived
the world of six per cent of its oil supply in August 1990, it took Saudi
officials what they described as a 'month of political pain' to persuade
Opec members to allow the kingdom to make up 60 per cent of the shortfall
itself, almost at a stroke.
But by August 27 1990, and with the support of Venezuela and the United Arab
Emirates - the only other Opec producers with much available spare capacity
 -Saudi Arabia had won consent to lift production from its pre-war Opec
quota of 5.4m b/d to more than 8m b/d. It has maintained this level, on
average, ever since.
It also took the considerable muscle of Saudi Arabia's notoriously
over-designed oil infrastructure to enable so great a production leap so
fast. This successful leap, allied with Saudi Arabia's relief at having
escaped largely unscathed from the war, is the fountain of its present
self-confidence.
However, neither the kingdom's willingness to throw its political weight
around nor the sheer size of its oil market clout have been lost on Opec's
smaller and more oil price-conscious members. While Iraq and Kuwait have
remained off-stage, Saudi Arabia's fractious Opec colleagues have been
content to allow the kingdom unbridled production for as long as they
themselves have also been free to produce flat out - and while oil prices
have largely weathered combined Opec output of more than 23.65m b/d. But
with prices now softening and the demand for Opec crude set to make its
seasonal spring dip, Saudi Arabia may be forced to flex its moderating
muscles.
The next test will come when Opec ministers gather in Geneva next month to
decide how to adjust output for a softer market. Price hawks such as Algeria
and Iran will be at the forefront of those lobbying for a reimposed
discipline, and possibly a reimposition of quotas, to shore up prices.
Saudi Arabia, however, has made it plain that it will countenance output
cuts only if these are shared in equal proportion by all Opec members.
Moreover, it wants to see cuts made relative to production capacity. If it
wins its way, the kingdom will therefore safeguard, at least until Iraq and
Kuwait are both back at full production, its augmented share of Opec output
and sustained production of about eight million barrels a day.
There is more at stake for the kingdom than holding present market
leadership. Although Saudi Arabia raised production during the Gulf crisis
to avoid what Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, described as 'spontaneous
chaos' in the oil market, Saudi Arabia was already proceeding with plans
drafted in 1988 for a long-term increase in sustainable capacity to 10m b/d.
The Gulf emergency merely accelerated this programme - at an estimated cost
of Dollars 5bn.
Since the war, Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, has proceeded
apace with plans to implement the new capacity in a programme which, Saudi
officials say, will finally cost Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn and which they
expect to be completed by early 1995.
The first phase largely entailed dusting-off facilities unused since the
kingdom last pumped more than 8m b/d during the early 1980s. During the Gulf
air war, the kingdom revived 146 wells and 12 gas oil separation plants
(Gosps) in the southern oilfields of the Eastern Province. Aramco also
drilled 51 wells and 21 water injection wells to keep production hovering at
8.5m b/d. Eight more Gosps were brought out of mothballs elsewhere in the
kingdom.
Work on the next stage of developing new oilfields and equipping them with
pipelines, gathering stations and new Gosps, is now in train. By late last
year, Aramco had appointed five project managers to oversee this
development: Ralph M Parsons, Fluor Daniel, John Brown, Stone &amp; Webster and
Abb Lumus Crest.
Ralph M Parsons has already pre-qualified contractors for the work at
Hawiyah in the Ghawar oilfields, Saudi Arabia's largest, where Dollars 200m
worth of construction is needed to complete a new 300,000 b/d Gosp and
expand pumping and handling facilities. Fluor Daniel has also started
co-ordinating work worth an expected Dollars 700m to upgrade plant in the
Marjan and Zuluf northern oilfields.
Perhaps the most intriguing project will be the development of the virgin
Hawtah and neighbouring oilfields south of Riyadh. John Brown Engineers, the
UK-based company, last year won the project management contract for the
fields which are known to hold substantial reserves of premium light crude.
No official reserve figure has been quoted for the Hawtah field, although
there are murmurings of five billion barrels of sweet crude in this area.
Some analysts also believe that the oil found there could be extremely
light.
The new southern fields are also close to the east-west pipeline linking
terminals on the Red Sea and Gulf coast, which the kingdom is also planning
to expand from its present capacity of 3m b/d to 5m b/d.
These expansion projects represent the base for the kingdom's ambitious
plans to expand and upgrade its refining capacity while also broadening and
deepening its already large petrochemicals industry. Moreover, along with
its planned internal oil industry integration Saudi Arabia is also pursuing
integration with its main consumer markets through joint venture refining
deals in Japan, south Korea, the US and perhaps, eventually, Europe.
With such ambitions propelling Saudi Arabia's assertive position within
Opec, the kingdom has little inclination to relinquish its new dominance in
the organisation. Saudi officials are convinced that Opec can, with a
commitment to flexible but moderate prices and to security of supply, fend
off any threat from alternative energy sources well into the next century.
It also sees Opec as a powerful lobby through which to oppose the imposition
in the west of environmental taxes on gasoline, which might in turn threaten
oil producers.
However, at least in its present post-war flush of confidence, the kingdom
seems indisposed to suffer gladly anything it perceives as Opec foolishness.
'If other producers cheat on output by so much as a barrel, the Saudis will
cheat by a million to teach them a lesson,' suggests one oil industry
analyst.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (3): Eagerly awaited guidance - The
budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO financial event in the past few months was more eagerly awaited than the
publication of the budget for 1992. Announced at the end of December, it was
the traditionally sparse document with which Saudis have become familiar,
offering a minimum of information.
But in the absence of a budget last year because of the Gulf war it provided
the first official guidance since 1990 on how well the economy was
performing and, critically for the private sector, how much the government
was planning to spend.
In the only official analysis to accompany the figures, the Ministry of
Finance and National Economy said that the figures were evidence that Saudi
Arabia was undergoing 'a major economic revival.'
The business community seemed to concur. Expenditure has been set at Dollars
48.3bn, 27 per cent up on 1990 and the highest figure since 1985-86,
although still far below the Dollars 83.5bn budgeted in 1982-83. With
revenues estimated to reach Dollars 40.3bn, this left a shortfall of Dollars
8bn which the government said it had already arranged to cover through local
financing.
The projected deficit is Dollars 1.4bn greater than the figures that had
been projected in 1989 and 1990 but lower than during the recession when in
1987 the deficit had widened to more than Dollars 14bn. Since 1982, the last
time that the budget was in balance, Saudi Arabia will at the end of this
year have accumulated gross budget deficits of approximately Dollars 125bn.
No guidance is provided on how much of this remains outstanding.
Historically, the government has tended to overestimate expenditure while
being conservative about projecting revenue. Given the present weakness of
oil prices, the effect on demand of the mild northern hemisphere winter and
the re-entry of Kuwait to the oil export market, industry analysts accept as
reasonable the projected revenue figure of just over Dollars 40bn, although
they would be surprised if it turned out to be any higher.
More than a third of revenues, or some Dollars 14.5bn, has been earmarked
for defence and security. This does not include those arms deals which are
paid for in oil. The other big budget items are education (Dollars 8.3bn),
health (Dollars 3.26bn), transport and communications (Dollars 2.2bn) and
domestic subsidies (Dollars 1.9bn).
The largest single sectoral rise has been made in the education budget which
is up by Dollars 1.32bn. This underlines the huge expansion in the number of
students, now estimated to be about 3m, up from little more than 500,000 in
1967. University attendance has more than doubled in the past 10 years and
is forecast to continue growing at about 15 per cent a year.
Out of the Dollars 48.25bn budget total, the government offers one further
division, distinguishing between the Dollars 34.4bn which is allocated to
recurrent expenditure and the Dollars 13.9bn set aside for what are
described as special projects. It is this last figure to which the private
sector pays most attention, although the government offers no further
information about what those projects may be and how many of them are
military-related.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (2): Victory spurred confidence in
country's future - The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI Arabia's business community says it is feeling happier about the
nation's economic prospects than at any time for several years. The Gulf
crisis provoked a sharp rise in government spending and military purchases
created a boom in commission earnings while the arrival of foreign troops
and affluent refugees from Kuwait injected further cash into the commercial
sector and increased the demand for service industries such as banking and
hotels.
The relative ease of the military victory over Iraq spurred another burst of
confidence in the country's future, drawing back to the kingdom funds which
had fled during the early stages of the crisis. In their wake came
additional money eager to take advantage of new opportunities, prompting a
further surge in prices on the small and already overheated stock exchange.
With property prices also showing signs of recovery and the kingdom
producing more than 8m barrels of crude oil a day the 'feel good' factor,
greatly prized by western politicians seeking re-election, has been much in
evidence.
In such a positive atmosphere the announcement in the long-awaited budget at
the end of December that some Dollars 14bn had been allocated for special
projects was immediately greeted as another boost for the private sector.
'Since last March there has been prosperity here such as people have not
seen for a long time,' said one of the country's leading businessmen. 'This
area has been in recession since 1984. Now there is a sense of being born
again, encouraged by the fact that it has been demonstrated that the private
sector is no longer 100 per cent dependent on government expenditure.'
The euphoria, while all too understandable, cannot be entirely supported by
figures. Certainly the economy grew by more than 20 per cent in 1990 as a
result of increased oil exports. Last year saw a further 5 per cent rise and
total gross domestic product has again topped Dollars 100bn, or some
two-thirds of the peak it hit in the early 1980s.
But although the Gulf war brought those real advantages to the Saudi economy
it was also extremely costly. It has bitten a large chunk out of the
country's reserves, increased the probability of bigger budget deficits over
a longer period and ensured that military spending will continue to consume
an important part of oil revenues.
The government has now paid fully almost all the contributors to Desert
Shield and Desert Storm. This includes nearly Dollars 17bn to the US,
Dollars 1.7bn to Egypt, Dollars 1.5bn in aid to the Soviet Union, Dollars
1bn each to Britain, France, Syria and Turkey, and other substantial amounts
to a number of smaller contributors. In addition Saudi Arabia committed
itself to arms purchases worth more than Dollars 9bn from the US.
Together with the domestic costs of mobilisation, arming, clothing and
feeding some of the friendly forces, plus the investment that was required
to step up oil production, a final bill of Dollars 60bn does not seem
unrealistic.
Reserves held overseas appear to have been drawn down by close to Dollars
10bn and in addition the kingdom raised an international loan of Dollars
4.5bn, a total sum equivalent to just over four months' oil revenues at
current rates of production. A better perspective is provided by comparing
Saudi Arabia's external position 10 years ago. Then the total funds managed
by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency and those available to government
ministries exceeded Dollars 220bn. Today the comparable figure is Dollars
55bn, very little of which is easily realisable.
Economists in the kingdom point out that the government could not finance
another large-scale military build-up without recourse to much heavier
foreign borrowing. They also note that it will be hard pressed to improve
its reserve position in the next few years. The current account deficit for
1990 and 1991 is estimated at close to Dollars 20bn.
The huge drop in reserves over the past decade has further limited the funds
available to the government at a time of increased demand on official
spending. Saudi Arabia has coped with budget deficits for the past 10 years
but as earnings from overseas assets declined it has been forced
increasingly to turn to development bonds and treasury bills to cover the
shortfall.
With the banks eager to find ways of mopping up their excess liquidity, the
government is confident that the Dollars 8bn deficit forecast for this year
can again be comfortably covered. But with no let-up likely in demand for
government spending and oil prices softening, Saudi Arabia is accumulating
deficits at a rate which will impose much heavier debt servicing
requirements during the next few years.
The government's fiscal difficulties are beginning to pose real problems for
the maintenance of a virtually tax-free society. The government has looked
at additional revenue-raising measures over the past few years, such as
taxing expatriates and licensing cars but has backed off in the face of
opposition.
While demands for capital spending on the infrastructure have eased, the
level of recurrent expenditure cannot easily be reduced because of high
maintenance costs, wage bills and the annual growth rate in the indigenous
population of some 3.7 per cent which keeps up the pressure on public
services. At the present rate of increase, Saudi Arabia's population will
rise by 35 per cent by the end of the century and double within 19 years.
The military establishment's appetite for more sophisticated weaponry and
defence systems has soared over the past two years. Together with plans to
increase the sustainable output level and develop downstream facilities,
this could involve expenditure of at least another Dollars 40bn by the end
of the decade. Saudi Aramco will meet part of that investment from its own
funds, but the overall implications for the budget are clear.
The members of Opec will need to make their own calculations. If the Saudi
government is this year predicting its revenues at around Dollars 40bn
(close to the average achieved in 1990 and 1991) this would suppose, after
costs, oil production of some 8m b/d at an average price of about Dollars
16. It could, of course, earn as much by pumping less at a higher price. But
what the government will not contemplate, even temporarily, is pumping less
at a lower price. 'The days of the swing producer are over', said one
official. 'Maybe there are some people still arguing for it, but the simple
truth is that we cannot afford to be the swing producer and the others had
better understand that.'
There are areas where costs could be cut to the benefit of the economy
although not perhaps to the popularity of the country's rulers. For example,
more than 90 per cent of the water consumed in Saudi Arabia is used for
agriculture and the creation of a large wheat surplus which is then exported
at a heavy net cost to the exchequer. One economist has calculated that the
government could have saved more than Dollars 2bn last year simply by
reducing wheat production to the level needed for domestic consumption.
It is the sort of calculation which will have to be addressed if Saudi
Arabia's spending plans are not to come into more serious conflict with the
revenue limitations imposed by western governments which believe that they
can now impose a political and financial cap on the price of a barrel of
oil.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (1): Resting on its assets - Saudi
Arabia's guardianship of Mecca and Medina, its vital but sensitive
relationship with the west and its capacity to influence neighbouring
economies through Opec are not only the kingdom's strengths but the key
issues which its opponents will try harder to exploit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SAUDI Arabia, protector of the two sites most holy to Islam and possessor of
25 per cent of the world's known oil reserves, emerged jubilant from the
Gulf war. With surprising ease the kingdom appears once more to be resting
comfortably on its assets, tempered by a new international assertiveness
that is being signalled but has yet to be tested.
The public face of the nation is smiling as it contemplates, ever more
distantly, the relative military and economic ease with which it escaped the
threat of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Friendly foreign armies were
summoned, arrived, conquered and - most important - departed, with the
majority of Saudi Arabia's estimated 8m population having known of their
presence only through the media.
Oil is being pumped at near-record levels, the banks are flush with cash and
the stock market bulls are rampant. Few optimists would have predicted such
a positive outcome in August 1990 when Kuwait had been overrun and Iraqi
tanks were at the kingdom's door.
Today there are similarly few Saudis, especially in the business community,
who are willing to voice doubts about the future. The deeply conservative
and absolute rulers of this still tribal and traditional society seem
confident that the country is back on track. In short, nothing much has
changed, although whether that is a cause for unqualified celebration is
more debatable.
The external credit side of the Saudi balance sheet rests heavily on the
assumption that the kingdom's borders are more secure than at any time in
its modern history. Iraq and Iran, the two most dangerously ambitious of
Saudi Arabia's neighbours, have in the past decade had their military teeth
drawn. Their economies have been seriously weakened and hopes of recovery
must in part depend on how Riyadh exercises its supremacy within the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Saudi Arabia still needs the scalp of President Saddam Hussein before it
will feel comfortable about closing the Gulf war chapter and its recent
improvement in relations with Iran is heavily qualified by past memories and
by Tehran's continuing support for Moslem militants elsewhere in the Middle
East, most recently in Algeria where Saudi Arabia welcomed the cancellation
of elections.
Saudi Arabia's guardianship of Mecca and Medina, its vital but sensitive
relationship with the west and its capacity to influence neighbouring
economies through Opec are not only the kingdom's strengths but the key
issues which its opponents will try harder to exploit. The American military
umbrella, which could be denied by the Saudis so long as it remained furled
and out of sight, had finally to be fully admitted last year.
The participation of other Arab and western forces in the defeat of Saddam's
army in Kuwait, however valuable politically, could not disguise the fact
that the essential protector of the House of Saud is very visibly the nation
still known best to Iranians as 'the great Satan'. Despite the heavy
investment in defence planned by Saudi Arabia during the next 10 years, its
ability to counter substantial external threats rests on the country also
viewed by many people in the region as hostile to Islam, devoted to Israel
and the source of much of their suffering.
To that extent the new world order, so enthusiastically promoted in
Washington, is very much the same old order so far as the Gulf is concerned,
but with one important amendment.
There is now little pretence that the defence of the Gulf has a wider Arab
dimension. Efforts to put together a defence pact between the six Gulf
monarchies, Egypt and Syria has made no progress primarily because Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia have shown they would rather be under direct American
protection.
If that is a gamble then Saudi Arabia's rulers would probably argue that it
was one in which they were given little choice, either by the US or by some
of their Arab allies. Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and
Yemen were all felt to have betrayed the kingdom by supporting Saddam
Hussein and have suffered financially as a result.
But such relatively minor retribution disguises a wider necessity: Saudi
Arabia's ability to use financial aid as its most important arm of foreign
policy has been severely limited by the costs incurred in helping others to
defend its sovereignty.
There is no reason to doubt Saudi Arabia's assertion that the overall cost
of the war was close to Dollars 60bn. The kingdom was forced to draw heavily
on its more liquid foreign assets and to push the budget into deeper
deficit. Foreign currency reserves available to the government may have
fallen to as low as Dollars 5bn last month compared with close to Dollars
95bn at the start of the 1980s.
The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency manages another Dollars 50bn, compared
with an estimated Dollars 125bn in 1981, but much of it is required as
backing for the currency and to fulfil other international obligations.
No additional explanation is required for Saudi Arabia's stated
determination to sustain its current level of oil production at around 8m
barrels a day, its insistence on retaining its market share and the
resistance it will mount to growing pressure for it to revert again to its
role as Opec's swing producer. For the foreseeable future, Saudi Arabia's
aim will be to maximise its revenues while maintaining oil prices within the
Dollars 16-Dollars 23 a barrel range.
How this squares with the cuts in production by Opec members that will be
required to accommodate increased Kuwaiti production and the eventual if
limited return of Iraq to the market is not explained.
But just in case Opec members believe Saudi Arabia will eventually fall into
line they are reminded that the kingdom has embarked on a Dollars 15bn
investment programme which over the next three to four years will bring the
level of sustainable crude production to around 10m b/d.
It would be a very expensive threat if Saudi Arabia had no intention of
employing it.
Other Opec producers who are tempted to ignore the implications of Saudi
Arabia's production plans might also profitably study the domestic
background to the government's decision. Oil revenues remain the
overwhelming source of government income in a country where the ruling
family appears unwilling to rescind its cradle-to-the-grave welfare
provisions.
The private protector is making a larger contribution to the country's gross
domestic product, but is not required to match that with personal
contributions to the national exchequer.
The taxation of individuals is still not on the government's agenda. Instead
it has been forced into the novel experience of tapping international
markets for Dollars 4.5bn and borrowing more domestically.
Put another way, the government is going to need every cent of the Dollars
40bn in revenue that it has forecast from oil exports this year, a figure
that is still Dollars 8bn below expected spending levels.
The domestic financial squeeze that will emerge more clearly in the coming
years is being accompanied by a modest but discernible level of political
agitation. The ruling House of Saud earned credit among many nationals for
the way it handled the Gulf crisis, but the shock of war also jolted the
activists on the political extremes.
Western-educated liberals who argue for a more modern state, and the
religious right wing which would prefer it to retreat further into the past,
have both privately and publicly been testing the ruling family's tolerance
levels.
The response so far has been characteristically muted but the announcement
that a Consultative Council will be created suggests that beneath the bland
public exterior there may be the faintest stirrings of political reform.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Appointments: Electric atmosphere in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While Northern Ireland's electricity privatisation programme remains mired
in political difficulties - with the possibility, into the bargain, of a
reversal of the entire endeavour in the event of a Labour victory in the UK
election - some of the key players are taking up their positions for the
forthcoming fray.
Northern Ireland Electricity, which is set to become a public limited
company at the end of March, with possible flotation towards the end of the
year, lost its Yorkshire-born chief executive Tony Hadfield who was lured to
Newcastle last October as the new managing director of Northern Electric.
NIE has now found a replacement in 41-year-old Ulsterman Patrick Haren
(below left), who has been in Dublin in recent years as new business
investment director of the Electricity Supply Board in the Republic.
As NIE battles its way between the competition-minded department of economic
development and an array of Ulster politicians fearful of job losses and
fighting to defend the 'public sector ethic', it is far from clear quite
what sort of organisation Haren will head from March 31.
Meanwhile, economist Geoffrey Horton (below right) is to become director
general of the province's electricity regulator which is designed to come
into being on April 1.
Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator in
England and Wales, had declined the northern Ireland post saying his
workload was too heavy.
The Northern Irish Offer will be a separate entity, but with close links
enabling it to tap into the experience of the longer established regulator.
Horton himself will be based in Birmingham, spending perhaps two days a week
in the province.
Horton, who is 40, has also been working part-time as a consultant to the
National Economic Research Associates although he will give this up when he
takes on Northern Ireland.
He previously worked at the Department of Energy and played a significant
part in the re-organisation and privatisation of the electricity industry in
England and Wales, as well as being involved in setting up the regulatory
regime for Northern Ireland.

of Monday's trading.
A strong opening had been expected for the March contract following Monday's
late squeeze and the firm overnight performance on Wall Street. However,
there was little in the way of buying interest and sellers sent March
drifting lower. The poor Wall Street opening sent the contract to 2,562, the
low of the day, although a recovery was seen late in the session as Walls
Street bounced.
March closed at 2,578, down 16 from Tuesday and around 16 above its
estimated fair value premium of 16. Turnover was only 5,176 contracts.
The traded options market also experienced a dull session with turnover
reaching only 22,820, down from Monday's 28,724. The FT-SE 100 option traded
4,018. Dealers expected a higher total ahead of its January expiry this
week.
Tesco was the busiest stock option following a late spate of trading. It
traded 3,221 lots, with James Capel reported to have carried out a majority
of the day's business. This was followed by British Steel with a total of
1,676. Fisons was also busy, trading 1,493 lots.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Business Law: Tax bill in US Congress seems to promote
takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEO HERZEL and WILLIAM A SCHMALZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPORTANT tax bill pending in the US Congress would permit depreciation
of intangibles, including goodwill, for tax purposes. This would appear to
eliminate a major US tax barrier against take-overs.
Just a short time ago, Congress had been carefully scrutinising possible tax
incentives for acquisitions, such as deductions for interest expense, with
an eye towards removing them.
Now it is considering a proposal that appears to increase the tax
attractiveness of acquisitions, especially those in which large premiums are
paid.
In July last year, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, who is chairman of the
powerful Ways and Means Committee, introduced a bill, HR 3035, adding a new
section 197 to the Internal Revenue Code. This was entitled 'Amortisation of
Goodwill and Certain other Intangibles'.
The bill would provide a uniform 14 year amortisation period for goodwill
and other intangibles.
While the bill did not come to a vote during 1991, it seems likely that it
will become a part of some future legislative package since both the
Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service support it.
Because the bill has such an important bearing on acquisition planning,
Congressman Rostenkowski has proposed that, when it is reintroduced into
Congress, it should be made retroactive to the date of its original
introduction last July.
The inability to deduct or amortise amounts paid for goodwill has long been
one of the main constraints in tax planning for acquisitions in the US.
While businessmen recognise that goodwill may be an important business
asset, they also recognise that its value may be fleeting. During the 1980s,
the large premiums paid in acquisitions often resulted in prices that
greatly exceeded the value of tangible assets, further increasing the
significance of the non-deductibility of goodwill.
By allowing amortisation of goodwill, HR 3035 would appear to increase the
attractiveness of acquisi-tions.
A closer examination of the proposal, however, reveals that the motive
behind it is not to provide a tax incentive for acquisitions.
During the 1980s, as the premiums paid in acquisitions increased so did the
incentives for creativity by tax advisers. Acquirers did not accept
fatalistically that the large premiums they paid had to be additional
goodwill.
Instead, the assets of targets were closely scrutinised to ensure that no
possible depreciable or amortisable asset was overlooked.
Along with patents, licences, favourable contracts, the deductible assets
uncovered included such items as:
workforce in place (experience and composition of existing workforce);
information base (business records, operating systems, etc);
customer-based intangibles (market share and composition);
and supplier-based intangibles (any expected special value in the future
from the acquisition of goods and services).
In many instances, the result was that the amount of the purchase price
remaining to be allocated to goodwill was quite small.
However, the Internal Revenue Service challenged many of these claimed
deductions.
Disputes between the Internal Revenue Service and taxpayers involving very
large sums of money ensued over whether these intangibles existed, the
appropriate period for their amortisation, and the portion of the total
purchase price that could be allocated to them.
The disputes are only now beginning to wind their way through the audit
process. Final resolutions by settle-ment or litigation are likely to be
years in the future.
Moreover, because of the highly specific factual nature of these disputes, a
resolution in one case usually provides only limited guidance for other
acquirers and the Internal Revenue Service.
These problems are the driving force behind the proposed legislation.
The uniform amortisation period for intangibles is intended to eliminate
disputes over the existence, value and life of intangible assets.
The bill is designed to be neutral with regard to tax revenue although
savings are anticipated from the reduction in complex disputes. Hence, the
amortisation of goodwill is expected to be financed by increasing the
amortisation period for some intangible assets.
For example, acquired computer software would be amortised over 14 years
rather than the current five years and covenants not to compete would be
amortised over 14 years rather than their likely much shorter lives.
Generally, the benefits (or detriments) of this new legislation would depend
on whether an acquirer bought assets rather than stock. Business
considerations may limit an acquirer's ability to choose.
For example, an acquirer may strongly prefer to buy assets because of
concerns about large, difficult-to-measure liabilities of the business being
acquired.
On the other hand, an acquirer who must make a hostile tender offer can only
buy stock.
A purchase of stock would not automatically permit an amortisation of the
acquired corporation's goodwill since the goodwill itself would not have
been purchased. An acquirer could elect to treat a purchase of stock as a
constructive purchase of assets for tax purposes and thereby come within the
scope of this new provision.
However, generally, this would not achieve the best tax result for an
acquirer because of the immediate taxable gain on the difference between the
purchase price and the tax basis of the assets.
In any contemplated acquisition, the effects of the proposed legislation
should be reviewed in detail.
In situations where, under existing law, large values could be ascribed to
intangibles for which a short useful life could be established, this bill
might reduce the tax benefits from an acquisition.
In situations where the major intangible is clearly goodwill, the bill could
make the acquisition much more attractive.
Accordingly, even if the aggregate effect on the value of acquisitions is
unchanged by the legislation, the allocation of values among individual
acquisitions may be changed drastically, making some previously unacceptable
deals attractive - and vice versa.
Any company considering an acquisition in the US should analyse the likely
effects of this bill and watch its progress in Congress.

FT  30 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Leisure stake sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRIS PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 10 per cent of the equity of First Leisure, the biggest pure UK
leisure group, was sold into the market yesterday by London Merchant
Securities, a move which left the ten-pin bowling and disco operator down 8
at 296p. The line of 15.5m shares was placed at 293p by Cazenove.
The placing was seen in the market as an attempt by Lord Rayne, chairman of
London Merchant, to introduce some liquidity into the stock of First
Leisure, where he is a director and due to take the chair in November from
Lord Delfont. London Merchant's stake in First Leisure has now been reduced
to 15.3 per cent.
Last night, First Leisure chief executive Mr John Conlan said: 'We
understand that London Merchant wanted to reduce its stake in First Leisure
to below 50 per cent of Merchant's own market capitalisation.'
Fisons active
Fisons advanced 13 to 382p in heavy turnover of 8.3m shares on further
consideration of a product relicensing and renewed bid speculation. There
was also busy trading in Fisons in the options market.
The pharmaceuticals company has announced that it will restart manufacture
of its eye preparation Opticrom in the UK, following regulatory approval.
Opticrom is currently banned in the US and the move was seen as the first
stage of its reinstatement. Also, market talk continued to see the company
as vulnerable to predators. Analysts felt that news of the Hanson decision
against bidding for ICI has left the market casting around for
possibilities.
Kleinwort Benson continued to be active in the stock yesterday. It has been
a buyer since the new year, when it singled Fisons out for recommendation in
what it otherwise sees as a neutral sector, arguing that it looks very cheap
in the light of 1993 earnings. Many of the 1993 hopes are pinned on US
approval for the company's anti-asthma drug Tilade.
Commenting on the recent speculation, Ms Barbara Arzymanow of Kleinwort's
pharmaceuticals team said: 'Companies specialising in asthma products must
be noticing that Fisons' problems only relate to manufacturing
difficulties.'
SmithKline Beecham, down 5 at 918p, saw good two-way business as selling was
encouraged by a forecast profits cut by County NatWest and buyers moved in
on weakness in the stock.
Dollar weakness and good results from Merck, of the US, the world's largest
drug company, adversely affected Glaxo, which fell nearly 20 at one stage
before recovering to close 7 off at 848p. Merck pointed to the very healthy
performance of the anti-ulcer drug Losec, which is a direct competitor to
Glaxo's principal earner Zantac. Further, Nomura was advising clients to
take profits in Glaxo.
Food and detergents group Unilever gained 8 to 921p against the market as
investors took heart from a solid rise in second-quarter earnings from
Procter &amp; Gamble.
International trading group Lonrho, already hit after reporting a lowered
dividend and sharply reduced profits, suffered a further blow yesterday on a
report that it would lose its UK import and distribution contract with
German carmakers Volkswagen and Audi which expires at the end of 1993. The
shares fell 8 to 115 1/2 p in spite of a claim by Lonrho that it hopes to
extend the contract.
Caution ahead of a television documentary last night left Hanson 5 off at
203p with 12m shares traded.
British Gas was among the best performers among the Footsie constituents,
the stock advancing 5 1/2 to 248p on good turnover of 5.1m shares.
Specialists said Gas shares were stimulated by an aggressive institutional
buyer responding to Gas's yield attractions, strong demand in the options
market and some brokers reaffirmining their buy recommendations.
Oil majors diverged, with BP outperforming the market and Shell
substantially underperforming. US funds were said to have switched from the
latter to the former. Much of the switching was said to have been carried
out overnight and in the US, with the remainder transacted in London early
in the session.
BP eased a fraction to 289p on heavy turnover of 9.6m shares, while Shell
declined 8 to 484p on 3m. County NatWest issued a note detailing a cut in
oil demand growth in 1992 and mentioned 'very poor Q4 earnings from the US
oil majors'. The broker said it expected a dull pattern in the oil stocks to
continue over the Q4 results and the forthcoming February Opec meeting, but
said it looked for Shell to prove more robust than BP.
There have been ominous rumblings of exceptionally poor Q4 figures from BP,
expected on February 13, with the market bracing itself for a sharply higher
tax charge.
Turnover in Lucas Industries soared to a five-year high as 11m shares
changed hands after UBS Phillips &amp; Drew weighed in with a hefty profits
downgrading.
The securities house reduced its current-year figure by Pounds 40m to Pounds
20m and the following year's forecast by 50 per cent to Pounds 45m. Mr Tony
Lancelot, at UBS, said: 'Competition is intensifying in many areas where
Lucas operates and recovery is becoming more distant.' The shares retreated
6 to 112p, although dealers noted a certain amount of 'bottom fishing'.
Dowty Group was another victim of a profits downgrading. The shares lost 7
1/2 to 135p after Smith New Court reduced its current-year profits estimate
by Pounds 3m to Pounds 19m and next year's by Pounds 6m to Pounds 27m.
BM Group continued to bask in the glow of its bid for Thomas Robinson
announced last week. The shares jumped 21 to 410p as dealers continued to
appreciate the deal. News of US defence cuts weakened Smiths Industries, a
military contractor in the US. The stock declined 6 to 280p.
The power generators, where investors have until February 4 to pay the next
70p a share instalment on the two stocks, moved sharply higher in the wake
of recent broker recommendations.
County NatWest was said to have given the stocks a strong push yesterday.
They were additionally boosted by recent opinion polls indicating a
Conservative lead over Labour. There were also suggestions that a poll
expected this morning would confirm a Tory lead. National Power moved up 6
to 224p and PowerGen added 7 at 237p. The Scottish generators, which have
underperformed the rest of the utilities since their flotations last summer,
managed minor gains.
Sedgwick, the insurance broker, tumbled 12 to 214p after some determined
selling by one of the big US investment banks.
Negative sentiment on hotel stocks continued following the news that one
leading broker had received reports of poor end-of-year occupancy figures in
London. Forte lost 4 to 231p, Savoy 'A' slipped 8 to 635p and Ladbroke eased
2 to 214p.
Profit-taking in Airtours left the holiday charter group off 7 at 231p.
Pickwick Group suffered similar treatment, following Tuesday's takeover bid
by Carlton Communications, losing 5 to 235p.
Nervousness ahead of today's Rank Organisation finals took 14 off the stock
to 595p as talk of rights issues and dividend cuts continued to circulate.
Buying on economic recovery hopes continued to spur Scottish Television. The
shares rose 15 to 755p, making a jump of 171p or nearly 30 per cent since
the start of the year.
WH Smith 'A' shares were unchanged at 459p in spite of profit figures above
most expectations and an increase to 4.3p from 4p in the interim dividend.
The shares touched 468p in initial response to news that half-year trading
profits had improved to Pounds 50.1m from Pounds 34.9m, but receded after
Sir Simon Hornby, the group chairman, said 'consumer confidence remains at a
low level and we see no prospect of a significant recovery in the economy
over the next few months'.
In a generally firm food retailing sector, J. Sainsbury gained 5 to 374p. In
contrast, Farepak lost 3 to 270p after an increased half-year loss but a
rise in the interim dividend.
BET picked up from the day's low after it was announced that chief executive
Mr John Clark and another BET director bought stock. The shares closed 7 off
at 152p.

FT  30 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Manila recovers after a series of
disasters - The Mt Pinatubo eruption could not stop the market last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political risk looms large in the minds of investors contemplating the
Philippines stock market.
Starting from a deep trough, the market was south-east Asia's best performer
last year and continued to forge ahead in early January, encouraging brokers
in Manila's Makati business district to declare themselves resolutely
bullish.
Mr Irving Ackerman, an American broker resident in the Philippines for 37
years, is in tune with the mood of his colleagues and rivals, but he recalls
self-deprecatingly how he told the Makati Rotary Club, in November 1989,
that Filipinos were about to enjoy their most prosperous period in years. A
week later, a failed coup attempt of which economic effects are felt to this
day destroyed confidence at home and abroad. 'All the things I had said went
into the trash can,' he says.
A series of disasters, including an earthquake, a typhoon and the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, followed the coup attempt, and it was only in 1991 - in
spite of a severe setback prompted by the eruption of the Mt Pinatubo
volcano - that the market recovered from depression. From under 600 in early
January last year, the Manila composite index rose to 1,303 by January 17
this year, a performance dented only by inflation of 17 per cent and - for
foreign investors - a slight decline in the peso against the dollar.
Over the last 10 days the index has been falling back again, partly because
of uncertainty about the outcome of the May elections, although yesterday it
recovered 11.45 to 1,242.04.
Speculation by Filipinos disenchanted with property and other investments
has been crucial to the stock market's rise, according to Mr Erico Claudio
of James Capel. The traditional refuge of the local speculator, the US
dollar, became increasingly unattractive as economic reforms and stagnant
imports created a plentiful supply of dollars in Manila.
'The stock market here is still very speculative,' says Mr Claudio. 'It is
only in the past few years that trust funds and institutional investors have
started looking at the market. Foreigners were not able to ride on this
local rise because it did not make sense to them.'
Brokers say that foreign fund managers in Hong Kong, London and other
centres now account for only about 10 to 15 per cent of volume on the rival
Manila and Makati exchanges, and have reduced the Philippines share of
regional funds to around 3 per cent. A liberalisation of foreign exchange
regulations, allowing foreign investors to expatriate money within two weeks
to a month after a sale, has improved the market's image, but volume remains
modest - typically worth Dollars 15m or less a day - and prices volatile.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is regarded as competent but
underfunded, and the existence of two competing exchanges, each marking
prices in chalk, is incon-venient for foreign investors even if it provides
arbitrage opportunities for energetic local brokers.
Last year's rise notwithstanding, brokers have been advising their foreign
clients to buy selected blue chips, particularly those which might benefit
from increased spending by consumers as politicians spread their money
around before the elections.
San Miguel, the beer and food conglomerate, Philippine Long Distance
Telephone (PLDT) and Ayala Land remain the favourites, but brokers are
advising some of their bolder clients to look at oil and oil service
companies likely to benefit from further oil finds, and at companies with
lower price/earnings ratios. One such is the recently floated Manila
Electric Co (Meralco), the electricity distributor with a prospective 1992
p/e of less than five; but it has little track record and faces the risk of
lost revenue caused by power shortages if drought continues.
Mr Ackerman notes that the dominance of major stocks such as San Miguel
makes the rise in the composite index deceptive. 'The average is not exactly
indicative of the real situation,' he says, suggesting there might be more
mileage in less well known stocks, in the mining sector for example.
Analysts in the Philippines believe that the market will rise further, but
they accept that foreigners are concerned about political uncertainty in the
run-up to the elections in May. 'That is why investors continue to be
cautious,' says Mr Villamor Vital, chief strategist at All Asia Securities.
Or, as Mr Claudio puts it: 'We assume that foreigners will invest after the
election.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox suspends more on-screen
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MORE screen-traded contracts were effectively closed yesterday by the
London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox).
Trading in the MGMI base metals index and arabica coffee futures has been
limited to liquidation orders.
The arabica contract, set up only last March in a bid to win business from
New York's successful open outcry market, never attracted much interest. In
the last three months of last year, turnover was just 10 lots.
The MGMI contract had a turnover of 7,404 lots last September. Volume
collapsed in October following the closure of the screen traded property
futures contracts, which were the centre of a financial scandal. In the last
two months of the year it was 20 lots.
Mr Phillip Thorpe, Fox chief executive, said yesterday there was not enough
interest to keep the two contracts running. They have been suspended, along
with rice and rubber, and could be revived at some future date.

flood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community will be flooded with Danish dairy products if the
Gatt proposals now on the table are implemented, according to the Danish
Dairy Board.
Denmark is the EC's largest exporter of dairy products to third countries.
It accounts for 39 per cent of the EC's export of cheese to non-member
countries.
The Dairy Board calculates that Denmark's cheese exports to third countries
would fall gradually by about 45,000 tonnes from a total export to third
countries of 150,000 tonnes a year.
Denmark also exports about 112,000 tonnes of milk powder, sterile cream and
casein products to third countries, a substantial part of which will be
diverted to Europe if the Gatt proposal is realised.
However, only about 15,000 tonnes of Danish butter go to third countries out
of total exports of 50,000 tonnes. Other EC exporters of dairy products,
such as Holland, France and Ireland, face similar problems. A total of
between 4m and 5m milk equivalent tonnes of dairy products could be diverted
to the European market, causing milk prices to fall by 20-25 per cent,
according to the Danes.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: FAO plans to preserve farm
animal genes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIVE-YEAR, Dollars 15m plan to preserve the ancestral gene pool of
domestic animals in the developing world is being launched by the Food and
Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.
Mr Edouard Saouma, FAO director-general, believes the situation is urgent.
'Most of the animal resources that exist in the developing world have been
in stable production systems for hundreds of years,' he says. 'Now they are
coming under competitive pressure from imported stocks. A breed can be
completely changed genetically in 10 years without a full understanding of
what will be lost.'
The FAO is kick-starting the plan with Dollars 3m, but is seeking donor
funding for the rest.
The programme has five goals - to take a world inventory of livestock breeds
and strains; to establish banks of semen and embryos from endangered
animals; to start conservation programmes to save livestock in native
habitats; to use DNA technology to determine genetic characteristics and
improve breeds; and to develop an international legal framework for global
animal trade.
Mr Patrick Cunningham, director of the FAO's animal production and health
division, believes livestock is under pressure from both the move from
subsistence to commercial farming, and from the speed with which Western
technology can be adopted. 'You can fly in one container of semen and change
totally the next generation,' he says, adding that some animal breeds had
been protected by isolation and poverty for centuries.
The programme will be looking at all livestock, including fowl and pigs.
'No-one really knows how many types of goat and cattle there are, nor how
they differ from each other genetically, in evolutionary terms,' says Mr
Cunningham. One example of the sort of animal that needs study is the
sahiwal cattle of Pakistan and parts of India, which is a promising dairy
breed at about the same stage of development as Europe's holstein was 200
years ago, giving less than half the milk of a modern holstein. The sahiwal
thrives in the heat, unlike the holstein, but is in danger of extinction as
local producers try to adapt the Holstein to tropical countries.
He wants to see the same transformation of productivity for the sahiwal that
has been achieved in the West, through selective breeding using artificial
insemination and embryo transfer techniques.
While the sahiwal is the most promising in dairy terms of the cattle breeds
on the Indian subcontinent, there are dozens more with different
characteristics. 'We want to preserve, but we also want to develop,' he
says. 'We can't leave them as they are - if they remain static they will
disappear.'

Auction sales so far this year have revealed no clear direction in wool
prices. Some finer merinos have tended cheaper, whereas broader categories
have been firm or slightly dearer. There is also continuing divergence
between better style wools and those adversely affected by drought. The AWC
market indicator has risen only one cent compared with a week ago, and is
581c. Apart from minor and mixed price changes in terms of the Australian
dollar, fluctuations in that currency, loosely related to the US dollar,
have also kept buyers cautious.

London robusta coffee prices were sharply down by the close, while New York
arabicas had set life-of-contract lows for the fifth straight session at
midday. The London fall came as the continuing flow of gradings removed any
remaining concern over near-term supplies, dealers said. This was despite
the large total uncovered position in the dollar and sterlings contracts,
now expected to decline. 'We saw fund selling and liquidation today with
only light buying at the end on profit-taking ..We've closed very badly on
the charts - the only positive thing is that the market is now definitely
oversold,' one trader said. New York's March contract was falling early on
selling from funds, speculators and countries of origin. On the LME copper
closed steady as New York's Comex prices stalled near overhead targets.
However possible concern over Chilean supplies is expected to curb any
decline. Chile's senate has voted to allow state-owned Codelco to grant
private companies controlling stakes in joint-ventures, and unions are
threatening strike action. LME aluminium prices lost much of this week's
gains. Japanese selling took the three-month price down to Dollars 1,274 a
tonne in early trading.

FT  30 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Securities industry capital
rules move closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL capital rules for the securities industry were agreed in
principle yesterday as bank and securities regulators met for the first time
to seek a common worldwide framework.
If adopted, the rules would mirror the Basle risk-weighted capital standards
for banks, which were agreed in 1988 and come into force this year.
After a meeting in Geneva, the regulators agreed a common approach to the
issue, although differences remain about the precise level of capital
securities businesses - if those owned by banks, or non-bank firms - would
have to provide to support their market exposures.
In a joint statement, Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the technical
committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions
(Iosco) and Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision, said differences between current capital rules applied to the
securities and banking industries 'create the risk of distortion of trading
patterns and significantly varying levels of protection. . .for firms from
different countries against both local and global market volatility.'
Regulators failed to reach full agreement on the two most important
outstanding issues - the ratio of subordinated debt to equity that can be
applied for regulatory purposes and the amount of capital needed to back
equity risks.
On the first, there was general agreement to a ratio of 2.5:1 - a level
sought by securities commissioners in the UK, US and elsewhere. Some banking
supervisors continued to express concern at this level. There was also
'general consensus' on the equity risk question, though without disclosing
figures. It is understood the agreement was for firms to provide capital
equal to 8 per cent of their net positions and 4 per cent of their gross
positions - against the wishes of securities regulators, who had pushed for
a lower percentage of gross positions.

FT  30 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: An upheaval waiting to happen
 -The London Stock Exchange's delayed reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TWO years ago, the London Stock Exchange
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
then called the International Stock Exchange - seemed on the point of rapid
transformation.
Under new management, and with a new strategy agreed in outline, it seemed
set for an upheaval to parallel the Big Bang reforms that had reshaped the
City in 1986.
Two years on, nothing has happened - and the securities companies which are
the exchange's biggest customers are getting impatient. The exchange seems
no closer to achieving its original plan: to split its markets into two,
creating a national, retail market for the UK and a wholesale one for all
European stocks. Frustration has begun to turn to anger.
An executive at one of the City's top securities companies, who has been
deeply involved in the stock exchange's work on its new strategy, says: 'I
just can't understand why there isn't any progress. We've done all the hard
work - why aren't they putting it out?'
Another, who also declined to be named, added: 'The strategy was accepted
conceptually by the whole market place 18 months ago. Mr Peter Rawlins (the
exchange's chief executive) has let this one slip, and has lost credibility
because of it.'
One person who is prepared to speak openly is Mr David Jones, managing
director of Sharelink, a telephone-based retail broker which regularly
handles more than 10 per cent of the trades in the UK market. Mr Jones's
proposals for a new retail stock market in the UK, separate from the stock
exchange, were previously cold-shouldered by the exchange. 'They led me and
everybody else to believe that they would not only do it more effectively
themselves, but also that they would do it quicker. Yet here we are, two
years later, with no progress.'
What has added to the frustration of these and other financial firms is that
their contribution to the redevelopment of the exchange was completed long
ago. Two high-level committees of brokers, set up to advise the exchange's
staff, finished their work last autumn, and expected a quick response from
the authorities. Since then, there has been a deathly silence.
Three possible reasons are put forward for the delays. One is that upheavals
among the exchange's staff has held back development and that the work will
now be completed by a team of outside consultants from Andersen Consultants
(Mr Rawlins is an Andersen-trained accountant). A fortnight ago, the
exchange revealed that Andersen partners would henceforth hold key line
management positions in the exchange, effectively providing a
middle-management below Mr Rawlins and his fellow directors.
That arrival of Andersen has awakened fears in the industry that the
exchange's redevelopment has now fallen into the hands of technocrats, and
previously-agreed changes will be subject to amendment.
Mr Peter Hogarth, the exchange's director for trading markets (its secondary
market activities) says such fears are misplaced.
'They (Andersen) are not responsible for the business definition or
requirements at all,' he said. 'They are there to implement the answers, not
to give them.'
He also played down fears that the arrival of Andersen signals an expensive,
long-term overhaul of the exchange's decrepit systems. All sides agree a new
technological base for the market needs to be created, but the market's
users do not want an expensive refit.
The second reason put forward for the delays is that the exchange has failed
completely to disentangle the two segments of its new strategy, and so has
become bogged down in finding ways for the retail and wholesale markets to
stand side-by-side.
'We need two completely separate structures,' said Mr Jones. 'They need to
be designed, managed and run separately, from separate budgets.'
A third possible reason has been the difficulty of overcoming entrenched
interests in the market. A good example is the position of market makers in
the UK market (as opposed to Seaq International, London's successful
international share market). At present, market makers in the UK market
benefit from privileges such as the exclusive right to borrow stock to meet
settlement obligations - something that gives them a considerable advantage
over others. On the other hand, they suffer from the rule to publish details
of all trades within 90 minutes. They claim this exposes them to attack from
other market-makers before they have a chance to unwind their positions,
they claim.
Market-makers on Seaq International find themselves in the opposite
position. Trades are not published and there are no stock-borrowing
privileges. The question for the exchange has been: how to migrate to a
single European market, with UK as well as foreign stocks, without upsetting
the market-makers on the one hand, or regulators on the other?
An answer could be close. Discussions with market makers and regulators have
intensified recently. On February 27, the exchange's board is (finally) due
to be presented with the a proposal.
If all goes as the exchange hopes, that will involve scrapping the trade
publication rule for large bargains - a move which has met with resistance
from the Office of Fair Trading and the Securities and Investments Board. It
will also mean the launch of a limited pilot scheme for a new 'matching
principle' scheme for trading small, illiquid stocks.
Other changes will then be phased in.

FT  30 JAN 92 / International Bonds: EIB raises Ecu500m in issue of
floating-rate notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank yesterday raised Ecu500m in floating-rate
notes, with its third issue structured as a block trade - that is, with
lower fees and without an underwriting group - so far this year.
The deal was considered aggressively-priced, at a discounted margin of 58
basis points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). In addition,
the EIB once again squeezed the fees for both the three lead underwriters
and the small selling group.
However, EIB paper is exempt from withholding tax for Italian investors, so
the demand for the offering was concentrated in Italy. Most dealers said the
issue would have to rely almost solely on Italian placement. 'The Italian
effort will have to be very strong, because it takes a story to sell paper
at this level,' one syndicate manager said.
An outstanding issue of nine-year EIB floating-rate notes is currently
trading at about 51 basis points under Libor. However, that paper is trading
at about a 2-point premium to par, a deterrent for some investors.
There were also some reports of demand from money-market funds. Short-term
rates in the Ecu market are currently high compared with other markets, and
with the rest of the Ecu yield curve. Six-month Libor currently stands at
about 10 3/8 per cent, while the UK's recently issued Treasury notes are
yielding about 8 1/2 per cent.
Also in the Ecu market, KFW International Finance launched a successful
Ecu250m five-year deal, arranged by Deutsche Bank. The deal was considered
fairly-priced, and took away any bitter taste left by the aggressive pricing
of KFW's last deal, a Dollars 300m 15-year deal launched early this month.
The Ecu deal met strong demand from German and Swiss retail investment, as
well as from institutional players. The deal closed at 99.96 bid, the level
of its initial fixed reoffer price.
Traders speculated the EIB's FFr3bn 10-year offering of fixed-rate bonds,
expected to be launched today, would also be structured as a block trade.
Sources at the Bank of Italy denied reports that Italy is considering
launching a FFr7 to FFr10bn offering of long-dated bonds, and said Italy
would not be tapping any offshore market in the 'foreseeable future'. But,
banks continue to present the Italian authorities with proposals for
long-dated transactions in both French francs and Ecu.
In the dollar sector, Telecommunicacoes de Sao Paolo (Telesp) launched a
Dollars 100m three-year deal, puttable after two years, via Banque Indosuez.
The deal met strong demand, particularly from retail investors, encouraged
by a hefty 650 basis point yield spread (to the put option). Telesp is an
operating subsidiary of Telebras, the Brazilian telecommunications utility,
which paved the way with a deal last year.
Also in the dollar sector, two fixed/floating-rate offerings for Mitsubishi
Bank and Long-Term Credit Bank were targetted at Japanese investors.

<TEXT>
JOHANNESBURG Consolidated Investment (JCI), the South African mining house
which controls the world's largest platinum group, reported a 5 per cent
increase in attributable earnings in the six months to the end of December.
Pre-tax profits increased to R176.4m (Dollars 63.4m) from R171.4m, and
attributable earnings were up to R166.1m from R158.4m. The vast bulk of this
 -R144.7m - came from investment income, with R16.8m attributable from
operating subsidiaries and R14.5m abnormal items.
Equity accounted earnings were only 1 per cent up at R190.6m following a
drop in the share of retained earnings from associated companies to R24.5m
from R30.7m. This was the result of lower 1991 earnings from Rustenburg
Platinum, the world's largest platinum producer. This offset the gains which
JCI received from Rusplats's higher 1991 dividends, reflected in the
investment income, and the abnormal item which was the result of Rusplats
paying a one-off dividend in specie.
Apart from the performance of Rusplats, earnings were hit by ferrochrome
producer CMI passing its dividend, a reflection of the difficult state of
world markets, and modest earnings from some of JCI's industrial interests
which include large stakes in South African Breweries, Premier Group, Argus
and Times Media.
The outlook for the second half is that earnings will proably be below 1991
levels. Rusplats cut its interim dividend by 30 per cent last weak and there
is not sign yet of recovery in the world platinum and rhodium price.
Earnings per share rose to 113 cents from 107 cents, and the dividend was
maintained at 42 cents.

FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: ANZ seeks ADollars 780m by
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has continued the trend for
leading Australian banks to top up their equity bases with a one-for-five
rights issue seeking almost ADollars 780m (USDollars 586.4m).
ANZ, one of Australia's four leading trading banks, yesterday confirmed
market speculation with a fully-underwritten issue at ADollars 3.76 a share,
well below yesterday's price of ADollars 4.35 on the Australian Stock
Exchange.
The offering follows a ADollars 600m preference share issue by ANZ in May
last year, and brings the amount of major bank equity raised in Australia in
the past year to more than ADollars 4bn.
This includes ADollars 1.65bn raised in the flotation of 30 per cent of the
Commonwealth Bank and a ADollars 1bn share issue by National Australia Bank.
Conspicuous by its absence from the equity raising queue has been Westpac,
the other leading Australian bank. But with speculation continuing on the
possibility of another big bank merger, the market is bracing for an
imminent Westpac issue.
Westpac also lost ground against its competitors yesterday with the release
of bank debt ratings by Standard and Poor's Australian Ratings. The ratings
agency lowered various debt ratings for Westpac and some of its
subsidiaries, but reaffirmed ratings of the National Australia Bank and ANZ.
The agency said the Westpac downgrade was due to the weakening of asset
quality through emergence in 1991 of substantial property-related problem
exposures. But it commended Westpac management's efforts to address
problems.
The rash of Australian bank equity raisings reflects a desire to take
advantage of a relatively strong Australian share market, and the need to
maintain capital adequacy ratios at or above international standards.
Announcing the issue at ANZ's annual meeting in Melbourne yesterday, Mr
Milton Bridgland, chairman, said he recognised the need for additional
capital over the next two years.
'The funds raised by the issue will further strengthen our capital base,
which, whilst already sound by international standards, will be subject to
some statutory adjustments over the forthcoming 18 months,' he said.
'These adjustments relate to the deduction of future income tax benefits
from our capital base calculation with effect from October 1 1992, and the
similar deduction of general provisions relating to rescheduled debt a year
later.
'This share issue will adequately compensate for both these adjustments
about six months in advance in each case. Our capital adequacy ratio is
projected to be well in excess of 10 per cent over the next two years,
substantially above the 8 per cent required by the Reserve Bank.'
Mr Bridgland said ANZ, which is among the more international of Australia's
banks through its control of the UK-based Grindlays group, would apply for
listing of the new shares in Australia, New Zealand and London.
The issue is payable in two tranches, ADollars 1.88 by March 27 this year
and the balance a year later.
Rights trading is scheduled to begin in Australia and the UK on February 13
and in New Zealand on February 19.
Stockland Trust Group, one of Australia's largest listed property trusts,
will raise ADollars 62.4m from a placement of converting preference units
and shares to institutional investors.
The issue will involve 24m new securities at ADollars 2.60 - ADollars 2 for
the units and 60 cents for the shares - with 12m attaching options which
will be separately listed.

refinancing deal

<TEXT>
ADSTEAM, the diversified industrial empire formerly controlled by
Sydney-based corporate raider Mr John Spalvins, has announced long-awaited
agreement with its bankers for a refinancing package, writes Bruce Jacques.
The package, which should stave off formal collapse by the three main group
companies, Adelaide Steamship, David Jones and Tooth and Co, has been under
negotiation since last year.
It involves total debts of about ADollars 3.3bn (USDollars 2bn) and will
effectively delay interest payments until cash is available from operations.
The agreement removes pressure for further asset sales and should ensure
group companies continue trading.
The package may also facilitate the refloat of the jointly controlled
Woolworths operations, one of the country's most successful retailers.

USF&amp;G, whose property/casualty operations rank about 13th in premium volume,
has turned in a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 40m, or 62 cents a share,
reflecting the difficulties faced by many US insurers in 1991.
The loss compares with a fourth-quarter deficit of Dollars 610m, or Dollars
7.32 a share, in 1990. The 1991 figures include one-time gains of Dollars
16m, more than offset by one-time charges of Dollars 50m. Revenues eased to
Dollars 1.02bn from Dollars 1.17bn.
The company cut its fourth-quarter operating loss to Dollars 7m, or 23
cents, from Dollars 113m, or Dollars 1.40, in the previous year.
For the full year, USF&amp;G's net loss was Dollars 179m, or 38 cents a share,
on revenues of Dollars 4.13bn compared with a deficit of Dollars 569m, or
Dollars 1.62, on revenues of Dollars 4.53bn in 1990.
USF&amp;G said it had met its 1991 objective of strengthening its balance sheet,
cutting costs and sharpening its business focus.
Mr Norman Blake, chairman and chief executive, said the performance of the
property/casualty offshoot was particularly encouraging. 'Its fourth quarter
1991 operating income of Dollars 17m was the best since the second quarter
of 1990.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: A shake-out for S African
banking - The planned merger of ABSA with Bankorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by ABSA and Bankorp to merge, forming a giant South African
bank with assets of over R80bn (Dollars 28.7bn), brings to a head an
important shake-out in the country's banking sector, whose ramifications
will affect the entire sector and perhaps beyond.
The deal has been welcomed because it removes Bankorp, the weakest of the
big five banks in South Africa, from the sector without making ABSA
excessively powerful.
However, ABSA is only 10 months old, the product of a complicated merger
last year between United, Allied, Volkskas and part of the Sage group, and
there are question marks over whether this earlier deal has settled down
well enough to justify taking over Bankorp, a banking group with its fair
share of troubles.
For instance, Mr Alan McConnochie, banking analyst at Ed Hern, Rudolph, the
stockbroker, says he believes that Allied's operations have been well
integrated into ABSA. But he questions whether the rationalisation of
Volkskas's operations into the group has has even started.
However, he notes three reasons which explain the timing of the deal: the
availability of a large assessed tax loss at Bankorp; a better product mix
which the deal gives; and the fact that it takes the pressure off volume
growth at a time when slow South African money supply growth is putting
banks under pressure.
While the latest deal may cause ABSA difficulties in absorbing all its
disparate parts, there is no doubt it leaves the industry in a healthier
state. Volkskas and Bankorp were always lame ducks in the sector, ripe for
the picking when stricter capital adequacy requirements and the need to make
expensive computer hardware pay through high volumes brought pressures for
rationalisation.
Further rationalisation in the South African banking sector among the larger
players, at least in the short term, is seen as now unlikely.
While competitors will comfort themselves with the thought that ABSA will be
heavily weighed down in the short term by merger baggage, they will not be
so happy about the longer term. Mr McConnochie says that if ABSA succeeds in
achieving cost rationalisation through economies of scale, then it will be
able to put a lot of pressure on competitors to get their costs down.
Particularly upset by the merger will be Stanbic, which can no longer claim
it is the country's top bank. When ABSA was formed, it overtook Stanbic in
terms of assets - R53bn against Stanbic's R48bn. But Stanbic was still able
to claim that it was larger in terms of shareholders' funds and by market
capitalisation.
This has now changed. ABSA's shareholders' funds are R4.4bn, against R3.3bn
at Stanbic, while its market capitalisation of R6.5bn compares with
Stanbic's R5.9bn.
There were rumours in the market earlier this week that when Stanbic got
wind of the deal, it went to the Reserve Bank of South Africa and sought to
have it stopped. The Competition Board, however, has given the deal the
go-ahead, and there does not seem much reason to dispute its reasoning.
Mr Richard Jesse, banking analyst at Martin and Co, the stockbroker, says
that the main effects of the deal, in terms of market share, are that it
lifts ABSA from 15 to 32 per cent of the hire purchase market and from 11 to
31 per cent of the leasing market. It already had 32 per cent of the home
loans market. He notes that none of these figures could be described as
excessive market concentration.
The parties which have most to be pleased about are Sanlam and Sankorp which
have ploughed large sums into Bankorp, often by way of accepting scrip
dividends in lieu of cash to help the bank through its difficulties.
Another market rumour was that an investigation of the Bankorp balance
sheet, to coincide with the release of its December results, would reveal
that the bank may have needed a further R1bn capital injection. This would
have been an unacceptable prospect for Sankorp, the industrial arm of the
Sanlam group, which already held 86 per cent of Bankorp's equity. As a
result of the ABSA/Bankorp merger, Sanlam's stake drops to 21 per cent of
the enlarged ABSA.
Mr Jesse says the benefits ABSA receives from the deal are clear: not only
has it increased market share in the important leasing and hire purchase
areas, where it was underweighted relative to its size, but the sheer size
of the new group will confer considerable economies of scale.
Against this must be weighed the prospect of ABSA buckling under the strain
of a second merger, not to mention possible problems it is picking up at
Trust Bank, Bankorp's retail arm. Although Mr Piet Liebenberg, Bankorp's
chairman, has been sweeping a new broom through the group for 18 months,
analysts believe there remain numerous bad apples to be discovered.
Mr Liebenberg lent support to this view in his most recent chairman's
statement when he commented pessimistically: 'Fully restoring the
profitability and professional management capabilities at all levels within
the group. . . will still take several years to complete.'
ABSA is to some extent protected here by a clause which says the R1.3bn
price ABSA is paying for all of Bankorp's equity is subject to a due
diligence investigation still to be completed.
One non-banking side of the deal raises the question, as yet unanswered, as
to the co-operation between Sanlam and Rembrandt, the two giants of
Afrikaans business which have not always been best of friends. Together they
wield financial clout to rival the giant Anglo American group.

IN LIGHT of US investors' expanding interest in mid-sized growth companies,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the American Stock Exchange have
announced they will jointly launch derivative products based on the new
Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap 400 Index.
On February 13, the CME will offer futures and options on futures and the
American Stock Exchange will begin trading options on the S&amp;P MidCap 400.
Introduced by Standard &amp; Poor's last year, the MidCap Index is composed of
400 companies with a median capitalisation of Dollars 754m and total market
value of about Dollars 425bn. To date, investors have indexed almost Dollars
3bn in assets to the S&amp;P MidCap 400.
Both exchanges were granted exclusive licences to trade derivative
instruments on the MidCap index last September.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities industry regulator,
has approved the American Stock Exchange's use of the MidCap, and approval
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator,
is expected for the CME on February 11.
The New York Commodity Exchange filed an application with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission to list futures and options on futures based on
the Eurotop 100 index. Comex made its application after reaching an
agreement with the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam, which trades and
controls rights to the index.

MOODY'S Investor Service, the US ratings agency, has confirmed its AAA
rating on the debt of one Australian state but given a negative view on two
others, writes Bruce Jacques.
Government debt of Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, has
retained its AAA rating, with Moody's citing decisive action by the state
government to counteract the negative budgetary effects of the country's
economic downturn.
'The rating agency's review has evaluated the impact of current negative
trends on the state's fiscal position and it concluded that these trends
have not caused substantial medium term damage to New South Wales'
creditworthiness,' Moody's said.
But the ratings agency has reduced its rating on the debt of the Western
Australian government from AAA to AA1 and it is also reviewing the AA1
rating which is held by the South Australian government.

WEYERHAEUSER, the US timber products group, has suffered a loss amid
conditions which include the lowest rate in US housing starts since the
Second World War, Reuter reports.
The company posted a 1991 year-end loss of Dollars 161.9m, or 80 cents a

Dollars 61m accounting change charge. Revenues fell to Dollars 8.7bn from
Dollars 9.02bn in 1990.
In 1990, the company earned Dollars 393.7m, or Dollars 1.87 a share.
The company also cited a 20 per cent drop in Japanese housing starts in
1991, falling prices in all leading pulp and product lines, and a property
market in turmoil as reasons for its lower results.
In the fourth quarter, Weyerhaeuser's pulp and paper earnings were down 85
per cent.

UNISYS and Motorola have expanded their collaboration in chip technology
development, manufacturing and design by entering a semiconductor technology
alliance.
Motorola, the largest US semiconductor manufacturer, is already a main
supplier to Unisys, the US computer group. Under the new agreement, however,
Unisys and Motorola will jointly define new chip production process and
design technologies for customised chips to be used in future Unisys
mainframe computer systems.
Unisys said it would phase out its last chip-making operation, in
California, making the company the largest computer manufacturer to rely
entirely on outside sources for its semiconductor supplies.
'The alliance confirms our commitment to focus our resources where we add
unique value, and team with industry leaders in other disciplines,' said Mr
James Unruh, Unisys chairman and chief executive.
Under the agreement, Unisys, the third largest US computer maker, will gain
earlier access to Motorola advances in chip design.
Unisys will incorporate Motorola semiconductor devices into future mainframe
computer systems, and joint engineering teams will define and develop
semiconductor products.
The Unisys-Motorola alliance follows an agreement between Unisys and Intel,
announced late last year, in which Unisys agreed to standardise its open
systems product lines on Intel microprocessors.
The new agreement with Motorola means that Unisys will base its customised
semiconductor requirements on Motorola technology.
For Unisys, the semi-conductor partnerships represent a way of reducing
development and manufacturing costs, at a time when the computer company is
struggling to maintain profitability.

Lower prices for the company's principal products of copper, lead, silver
and zinc brought the results down. They also suffered from lower prices for
specialty chemicals.
Earnings in 1991 fell to Dollars 46m, or Dollars 1.12 per share, from
Dollars 149.1m, or Dollars 3.60, in 1990. Sales were Dollars 1.9bn, down
from Dollars 2.2bn in 1990.
The decline prompted the company to halve its quarterly dividend to 20 cents
from 40 cents, the level at which it had stood since April 1989.
'In a cyclical business such as ours, the dividend rate must relate to the
company's earnings,' said Mr Richard Osborne, chairman.
In the fourth quarter, net earnings were Dollars 12.2m, or 30 cents,
compared with Dollars 3.7m, or 10 cents.
However, the 1990 fourth quarter included a non-recurring after-tax charge
of Dollars 51.5m, or Dollars 1.24 per share, for environmental clean-up and
royalty costs. Sales were Dollars 492.4m, down from Dollars 549.9m in 1990.
Mr Osborne said that although demand for copper remained strong, demand for
lead and zinc continued to be affected by the recession-hit US vehicle
market.
He noted that Pacific Rim markets had remained strong, while European
markets for base metals had weakened.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express, the US financial services group buffeted by credit card
loan losses, reported a 72 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings,
although income at its core cards business dropped by almost two-thirds.
The group reported net income of Dollars 237m, or 47 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 6.6bn, compared with income of Dollars 138m, or 28
cents, on Dollars 6.3bn of revenues in the same period of 1990, when it was
hit by particularly heavy losses at its Shearson Lehman investment banking
subsidiary.
The figures were broadly in line with Wall Street expectations.
For the full year, it reported net income of Dollars 789m, or Dollars 1.59 a
share, against Dollars 181m, or 34 cents, in 1990, when it took a Dollars
837m restructuring charge at Shearson.
Over the past year, Shearson's performance has improved, helped by rising
stock and bond markets, while Amex's core Travel Related Services (TRS)
business, which includes its cards and travellers cheques operation, has
been hit by the recession.
The company shocked Wall Street last autumn when it took a Dollars 265m
charge against earnings, including Dollars 155m to cover credit losses,
mainly at its Optima credit card.
TRS's fourth-quarter net income totalled Dollars 81m, down from Dollars 215m
a year ago. Charge volume on its credit cards totalled Dollars 30bn, a 1.3
per cent increase from last year.
For the full year, TRS produced net income of Dollars 396m, down from
Dollars 956m, due to a Dollars 432m post-tax increased provision for credit
losses, Dollars 110m of third-quarter restructuring charges, a Dollars 200m
increase in operating expenses and a Dollars 24m rise in marketing expenses.
Worldwide charge volume totalled Dollars 111bn, unchanged from a year ago,
while the number of establishments accepting the card rose 7.6 per cent to
over 3.5m. Cards in force rose slightly to 36.6m - a drop from past growth
rates which the company said was due to tightened credit procedures and
reduced solicitation.
Shearson reported record income of Dollars 130m in the fourth quarter,
compared with a Dollars 115m net loss a year ago, while the IDS financial
services unit saw profits rise 21 per cent to Dollars 68m.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially-stretched US defence and aerospace group,
underscored its improving health by reporting a sharp increase in
fourth-quarter earnings and a further reduction in its debt burden, writes
Martin Dickson.
The St Louis-based company, which is being hit by the downturn in US defence
spending, reported net earnings of Dollars 211m, or Dollars 5.50 a share,
compared with break-even in the fourth quarter of last year, when the
company took a Dollars 219m after-tax provision for the cancelled A-12
aircraft programme.
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.5bn, against Dollars 1.12bn. For the full year,
the group earned Dollars 423m, or Dollars 11.03 a share, compared with
Dollars 306m, or Dollars 7.99 in 1990.
The company's debt - apart from at its financial services unit - fell to
Dollars 2.39bn at the year-end, against Dollars 2.68bn three months before.
The level of debt has dropped 28 per cent since its peak last March, when
analysts questioned if the company might have to file for bankruptcy. The
company still needs capital to develop aircraft, and Taiwan Aerospace is
considering buying a 40 per cent stake in its civil aircraft operations for
Dollars 2bn.
Behind the improving balance sheet and profit figures is a much better
performance at its civil aircraft business, which began deliveries of its
new wide-bodied jet, the MD-11, just before the start of 1991.

NINE Canadian telephone utilities are forming a new company to co-ordinate
their move into international markets and to oversee research and marketing
of domestic telephone services, writes Bernard Simon.
The new company, Stentor Resource Centre, comprises all but one of the
shareholders of Telecom Canada, the alliance which administers Canada's
domestic long-distance system. Stentor is expected to start operations next
January with about 2,500 employees.
Stentor will be dominated by Bell Canada, the biggest of the phone
companies. Bell, subsidiary of Montreal-based BCE, provides service to most
of Ontario and Quebec and has a substantial shareholding in several smaller
provincial companies.
The utilities face pressure on their monopoly of the Canadian telephone
system. Regulators are due to decide within the next few months whether to
open the long-distance market to competition.

240m in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DU PONT, the biggest US chemicals group, suffered a Dollars 240m loss in the
fourth quarter of 1991 following some Dollars 469.5m of special charges
associated with cost reductions, business restructuring and the recall of a
fungicide product.
The loss, which compares with a Dollars 468m net profit in the last quarter
of 1990, would have been even larger had it not been for a Dollars 391m
extraordinary credit resulting from the sale of assets, including an
interest in its coal business.
The coal business gain, together with other asset disposals, was
insufficient to offset net charges of Dollars 328.6m for the whole of 1991.
Du Pont's net income for 1991 slumped by 39.3 per cent, to Dollars 1.4bn.
When the non-recurring gains and losses are stripped out, Du Pont's 1991
earnings per share of Dollars 2.08, against Dollars 3.40 in 1990, were 43
per cent lower, year-on-year.
Du Pont's total sales fell by 11.7 per cent to Dollars 9.77bn in the fourth
quarter of 1991, and by 3.4 per cent to Dollars 38.7bn for the full year.
Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman, said the company's operating results were
affected by sluggish economies worldwide, which caused weak demand and price
pressures for chemicals, polymers and products for the printing and
electronic industries.
On an after-tax basis, all of Du Pont's divisions experienced reduced 1991
operating earnings except for the coal business, which benefited from an
asset disposal.
With extraordinary items stripped out of calculations, the fibres business,
had 28 per cent improved earnings that benefited from higher demand for
apparel fibres and reduced costs. On this basis, earnings from chemicals
were 35 per cent lower, while the polymers division suffered a 42 per cent
drop in income.
Du Pont's diversified business division recorded 60 per cent lower 1991
earnings, reflecting higher costs in agricultural products and lower sales
volumes and margins in most of the electronics and imaging systems
businesses. Petroleum earnings were down 11 per cent in 1991, reflecting
lower crude prices.
Mr Woolard said he believed the company's underlying strengths and benefits
from cost reduction programmes would put Du Pont in a position to gain from
a resumption of growth in world markets.

</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Sweden's leading commercial banks revealed yesterday that mounting
credit losses had made a severe impact on their financial results for 1991.
Svenska Handelsbanken said net operating income was 'somewhat below' SKr3bn
(Dollars 516m) last year. This contrasts with the SKr4.6bn profit it made in
1990. Handelsbanken will publish complete financial results on February 18.
The bank said it expected loan losses of 'slightly over 1 per cent of total
lending'. Handelsbanken has more than doubled its reserves for credit losses
since last autumn to SKr3.5bn.
Handelsbanken blamed the negative trend in loan losses on the finance
company Gamlestaden, rescued from collapse by a Swedish bank consortium last
autumn. It has a negative equity of SKr2.2bn and Handelsbanken estimates its
share of that figure is SKr455m.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, also
reported a deterioration in financial performance with profits falling by 27
per cent to SKr2.4bn for 1991. The bank blamed the decline on escalating
credit losses, including last week's further SKr352m loss from its
involvement in the rescue of Gamlestaden.
The bank said the group's results would have grown favourably during 1991 if
its credit losses were excluded from its figures. The estimated SKr415m loss
resulting from the sale of most of a 28.2 per cent share option in Skandia,
Sweden's leading insurance company, is to be taken against the accounts.

The group reported a first half profit of DKr2m (Dollars 322,000) compared
with a loss of DKr45m in the first half of last year and a full-year loss of
DKr145m. Sales were up 10 per cent to DKr1.16bn from DKr1.05bn.
The result after depreciation was turned from a DKr6m loss to a profit of
DKr24m and net financial costs were cut from DKr42m to DKr22m. There was a
management reorganisation last year, when Mr Anders Knutsen took over as
managing director.

BANCO Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private-sector
financial institution, has approved plans to buy a minority stake in ISA,
the holding company which controls Banca di Trento e Bolzano, a large north
Italian regional bank.
The purchase, subject to regulatory approval, marks another step in
Ambroveneto's expansion after last year's acquisition of Citibank Italia and
50 per cent of Caboto, a Milan securities trading firm.
The 20 per cent stake in ISA was sold by Edizione Holding, the holding
company of the Benetton family who have been divesting their interests in
financial services to concentrate on their clothing and sports goods
activities. No price has been disclosed, but reports suggest the stake was
sold for around L60bn (Dollars 50m).
Banca di Trento e Bolzano, which had deposits of L1,642bn in 1990, has
around 50 branches in the Trento and Alto Adige regions.
Ambroveneto's purchase may mark the first step towards taking full control
of the bank. Among other shareholders in ISA are Banca San Paolo di Brescia
and Mittel, two financial institutions largely controlled by Ambroveneto's
chairman, Mr Giovanni Bazoli.

FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fiat sticks to its investment
guns - The car-maker's efforts to maintain confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME manufacturers would react to a severe decline in demand and severe
price competition by axing spending. But Fiat, Italy's biggest
private-sector company, is sticking to its ambitious long-term investment
programme, despite the damage to short-term finances from tumbling profits.
Even skilful window dressing failed to make Fiat's preliminary results,
disclosed in a letter to shareholders this week, encouraging reading.
Falling sales, high costs and growing competition meant Fiat's core business
of producing motor vehicles was barely profitable last year.
Increased revenues from non-industrial activities such as financial services
and retailing softened the blow. But with Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's
chairman, warning that no upturn was in sight, the company will have to
depend on one-off capital gains and extraordinary items to tide it over.
Operating profits fell to around L636bn (Dollars 530m) last year, or about
L450bn after tax. That is frighteningly little for a group with sales of
L57,828bn. In 1990, operating earnings for Fiat's core industrial activities
alone amounted to L2,103bn. But in 1991, the decision to add operating
earnings for highly profitable non-core businesses was just one of the steps
the group had to take to produce an acceptable figure.
The result is that Fiat's industrial activities, principally cars and
trucks, which account for more than 61 per cent of turnover, were barely
profitable last year.
Fiat stressed its car business remained in the black, despite selling 65,300
fewer vehicles and seeing its domestic market share tumble to 47 per cent
from 53 per cent in 1990. However, it admitted that recent purchases of
loss-making activities, such as the Ford New Holland farm equipment business
and the Enasa trucks group in Spain, had cut into earnings.
Moreover, careful reading of the figures suggests the situation worsened in
the second half. On the cars side, the group's domestic market share edged
down during the year, dropping to 46.40 per cent in November and just 45.13
per cent the following month.
Matters look set to get worse before they get better. A number of importers,
notably Ford, have targeted the Italian market, which remained fairly
buoyant last year, to make up for falling demand elsewhere.
Others, like Volkswagen, were held back by model changes. With growth in its
home market slowing, VW may be in a position to give customers in Italy, its
biggest export market, the cars they have been crying out for.
Mr Agnelli admitted that European demand for cars showed little sign of an
upturn this year. Nor will Fiat have another windfall in Germany, where
group sales rose by 28 per cent last year. And although it is now committed
to an ambitious new model programme, neither the new Cinquecento minicar nor
the mid-sized Alfa 155 saloon are the sort of mass market models to produce
a sudden change in fortunes.
The group is in the throes of a huge L47,000bn investment programme over the
next five years. Around L28,000bn will be devoted to the cars side, on which
a total of L40,000bn is to be spent over the next decade.
But at a time of sharply declining cash flow, such ambitious spending is
already taking its toll on Fiat's balance sheet. Fiat's financial position
swung to a deficit of L385bn last year compared with a positive figure of
L570bn at end-1990 - the first time the company's financial position was in
the red in a decade. The likelihood of a continuing fall in cash flow, which
plunged to L4,604bn from L6,065 in 1990, means debt is bound to rise.
Fiat will increasingly depend on one-off gains and asset sales to prop up
its earnings until the benefits of its investment programme come on stream.
Selling the Telettra telecommunications operation and other disposals
provided a L900bn extraordinary boost to earnings last year. As a result,
net profits for 1991 will fall to around L1,100bn - not as bad as some
analysts expected.
That is still around one-third below the L1,613 made in 1990, but a great
deal more than would have been the case but for the disposals. The task for
Fiat now is to pull enough extraordinary gains out of its hat to retain
shareholders' confidence until its long-term investments start to pay off.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Savings Banks' Association yesterday sharply criticised the
country's top three commercial banks, alleging that they adjusted credit
losses upwards to qualify for increases in state support.
The association also said the banks were under-pricing loans to
municipalities in order to boost market share.
Last year state-backed support to the country's ailing banking system
reached NKr16bn (Dollars 2.54bn).
Christiania Bank, the second biggest bank, and Fokus Bank, the third
biggest, were taken over by the state and de-listed from the Oslo bourse,
while Den norske Bank, the biggest commercial bank, received a massive state
bail-out to secure its survival.
Mr Einar Forsbakk, managing director of the Savings Banks' Association,
accused the commercial banks of bidding so low for loans that it is
virtually impossible to earn money on them. He claimed that the three
biggest commercial banks held so small interest rate margins on loans to
municipalities that they must be characterised as under-pricing.
'We have seen several examples of under-pricing (on loans) to municipalities
where the loans will contribute to a negative result,' he charged.

<TEXT>
BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), one of Spain's large commercial banks, reported
a 4 per cent increase in net profits for 1991 and a 3 per cent dividend
increase to Pta163.
Mr Emilio Ybarra, president, said net group profits had grown slightly to
Pta109.1bn (Dollars 1.08m), and warned that a general slide in Spanish bank
lending margins had hit the bank.
The bank reported a 50 per cent increase in extra-ordinary income, although
officials at the bank insisted that half of the Pta71bn reported were the
proceeds of trading in its 'normal' portfolio.
The other half was accounted for by the sale of two banking affiliates and
the closure of duplicate branches brought about by the merger of Bilbao and
Vizcaya banks in 1989.
Mr Ybarra acknowledged that BBV's dividend was low, but said that in the
current economic climate, the bank had to be prudent.
Profits have been hit by a sudden explosion in sales of unit trusts, brought
about by new, relaxed tax rules last year, and they are still feeling the
effects of competition.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BPCC pensioners thankful for their timely
escape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MAXWELL knew I would never take any shit from him,' is how Mr John
Holloran, chief executive of BPCC, the printing group, describes his
relationship with the late chairman of MCC.
It was that very toughness that attracted Mr Robert Maxwell in the first
place when he saw Mr Holloran in action trying unsuccessfully to buy his old
employers, McCorquodale, the printers. McCorquodale was ultimately taken
over by Norton Opax.
Mr Holloran worked for Mr Maxwell for two years before putting together a
buy-out that did work - a Pounds 235m deal which in January 1989 took BPCC
out of MCC and Maxwell out of printing in the UK.
Some 4,000 members of the BPCC pension fund should be more than a little
grateful for Mr Holloran's persistence and robust attitude to his former
employer.
Nearly Pounds 100m owed to the BPCC pension scheme was successfully
transferred to the fund in late September and early October last year. The
money arrived safely at the very time when the Maxwell empire was under its
most extreme financial stress and when, it is now known, many millions were
missing from other Maxwell pension funds.
Under the buy-out agreement an initial Pounds 30m went into the BPCC pension
fund and a further Pounds 97m was due last autumn. When the money was
several weeks late Mr Holloran, who is chairman of the BPCC pension fund,
contacted Mr Maxwell and Pounds 50m arrived in late September while the
balance was paid in early October.
'All our pension money has been paid over. It's virtually all in alpha
shares, cash or gilts,' says Mr Holloran, who adds that considerably less
than Pounds 1m is in Mirror Group Newspapers or MCC shares.
MCC's stake in BPCC, which started out at 19.9 per cent in 1989, has now
fallen to 14 per cent because rights were not taken up.
Mr Holloran said that the collapse of the Maxwell empire has not affected
the BPCC business in any way apart from the irritation of having to deal
with constant rumours and questions.
The recession has hit the printing business hard but Mr Holloran said that
all 50 printing plants taken over from Maxwell were still operating,
although the workforce has fallen from 7,400 to 5,200.
In 1990 the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 39m. Since then recession
has eroded margins, particularly in the company's web offset printing
businesses. It is however expected to have remained profitable in 1991.
But one of Mr Holloran's greatest assets at the moment, given the history of
the company, must be its fully funded pensions fund.

The interim dividend is 1.45p (1.15p). The previous year's total was 3.87p
from pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.7m.

Pre-tax profits at Adscene Group recovered strongly in the six months to
November 30, and shareholders benefit by having their interim dividend
doubled to 1.5p.
The group, which publishes 33 local newspaper titles in Kent, Lincolnshire
and London, saw profits rise from Pounds 462,000 to Pounds 720,000 largely
as a result of a lower cost base.
Mr Harry Lambert, chairman, said margins expanded 3 per cent to 12.6 per
cent while the interest bill fell 25 per cent to Pounds 303,000 following
the sale of the Lincoln property for Pounds 1.2m.
Turnover fell to Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 9.2m). In Kent the group lifted
publishing turnover by 13 per cent. In Lincolnshire and London advertising
revenue continued to fall but there were some signs recently that the
decline had slowed.
The printing division's turnover again reduced by 23 per cent but margins
were still above 10 per cent. There were only limited opportunities in the
immediate future for new printing contracts, Mr Lambert stressed.
Earnings per share rose to 3.01p (1.78p).

It has provisionally agreed the sale to a management-led company, which will
pay Pounds 2.2m on completion and assume the existing property mortgage of
Pounds 820,000.
Waverley said difficulties arose with banks - which effectively withdrew
Pounds 2m of working capital - despite that it reducing borrowings from
Pounds 7.81m since March 31 to Pounds 4.54m, significantly improving the
trading performance of Partners, and integrating and restructuring the
office products activities, thereby making significant savings in operating
costs.

<TEXT>
The net asset value of Hambros Investment Trust was 46.54p per share at
September 30, down from the 46.61p at the same stage of 1990.
The trust's equity capital is held by Hambros and its subsidiaries, and only
the two classes of preference stock are quoted on the Stock Exchange.
Dividends would continue to be paid on these stocks, directors said.
Net revenue for the six months to end-September amounted to just Pounds

The Sunderland-based North of England Building Society produced a 12 per
cent improvement in net profits to Pounds 10.3m and a similar increase in
lending to Pounds 297m in 1991. Assets advanced 20 per cent to more than
Pounds 1.2bn.
Mr Robert Linden, group chief executive, said: 'Our performance must be
among the best in the country,' and he pointed out that the Pounds 620,000
provision for losses was a figure that would be envied by many societies.
The number of the society's borrowers between three and six months in
arrears was only eight more at the year-end than it had been a year earlier:
1,066, against 1,058. The number of homes in possession was up from 47 to a
record 160 at the end of 1991, only 0.38 per cent of all homes mortgaged.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Against a background of numerous board changes and rationalisation of its
operations, pre-tax profits of Kembrey, the electrical precision components
and foundry products group, showed a 68 per cent decline in the six months
to September 28.
Although turnover increased by Pounds 5.58m to Pounds 15.1m, the pre-tax
line fell from Pounds 530,000 to Pounds 170,000.
The principal reasons for the decline were Pounds 122,000 of trading losses
of the discontinued business of Ripault-Drivex and Pounds 172,000 of
exceptional losses due to reorganisation and adjustment for prior periods
related to the discontinued Coated Electrodes' business.
These losses were further exacerbated by an interest turnround to charges of
Pounds 271,000 (Pounds 35,000 credit) relating to the acquisition in 1990 of
McMurdo, a manufacturer of connectors and marine safety lights.
Earnings per share fell to 0.4p (1.2p) and again there is no interim
dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the industrial conglomerate, is paying nearly Pounds 11m for the
outstanding 60 per cent of Guest &amp; Chrimes, a maker and supplier of cast
iron valves and hydrants for the water industry.
A 40 per cent interest in Guest came into the group with the 1986
acquisition of Pegler Hattersley and it will join those valve and tap
businesses in the fluid controls division.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, said Guest took the group further into
the UK water industry, which was benefiting from a big capital spending
programme.
In 1990, Guest made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 12.7m
and had net assets of Pounds 9m at the end of that year.
Most of the consideration is through the issue of 2.25m Tomkins shares. The
remaining Pounds 1.25m is in loan notes. The stake is being purchased from
the family owners.
Tomkins recently announced a 40 per cent increase to Pounds 43.7m in interim
pre-tax profits on sales of Pounds 594.5m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PARLIAMENTARY Select Committee is to question officials of the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation, the quasi-governmental self-regulatory
body, about its role in supervising the fund manager of the Maxwell
companies' pensions funds.
Officials of Imro will appear before the Select Committee on Social Security
some time within the next two weeks. The committee, chaired by Mr Frank
Field MP, will question the regulators about how the fund managers became
authorised to conduct investment business and how their activities were
supervised thereafter.
Earlier this week, members of the Maxwell Private Companies Pension Fund
Members Association, charged that Imro had failed to protect the public. Mr
Kenneth Trench, chairman of the group, cited press reports that Imro had
visited the premises of Bishopsgate Investment Management  - the funds'
investment manager - only six weeks before Mr Maxwell's death and found no
problems. Since then, auditors have found hundreds of millions of assets
missing from the pension funds managed by BIM.
The pensioners questioned whether BIM's ownership had been properly
investigated prior to authorisation. Mr Trench noted that it is owned by a
charitable organisation which is based in Liechtenstein and appeared to be
controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.

Babcock Prebon, a financial services group that went into receivership in

the High Court with a net deficiency of Pounds 49m.
Cork Gully, the receivers, sold the main trading businesses to management as

Babcock Prebon's demise was blamed on its high debt, recession and
substantial rental commitments on four properties it vacated to move into
new offices in Broadgate.
In August it announced losses of Pounds 8.5m for the first six months of the

It has set up a joint venture, Southern Gas, in which it will hold a 75 per

utility based in Kansas City.
The venture will purchase gas from United Gas, another UK subsidiary of
Utilicorp, and supply it to large gas consumers via British Gas pipelines
starting in March.
Seeboard said the move would enable it to provide a more comprehensive
energy service to customers. It intended to expand the service as UK
regulations were eased.
The deal is the fourth of its kind for Utilicorp.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Allied Textile declines to Pounds 13.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING PROPERTY prices last year prompted Allied Textile Companies to
suspend property sales and led to a decline, from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds
13.2m, in pre-tax profits.
Problems in its financial activities were in contrast to the textile side,
which contributed Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 8.3m) despite a fall in wool values
which left overall turnover for the year to September 30 slightly lower at
Pounds 112.2m (Pounds 115.3m).
'Current trading remains extremely difficult,' said Mr John Corrin, chief
executive. 'It will be hard to match 1991's profit this year. We will
continue to rationalise as necessary.'
Closing businesses in 1991 led to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 377,000
(Pounds 644,000).
'We reduced staff by 290 and closed six textiles sites,' said Mr Corrin. The
company now employs 2,220 people.
Earnings per share fell by 1.4p to 31.7p as the company issued more shares
through employee share option schemes.
The final dividend is increased by 0.2p to 7.9p, making a total of 12.3p
(12p).
The company has net cash of Pounds 17m and Mr Corrin said there was 'no
question of the dividend being cut.'
A change in accounting practice, the valuing of fixed assets, largely listed
investments, at market prices rather than original cost, contributed to a 51
per cent jump in fixed assets to Pounds 37.7m.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Gardiner's Pounds 6m falls short of
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDINER, which claims to be the world's largest independent distributor of
security products, yesterday announced the departure of its finance director
as it revealed pre-tax profits of Pounds 6m - well below City expectations.
The shares tumbled 22 per cent to 42p following the announcement.
Analysts, expecting profits of between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m, were
surprised by the difference in the actual results, which appeared to stem
from an error in calculating margins during the final quarter, as well as
recessionary factors.
'We established in mid-January that our accounts were based on some
over-optimistic assumptions,' said Mr Yashar Turgut, managing director.
Mr Ian Nellist, who had been with Gardiner for three years, resigned by
mutual consent, said Mr Turgut.
He will assume the finance director's responsibilities until a suitable
replacement can be found.
The decline in the share price cast a shadow over the actual 15.6 per cent
increase in profits and the 15.5 per cent rise in the dividend to 1.3p.
Turnover rose by 46 per cent to Pounds 60.6m.
Mr Turgut said that Europe had provided the strongest growth with sales up
22 per cent, excluding acquisitions.
The UK, however, had been hard pressed during the recession, with comparable
sales up just 2 per cent. Gardiner took a Pounds 400,000 provision - the
first since 1985 - for bad debts in the UK. Mr Turgut warned that the core
UK intruder business 'continues to be unpredictable'. Britain accounts for
some 55 per cent of group sales.
On the brighter side, the closed circuit television division experienced
above average growth. The acquisition of Multi-Video in June for Pounds 6m
had brought Gardiner into the higher specification end of the market, Mr
Turgut said.
'It is the high technology-led sectors of the security industry, in
particular CCTV, which have the most exciting potential,' said Mr Turgut.
The group is introducing CCTV operations into each of its European
subsidiaries.
During the year Gardiner also bought AW Alarm Systems of Denmark for Pounds
1.6m.
Debt at the year-end was Pounds 5.1m, while gearing had fallen from 80 per
cent to 26 per cent. However, interest payments were only slightly lower at
Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 1.53m).
Earnings per share tumbled from 5.07p to 4.25p, partly due to the effects of
the group's Pounds 10.6m rights issue during the year.
COMMENT
Had Gardiner warned in September that profits would not meet expectations,
there would be a few happier analysts in the City. But had the company been
aware of the error on gross margins, it might have been able to act earlier.
As it is, investors will be watching closely to see if the 5 per cent price
rise implemented in January will stick. The shares are likely to languish
under the loss of credibility until the next set of results. The important
thing to remember is the basic strength of the business. Gardiner would
appear to be the main, if not only, security products distributor in Europe,
so there is plenty of growth left there. CCTV should bolster a depressed UK.
Forecasts range at about the Pounds 7m mark. The prospective p/e of over 10
looks cheap for a basically sound company.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fleming Income coming to main market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEMING INCOME and Capital Investment Trust is joining the main market via
an offer for subscription which could raise up to Pounds 250m.
Like many other recent investment trust issues, the trust has a split
capital structure and is linked to a personal equity plan. Investors will be
able to place a full Pounds 6,000 of shares into a Pep in respect of each of
the 1991-92 and 1992-93 tax years. Returns from a Pep are free of both
income and capital gains tax.
The trust has two classes of share: zero dividend and ordinary income. The
former, which are being placed at 30p, will have an entitlement to be repaid
at 85.2p when the trust is wound up in 2002. This is equivalent to a gross
redemption yield of 11 per cent.
The initial net assets of the company, after expenses, are expected to cover
112 per cent of the final capital entitlement of the zero shareholders.
The ordinary income shares will be entitled to all the income of the trust
but will only be repaid after the entitlements of the zero shareholders have
been met in full.
The forecast gross dividend yield on the ordinary income shares is 9 per
cent. Dividends will be paid quarterly. The compound rate of growth of
assets needed for the ordinary income shares to be redeemed at the issue
price in 2002 is 5.2 per cent.
The trust will invest in UK shares and will aim for a yield one third higher
than that on the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index. That implies a gross dividend
yield on the portfolio of 6.6 per cent.
Private shareholders can apply for the ordinary income shares at 70p, or a
packaged unit of ordinary income and zero shares at 100p, which will yield
6.3 per cent. They will not be able to apply for the zeroes directly. These
will be placed with institutions.
Commissions of 3 per cent are being paid to independent financial advisers
who sell the trust so the expenses, like those on last year's M&amp;G issue, are
high for an investment trust offer. If the trust raises Pounds 100m,
expenses will absorb 4.3 per cent of the proceeds.
Applications are invited by February 24 for a minimum of 1,000 units or
1,500 ordinary income shares. The offer, which is not underwritten, will not
proceed unless Pounds 30m is raised.
COMMENT
The investment trust marketing spree rumbles on, with an extra selling
device being the prospect of a Labour government. The attractions of offers
like this is that if all goes well, a private investor placing the ordinary
income shares in a Pep can earn a tax-free yield of 9 per cent; the
equivalent gross yield for a top rate taxpayer is 15 per cent. Of course,
the risk is that the ordinary income shares might not be repaid at the issue
price, especially as the managers will not be able to buy exclusively blue
chips if they are aiming for a portfolio yield of 6.6 per cent. As so often
with these trusts, the zeroes, which are well covered, look the best deal
but private investors can only buy them as part of the package. What with
this offer, and the M&amp;G Recovery Trust being advertised on TV, we will soon
discover whether the industry has swamped investor demand.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Huntingdon International Holdings, life sciences and engineering services
group, reported a 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in its first quarter
for the year to September.
Mr David Morgan, business development manager, said the decline, from Pounds
4.07m to Pounds 3.58m, was the result of the continuing recession in the US,
where over 67 per cent of sales were generated. Turnover increased from
Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 31m.
However, Mr Morgan said the new US regulations would help it penetrate the
environmental services market.
The recently agreed acquisition of Travers Morgan had cost the group Pounds
6m in cash and a further Pounds 6m in shares. Mr Morgan said the
reorganisation of the company, specialising in road, bridge and tunnel
design, would be completed after the group's second quarter.
Earnings per share were 0.029p (0.033p) and per ADR were 26.7 cents (30.6
cents).

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Berisford picks new chief for rebuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD, the commodities and property group which narrowly escaped
liquidation through an 18-month-long sale of assets, yesterday moved one
step closer to rebuilding its business with the appointment of Mr Alan
Bowkett as chief executive.
Mr Bowkett replaces Mr Murray Stewart, who directed the company's disposal
programme and cut debt from Pounds 1.2bn to the current net cash position of
Pounds 18m. The biggest sale was British Sugar in 1990 for Pounds 800m.
Berisford is now little more than a shell, with a UK property portfolio
worth Pounds 57m, some small agribusinesses in California and a 45 per cent
stake in Rayner Coffee International, the loss-making coffee trading group.
Mr Bowkett said his first task would be to sort out RCI. 'In the next six
months I want to resolve that problem (and) turn (it) into a profitable
situation for shareholders.' That could mean either retaining or reducing
the stake.
Once RCI was dealt with, Mr Bowkett said he would begin building a core
business, funded by further asset sales or perhaps rights issues. None of
the existing operations would be suitable.
'We are looking for a fragmented market where we can put units together,' Mr
Bowkett said. He added he would be looking in the services and manufacturing
sectors.
The property division was not part of Berisford's long-term plans, said Mr
Bowkett. 'Over the next few years we will either liquidate at a profit or
look at some form of joint venture.'
Mr Bowkett, who will invest Pounds 1.1m in Berisford in return for a 1.2 per
cent stake, was former chief executive of United Precision Industries, sold
to NSK of Japan for Pounds 210m in 1990, and managing director of Boulton &amp;
Paul, where profits doubled in two years.
Berisford shares moved up 3p to 20p on yesterday's announcement.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: WH Smith sees CDs as growth area
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTUNES were rather mixed at WH Smith, which saw buoyant sales in its high
street bookstores countered by a sluggish performance at its Our Price
Records stores, where turnover was hurt by the downturn in recorded music
sales. Although the drop there was due in part to the recession, there was
nevertheless a marked improvement in music sales over the Christmas period,
which was not such a profitable time for the book business.
Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, expressed optimism that with CD penetration in
the UK only at 31 per cent, the prospects were bright for growth in recorded
music sales. There was still some resistance to the high price of CDs, but
moves were being taken to introduce lower price ranges, which should help
stimulate sales.
Sir Simon said that the deal agreed with Virgin Group in September, whereby
WH Smith would buy a 50 per cent stake in Virgin's retailing operations, was
close to being finalised.
The Virgin megastore format complements that of the typical Our Price
Records store, which tends to have considerably less floor space than the
10,000 sq ft of a typical Virgin megastore.
The group has similarly rosy visions for its DIY joint venture with Boots,
which has been battered by the severe price cutting of its principal
competitors.
The product range has been substantially improved, Sir Simon contends, and
Do It All is set to become the number two DIY business in the UK.

<TEXT>
PERRIER, France's leading mineral water company, yesterday fired a salvo in
its defence against the FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.37bn) hostile bid from Nestle
and Banque Indosuez.
Mr Jacques Vincent, president of Perrier and Exor, the French property group
that controls 35 per cent of the mineral water company and is itself the
subject of a FFr5.6bn friendly bid from Italy's Agnelli family, said Perrier
was determined to 'say no to this strange adventure'.
He was particularly critical of Indosuez, the banking subsidiary of France's
Suez Group which owns 10 per cent of Exor. Mr Vincent, who is a board member
of Suez, said he was 'confused and even a little bitter' about its
participation in the bid.
The fight for Perrier, which began 10 days ago when Nestle, the Swiss food
group, and Indosuez unveiled their bid, threatens to involve some of the
leading figures in the European industrial establishment and French
financial circles.
Perrier's defence against Nestle is based on the claim that its mineral
water interests should remain intact. Nestle has already agreed to sell
Volvic, one of Perrier's waters, to BSN, the French food group which, until
this bid, had been regarded as an ally of the Agnellis.
Perrier has taken legal action to try to nullify the agreement between
Nestle and BSN by filing a complaint with the Conseil de la Concurrence, the
French competition authority.
If Nestle's plan to sell Volvic to BSN was blocked, its bid might face
monopoly problems. Nestle has mounted a legal case of its own against the
recent FFr1.5bn sale of 13.8 per cent of Perrier to Saint Louis, the French

Mr Vincent yesterday defended the decision to introduce Saint Louis as an
investor saying it formed part of Perrier's diversification strategy. Mr
Bernard Dumon, president of Saint Louis, said his company had agreed to take
an initial 13.8 per cent of Perrier with the aim of raising its holding to
20 per cent.
Societe Generale, the French bank, pledged its support to Perrier, of which
it owns 0.5 per cent. Mr Marc Vienot, president, said the bank believed
Perrier should remain independent and criticised the 'low price' of Nestle's
offer.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: No plantation closure in Assam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P MAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your survey on Kenya (January 8) Mr Julian Ozanne was wholly
inaccurate in stating that plantations had been closed in Assam. In fact,
great credit is due to the planting community in Assam, which continued
normal estate operations and the despatch of teas despite the pressures of
extortion, kidnapping and killings. On one occasion these pressures
culminated in the cold-blooded murder of an estate manager.
It would be quite wrong to portray Kenya as benefiting from the problems in
Assam.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: Treasury double-speak that denies companies project
finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the row over the EC regional aid one important factor seems to have
been missed. This is that the Treasury's interpretation of the word
'additionality' when in receipt of EC funds is completely opposite to its
interpretation when UK finance is being provided.
A good example was the Product and Process Development Scheme (now
suspended) of the Department of Trade and Industry, designed to assist
companies to develop prototypes. Here the Treasury refused to agree to
support being given if work on the prototype had already started, since
'there was no additionality', in other words the work would be done whether
or not government support was provided. In practice the result was that some
companies' second best projects were financed, while, according to
information to which I had access at the time, others with a good product
could not finance it and had to sell it off to foreign competitors.
We shall really become a laughing stock if in addition to our ignorance of
foreign languages we do not even know what our own words mean, or give them
two opposing meanings. Federalism, subsidiarity, and now additionality.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Lombard: Man bites watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the Maxwell scandal erupted, the financial press has been zealous in
rooting out those whose cowardice or venality allowed it to happen: the
banks, the auditors, Maxwell's various helpers and subordinates. One group
has escaped the lash: the financial press itself.
A handful of Maxwell's journalistic toadies have been held up to ridicule.
Otherwise, the official line is that the investigative instincts of the
press were thwarted by the UK's repressive libel laws. So the press is now
calling for changes to the libel laws to make its job easier.
If any of the other guilty parties presented such a self-serving excuse, the
press would have a field day. Certainly, Maxwell could not have exploited
the US laws of libel in the same way. But in the UK, he was perfectly
entitled to demand that any damaging allegation against him should be made
good in court.
In doing so, he imposed on the financial press standards of proof we were
unwilling or unable to meet. This was despite the fact that, as we knew very
well, it was mostly a gigantic bluff. In his latter days at any rate,
Maxwell could not conceivably have risked cross-examination on his business
practices by an experienced barrister.
There is a richly comic aspect to this. Despite the enormities that Maxwell
got away with by dint of bullying and cheek, he was only one man against the
massed ranks of the British media. 'Press hounded by individual' is a
man-bites-dog story with a vengeance. The media have been too much on the
defensive to see it.
The best excuse for the press, and not a very good one, lies in the nature
of the challenge which Maxwell presented to journalists. From 1987 onwards,
I covered his affairs for the FT's Lex column. Almost every time I spoke to
him, he contrived to wrong-foot me one way or another.
This was largely achieved by sheer baffling inconsistency. At various times,
he threatened to sue me and promised not to in any circumstances; flattered
me and swore at me; complained that I did not consult him and, when I did,
accused me of cowardice.
Above all, he lied like a trooper. The effect of this is not easy to convey.
No experienced journalist works on the assumption that he is being told the
truth. But properly used, the direct lie has its awkward aspects.
Some months before Maxwell's death, it began to be rumoured that his
holdings in Maxwell Communication and Mirror Group were partly pledged as
collateral against private loans. Since this was plainly crucial to the
whole ramshackle structure of his empire, I phoned him to put the question.
After a burst of tactical self pity - 'why should I talk to you? Every time
I do I get kicked around. Are you an honourable man?' - he flatly asserted
that none of his shares was so pledged. As we now know, they almost all
were. I was fairly sure he was lying, but that was beside the point. He was
correct in assuming I would not undertake a long investigation on the
off-chance of proving it.
In its own horrible way, some of the Maxwell treatment was salutary.
Journalists are used to being treated with undue deference by a public
nervous of the powers of the press. Maxwell, who as a newspaper proprietor
hired and fired journalists wholesale, treated us with contempt. If we
failed to nail him in revenge, that was hardly his fault.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: Consumer pays pollution tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Lascelles omitted one significant point from his excellent
analysis of European Community ideas for a carbon (or pollution) tax ('A
mission to make the polluters pay', January 28).
The 'polluter pays' principle is the same as the 'consumer pays'. The
environmental lobby seems to be unaware of this simple equation. Is it not
better to offer industry tax incentives rather than punish its customers by
increasing a tax burden which would be passed on in higher prices?
And what about the Japanese and the Americans? There is little evidence from
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and elsewhere to suggest that a
good environmental example from Europe would be followed by our competitors,
especially at a time of world recession.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Deterrence in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, the disarmament measures announced by President George
Bush on Tuesday night, and by President Boris Yeltsin yesterday do not
directly affect western Europe. Both British and French officials were quick
to point out that, even after these measures are implemented, Russia and the
US will still have nuclear arsenals far larger than either Britain or
France.
But officials in both London and Paris are well aware that the reverse arms
race, if it continues at its present rate, will before long reach a point
where the size of the British and French arsenals becomes a consideration
affecting US and Russian decisions.
And without waiting for that point to be reached, it is already abundantly
clear that the old rationale for the deployment of nuclear weapons in
western Europe no longer applies. Mr Tom King, Britain's defence secretary,
effectively admitted as much yesterday when he invited journalists to draw
their own conclusions about the targeting of Britain's submarine-based
missiles from Nato's declaration that it no longer viewed the former Soviet
Union as an adversary. It no longer makes sense for British or French
strategic weapons to be targeted on Russian cities.
The threat to western Europe from Soviet conventional power has now been
removed. There is therefore no longer a justification for any Nato country
to retain an option of being the first to use nuclear weapons. The remaining
function of nuclear weapons is, so to speak, to deter each other. Given that
there are a great many of them around, particularly at present in the former
Soviet Union but potentially also in the Middle East and the Third World, no
country wants to be exposed to the threat of their being used against it.
Three choices
Three ways to avoid that risk suggest themselves. One is to be armed with
nuclear weapons of your own as a deterrent. But that solution, if
generalised, leads to a world with dozens of nuclear powers. Few theorists,
and no political leaders, are prepared to say that such a world would be a
safe one. Consequently there is more or less of a consensus on the
preferability of a second and contrary option, which is to limit the spread
of nuclear weapons as strictly as possible. That is the object of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), of which Britain was a co-sponsor
with the US and the Soviet Union, and to which France too is now a party.
The awkward long-term question for Britain and France is whether, by
insisting on the necessity of maintaining their own independent national
deterrents, they do not risk undermining the NPT and making it more
difficult to persuade states such as Kazakhstan and Ukraine to adhere to it.
The awkward short-term question, for Britain in particular, is whether a
decision to commission a fourth Trident submarine, which is due to be taken
within the next weeks or months, might not in present circumstances be seen
as a step in the wrong direction, sending a wrong signal to states now
considering their nuclear options.
Uniform security
It was perhaps with such thoughts in mind that President Francois Mitterrand
recently suggested the necessity of working out a 'European nuclear
doctrine'. Certainly Britain and France would be well advised, if they wish
to retain their nuclear forces, to relate them as clearly as possible to the
security of Europe as a whole. If they decide that a tactical air-to-surface
missile is necessary as a deterrent against new nuclear powers, they would
surely be well advised to pool their resources in developing it.
The third solution, compatible with both of the others, is the one suggested
by Mr Yeltsin yesterday: a co-operative effort to build anti-missile
defences. Implausible when President Ronald Reagan suggested it as a way of
making nuclear weapons 'impotent and obsolete', it becomes less so as an
insurance against a single strike from a novice nuclear power. It is
certainly worth examining, and if it goes ahead Europe should make sure of
being included in it.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Sundered chains: The process of change within the Indian
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's industrialists are braced for a shock. They may soon have to face
competition. If they survive they could become serious players in the global
markets. They are by nature survivors. 'We enjoy the privileges of a
monopoly in some of our businesses,' acknowledged the beaming chairman of
Kanoria Chemicals &amp; Industries in Calcutta, 'and we also welcome the
government's new economic policy, which opens the market to all comers.'
There was just one little thing. Competition should first be confined to
Indian companies. Then the newly strengthened enterprises should try their
hand at exports. Only when they had thus proved their mettle should foreign
imports be allowed in. But if there is to be no foreign capital, I
protested, local new entrants to highly capitalised industries will face
impossibly high start-up costs. Mr S S Kanoria smiled expansively.
A company boss in another sector spread his hands to emphasise a different
point. 'Of course I built my business cheaply by bribing officials to grant
licences,' he confessed. 'You call that corrupt. I call it the only way it
has been possible to do business in India. Now, under the new economic
policy, licences from the central government are no longer needed. We shall
have to learn new methods.' But Mr M Z A Baig, principal executive officer
of Tata Services, insisted that the Tata companies had never resorted to
bribes.
Another chairman, whose varied interests include a huge tea plantation, was
even more positive about New Delhi's liberalisation of the economy. 'As soon
as the rupee becomes fully convertible,' said Mr B M Khaitan of MacNeill &amp;
Magor, 'we shall buy into certain companies in Britain.' Watch out,
Allied-Lyons.
Watch out, although not quite yet, Renault, Volkswagen and Fiat. The car
manufacturing plant of Maruti Udyog is just a half-hour's drive out of New
Delhi. Founded on the ruins of a venture initiated by the late Mr Sanjay
Gandhi, Maruti is 40 per cent owned by Suzuki, 60 per cent by the government
of India. The plant's snappy small cars have become the symbol of Indian
yuppiedom. Last year they exported 5,000 of the 123,000 they made; now they
are planning a new assembly line able to make 70,000 export models annually.
Their employees, well paid by Indian standards, seemed to my untrained eye
to be highly skilled, at home among the giant Komatsu steel presses and the
Kawasaki robots.
As many Indians see it, the government's plan to increase Suzuki's stake to
50 per cent is a dangerously revolutionary act of creeping privatisation.
Yet 10 years from now, Maruti should be wholly private - and able to
undercut most of the world's small-car manufacturers. Before that, the 200
per cent duty on imports also has to go. Meanwhile, as the number of local
carmakers grows (Tata has a new marque on the roads) the legal impediments
to the expansion of activities by large companies are to be removed.
Indian tycoons sit in palatial offices, surrounded by electronic
accoutrements familiar to their counterparts in New York, London or
Frankfurt. Outside you find the overpopulated pavements of Mother Theresa's
universe; as soon as you come down for a taxi a skeletal hand appears before
your face, begging. The India most foreigners can understand is confined to
the urban industrialised sector, minus the city poor. Indians call it the
'organised sector'. The real India, a nation of villagers and rural
labourers, is a closed book.
The organised sector accounts for perhaps an eighth of the population, or
some 110m people. Most of the top-level Indians mumble that something must
be done to raise the living standards of the other seven-eighths but, beyond
rapid industrialisation and trickle-down, few seemed to have any solution.
I have doubts about the efficacy of trickle-down. If it comes, it will come
slowly. Hundreds of millions of people will die in abject poverty before it
does. Yet to those who believe that there is no alternative it must be
conceded that the potential for rapid growth is there. All that is required
is that New Delhi's politicians exhibit qualities superior to those of most
other politicians in most other countries.
India's neo-Thatcherite trio - the prime minister and the ministers of
finance and commerce - are trying to rise to the moment. The prime minister,
Mr P V Narashima Rao, was regarded as a stop-gap when he formed a government
last June, following the assassination of Mr Rajiv Gandhi during an
inconclusive election campaign. Yet the 70-year-old Mr Rao has so far held
his government together in spite of continuing violence in Assam (where a
political deal may contain the troubles), the Punjab (where he hopes to hold
an election), and Kashmir.
He has also presided over the formulation of the most radical programme of
economic liberalisation in independent India's history. The question, much
debated in New Delhi, of how much is genuine and how much has been forced on
the government by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is
secondary. The important point is that a start is being made on dismantling
the quasi-socialist state built by Nehru and his successors under Soviet
influence.
There will be setbacks. Soviet spares are missed, especially by the
military. Rouble-rupee trade, built up by previous governments, has
vanished. Inflation may topple the Rao government. The 'exit programme', an
Indian phrase meaning the redeployment or retraining or sacking of redundant
workers, has already led to one strike. With no social security safety net,
unemployment can mean a return to pavement life. Corruption will take at
least a generation to weed out. The bureaucracy will take years to uproot.
State governments will continue to be obstructive. You could cast doubt on
the whole experiment. Mr Swarj Paul, who travels frequently to India from
his Caparo Group headquarters in London, observes that, so far, little has
really changed.
Yet Mr Rao's two key ministers seem absolutely determined to press ahead.
The finance minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, is a distinguished economist. The
commerce minister, Mr P Chidambaram is a lawyer and a Harvard MBA. With Mr
Rao, this troika is trying to reconstruct India's economy. It has New
Delhi's sophisticated economists, although not its academics, behind it. So
far it has devalued the rupee, cut government expenditure, abolished
industrial licensing, slashed export subsidies and introduced 'exim scrip',
a foreign exchange permit allowing companies to import goods to the value of
30 per cent of their exports. The scrip is freely tradeable; the margin on
scrip sales constitutes a hidden export subsidy. Clearances for foreign
investors, once held up, have suddenly begun to flow through. General
Motors, General Electric, IBM and, sensationally in view of past
antipathies, Coca-Cola have all signed recent deals. These and other
liberalisation measures are advertised on New Delhi posters with the symbol
of an unchained elephant.
The powerful beast may turn on its new mahout. Next month's budget will be a
test of the popular will and the opposition parties' patience. Further
public expenditure cuts are required by the deal with the Fund. The
government's objective is that the overall public sector deficit, which
includes the states and public enterprises, is to be reduced from 12.5 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1990-91 to about 7 per cent within four
years. British or American treasury officials could not promise the
equivalent.
Dr Singh has also undertaken to reform the tax system, which at the moment
depends heavily on excise duties. The Indian government proposes to
restructure the banks (nationalised by Mrs Indira Gandhi), partly to
introduce competition and partly to reduce the requirements imposed on
commercial banks to hold large amounts of government debt at below-market
rates or, as bad, to lend to borrowers in sectors classed by the government
as 'priority'. (About half of lending is at subsidised rates of interest.)
He will also try to restructure his international borrowings, although from
a position of less weakness than on the day he took office, when he found
the foreign exchange reserves down to a fortnight's imports and had to pawn
Dollars 600m of India's gold. Dr Singh is not relying on a surge in foreign
investments, or a rush home of money from the wealthy diaspora of
non-resident Indians. Just restructuring, exports and hard slog, with the
loans to tide him over. Mexico, he points out, took seven years - from 1982
to 1989 - to come right. He muses that India could take half that time.
Maybe. But the sub-continent's many fundamental economic problems will not
be solved in one generation.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Arts: Humperdinck's 'Konigskinder' comes to the Coliseum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rare, risk-taking revival at the Coliseum tonight: the return to London
after eight decades' absence of Konigskinder or The Prince and the
Goosegirl. An opera first performed at the New York Metropolitan in 1910 and
at Covent Garden (among many other European theatres) soon afterwards, it
disappeared into semi-perpetual neglect after the First World War.
The title will probably not mean a lot to the average English National Opera
patron. The name of the composer - Humperdinck - should mean a lot more to
that same average patron, but as the creator of another opera entirely,
Hansel and Gretel. The story concerns a couple of fairy-tale lovers, the
Goose Girl and the King's Son, also a Witch living in a forest, and a
Broommaker, Woodcutter and lame Minstrel from a town (Hellabrunn) full of
disastrously self-important bourgeoisie; in the finale the lovers meet their
death out in the winter snow, and are then mourned by a procession of
Hellabrunn children. What on earth are ENO up to?
What they are up to, I have every confidence, is the revelation to a wider
public of a late-Romantic masterpiece both important and ravishingly
beautiful. The new production, put on in recessionary hard times and at
noble risk to box-office health, is above all the love-child of Peter Jonas,
ENO general director and a Humperdinck appassionato to whose personal
insistence we already owe the company's magnificent modern-dress Hansel and
Gretel of 1987.
In the audience for the 1986 production of Konigskinder at the Wexford
Festival - which is where many of us first fell under the work's spell  -
Jonas had been prominently visible, and talk of a proposed ENO staging
mounted by the house's A-team of Elder (conductor) and Pountney (producer)
began to circulate soon afterwards. This season, rumour hardens into fact;
whatever may be the fate of the tonight's premiere, Jonas's active devotion
to the Humperdinck cause must already have secured him a place in
opera-intendants' heaven.
Hansel was the first of Humperdinck's ten stage works. Its worldwide triumph
was for the composer a burden as well as a boon. Konigskinder took a long
while to achieve final form (in its original version of 1897 it had been a
striking experiment, a play with music accompanying notated speech);
Humperdinck only received the permission of the playwright Ernst Rosmer
(pseudonym of Elsa Bernstein-Porges) to make a fully-fledged Konigskinder
opera after years of struggle.
The general rule about neglected operas is that there is often a good,
practical reason why they got that way. The Konigskinder case is, I believe,
different. Its 'problem' was not just that the runaway success of Hansel had
still to be followed up, but that it launches itself as a work of apparently
Hansel-like nature and substance: a fairy tale of folk-ish hue and melodic
inflection that, like Hansel, opens and closes in that cradle of German
Romantic sensibility, the dark forest.
Soon, however, it develops a considerable 'differentness' - as David
Pountney sees it, Konigskinder operates on three interlinked levels, as
fairy tale, symbolist drama with social-satire overtones, and (above all in
the final act) allegory of the seasons with a powerful, ecologically-aware
undercurrent: in his words, a vision of 'eternal winter'.
Admittedly, the complications of the plot bring with them an immense number
of traps for the unwary. It is folk-tale simple - characters specified by
jobs, not names - but also, as suggested earlier, folk-tale eventful. Its
panoply of echt-Deutsch scenic and symbolic devices - geese, flower
garlands, falling stars and poisoned loaves of bread, just for a start -
provide a potentially deep chasm of embarrassment for performers and
audiences to topple into together.
As in all worthwhile operas, what holds it all together, making the mixture
not just meaningful but powerfully affecting and 'relevant', is, of course,
the music. The score allies post-Wagnerian construction and richness of
vocal and instrumental sound to a radiant freshness of sensibility entirely
personal to Humperdinck.
Pountney's word for the composer's creative stance is 'innocent'. This, his
says, has determined his treatment of the opera. The example of his
celebrated 1982 production of Dvorak's Rusalka, another late-Romantic
fairy-tale transformed on the ENO stage into a Freudian fable of sexual
awakening, is not appropriate here, since the chromatic sensuality of
Dvorak's idiom has no parallel in Konigskinder.
This is in no way to suggest that Pountney believes the opera simple-minded
or archly naive; indeed, it's hard to think he could, or imagine anyone one
coming to the opera for the first time who does not fall under the spell of
its limpid sounds, shiningly broad spans of lyrical invention, and gentle
but utterly purposeful dramatic modulation from light to tragically dark
over the course of its three acts.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Arts: Good Rockin' Tonite] - Strand Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cliff was there in the audience, and Lonnie, and Marty and genial Joe Brown.
And there they were on stage, too, or rather the young musicians given the
thankless task of impersonating the old rockers of the 1950s, who have now
become old rockers in their fifties. Of course by the end everyone was on
stage for 'Good rockin' tonite', including Jack Good who was credited with
devising and writing a show which is all about, well, Jack Good.
Good was the Balliol man who in 1956 was given the job of producing the
BBC's first television programme aimed at that new social group, teenagers.
Ignoring pleas for vignettes on mountaineering and fashion he rounded up the
skiffle groups and first rockers, who were surfacing in Soho, and gave the
world Six Five Special. It was such a success that Good was sacked. He moved
to ITV and repeated the trick with Oh Boy. After that there were 30 years of
relative obscurity before this, his last public engagement. In the summer he
enters a monastic order in Texas.
Anyone expecting a coherent plot, witty dialogue, and perceptive insights is
in dreamland. What you get is a re-creation of the shows, in particular Oh
Boy, from a likeable cast, better at evoking the music than the charisma.
Through it all Philip Bird, as the young Jack Good, plays the overbearing
egoist, desperately hamming Shakespeare at times of crisis.
The only moments of hard core reality in this escapist evening were when the
old rockers in the audience happily booed when the character playing that
managerial Svengali, Larry Parnes, came on stage and when Michael Dimitri,
as Gene Vincent, burst the zip on his leather trousers. The show was also
slow on the litmus test of getting them dancing in the aisles: it needed
Bird at the finale to grab a girl from the stalls to get the joint bopping.
Tim Whitnall was convincing as Eddie Cochran and endearing as Cliff, and
Gavin Stanley made Billy Fury (who died nine years ago to the night) more
interesting than he managed to be in life. But as an insider's view of a
musical revolution it was a non-starter. As a party it was fine, and anyone
mindful of 'Move it', 'Run around Sue', 'Be-Bop-a-Lula' and scores more of
those artless paeons to pure teenage love, will enjoy themselves
tremendously for the knock down price of Pounds 10 a ticket, and for eight
weeks only.
My nostalgia for the era suffered two setbacks: at the end, when
Anna-Juliana Clare, one of the under-used women in the cast, belted out a
song of the '60s, 'Respect', which exposed the shallowness of '50s rock; and
at the beginning, when the tucked and tanned celebrity audience eased into
their seats, I realised that the years had shrunk to nothing the generation
gap between 'Good Old Days' celebrations of 'Olde Tyme Music Hall' and 'Rock
and Roll' revival nights. Both satisfy the natural reverence of oldies for
the innocent music of their youth.

How long before people start yearning for the good old days when Europe's
big bad ogre was that cuddly old bear, the Soviet Union? The speed with
which post-unification Germany seems to be reverting, in so many minds, to
the bete noire of Europe is both startling and somewhat frightening.
It seems a suitable moment for Channel 4 to start its series The Germans
(9.00), examining the country and its people.
At 9.30 BBC2 begins its series on 'the new Spain', Fire In The Blood. BBC2's
other new series, Redundant (8.00), was prompted by the number of businesses
which closed in 1991; more than 400 every working day.
The opening programme looks at Tills of Battle, said to be the oldest
ironmonger in Britain, which was established in 1680, survived revolution,
wars and depression, but was forced into voluntary liquidation three weeks
before Christmas.
In Talking To Myself well-known people interview themselves, beginning with
Esther Rantzen (10.20).

FT  30 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Shocking tone for
united colours - Controversial questions of taste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Benetton has certainly achieved one of the basic aims of advertising - to
get noticed - with its proposed ad featuring the dying moments of an Aids
sufferer. The Italian clothing manufacturer has obviously decided that shock
tactics work on the level of attention seeking; whether they work on the
more profound level - increased sales - is not so simply resolved.
Benetton's Aids ad has met widespread outrage. The Advertising Standards
Authority, the UK organisation which operates self-regulating codes of
practice for advertising, last year ordered the removal of 3,000 Benetton
posters featuring a blood-smeared new-born baby after protests from the
public. At the time, Luciano Benetton, the company's managing director,
argued the bloody baby caused little trouble in any of the 50 other
countries where it was due to run. Since then, the number of protests has
increased, even from Italy.
But what Benetton might be guilty of this time is not so much poor taste as
thoughtless marketing. After all, many charities in the UK have been trying
to shock the public for years and have yet to receive slapped wrists from
the self-regulatory ASA.
The ASA received not a single complaint concerning The Romanian Orphanage
Trust, which last year ran an ad, calculated to shock (right) in national
newspapers. In a sense, the Trust could also have been accused of
tastelessly exploiting a clever marketing gimmick to attract attention. But
it was not, because public feelings have adjusted to some levels of shock in
certain ill-defined contexts.
It now looks likely that the Benetton ad will not be welcomed by most
British magazine publishers, most of whom have taken counsel from the ASA.
The ASA - which has no power to ban an advertisement - watches two areas
under the general heading of taste; sexism and general decency.
According to Caroline Crawford of the ASA: 'The number of advertisements
which might be termed sexist are on the decline, but the number of
complaints about those advertisements is on the increase'.
The ASA has studied the issue of sexual stereotyping in commercials and
finds that it is, for the most part, a dying practice, mostly found in trade
publications which have a predominantly male readership.
When it comes to the more general issue of taste - under which complaints
against the Benetton ad would be considered - the ASA works on the basis of
precedent.
'Certainly, over the last couple of years, advertisers have shown themselves
much more prepared to use shock tactics to draw attention to their causes,
their products, than was previously the case,' says Crawford.
But the crucial difference is location - which audience the advertisement is
attempting to target.
'With charities, for example, the public has come to accept that shock
tactics are not just an acceptable but perhaps even necessary way of
advertising. But the public is not prepared to see a commercial company do
the same thing. It's also a question of corporate image, most companies
would not wish to be associated with advertising which shocks,' says
Crawford.
The ASA has in the past cautioned Amnesty International a couple of times,
and 'if we felt a charity had gone overboard we would mention it to them.
But most charities use national broadsheets to advertise in, where they can
be fairly sure that the readership is not going to be offended. Shock ads
might not be appropriate in other types of press,' says Crawford.
That would seem to suggest Benetton's big mistake. Rather than build a
carefully-planned campaign around the clever and now commonly used marketing
trick of shock-impact, it has once again exploded with an ad which seems
gratuitously and not purposefully shocking. One approach would have been to
deal with important but delicate issues in a way which portrays the company
as having a sensitive image.
Benetton itself feels differently. Oliviero Toscani, the freelance
photographer who has been its advertising 'guru' for the past nine years,
staunchly defends the company's publicity.
Using 'real-life' pictures underlines Benetton's commitment to social issues
and its distaste for run-of-the-mill corporate advertising, dismissed as
'banal'. Benetton's publicity should make consumers think; selling clothes
has nothing to do with it, Toscani claims.
So it may not be a mistake at all. While the British version of the monthly
fashion magazine Vogue is not going to run the Benetton Aids ad, its sister
publication in the US plans to do so. But only Benetton's - and US Vogue's -
future sales figures can be a reliable guide to what advertising styles are
now socially acceptable.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Technology: Youthful new look for pylons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity privatisation has prompted a redesign of Britain's most familiar
landmarks - the giant pylons which stride across the countryside from power
stations to cities.
Since 1935, when the national grid was formed, the towers supporting the
grid's high-voltage lines have grown in size as the demand for 'juice' has
grown. The tall lattice structures still bear the hallmark of the original
Meccano-type towers designed for the old Central Electricity Board in the
1930s.
But new shapes are being evaluated by engineers and advisers of the National
Grid Company (NGC), the privately based specialist group, which has
inherited the bulk power transmission systemfrom the now defunct Central
Electricity Generating Board.
The most striking new shape is the folded plate tower, an elegant steel
structure resembling motorway illumination poles. It has three gull-shaped
wings to carry the six bunches of conductors charged with up to 400,000
volts.
Latticed steel is present in all the other new designs. Most are based on a
new standard model so far only used on the lines connecting Scotland's
Torness power station with the main transmission system. Known as the L12,
the model has upward-swept arms compared with the drooping arms of most
British pylons.
The work of the designers is prompted by another by-product of privatisation
 -the proposed 1,800 MW gas-fired power station at ICI's Wilton site on
Teesside, which requires the biggest extension to the national grid for 20
years.
The project has stirred fears about the effect of new power lines on such
beauty spots as the Vale of York. But the changes are not only about
appearances. The lighter and more slender L12 was developed because of the
introduction in the 1980s of all-aluminium alloy conductors to replace
steel-reinforced cables.
The designers hope to have a portfolio of three or four new options ready by
the spring.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Technology: Light at the end of the tunnel - Newly
privatised UK utilities are expecting IT to give them a competitive edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVE MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thames Water's customer information system is one of its biggest capital
investments - second only to the London Ring Main, the three-metre diameter
tunnel surrounding the capital.
Although the project is one of the more ambitious information technology
developments undertaken by a UK utility, it is not unique. Rather it
illustrates the vast scale of IT investment in the newly privatised water
and electricity industries - and the pivotal role that investment is playing
in creating a competing, and competitive, utilities sector.
The water industry has some Pounds 25bn to spend on capital projects in the
decade to 1999 - of which around 10 per cent will go on support systems.
The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 big water and sewage
companies in England and Wales, says that Pounds 275m of the industry's
Pounds 2.29bn capital expenditure last year went on 'miscellaneous
projects', of which IT constitutes the bulk.
It is tempting to view this as some sort of 'privatisation dividend', a
reaction to years of public sector starvation. But money is not just being
spent for the sake of it.
First, individual systems face rigorous cost-benefit analysis. 'There is no
question in my mind - the National Power board takes a highly commercial
view of return on investment,' says John Handby, IT director.
Second, some of these projects are driven by pre-privatisation IT
strategies: Thames Water set its agenda in 1986; Welsh Water is building on
its integrated business information system, conceived in 1985.
There is no doubt, however, that privatisation accelerated programmes and
changed priorities. 'Privatisation was not the catalyst but it fuelled the
process,' says Jeff Maynard, Welsh Water's IT manager.
But what is happening now says Declan Good, managing associate of
consultants CSC Index, is that these companies are shifting emphasis from
mandatory projects to more glamorous competitive initiatives. This
transition is nowhere more evident than at National Power, the biggest
electricity generator.
National Power inherited a fragmented IT infrastructure. It had lost IT and
telecommunications assets, including its central mainframe, to Nuclear
Electric in the dismantling of the Central Electricity Generating Board. Its
remaining technology was complex, often incompatible and, says Handby, its
core business systems were incapable of meeting the demands of its new
commercial environment.
After a 'survival phase', in which it secured short-term solutions to keep
the business running, National Power committed itself to a substantial
investment in a radical IT infrastructure to underpin the new company. The
programme is one of the largest computing and telecommunications projects
ever undertaken by a company in Europe.
It comprises core hardware and systems software - Amdahl mainframe and
Digital Equipment Vax machines, a new company-wide network, applications,
tools and procedures. When it is completed 70 Vax machines will be
distributed across the company linked to 3,000 networked Compaq personal
computers.
Handby's priority has been to devolve computing to the remotest parts of an
unusually dispersed organisation. In technological terms that has meant
single-screen access to an integrated network.
But its effect is farther reaching. 'We are building a true networked
organisation,' says Handby, replacing the formal hierarchical culture of a
public utility with a 'flatter, highly responsive' structure, which has
shifted power from corporate headquarters to the power stations themselves.
Distributing technology 'is as clear a signal of intent', Handby says, 'as
getting rid of the executive loos'.
National Power's IT strategy was developed in just three months. It is now
18 months into an aggressive three-year programme. This has seen it:
Implement a company-wide communications network, called Unity;
Install new hardware and systems software in new data centres;
Design, build and roll out a series of applications: office systems,
procurement, work management, financial reporting - and an innovative
operational information system which gives the business access to a
reservoir of operational power plant data.
National Power's experience is exceptional but its conviction that IT will
prove an agent of cultural change is shared.
Maynard expects IT to 'empower Welsh Water workers' - but that does not
translate into a uniform approach. Good says the scope and ambition of IT
initiatives across these utilities is conditioned largely by the management
style they inherited, and their relative sophistication when they 'hit'
privatisation.
But there are clear priorities emerging. The first is customer service
systems.
At first sight this is hard to fathom. Water companies retain a monopoly, as
do the electricity suppliers in the domestic market, until full deregulation
in 1998. So is their interest in customer service systems more than just a
fashionable import from the US?
'We simply would not survive very long under the new regime if we didn't
take this seriously,' says Maynard.
Customer service initiatives address three interrelated issues: inflexible
billing systems; scattered, and often incompatible customer databases; and
inferior customer service organisations.
Of these there is no doubt that privatisation has concentrated minds on the
inadequacy of existing billing arrangements in both industries. As Maynard
says, Welsh Water's customer accounting system 'handles our most important
customer contact'.
Yet, says Good, these same systems are elsewhere 'bogging companies down' to
the extent that they can only introduce creative service products or complex
tariffs with great difficulty, because they cannot bill for them. But while
the motivation is the same, the approach varies greatly.
Severn Trent Water turned to IBM imaging technology as the basis of its
customer service effort. Ian Hislop, director of computer systems, says the
systems were built to deliver immediate improvements in the speed and
quality of its response to customers.
Thames Water, on the other hand, is building a 'one-stop customer contact
point' at its customer centre in Swindon - from the bottom up.
This strategy, says project manager Peter Ratcliffe, is dependent on a
complex computing and telecommunications infrastructure which will integrate
all Thames's customer service contacts.
A second priority is for 'work and asset' management systems. Asset
management in both the water and electricity industries demands not just
proper job or workflow administration but geographical information systems
(GISs) to keep track of the network.
Thames Water is three years into its own IBM mainframe-based GIS project (it
has 20,000 maps loaded so far). But, says Ratcliffe, it will take another
five years to digitise Thames's own water and sewer network on top. The
ultimate trick, he says, will be to give its customer and job management
centres direct access to that integrated model.
In part these GIS initiatives are driven by legislation: the Street Work Act
and respective customer charters oblige utilities to take better control of
their physical infrastructure as well as their field workforce.
In the longer term, the emergence of an IT-based customer service culture
among UK utilities raises the prospect that, ultimately, providing the
service could be decoupled from owning and running the physical
infrastructure.
In the mean time, says Good, 'having the utilities around the place has
certainly kept the wolf from the (IT consultants') door'.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Carat gives Sundays
the stick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the UK's 'quality' Sunday newspapers have spawned new sections and
increased in girth, advertisers have become more interested in who actually
reads what.
Ray Kelly, chief executive of Carat UK, the media space buyers, was
increasingly frustrated at traditional industry-sponsored research which
treats each title as a single entity.
So Carat carried out its own Quality Sundays Sections Readership Research -
Quaser - with some surprising results. It covered the Sunday Times,
Observer, Sunday Telegraph and Independent on Sunday.
The research found, for instance, that the Sunday Times business section was
one of the least read sections of the paper, despite charging premium
advertising rates.
Giving the main news section a base of 100, the business pages scored only
57 and only 52 on the index of up-market AB readers. On the same index, the
review section scored 90 and 96 respectively even though advertising rates
are lower. Low female interest in business could be one of the reasons for
the difference. On value per Pounds 1 for AB adult readers of the Sunday
Times, the business section scored 54 compared with 346 for the review
section.
The business section was well read by those who did read it - 111 on the
index - but there were four times the number of 'exposures per Pounds 1' in
the review.
Other findings were that the amount of time spent reading the four Sunday
papers was very similar at around 113 minutes and that AB readers spent less
time than the average.
The research was carried out by re-interviewing more than 1,000 regular
readers identified by a large general consumer research panel. Data on
lifestyle and product use is now being added.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Airlines set fair
for improved service - Trends that may mask a move to higher prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has 'service' become a buzzword in the traditionally utilitarian US airline
industry? Or is it a marketing wheeze, masking a push for higher prices?
While European and Asian airlines have been soft selling to business
customers for years, US carriers have started to flaunt business class
services for the first time on internal routes.
Lavish marketing literature - displaying roses on dinner-trays, foot-rests,
and wide leather seats - is becoming rife. Northwest Airlines, for example,
plans to introduce personal videos for all economy class travellers, and is
putting seatback televisions into all its aircraft.
But US air travellers may have cause for scepticism. After the hefty
fare-discounting of the past 18 months, there are signs that internal fares
are firming. All carriers would like to push the trend further, and some of
the latest initiatives seem designed to achieve just that.
Perhaps the loudest noises have come from American Airlines. With a good
deal of fanfare, the Dallas-based carrier announced that it would
reconfigure 10 DC-10 aircraft used on its seven flights-a-day service
between New York and Los Angeles. Out would go almost 100 coach seats, and
in would come a new 'business class' cabin, housing up to 52 higher-margin
passengers.
American suggests that the domestic US market is to copy the international
marketplace, where three-tier pricing is commonplace. The motivation would
be the increasing number of 'global' travellers who demand continuity of
service.
It did not take big rivals like United and Delta long to retaliate. United
tartly observed that it revamped its own business class last November and
that this is already available on 'feeder' flights - domestic flights which
connect with aircraft going on to international destinations. Delta, in more
mild form, makes a similar observation. Even Air Canada hopped on the
bandwagon, announcing an overhaul of its DC-9 fleet, providing 'executive
class' on all flights between the US and Canada.
A solid pricing argument can be made for the three-class system. A full
economy fare for LA to New York is Dollars 752. A first class ticket is
Dollars 1,288. American says the new business class fare will be equidistant
between these two levels - at around Dollars 1,000.
The key unknown, however, is how many passengers will want the intermediate
service. Those extra dollars will not buy all the first class facilities -
personal video screens, for example - but they will achieve extra leg-room,
leather seats, and a superior meal service.
On the plus side, business class sells elsewhere in the world, and MGM
Grand, owned by West Coast businessman Kirk Kekorian, has prospered by
providing upmarket facilities on the LA-New York route.
That said, some travel agents are cautious. One Manhattan agent noted there
was 'not much demand' to existing business class feeder flights.
Similar impressions in Europe have taken years to overcome. Market research
showed passengers' priorities were safety and cheap tickets. No frills
services on Laker and People Express, where passengers could bring
sandwiches and load their own luggage, were the result.
Says Virgin: 'We don't regard seatback screens as soft-sell. We have had
calls from passengers to check whether a flight has them or not.' Virgin's
other ploys are among the softest sells in the business: free head massages
and aromatherapy kits to help you overcome jet lag.
In the heavily regulated world outside the US, such extras might make a
difference to customer loyalty: BA, JAL and Virgin all charge Pounds 2,895
for a business class return fare from London to Tokyo.
Northwest Airlines is spending Dollars 70m on personal videos as part of a
general Dollars 450m upgrade. More grandiose developments, which might allow
the system to provide home shopping facilities and viewing of live sporting
events, are promised for the future.
The airline, moreover, was frank about its motive, noting a lowly standing
in the 'customer preference' league. More objective observers might put the
point more bluntly, saying that Northwest became notorious for shoddy
service in the wake of a troublesome merger with Republic Airlines in 1986.
Whether free videos make amends remains to be seen.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Technology: Communications in power struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Information technology managers grappling with the problem of creating
corporate communications networks could do worse than look at the experience
of Britain's three privatised electricity generators.
With the break-up of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1989 into
three competing generating companies - National Power, PowerGen and Nuclear
Electric - the company's communications infrastructure was torn apart. The
generators either lost or were forced to share vital infrastructure with
their new rivals.
In 1990 National Power started a three-year programme to build optical fibre
networks between its 43 sites which would support the company's needs for
voice, data and videoconferencing until the end of the decade.
The network would transform the generator's business by improving
efficiency, changing the way it worked with its customers and providing
revenues in its own right.
Faced with a similar problem PowerGen had to completely rebuild the
infrastructure in its 26 sites. To keep costs down conventional copper
cabling was used to network the company's 2,500 PCs and workstations.
According to Jeffery Jones, PowerGen's telecommunications services manager,
optical fibre was only used when necessary to meet network capacity
requirements or for safety considerations within power stations.
As a result, by the end of 1990 PowerGen had spent more than Pounds 6m on
its telephone and computer networks.
National Power's was a more ambitious programme costing Pounds 20m, but
Chris Yates, head of telecommunications services, was convinced the
long-term approach to the network was the correct one. 'We did not plan to
do this again in another two or three years, which other companies may find
themselves doing, like it or not,' he says.
The first priority was the company's phone network with 15,000 extensions
spread around the country and connected by lines leased from BT, formerly
British Telecom, or Mercury. Even before this was finished at the end of
1990 important decisions had already been made about which equipment to use
in the rest of the programme.
Yates decided to use a single supplier for the core network hardware and the
network management software. It would be easier to gain the operational
expertise which would improve network efficiency and contain the running
costs.
AT&amp;T of the US was chosen to supply the core network infrastructure which
included more than 2,000 miles of optical fibre cable and 1,000 miles of
copper cable.
A team of four contractors were used to build the network, and the overall
project management responsibility was shared between National Power and PA
Consulting.
National Power decided not to put the main contract out to competitive
tender even though it could have reduced the final cost. 'For a key product
such as this you cannot afford to go to competitive tenders and the
professional relationship with our suppliers has more than repaid that
decision,' says Yates.
The quality of the relationship between AT&amp;T, the contractors and National
Power meant that the project was completed in nine months. This was despite
the unforeseen difficulty of flying equipment from the US at the height of
the Gulf War.
According to Yates, current network usage did not dictate the need for
high-capacity optical fibre. He expects it to be five years before the
company sees the real benefits of its decision to use more advanced optical
fibre for most connections.
At Power Gen, Jones is already reconsidering the need for increasing network
capacity with optical fibre to the desktop. 'The need for document imaging
may force us down the route for greater use of fibre,' he says.
National Power expects to gain the competitive advantage from its early
investment in optical fibre. 'The choice of fibre over copper will influence
the company's business over the next 10 or 15 years,' says Yates.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Brel lodges faults claim against BR
 -Transport
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BREL, the privatised train-maker once part of British Rail, has lodged a
multi-million pound claim against BR for the cost of rectifying faults in
trains which Brel itself made.
Problems blamed on the innovative design of the Class 158 diesel express
trains have badly delayed deliveries and caused trains already supplied to
BR to be recalled for costly modifications.
At the Commons transport committee yesterday it emerged that Brel's owners -
Asea Brown Boveri, Trafalgar House and Brel's management - had won exemption
from warranty claims by BR when they bought the company in 1989.
BR said in written evidence that Brel had made a 'very substantial claim'
for reimbursement of costs incurred in rectifying design defects. Rail
analysts say the figure exceeds Pounds 10m.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Weakness in Lloyd's solvency seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Lloyd's of London over the next three years could seriously weaken
its solvency, according to figures published yesterday by Chatset, the
company that analyses the performance of the insurance market's syndicates.
Chatset estimates that losses for 1989, 1990 and last year may exceed Pounds
3.2bn against deposits and reserves of around Pounds 4.4bn at the end of
1990.
'On our projections Lloyd's will have lost, by the time the 1991 figures are
out in 1994, the equivalent of the accumulated deposits of the entire
membership,' Chatset warns.
Names - the individuals whose assets make up the market's capital base  -
deposit an amount equivalent to 30 per cent of their stamp capacity (the
amount of premiums they are allowed to accept under Lloyd's rules) with
Lloyd's.
Chatset suggests that urgent action is needed to bolster the the market's
central fund, out of which claims are paid if Names are unable to meet their
commitments. The fund currently stands at around Pounds 450m.
The group's grim predictions come as Lloyd's leadership grapples with the
implications of implementing wide-ranging reforms of the market's structure
recommended by a task force just over a fortnight ago.
It had been expected that the 1989 year, the results of which Lloyd's will
report in June, would produce losses of more than Pounds 1bn. However, the
scale of Chatset's forecast losses for 1990 and last year - which will be
reported this year and next - has provoked consternation in the market,
where insiders dispute the predictions.
Chatset says losses in 1990 could again exceed Pounds 1bn (against a
forecast Pounds 1.35bn in 1989) and losses for last year could be at least
Pounds 700m, partially because of the continuing impact of claims as a
result of US asbestosis and pollution awards.
According to Chatset an average of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 600m a
year will be needed to top up reserves.
The market was badly hit by a number of substantial losses at the end of
last year. The biggest losses came from Typhoon Mireille which devastated
parts of Japan in September, leaving Lloyd's with claims of more than Pounds
200m.
Chatset expects the results for 1990 and last year for marine syndicates -
specialists in the insurance of ships, cargoes and offshore oil rigs - to be
worse than expected.
The group's preliminary figures indicate that the rate rises introduced last
year by marine underwriters were insufficient to restore profitability.
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agencies Association,
yesterday described the predictions for last year as 'completely and grossly
inaccurate'. He added: 'By any stretch of the imagination they are
crystal-ball gazing.'
Solicitors acting for a group of Names involved in litigation with their
agencies confirmed yesterday that they were seeking an out-of-court
settlement. More than 570 Names, members of syndicate 533 managed by the
Warrilow Agency, initiated legal action more than four years ago to recover
insurance losses of more than Pounds 80m. The case was expected to come to
court this year.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Customs launches Traveller's Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES TO speed up clearance through customs for people entering the UK
were announced yesterday, with the publication by Customs &amp; Excise of a
Traveller's Charter, John Willman writes.
The charter sets out the standards to which customs officers will work and
promises surveys of performance. A training programme has been created to
ensure that service is 'courteous and helpful'.
Officers who normally deal with the public will wear name badges unless the
nature of their duties would make this unsafe. Greater publicity will be
given to the complaints procedure under which compensation is payable if
belongings are damaged.
Among moves to speed up clearance times are a target of a maximum of 10
minutes waiting to declare goods and more 'red points' where air travellers
can declare goods and pay duty while waiting for their baggage to be
unloaded.
Ministers are also arguing for an increase in the value of duty-free goods
which can be imported from countries outside the EC.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Harland workers in dispute laid off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 500 workers at Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder, went on
strike yesterday in one of the most serious outbreaks of industrial unrest
since the company was privatised nearly three years ago.
The dispute, prompted by the company's decision to lay off four outfitters
for supporting an overtime ban, escalated as pickets manned the yard's main
gates in east Belfast.
Mr Jack Nicholl, an official of the Manufacturing Science and Finance Union,
said the workers were demanding the reinstatement of the outfitters in talks
with the management aimed at resolving the dispute.
The management said the dispute with the outfitters was caused by the
refusal of some of them to work night shifts earlier this week.
The outfitters, including plumbers and electricians, have been in dispute
with the company for a year over a qualifications payment which led to the
union imposing the overtime ban.
Harland has an order book filled until the end of 1994.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday gave his backing to a
business-led initiative to improve the job prospects of Britain's 6m
disabled adults.
The campaign, similar to the Opportunity 2000 initiative on women's
employment launched in October, is being supported by 21 companies,
including Barclays, Midland and National Westminster banks, and Grand
Metropolitan.
Mr Major said at the launch of the 10-point agenda for action, which is
being put forward by the Employers' Forum on Disability, that he would be
'commending the principles' to his cabinet colleagues.
But Mr Major was challenged by Labour to substantiate his commitment by
supporting a backbench bill on civil rights for disabled people due to be
debated in the Commons tomorrow.
Mr Alf Morris, the Labour MP sponsoring the bill, said his measure would
make employers respect the existing law which requires companies with 20 or
more employees to give 3 per cent of jobs to disabled people. Only 22 per
cent of employers meet that quota.

FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Fears over doctors' performance pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERFORMANCE PAY for 50,000 hospital doctors would be opposed if it was based
only on the number of patients they treated, the British Medical Association
said yesterday.
The BMA, which represents most of Britain's doctors, said it wanted
performance indicators to be based on the quality of patient care given, and
not just on its quantity.
The government wants to introduce performance pay for doctors next year.
It is understood that the Department of Health has asked the doctors' pay
review body to consider bonus payments for doctors who treat more patients
and cut waiting lists.
The BMA said it was concerned that there would be no additional funds for
performance pay, but that it would be 'a redistribution of income, with some
people paid more and others less.'
It said it was particularly concerned about performance indicators for
junior hospital doctors, who often worked up to 100 hours a week.
Performance-related pay for nurses is also being discussed, and is opposed
by the nursing unions.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Parents' survey adds to student fees controversy
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST parents with incomes of more than Pounds 15,500 a year would be
prepared to contribute to the tuition costs of their children's higher
education, according to a Mori survey released by the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors yesterday.
The survey will fuel controversy on whether students should pay fees in
addition to those paid by the state.
At present, no higher education institutions charge such 'top-up fees'. Many
vice-chancellors would like to, but the committee has been reluc-tant to
support action that would mean breaking ranks.
The average amount those surveyed said they would pay was just over Pounds
1,000.
While 72 per cent said the government should spend more on each student,
respondents were evenly divided on whether the state should pay all the
extra teaching costs of expanding the universities.
Respondents ranked job training as the top priority for public spending on
education while higher education was ranked sixth.

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA does not expect to gain access to loans from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) until after this year's US elections, according to the
deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank (central bank), Mr Jaap
Meijer.
Mr Meijer said he believed it would be politically impossible in an election
year to persuade the US Congress to repeal legislation blocking South
Africa's access to IMF funding, introduced as part of a US sanctions package
aimed at forcing political reform on Pretoria.
In Cape Town, Mr Meijer said IMF funding was not immediately necessary, as
the country was running a healthy surplus on the current account of the
balance of payments, estimated at R7bn (Pounds 1.4bn) for 1991. Gold and
foreign exchange reserves are also strong, reaching R10bn by the end of last
year.
However, economic growth had been disappointing in 1991, with real GDP
estimated to have contracted by about half a per cent.
Positive real growth is expected to resume this year, with the Reserve Bank
forecasting a 1.5 per cent increase.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Japan likely to support Russian oil, gas project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) is set to
further relax a long-standing policy against supporting Russian development
projects by providing financial backing for an oil and gas project on
Russia's Sakhalin island that could cost up to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn).
A consortium, including Mitsui of Japan and Marathon Oil and McDermott
International of the US, was awarded a letter of intent to conduct a project
feasibility study on Monday.
Government backing is crucial because of the inherent high-risk nature of
oil and gas development coupled with political uncertainties and the
long-term credits that would be required. Purely commercial finance for the
Sakhalin project could be prohibitively costly, if available at all.
Japan has long refused to back Russian development projects because of its
territorial dispute involving the four Kurile islands off the northern coast
of Hokkaido.
Miti, however, has taken the view that the Sakhalin project is of national
importance to Japan, although it is seeking ways for the partially
government-owned Sakhalin Oil Development Corporation (Sodeco) to
participate in the development.
Mitsui said yesterday it was confident of receiving support from the
Japanese government, and was also hopeful of obtaining US government backing
for the project. A Mitsui executive said preliminary studies indicated the
project would be feasible if oil prices stayed above Dollars 15 a barrel.
The formal feasibility study is to be completed by the end of next year,
with first oil production hoped for around 1995. Projected oil production
would cover the cash-flow requirements of the project, but eventually gas
production would be required to assure a profit, Mitsui said. The fields,
Piltun Astoskoye and Lunskoye, off the east coast of Sakhalin, have reserves
estimated at 730m barrels of oil and 400bn cubic feet of gas.
The possibility of building a gas liquefaction plant at the site is under
consideration. Liquefaction plants, however, are difficult to finance and
would require advance sales.
The Sakhalin project could be the first of a wave of resource development
projects in Siberia with extensive Japanese participation. Japan has long
looked at Siberian resources as a possible avenue to diversify dependence on
other sources of raw materials, particularly Middle Eastern oil.
However, future Japanese support for such projects is likely to depend on
progress in resolving the territorial dispute with the newly independent
Russian government.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Palestinians kick their heels in Moscow's cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOSCOW in winter is not the most inviting place, as Palestinian delegates to
a multinational forum on Middle East issues discovered this week.
Excluded from formal deliberations because of a row over the identity of
their nominees, the Palestinians were faced with the galling spectacle of
Israel sitting down for its first-ever meetings with several Arab states,
plus China, in the capital of what was until recently their most powerful
supporter.
After the euphoria of the Madrid opening of the peace process last October,
when it seemed that relatively quick progress might be possible, the Moscow
forum has reminded everyone of just how tough and complex the negotiations
will be.
With the Palestine Liberation Organisation seeking to reassert itself after
its setback in the Gulf war by resisting both international and, more
particularly, Arab pressure to send acceptable nominees to Moscow, the old
issue of who should represent the Palestinians again overshadowed efforts to
achieve peace.
But while the Palestinians were shut out of the formal sessions on such
issues as disarmament, economic development and the environment, all was not
lost for them. They were even claiming something of a moral victory after Mr
James Baker, the US secretary of state, had indicated that the co-sponsors
might agree to broader Palestinian representation in later negotiations.
The Palestinians were allowed to participate in last October's opening,
after bowing to Israeli demands that only representatives from the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip be included in their delegation.
In Moscow this week, the PLO, in a blatant challenge to the ground rules
agreed in Madrid, decided to make a stand by insisting on the inclusion of
diaspora Palestinians in the certain knowledge that Israel and the
co-sponsors would object.
The PLO, which has become increasingly alarmed at its formal exclusion from
the peace process, almost certainly calculated that whatever damage its
action rendered to the multilateral round in Moscow, it would not be
sufficient to derail the process itself, whose core is the bilateral
negotiations on land and sovereignty between Israel and delegations
representing Syria and Lebanon, plus a Jordanian-Palestinian team.
The Palestinians were at pains yesterday to distinguish between the Moscow
multilateral round, attended by 26 delegations including 10 from Arab
states, which they said were 'organisational', whereas the face-to-face
negotiations were 'substantive'.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, did not sound the least
defensive when she said: 'The time has come to be firm and to deal
effectively with Israel.'
This more challenging stance is likely to be especially welcomed in the
occupied territories, where anxiety over continued Jewish settlement
building is becoming more acute.
The Palestinians are also likely to have calculated that Israel's ability to
make propaganda at their expense will be lessened by its own difficulties
with the US, which is threatening to withhold Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) in
loan guarantees, unless the Israelis stop building settlements. This was a
subject discussed in a private meeting in Moscow yesterday between Mr Baker
and his Israeli counterpart, Mr David Levy.
But while the Palestinians may have been able to cut their losses in Moscow,
the event and its location carried with it some painful reminders of their
weakness and isolation.
Not only were the talks taking place in what had been the capital of one of
the first and most consistent supporters of Mr Yassir Arafat's PLO, but, to
add insult to injury, the Chinese, another of the PLO's traditional backers,
were also present after establishing relations with Israel last week.
The gesture of China's deputy foreign minister, Yang Fuchang, who warmly
embraced Mr Levy at the beginning of proceedings on Tuesday, could not have
expressed more eloquently changes in international relationships since the
collapse of the old world order.
The presence of the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, in the
same room as the Israelis, must have been especially irritating for the
Palestinians. Of all Arab states, the Saudis have been the PLO's most
generous financial backer, but Mr Arafat's support for Iraq in the Gulf
crisis led to a cut off in Saudi assistance and to a continued chill in
relations.
Other Arabs present included Egypt, the only Arab state to have established
relations with Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Tunisia, Mauritania, Qatar, Oman,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Algeria and Yemen had planned to
attend, but stayed away when the Palestinians were excluded.
Syria and Lebanon, who have begun bilateral talks with Israel on land and
sovereignty, boycotted the Moscow forum because of lack of progress in their
direct negotiations with Israel.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Australian inflation rate at 1.5%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S annualised rate of inflation fell to 1.5 per cent in the last
quarter of last year, the lowest in almost 30 years.
The underlying rate, which excludes volatile and seasonal factors, also
dropped to 3.4 per cent in the December quarter from 3.7 per cent in the
previous quarter.
In quick reaction to the official figures, Mr Paul Keating, the prime
minister, foreshadowed extra government spending within the current fiscal
year. The additional spending is expected to be announced in an economic
statement next month.
Citing a survey by the National Australia Bank showing Australian companies
to be operating at only 76 per cent capacity, Mr Keating said there was
scope for fiscal expansion.
'Given the level of capacity and the state of the economy, there is minimal
risk on inflation and demand if we stimulate the economy,' he said.
Mr Keating has been under severe pressure from business and trade unions for
some pump priming. During meetings last week with private business, he was
urged by the big banks to spend between ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 620m) and
ADollars 2bn on new government projects. The meetings were designed to get
private business inputs to the February economic statement.
A spending increase would result in a further revision of the 1991-92 budget
deficit. Earlier this month, Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, announced an
increase the budget deficit from ADollars 4.7bn to ADollars 5bn.
Yesterday's announcement said the low inflation figure was due mainly to
decline in housing costs brought on by mortgage interest rates that have
fallen by 12.6 percentage points since the December quarter, 1990. Petrol
prices also dropped by 16 per cent from the high levels during the Gulf
crisis 12 months ago.

COCA-COLA yesterday announced a IPounds 27m expansion plan for its drinks
concentrate manufacturing plant at Drogheda in Ireland, which is operated by
a subsidiary, Coca-Cola Atlantic.
Construction work is to begin immediately, and the plant is expected to be

The Drogheda facility is already Coca-Cola's largest concentrate
manufacturing plant in Europe, and supplies bottling plants in 70 different
countries.
Mr Ray McReave, the general manager of Coca-Cola Atlantic, said: 'Much of
the Coca-Cola company's success in expanding to meet the needs of growing
markets in Europe is as a result of the high standards achieved in the
Drogheda operation'.
A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Atlantic said the expansion was a 'significant
one', but would not give details of expected increase in turnover 'for
competitive reasons'. She said, however, that Coca-Cola's market has been
expanding at 9 per cent a year over the past five years, and the company's
main market opportunities 'are in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and parts
of Asia'.

The Japanese mission, led by Mr Rohuro Ishikawa, chairman of the Japan-India
business co-operation committee, wants all restrictions on investment
removed. It has pointed out that other countries have removed such
restrictions and if India wants foreign investment, it must be competitive
and offer matching conditions.
The group of 50 Japanese industrialists also wants links between profit
repatriation and export earnings removed, easier imports of capital goods
and a revision of the foreign exchange rules.

<TEXT>
POLITICAL confusion in Moscow, compounded by wrangling between the European
Commission and bankers in both east and west, has seriously delayed use of
the EC's Ecu 1.75bn (Pounds 1.24bn) food credits for ex-Soviet republics.
The longest delay concerns the Ecu500m credit guarantee. It was agreed by EC
leaders in December 1990, formally signed last November, but has since run
into problems. Counting on this credit, a few Western exporters and Russian
importers started shipments last month, and many more have contracts ready
for delivery before end-February.
'There is no doubt in my mind that some (European) traders are in difficulty
and are losing money,' said an EC official yesterday. Meanwhile, the
Russians are wondering where their EC food is, just when the EC has been
vaunting its predominant share in worldwide aid to the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS). By contrast, US food credit to the CIS seems to be
moving smoothly.
There is less controversy over the direct EC food loan of Ecu1.25bn to which
EC ministers gave the go-ahead last month, though this, too, has hit
problems. The EC has decided to disburse this to individual CIS states, with
a first Ecu500m slice going to Russia. But it refuses to pay over this
tranche until Russia produces a financially satisfactory agent for the loan
and agrees to waive its sovereign immunity and submit to any dispute to
outside arbitration.
More troubled has been the history of the Ecu500 commercial bank credit
which the EC promised to guarantee more than a year ago. 'We lost seven or
eight months last year,' an EC official said, due to a variety of factors.
Strong-arm Soviet tactics in the Baltic region last spring caused the
European Parliament to delay approving the credit guarantee. Last summer,
some banks defected from the Deutsche Bank-led credit syndicate. It was only
two months ago that the complex web of EC-Deutsche Bank-Vneshekonombank
agreements were finally signed.
But Vneshekonombank, the foreign trade bank of the old Union, failed to ask
to draw down the loan until after Christmas, by which time the Soviet Union
had folded. And, when at the turn of the year, Vneshekonombank paid all the
fees and asked for the money, the Deutsche Bank consortium had fresh doubts
about the former's status.
The Brussels Commission has since strongly urged speed on Deutsche Bank. EC
officials believe that with Brussels guaranteeing 98 per cent of a loan,
which includes a large, fixed rate interest amount, the commercial banks
have little cause for fear. Only Ecu370m of the Ecu500m will be available
for actual CIS food purchases; the other Ecu130m is to cover interest and
freight charges.
But a Deutsche Bank official said yesterday that, according to decrees this
month of the Russian Supreme Soviet, Vneshekonombank was no longer legally
able to take on new loans, but was merely an agent for servicing old debts.
Representatives of several ex-Soviet republics were meeting in Moscow
yesterday to plan future borrowing.

   TOKYO, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, has changed his stance and
said Japan had promised after all to increase purchases of US car parts,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Americans and the US Congress reacted with fury after Mr Miyazawa said last
week that a Dollars 19bn (Pounds 10.4bn) figure for US car part purchases by
Japanese car makers was a target and not a firm promise.
But yesterday in parliament Mr Miyazawa said: 'The government will endeavour
to sincerely fulfil its promise to the United States.' He was replying to a
question on whether the Dollars 19bn figure was a target or a promise.
'We had each of the (Japanese) car makers come up with quite firm
calculations (regarding the volume of car parts they will import) by 1994-95
. . . so I believe that each firm will sincerely buckle down to realise (the
plan),' he said.
The pledge to raise US car part imports from the current Dollars 9bn level
was included in a US-Japan statement unveiled at the end of President George
Bush's visit to Tokyo.
US politicians, eager to denounce Mr Bush's trip as a failure, seized on Mr
Miyazawa's remark on January 21 as evidence that Japan was backing off from
alleged pledges.
Mr Jacques Calvet, the chairman of French carmaker Peugeot, said the
European Community should refuse to ease barriers to Japanese car imports
until Tokyo takes steps to lift its citizens' living standards, Reuter
reports from Paris.
'We should not indefinitely put up with Japan's economic power if it has not
shared (its wealth) with those who created it,' he told a parliamentary
commission. Mr Calvet is a steadfast critic of a Japan-EC car accord reached
last year that will remove existing EC obstacles to Japanese car imports in
the year 2000.

FT  30 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Franchise pact signed for Texan railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.3bn) high-speed rail network in Texas has come a
step closer after the signing of a 50-year franchise agreement authorising
the construction and operation of the proposed 622-mile network.
The network would be the first high-speed rail system in the US, and would
link Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin with trains running
at more than 200mph. Earlier this week the Texas High-Speed Rail Authority
authorised a corporation recently established by the Texas TGV Consortium to
plan, finance, construct, lease, operate and maintain the system.
It is still not certain, however, that the privately-financed project will
go ahead. Contracts are not expected to be awarded until 1994, and the first
phase of the the system would not be open until 1998.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Engineering employers take hard line on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN engineering employers went on the offensive yesterday with a claim
that workers should be prepared to accept a reduction in real incomes this
year.
Pay awards had to be related to productivity, expected to increase by 2.5
per cent, and not inflation, forecast to average 4.5 per cent, according to
Mr Dieter Hundt, president of the Baden-Wurttemberg metal industries
employers' association (VMI).
Speaking in Stuttgart, he called for a change of course in pay policy, and
said the 9.5 per cent claim from the IG Metall union greatly worsened the
prospects for a peaceful solution to this year's negotiations.
The VMI, which employs 700,000, is traditionally the first engineering
employers' group to start pay talks. This year's round begins on March 17.
IG Metall represents around 4m workers in manufacturing industry, which has
seen domestic orders tail off and low overseas demand.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Novel German plan to finance roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government is to try hire purchase as a way of paying the
estimated DM100bn (Pounds 34.8bn) bill for transport links in former East
Germany.
In a renewed discussion on the private financing of public works, the
cabinet yesterday rejected toll-roads as 'counter-productive', and decided
that leasing of railways and roads from private consortiums was
'unsuitable'.
It chose instead to test what it called a 'concessionary' model, in which
private groups will finance and build projects on the government's behalf.
Bonn will then buy them back, paying in instalments.
The idea, which will spread the costs over an as-yet-unspecified period, is
to be tested on two projects in the west of the country - a DM3bn stretch of
railway between Munich and Nuremberg, and a road tunnel on the A81 autobahn
near Stuttgart.
Mr Gunther Krause, transport minister, was yesterday commissioned to draw up
draft contracts in preparation for a call for tenders.
The timing of these is uncertain. A government spokesman said only that the
cabinet would return to the subject this summer. However, the need is
urgent. The lack of western-standard communications is seen as one of the
main obstacles to economic recovery in former East Germany.
Government resources, meanwhile, are stretched to the limit by other
unification costs. Bonn is also committed to containing public borrowing,
which is currently growing faster than gross national product.
Official estimates say that DM100bn will be needed between 1995 and 2000 for
urgent transport infrastructure. Unofficial figures suggest the cost of
bringing transport systems up to western standards could be DM200bn.
Mr Krause, who had been eager to try gathering revenue at toll booths was
told they would be counter-productive. Construction would be too costly and
would interfere with traffic flow, and the tolls would also be unpopular
with the public which believes it is already being asked to pay too much to
support development in the east.

FT  30 JAN 92 / Rebel Serbs endanger UN peacekeeping plan: The decision
facing the Security Council tomorrow
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION by the United Nations Security Council to send UN peace-keeping
troops to Croatia hangs in the balance because rebel Serb leaders oppose
deployment of troops.
Western diplomats in Belgrade said yesterday the security council, which is
expected to meet tomorrow, will be given a less than optimistic report by Mr
Cyrus Vance, the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia.
Although the 15th ceasefire, brokered by the UN early this month, has
generally held in Croatia, several elements still stand in the way towards
the deployment of 10,000 UN troops. One is Mr Milan Babic, leader of the
self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina, southern Croatia.
Mr Babic, catapulted into power by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of
Serbia, does not want the Yugoslav federal army to be withdrawn from
Krajina, and replaced by UN troops. Nor does he want local Serb paramilitary
units to be disarmed, despite Mr Milosevic's support for the peace plan.
Under the Vance plan, the federal army - which, along with Serb militants
controls a third of Croatia - will withdraw from all Croatian territory; and
all paramilitary forces, including Serbian units, will be disarmed. The
regular Croatian army will be required to return to barracks.
Mr Lazar Macura, Krajina's minister of information, recently said the Serbs
would not give up their weapons. To complicate matters, local Serbs from
Krajina make up 80 per cent of the army in that region, which means that
practically no withdrawal by the federal army to areas outside Croatia would
take place.
Mr Babic opposes withdrawal of the federal army from areas in Croatia where
the Serbs are in a majority before the status of the Serb communities in
Croatia has been defined. These regions include Krajina, and the Baranja and
western Srem which are in eastern Slavonia, in the east of the republic.
Mr Babic wants the Serbs in Croatia to be able to opt out of an independent
Croatia.
In addition, Mr Goran Hadzik, head of the Serbs in eastern Slavonia, and Mr
Babic, are seeking guarantees against Croat reprisals when UN troops leave
the republic.
The UN troops are expected to stay six months, and the regions to which they
will be deployed will have the status of protectorates.
Western diplomats fear that if no political solution on Croatia's borders
and the status of the Serbs in Croatia is reached within that period, civil
war will return.
Croat officials said the deployment of UN troops would give them time to
re-establish law and order and try to regain control over the entire
territory. Any deployment might allow presidential and local elections to
take place.
Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, wants presidential elections as
soon as possible to capitalise on his success in attaining international
recognition.
The other, and less predictable element which could destabilise the Vance
plan is the federal army. So far, the army, under General Blagoje Adzic, a
Serb nationalist, has endorsed the peace plan. But it remains unclear what
role will be played by General Ratko Mladic, head of the federal army in
Krajina, or General Vladimir Vukovic, commander of the Banja Luka garrison
in northern Bosnia-Hercegovina, in persuading Mr Babic to accept the plan.
'The army continues to play a crucial role,' said Mr Haric Silajcic, the
foreign minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'Its relationship with both Mr
Milosevic and Mr Babic must not be underestimated. The situation remains
highly unstable.'

FT  30 JAN 92 / Berlin warned about city's mounting debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLIN, financially strapped by unification, faces a cumulative debt of up
to DM45bn (Pounds 15.6bn) by 1995, Mr Elmar Pieroth, the city's finance
chief, has warned in a delayed five year budget plan. The city's cumulative
debt was only DM18bn in 1990.
Berlin's federal subsidies, covering nearly half the city's budget in past
years, are being reduced sharply as are special investment incentives and
the German Unity Fund. At the same time Berlin is spending heavily on
infrastructure projects in the east of the city.
Mr Pieroth said the city's 'new identity' - Berlin is to become the
functioning capital of Germany by the end of the decade - has meant a fight
for additional funds from Bonn.
The city's budget deficits are expected to rise from DM6.3bn next year to
DM9.2bn in 1994 and DM12.6bn in 1995, although new indebtedness is to be
reduced from DM5.8bn in 1992 to DM2bn in 1995. Subsidies from Bonn, which
will total DM13.2bn this year compared with DM14.5bn in 1991, are to be
slashed to DM6.7bn in 1995, on present plans. The city had planned to cut
10,000 municipal jobs this year from the bloated number inherited from east
and west Berlin.
Berlin's Chamber of Industry and Commerce expressed doubts that as many jobs
as this would be saved, noting that Berlin's level of public-sector
employment was far higher than the other city-states of Hamburg and Bremen.
City tax revenues are forecast to rise from DM11bn this year to DM17bn in
1995. This means Berlin would finance 39 per cent of its spending from taxes
compared with 27 per cent at present. West German cities finance more than
60 per cent of spending from taxes. Many companies in the city, however,
plan to move to surrounding Brandenburg state.

FT  30 JAN 92 / EC agrees legal safeguards for electronic databases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DRAFT legislation to provide EC-wide legal protection against the
international piracy of electronic databases was approved yesterday by the
European Commission.
The 'ground-breaking' draft directive - modelled on existing Scandinavian
legislation - adds to the growing body of agreed or draft EC legislation on
intellectual property, including last year's directive aimed at fighting
piracy of computer software.
Within the next fortnight the Commission is also likely to propose
harmonising copyright protection for original work. According to officials,
Brussels is considering fixing the duration of protection at 70 years, a
compromise between the widely different regimes in the 12 member states.
The directive approved yesterday would introduce a new type of intellectual
property right, protecting producers of databases - computerised lists of
addresses, for example - from unfair copying of the contents of their
databases for 10 years. The measure leaves aside the question of personal
data protection, which is the subject of a controversial draft directive now
being discussed by the European Parliament.
Database producers, which include large publishers and direct marketing
organisations, believe the directive may also help liberalise the Ecu2.5bn
(Pounds 1.75bn) European market. It would allow competitors wishing to
re-use such information commercially to obtain compulsory licences 'on fair
and non-discriminatory terms'.
Mr Tony Coad, managing director of the British group NDL International,
which holds databases for UK manufacturers and retailers, said yesterday: 'I
can see this could be a genuine attempt to break down data monopolies, which
can be very powerful.'
The World Intellectual Property Organisation is already considering amending
the Berne Convention on intellectual property to cover databases, which are
not considered original enough to qualify for normal copyright protection.
But EC officials said they were unsure how long such moves would take, and
in any case they needed to introduce harmonised measures before the
introduction of the single European market at the end of this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE said yesterday it will pay its foreign debt independently and
appealed to the international financial community to help make the
appropriate arrangements.
The statement is likely to increase western unease about the division of the
former Soviet debt. Last week, German officials threatened that republics
which refused to accept 'joint and several' responsibility for the debt
should be excluded from international financial organisations such as the
IMF.
But yesterday the prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin, insisted that Ukraine
would pay its 16.37 per cent share of the Soviet debt independently.
He accused Russia of violating inter-republican agreements on the division
of Soviet foreign debt. Mr Fokin also insisted that the Ukrainian National
Bank and the Export-Import Bank of Ukraine, which was established to replace
Vnesheconombank in Ukraine this month, be allowed to participate directly in
international financial institutions and serve as Ukraine's sole
international financial representatives.
Mr Fokin appealed to the west for assistance in securing 16.37 per cent of
the assets of the former Soviet Union, both at home and abroad. He made
particular reference to foreign property, such as embassies, which he said
the west should not recognise as belonging to Russia.
The announcement signalled a further deterioration of Ukrainian-Russian
relations on the economic front. Mr Fokin accused Russia of illegally taking
control of Vnesheconombank, gold reserves and other assets of the former
Soviet Union.
Mr Jacques Attali, head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, met yesterday with Mr Fokin, the chairman of the Ukrainian
National Bank and other Ukrainian leaders and expressed confidence in their
economic reform programme and supported their efforts to join international
financial organisations, such as the IMF.
To insulate itself from feared Russian economic retaliation, Ukraine
yesterday signed a contract with Iran and Azerbaijan to purchase oil.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will travel to Prague at the end of next month to
sign a controversial co-operation treaty with Czechoslovakia, in spite of
strong conservative opposition in Germany.
The treaty was approved by the German cabinet yesterday, along with a
similar treaty with Hungary - but only after the chancellor had given the
assurance that he would raise the question of property rights for former
Sudeten Germans on his trip to Prague.
Properties once owned by Germans in the former Sudetenland are currently
being sold off, according to reports in Germany, and the former owners are
demanding a right to participate.
The issue has caused an embarrassing delay in ratifying the friendship
treaty.
Mr Kohl has already agreed to support a joint resolution in the Bundestag
backing the property claims of the Sudeten Germans, but has refused to agree
to any changes in the treaty itself.

RUSSIA has agreed to increase natural gas deliveries to Poland from Monday
following a sharp drop in supplies which caused heavy industry to cut output
severely.
After meetings in Moscow with Polish officials, the Russians confirmed that
5m tonnes of oil would be delivered this year. Gas deliveries would reach
6.6bn cubic metres, but the Poles want to match last year's deliveries of
7.1bn cu m.
The break in supplies occurred after a decree by President Boris Yeltsin
invalidated a Dollars 2.8bn barter agreement signed on December 24 between
the two nations.

<TEXT>
GERMAN AID for the film industry discriminates against foreign film-makers,
according to the European Commission, which has given the German government
a month to answer its complaints against the subsidy programme.
Directors of films which receive government grants have to be German or
'from a German cultural background'. The same conditions apply to some of
the jobs on co-productions between German and foreign film-makers.
The Commission approved the German aid scheme six years ago, but warned the
government it would have to remove the nationality restrictions by the end
of 1992.
But Bonn has just proposed extending the programme (including the
restrictions) for a further six years.
Brussels has asked Bonn to lower the level of aid available on applied
research contracts granted to companies in the five new La'nder (states) in
what was east Germany.
It says the maximum subsidy level of 50 per cent for each contract is too
high. European Commission guidelines recommend a 25 per cent aid ceiling for
applied research.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for cuts in corporate taxation and reductions in state subsidies
will be presented by the German government in the coming year, Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, the economics minister, said yesterday.
Action was needed to preserve the competitiveness of the German economy and
stabilise state spending, while also supporting the former east German
economy, he said, in a cautious forecast in the government's annual economic
report.
He called for tax cuts to bring down the marginal rates of income tax and
corporation tax from 53 to 46 per cent, and promised a corporation tax
reform package in the course of the year.
He also promised a package of subsidy cuts, prepared by the economics and
finance ministries, in time for the start of the annual budget negotiations
in June.
He warned that a failure to keep wage awards below the levels of 1991 could
actually result in higher, rather than lower interest rates.
His warning coincided with a gloomy prognosis by Mr Lothar Muller, head of
the Bavarian state central bank and a member of the board of the Bundesbank,
that the German economy would not allow interest rates to be cut by the
central bank at least until the end of the summer.
The government's annual economic report forecasts an overall German growth
rate of just 2 per cent for 1992, with the former West Germany growing by
only 1.5 per cent, and the east by 10 per cent - after its economic collapse
of the past two years.
It suggests that unemployment will rise by 100,000 to 1.8m in the west, a
rate of 6 per cent, compared with a 500,000 rise, to around 1.4m, in the
east, or around 17 per cent.
It is more optimistic on inflation than independent economic forecasts have
been, suggesting 3.5 per cent for the year as a whole in the west, and 12 to
14 per cent in the east. Wage rises it hopes will keep to an average rise of
just 5 per cent in the west, compared with 6.7 per cent in 1991, and trade
union demands of around 10 per cent. In the east, wages are expected to rise
between 30 and 35 per cent.

<TEXT>
GALLUP, the international polling organisation best known for trying to
predict the outcome of elections, is turning its attention to television
viewing habits in Russia and other former Soviet republics.
The company announced yesterday in London and Moscow that it was setting up
modern ratings research for a market of more than 300m viewers. The Russian
Media Monitor will be based on a panel of 6,000 viewers who will keep a
diary of the programmes they watch.
The main purpose of the monitor is to see how western-sponsored programmes
and advertising are received in the Russian television market. One of the
first programmes to be assessed in Russia will be the BBC documentary series
'The Second Russian Revolution' sponsored by Upjohn, the pharmaceutical
company.
The launch coincides with several programme sponsorship campaigns aimed at
Russia, including the world music series 'Mega Mix', sponsored by Mars
International, and a series of rock music concerts sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.
Mr Gordon Heald, managing director of Gallup (UK) said yesterday: 'It's a
breakthrough in this territory, following years of unstructured market
analysis'. The monitor is a joint venture between Gallup, BBDO, the
international advertising agency, and Invizible Arts, a sponsorship agency.

FT  30 JAN 92 / CSCE to gain up to ten new members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is expected to expand
its membership significantly following the break-up of the Soviet Union.
However, the admission of Croatia and Slovenia has been blocked by the
Yugoslav federal government under the CSCE's unanimity rule. Their entry
should have been a formality following their recognition by the European
Community. For the moment, the two states will be given observer status,
with the possibility of becoming full members later.
The foreign ministers of the security forum - which groups 36 European
states and the US and Canada - are meeting in Prague today and tomorrow.
They are due to approve the entry of up to 10 members from the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS).
Russia has already taken over the Soviet Union's seat and the three Baltic
states have been admitted. In addition to Ukraine and Belarus, the new
members are expected to include several former Soviet republics in central
Asia. Kazakhstan, where substantial numbers of nuclear weapons formerly
controlled by the central government in Moscow are stationed, had not
applied for membership at the beginning of the week, but was expected to do
so before the Prague meeting started.
Officials from the other member states were particularly keen to bring
Kazakhstan under the CSCE umbrella, even though it has said it wants to
become a non-nuclear state. Within the organisation, it would be subject to
all the CSCE's arms control and conflict prevention commitments.
Some member states, however, have reservations about letting in some former
Soviet republics because they do not yet meet the CSCE's human rights and
military confidence-building criteria. Georgia, in the grip of a civil
conflict and not in the CIS, and Armenia and Azerbaijan, which are fighting
over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, fall into this category.
The expansion of the organisation to 48 members has underlined the
constraints placed on it by the consensus principle which governs all its
decision-making.
With the CSCE's impotence in the Yugoslav civil war in mind, the ministers
are expected to discuss how the unanimity rule could be amended to give the
organisation a more constructive role in preventing conflicts and ensuring
the security needs of its members.
They will also discuss ways of strengthening the Vienna-based Conflict
Prevention Centre, set up at the end of 1990, but which has not yet managed
to play a significant role.
It is symptomatic of the CSCE's disappointing record so far that the new
eastern European democracies such as Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have
shown more interest in forging closer ties with their former western
adversaries within the new Nato Co-operation Council than in the further
development of the CSCE. Though Nato has not offered them full membership,
let alone mutual security guarantees, it appears to be seen as a more
effective guarantor of European peace than the CSCE.

HUNDREDS of trade unionists demonstrated outside Hong Kong's legislature
yesterday, demanding that the government drop plans to import workers to
ease the British colony's labour shortage, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Chan Yuen-Han, a member of the Federation of Trade Unions' standing
committee, said many of the 500,000 workers represented by the demonstrators
would strike if the government did not give in. He said unions would set up
a strike fund and organise another rally after the Chinese New Year.
The government, under pressure from employers to ease the labour shortage
they say is feeding the colony's double-digit inflation, last month raised
the ceiling on workers to 25,000. Many of the existing 13,000 come from
across the Chinese border.
About 600 unionists waved banners, shouted slogans and cheered speeches by
unionists outside the Legislative Council (Legco) building. Legislators
inside were due to debate a motion calling for a review of the two-year-old
policy.
Unions oppose the scheme saying it would lower wages and put many people out
of work.

NORTH KOREA yesterday rejected a South Korean proposal for early inspections
of suspected nuclear facilities in both Koreas, South Korean officials said,
AP reports from Seoul.
But North Korea said the issue could be discussed after a meeting of the
South and North Korean prime ministers scheduled for February 18-21.
The Communist government's move amplified worries in the south that the
north was trying to gain time to develop nuclear arms.
A South Korean newspaper yesterday quoted an unidentified government
official as saying intelligence reports indicate North Korea may be able to
start reprocessing nuclear fuel as early as May. Once reprocessing begins,
there is a danger North Korea could hide its nuclear weapons programme, the
paper said.
'Concerns are being raised because the north expressed its intention to
refuse pilot inspections,' Mr Lee Dong-bok, a South Korean negotiator, said
after meeting North Korean officials.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA said yesterday it was establishing full diplomatic relations with
Israel for the first time, completing the Jewish state's links with Asia's
two most populous nations, after a similar decision by China last Friday.
The development has evoked satisfaction in Israel. Premier Yitzhak Shamir
noted this week that a long period of diplomatic isolation for Israel was
ending. In the past few months, most Arab countries have engaged Israel in
peace talks. The former Soviet Union, as well as China and India, all
backers of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, have set up diplomatic
ties, despite Mr Shamir's unyielding policies towards the Palestinians.
India, which built a close relationship with the PLO based partly on its
leading role in the non-aligned movement, apparently saw little point in
continuing to shun Israel. India may also have its eye on improving ties
with the US, Israel's main ally.
Meanwhile, working groups to discuss Mid-East disarmament, economic
development, water and the environment are expected to convene this spring
in Europe, the Middle East, Japan and the US. Agreement on more detailed
talks about regional issues involving Israel, its neighbours and other
nations was reached at the multinational forum, which concluded in Moscow
yesterday.
The Palestinians, excluded from the forum, want the issues of Jerusalem and
human rights addressed in working committees set up under the multilateral
umbrella.
Mr Shamir agreed in principle with the opposition Labour party yesterday to
hold a general election on June 23, Reuter reports. A Labour party spokesman
said the agreement would have to be approved by Labour leaders tomorrow.

<TEXT>
INDIA has strongly protested to neighbouring Burma over the influx of 950
refugees, urging Rangoon to take them back immediately, a foreign ministry
spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from New Delhi
The influx of refugees into India's north-eastern Nagaland state follows a
crackdown by Burmese troops on militants of the National Socalist Council of
Nagaland (NSCN).
The NSCN, which has bases in Burma's border areas, opposes New Delhi's rule
in Nagaland state.
The Burmese crackdown on NSCN bases appears to be part of a broad offensive
against a number of rebel groups, including Karen rebels along its border
with Thailand, Moslem guerrillas on the Bangladesh border, and Kachin
insurgents in north-western Burma.
Indian military intelligence sources said some 150 people had been killed
over the past month in heavy fighting between Burmese troops and Naga
separatists in north-western Burma.
Thai officals said yesterday that Burmese troops were advancing on the
headquarters of Karen guerrillias near the Thai border. Recent fighting had
killed 220 combatants on both sides and sent 3,000 refugees fleeing into
Thailand, they said.

Nickel retreated further on the LME yesterday as the market continued to
stage a downward correction to recent strong gains. Dealers said the absence
of recent influential buying contributed to the downtrend, while negative
fundamental factors also weighed on sentiment. LME stocks rose 876 tonnes to
17,400 tonnes, the highest level since September 1984, reflecting arrivals
of Russian metal, and more shipments are said to be en-route. There are also
increasing prospects of a German steel-workers strike, which will reduce
offtake by stainless-steel mills. London robusta coffee prices closed lower,
while New York arabicas were down at midday after setting lifetime lows. 'We
are in a steady downtrend right now and the market is awaiting the outcome
of the ICO meeting next week,' he said. Meanwhile Brazil's National Economy
Secretary Dorothea Werneck said the country would not be taking any firm
proposals to next week's ICO working group meeting in London. New York
cotton prices were lower at midday after scoring lifetime lows for the
second straight session. Abundant world supplies, declining consumption and
bearish sentiment will continue to pressure prices, traders said.

FT  29 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index clears the 2,550 hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEGATIVE survey of busi-ness opinion from the Confederation of British
Industry proved no restraint for the UK stock market, which yesterday
bounded above the FT-SE 2,550 hurdle last seen in mid-November 1991. London
was helped at the close by a firm opening on Wall Street as it awaited the
State of the Union message from President Bush.
On the domestic front, the UK market continued to respond favourably to
political factors, with a firm pound at first encouraging hopes for a cut in
domestic interest rates ahead of the Budget and the UK general election
which is likely to follow soon after. Speculation over the re-election
prospects of Mr Major's government were enhanced by his announcement of
further plans for a Citizen's Charter.
Equities opened sharply higher, moving quickly above Footsie 2,550 in early
trading, but only to be trimmed back for a while when institutional demand
for shares proved relatively restrained. However, traders identified some
buying of UK equities by overseas and domestic funds.
By midsession, the stock market was less than four points above the Footsie
close of the previous night. But share prices resumed the upward path when
the Dow Industrial Average opened with a gain of 9 points in UK trading
hours.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,552.0 for a gain on the day of
12.1 points. The index last closed above 2,550 on November 14, but has been
struggling to regain this level in recent days.
Trading volume increased from Monday's relatively low levels. The Seaq
system yesterday recorded volume of 551.8m shares, compared with 448.1m the
previous day. On Monday, customer, or retail, business in London equities
totalled only Pounds 821.4m, against daily totals in the Pounds 1.1bn area
in many recent sessions.
In contrast with the general appearance of the market, the blue chip
internationals recorded a somewhat ragged performance yesterday. Financial
issues gave back a few pence of their recent gains and the pharmaceutical
sector turned in a more mixed pattern than in recent weeks.
One of the chief talking points was the annual meeting of Hanson, where
London traders were attentive to Lord Hanson's statement that the group had
no intention of bidding for ICI. While there was little likelihood of the
Hanson group trying to sell its 2.82 per cent shareholding in ICI yesterday,
or in the near future, there were enough disappointed speculators around to
depress the share price of the UK's premier chemical group.
Other features were few and far between, with traders unconvinced by a rerun
of some old bid stories in the insurance sector. Although the London money
markets discouraged hopes for an early cut in base rates, there were some
gains among the building shares, which have been so badly hurt by the
prolonged period of high interest rates in the UK. Some consumer-orientated
stocks also responded to interest rate optimism.
The initial firmness on Wall Street made little impression on oil shares,
which moved narrowly around their overnight levels as the London market
closed for the day. Nor was there much response from Cadbury Schweppes or
Reckitt &amp; Colman, both traditionally affected by transatlantic
considerations.

FT  29 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BURST of activity in the last few minutes of trading in stock index
futures brought a measure of excitement to an otherwise directionless
session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract opened strongly with traders reporting 2,580 as the
resistance point. A strong performance by short sterling and UK gilts,
coupled with an advance in US bonds and a firm Wall Street, encouraged
sporadic buying during the afternoon.
However, a big buy order from a leading securities house some 10 minutes
before the market's official close triggered a squeeze, sending March
forward to a large premium. Traders were also reported to have moved to
cover short positions ahead of the US president's State of the Union speech.
March closed at 2,594, a premium of 42, compared with its estimated fair
value premium to cash of 16.
In traded options, the FT-SE 100 Index's turnover of 8,468 contracts
accounted for a large part of the days's total of 28,724. Rolls-Royce, where
fears of a dividend cut had begun to fade, was the busiest stock option. It
had 5,547 contracts dealt, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and SG Warburg reported
to have carried out a majority of the day's business.

TRADING in ICI became frenetic at mid-morning as the stock market reacted to
the statement by Lord Hanson that his conglomerate had no intention of
bidding for the chemicals group.
The price of ICI shares moved so sharply that the quotation screen moved
into backwardation, the situation when one marketmaker quotes a higher bid
price than another's selling quote. Sellers were seen at 1245p but the
mid-price recovered later from a low of 1253p to end at 1267p, only 2 off on
the day.
Lord Hanson bought his 2.82 per cent stake in ICI last May, paying 1194 1/2
p a share for 20m shares. Assuming carrying costs of around Pounds 21m he
would have to sell the shares at around Pounds 13 apiece to show a profit.
The original stake purchase was carried out by securities house Smith New
Court, and as Smith's chemicals analyst Mr Charles Lambert pointed out: 'He
needs his dividend to break even at these levels.' The final dividend is
expected to be about 34p and is due towards the end of April.
Observers were surprised that Hanson lost 5 1/2 to 208p in spite of a
positive annual meeting. But the stock has had a good run recently and US
investors were taking profits.
BET worries
International business services group BET fell steeply after one securities
house turned seller and another was said to have sharply cut its forecasts.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was yesterday reminding clients that its prediction for
the year ending March 1993 was down to Pounds 140m and advising them to sell
the shares. Mr Mark Shepperd of UBS added: 'I no longer believe that the
dividend is absolutely safe.'
The shares were further affected by strong speculation that Cazenove, BET's
joint broker with BZW, had lowered its forecasts for the second time.
Cazenove never comments on its moves but it is believed to be forecasting
Pounds 110m for the year ending in March and Pounds 140m for the year to
March 1993.
The shares stood at 205p before a hefty forecast cut less than two weeks ago
by Robert Fleming Securities. That cut prompted most houses, including
Cazenove, to follow suit. The stock lost 17 yesterday to 159p with 16m
shares traded, the heaviest turnover for a year.
GRE rises sharply
Long-running rumours that a bid for Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite
insurance group, might be about to emerge from either the UK or Europe drove
GRE shares sharply higher.
They closed a net 7 firmer at 135p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 8.2m.
Dealers have noted strong support for GRE shares in recent weeks,
accompanied by heavier than usual activity in the stock.
The latest stories of an imminent takeover move against GRE suggested Sun
Alliance, GRE's fellow UK composite insurer, as the favourite to launch a
bid, with Axa Midi and the UAP/Sun Life grouping, both French-domiciled,
said to be other keen contenders.
GRE is scheduled to report preliminary figures on March 19 and the group is
one of the market's blue chip favourites for a cut in its dividend payment.
Analysts expect GRE to produce pre-tax losses of more than Pounds 200m for
1991, against a deficit of Pounds 157m in 1990, with many insurance
specialists forecasting a halved final dividend.
Sun Alliance, where 1991 losses are expected to reach Pounds 400m, has a
14.8 per cent stake in Commercial Union, another UK composite, whose shares
eased 2 to 463p. Sun shares dipped 3 to 296p.
Housebuilder and construction group Taylor Woodrow came under a sustained
bout of selling pressure from the outset as at least three leading brokers
chopped forecasts for the company to allow for expected provisions against
financial strains in the housing and Eurotunnel operations.
BZW lowered its forecast for the current year from Pounds 40m to Pounds 12m
and for 1992 from around Pounds 50m to Pounds 25m. Hoare Govett, Taylor
Woodrow's broker, shifted its current-year number from Pounds 20m down to
zero and for 1992 from Pounds 40m to Pounds 20m.
Charterhouse Tilney was reported as lowering its current forecast to zero
and maintaining its 1992 figure at Pounds 25m. However, Charterhouse was
said to have reduced its 1992 dividend expectation to 9.5p. Taylor Woodrow
shares dropped to 123p before closing a net 5 off at 128p, with turnover
reaching a heavy 6.5m.
BPB, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, settled 3 ahead at 147p,
after 150p, as the market reacted to suggestions that Knauf, the German
group seeking to expand its plasterboard operations in the UK and the rest
of Europe, has indicated it was about to increase its plasterboard prices by
up to 10 per cent.
Video distributor Pickwick surged ahead 67 to 240p after recommending
acceptance of a Pounds 67.8m bid from Carlton Communications, which added 11
at 569p with 2.2m traded.
Investment bank Kleinwort Benson strengthened its negative stance on Forte
and Ladbroke after new research indicated poor hotel occupancy rates,
particularly for London, in November and December. The outlook for January
is also weak. Forte slipped 2 1/2 to 230 1/2 p, while Ladbroke lost 3 to
216p.
Interest in selected property issues continued as buyers took account of
favourable interest rate comments and the sector's relative cheapness.
British Land added 11 at 272p, Great Portland rose 8 to 171p and MEPC gained
7 to 395p.
However, Chesterfield Property dropped 43 to 345p after one broker moved to
sell a line of stock and others followed suit on a stock which has been on a
number of brokers' sell lists.
Northern Foods gained 20 to 578p in response to a successful Pounds 227m
rights issue. The take-up of the company's offer was 91.4 per cent. The rump
of 3.3m shares was placed with institutions at 568p.
Food retailer J. Sainsbury was active, with 6.4m shares traded at 358p as
one half of a tax-related 'bed and breakfast' deal. The shares closed 5
higher at 369p.
WH Smith 'A' softened 2 to 459p ahead of today's interim figures.
Fisons rose 20 to 369p with 11m traded after stating that it would
recommence manufacture of its eye preparation Opticrom in the UK.
Lonrho rallied 6 to 1123 1/2 p on turnover of 12m shares, reflecting a
feeling that Friday's 30 per cent fall in the stock was overdone.
Industrial conglomerate Williams Holdings fell 11 to 312p after the UK
financial reporting review panel said Williams' 1990 accounts did not comply
with current company reporting rules.
Leather and hosiery group Hartstone jumped 20 on the announcement that its
Pounds 65m rights issue at 235p a share was 96.1 per cent taken up by
shareholders. The stock receded later to close 8 up at 277p. The rump of the
issue, just over 1.1m shares, was placed by BZW with around 20 institutions
at 284p a share.
Negative sentiment following a recent profits downgrade continued to affect
P &amp; O, which slipped 5 to 435p, after falling 7 on Monday. Eurotunnel,
recommended by Charterhouse Tilney, its own broker, as a switch out of P &amp;
O, which it downgraded, gained 12 to 469p.
Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 8.8m and the shares put on 8 to 144p as talk
of a dividend cut at the company continued to fade. Sentiment was also
helped by a recommendation of Rolls-Royce included in a review on the
aerospace sector by Charterhouse Tilney published yesterday.
T &amp; N hardened 4 to 106p after County NatWest moved the stock from a sell to
a buy in a review of the motor sector.
The broker said: 'Underperformance of 42 per cent during 1991 has resulted
in a rating that does not reflect the group's recovery potential.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow scores record peak ahead
of Bush speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH trading on US stock markets yesterday remained cautious ahead of
the State of the Union address by President Bush, heavy demand for blue
chips in the wake of good earnings reports helped the Dow Jones Industrial
Average establish a record high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was 31.53 stronger at 3,272.14, eclipsing its previous
all-time peak of 3,264.98 registered on January 17. Secondary indices,
however, were left out in the cold. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished a
slight 0.03 easier at 414.96, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks edged just 0.29 higher to 621.29. Turnover on the New York SE was
moderate at 217m shares.
As on Monday, the markets played a waiting game yesterday, with trading
overshadowed by the President's speech, which was scheduled for 8pm New York
time last night. No surprises were expected in the address, and while some
investors hoped for a range of measures to spur economic activity, others
were fearful that an over-stimulative package of tax cuts could revive
inflation and push up long-term interest rates.
The sharp rise in the Dow stemmed from big gains in a few stocks, which were
boosted by positive earnings reports. Walt Disney jumped Dollars 9 to
Dollars 141 1/2 on heavy buying as investors responded positively to
Monday's late announcement of a rise in fiscal first-quarter profits.
Procter &amp; Gamble also shone, appreciating Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 103 in
heavy trading after reporting fiscal second-quarter net income of Dollars
1.47 a share, higher than the Dollars 1.36 earned in the previous year's
second quarter. Merck firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 153 in the wake of
stronger fourth-quarter profits.
Compaq fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 32 3/4 in turnover of 3.4m shares after
the computer manufacturer reported fourth-quarter earnings of 77 cents a
share, almost half the Dollars 1.51 earned at the same stage of 1990.
Sentiment was also troubled by a warning from Compaq that it expected more
price competition this year. Other computer stocks were mixed on the Compaq
news, with Hewlett-Packard down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 60, Digital
Equipment up Dollars 1 at Dollars 52, Unisys Dollars  1/8 firmer at Dollars
7 3/4 and leader IBM off Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 93 1/4 .
Warner-Lambert shed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 on news of a Dollars
2.21 a share loss in the final quarter, incurred after two charges to cover
restructuring. The company surprised the market by increasing its dividend.
Bankers Trust ran into profit taking on the heels of Monday's
earnings-related gains. The stock retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/4
in spite of predictions from the company that 1992 trade revenues would
exceed last year's.
Lifetime forged ahead Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 37 1/4 on news that the home
healthcare group is considering to sell a substantial stake to investors.
Canada
TORONTO traded in a narrow range all session in moderate activity. The
composite index finished 5.2 off at 3,623.2, while declining issues held a
small edge over advances of 301 to 292. Volume was 28.1m shares.
International Verifact declined 13 cents to CDollars 1.26. The company said
it plans to offer up to 6m units at CDollars 1 apiece. Each unit comprises
one common share and one warrant, exercisable for two years, to purchase an
additional share at CDollars 1.30 in the first year and CDollars 1.80 in the
second year.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls on consumer poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar weakened sharply on the foreign exchange markets yesterday
following the release of a confidence survey which damped hopes of a
consumer-led recovery in the US economy, writes Simon London.
The consumer confidence index registered 50.4 this month, down from 52.5 in
December. The dollar fell sharply as a result from DM1.6050 immediately
before the announcement to a low of DM1.5925.
Overnight in the Far East the dollar was confined to a tight range. The US
currency closed in Tokyo at Y125.37, from Y125.25 in New York, and DM1.6095
from DM1.6105.
The yen was also weak against the D-Mark. The German currency regained
recent losses to push up to Y78.00 during the Tokyo day.
The Japanese unit was weak as economic data released yesterday confirmed
that the Japanese economy is slowing and increased expectations of an early
cut in interest rates.
Retail sales grew at a rate of just 1 per cent during December, from a 4.5
per cent rate of increas in November. Industrial production fell by 0.9 per
cent in December from November, and now stands down 1.4 per cent on December
1990.
In the light of the figures, analysts saw the Japanese currency weakening
through resistance levels at Y125.50 against the dollar before falling Y127,
the level at which central banks intervened earlier in the month.
In European trading the dollar was confined to its tight ranges until the
consumer confidence figures were released but the yen continued to weaken,
falling through resistance levels against both the dollar and D-Mark. The
Japanese currency fell to lows of Y125.95 against the dollar and Y78.66
against the D-Mark before stabilising.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5965 from DM1.6165 on Monday; Y125.60
from Y125.50; Dollars 1.7955 from Dollars 1.7765 against sterling.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark was soft again early
in the day but recovered ground through the afternoon session as its rallied
against the dollar.
The German currency was also supported by money supply figures which showed
M3 growing at a rate of 5.7 per cent in December from 5.1 per cent in
November. The Bundesbank's target range for M3 growth was 3 - 5 per cent,
suugesting that interest rates will be kept high to suppress money growth
and inflation. In the morning, the D-Mark fell below Pta63.00 against the
peseta, the strongest currency in the system, dropping to a low of Pta62.88
before recovering ground.
This raised sterling's floor within the system, determined by its maximum
permitted divergence against the Spanish currency. The UK currency rose in
line with the floor, peaking at DM2.8730 but falling back in the afternoon
in line with the dollar. By the close, sterling stood at DM2.8675, from
DM2.8725 on Monday.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates unmoved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK money market conditions were slightly easier yesterday, although rates
above one month remained unchanged, suggesting that few operators see room
for an early cut in base rates, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 900m early in
the session, revised down to Pounds 850m. The main factor was maturing
repurchase agreements, draining Pounds 670m from the market for the second
day in succession, as assistance injected earlier in the month is rolled
over.
In early assistance the Bank of England bought Pounds 465m paper for resale
to the market on February 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent, identical to the
Pounds 177m injected on the same terms on Monday. A further Pounds 37m was
added before the end of the morning session, through the outright purchase
of band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Afternoon assistance ampounted to Pounds 357m, again through the purchase of
band 1 at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance amounted to Pounds 25m, bringing
the total liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 884m.
The unsecured overnight money rate was steady at around 11 per cent during
the morning, falling to 8 per cent in the afternoon as market conditions
loosened. At the close the overnight rate was at 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent.
Longer rates were litle changed, suggesting that participants still see no
room for an early cut in interest rates.
Three month interbank funds traded at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent from 10 - 9/16
per cent on Monday; one month interbank money was 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent,
from 10 13/16 - 9/16 per cent.
However, operators in the futures market were more optimistic. The March
short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange traded up to 89.82, from 89.74 on Monday, implying base lending
rates of 10.18 per cent by the Spring.
In Frankfurt, call money rates were marginally higher for the second day
running, at 9.55/65 per cent from 9.50/60 per cent on Monday and the 9.40/50
per cent level which prevailed for most of last week.
Pension payments are draining funds from the market this week, although
yesterday the Bundesbank moved to relieve the liquidity squeeze by injecting
funds held on deposit for the public sector under Section 17 of the
Bundesbank Act.
In Tokyo call money was easier at 5 9/16 per cent from 5 23/32 per cent on
Monday.

FT  29 JAN 92 / International Equity Issues: Burlington Industries announces
IPO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US COMPANIES continue to dominate the international equity markets as those
groups which became heavily indebted as a result of leveraged buy-outs in
the 1980s are now turning to the equity markets again with initial public
offerings (IPOs).
The largest IPO to be announced recently is a Dollars 855m deal for
Burlington Industries. Morgan Stanley, which took the textile group private
five years ago, is now lead manager for the IPO.
Two other IPOs which have been filed are for the conglomerate Coltec, which
hopes to raise about Dollars 500m, and Foodmaker, the US fast food chain,
which is seeking Dollars 210m.
Further Percs - or preference equity redemption cumulative stock - issues
are expected from the US with Tandy and MaCaw expecting to raise about
Dollars 400m and Dollars 350m respectively.
Percs offer investors a high yield in return for limited capital gain.
Outside the US, attention is focusing on Istituto Bancario San Paolo di
Torino, the Italian banking group which is due to tap the markets for an
estimated Dollars 1.25bn to Dollars 1.5bn IPO soon, representing one of the
largest issues scheduled for the European markets so far this year.
About 40 per cent of the equity issue will be offered to international
investors, predominantly in Europe.
Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, is the lead manager with S. G.
Warburg and Hambros managing the offering in the UK, Indosuez managing the
offering in France, and Salomon Brothers the US portion.
San Paolo will be the second bank to take advantage of the new Amato Law,
under which public-sector banks can float up to 49 per cent of their
ordinary shares.
Banco di Napoli launched the first deal of its kind last year, raising
L400bn.

<TEXT>
GENBEL, the investment arm of South Africa's second largest mining house,
Gencor, overcame declining earnings in its mining and resource-based
investments to lift earnings and dividends by 11 per cent in the six months
to end-December, writes Philip Gawith.
Distributable income rose to R82.3m (Dollars 29.4m) from R74.5m, equivalent
to a rise in earnings per share from 17.1 cents to 19 cents. The dividend
was lifted to 15 cents from 13.5 cents. Gencor has announced its R2bn rights
offer, the largest in the country's history, has been priced at a 14.5 per
cent discount to the market price.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express, the US financial services group buffeted by credit card
loan losses, yesterday reported a 72 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
earnings, although income at its core cards business dropped by almost
two-thirds.
The group reported net income of Dollars 237m, or 47 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 6.6bn, compared with income of Dollars 138m, or 28 cents
a share, on Dollars 6.3bn of revenues in the same period of 1990, when it
was hit by particularly heavy losses at its Shearson Lehman investment
banking subsidiary.
The figures were broadly in line with Wall Street expectations.
For the full year, it reported net income of Dollars 789m, or Dollars 1.59 a
share, against Dollars 181m, or 34 cents, in 1990, when it took a Dollars
837m restructuring charge at Shearson.
Over the past year, Shearson's performance has improved, helped by booming
stock and bond markets, while Amex's core Travel Related Services (TRS)
business, which includes its cards and travellers cheques operation, has
been hit by the recession.
The company shocked Wall Street last autumn when it took a Dollars 265m
charge against earnings, including Dollars 155m to cover credit losses,
mainly at its Optima credit card.
TRS's fourth-quarter net income totalled Dollars 81m, down from Dollars 215m
a year ago. Charge volume on its credit cards totalled Dollars 30bn, a 1.3
per cent increase from last year.
For the full year, TRS produced net income of Dollars 396m, down from
Dollars 956m, due to a Dollars 432m post-tax increased provision for credit
losses, Dollars 110m of third-quarter restructuring charges, a Dollars 200m
increase in operating expenses and a Dollars 24m rise in marketing expenses.
Worldwide charge volume totalled Dollars 111bn, unchanged from a year ago,
while the number of establishments accepting the card rose 7.6 per cent to
over 3.5m. Cards in force rose slightly to 36.6m - a drop from past growth
rates which the company said was due to tightened credit procedures and
reduced solicitation.
Shearson reported record income of Dollars 130m in the fourth quarter,
compared with a Dollars 115m net loss a year ago, while the IDS financial
services unit saw profits rise 21 per cent to Dollars 68m.

<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the financially-stretched US defence and aerospace group,
yesterday underscored its improving health by reporting a sharp increase in
fourth-quarter earnings and a further reduction in its debt burden.
The St Louis-based company, which is being hit by the downturn in US defence
spending, reported net earnings of Dollars 211m, or Dollars 5.50 a share,
compared with break-even in the fourth quarter of last year, when the
company took a Dollars 219m after-tax provision for the cancelled A-12
aircraft programme.
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.5bn, against Dollars 1.12bn. For the full year,
the group earned Dollars 423m, or Dollars 11.03 a share, compared with
Dollars 306m, or Dollars 7.99 in 1990.
The company's debt - apart from its financial services unit - fell to
Dollars 2.39bn at the year-end, against Dollars 2.68bn three months before,
giving a debt-to-equity ratio of .68. The level of debt has dropped 28 per
cent since its peak last March, when analysts questioned if the company
might have to file for bankruptcy. The company still needs capital to
develop aircraft and Taiwan Aerospace is considering buying a 40 per cent
stake in its civil aircraft operations for Dollars 2bn.
Behind the improving balance sheet and profit figures is a much better
performance at its civil aircraft business, which began deliveries of its
new wide-bodied jet, the MD-11, just before the start of 1991. This segment
had operating earnings of Dollars 90m in the fourth quarter, against Dollars
38m a year before, despite a Dollars 30m loss on the C-17 transport aircraft
being developed for the US military. McDonnell's combat aircraft segment
earned Dollars 107m in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 96m a year
before, when the A-12 provision is stripped out. The missiles and space
business saw profits dip from Dollars 59m to Dollars 51m, while financial
services boosted profits from Dollars 6m to Dollars 11m, helped by asset
sales.
The group's overall fourth-quarter figures were flattered by settlement of a
tax dispute, which produced a Dollars 107m cut in previously accrued
interest expense.

ADVANCE Bank Australia has become one of the few Australian banks to report
earnings growth in the latest period. However, the Sydney-based bank had to
rely on an abnormal gain from share sales for its progress, writes Bruce
Jacques in Sydney.
Advance yesterday reported a 13 per cent rise to ADollars 20.6m (USDollars
15.4m) for the November half, from ADollars 18.2m. The result came on a 4
per cent increase in revenue, to ADollars 141.2m from ADollars 135.5m. The
interim dividend increased to 14 cents from 13 cents a share.
The result included a ADollars 3.4m pre-tax profit on share sales. In
contrast to most of its larger rivals, Advance reduced its bad and doubtful
debt provisions by 19 per cent to ADollars 14.3m in the half.
Net non-performing loans were virtually static at ADollars 139.7m, and tax
accounted for ADollars 12.4m against ADollars 10.8m. Depreciation charges
eased to ADollars 8.3m from ADollars 9.1m.
BOND Corporation, the troubled Australian conglomerate once run by Mr Alan
Bond, has confirmed the scheduled sale of its half-share in Australia's
first private university - Bond University - to EIE International, an
offshoot of the Japanese property conglomerate.

memory system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORAGE Technology, a computer disk drive manufacturer based in Louisville,
Colorado, yesterday announced a new computer memory which it believes will
revolutionise the data storage business.
Called Iceberg, the new memory has been widely promoted by Storage
Technology over the past three years as the answer to customers' data
storage problems in the 1990s.
The principal advance is a design which should ensure the system will never
fail completely. Iceberg applies techniques pioneered by 'fault tolerant'
computer manufacturers such as Tandem and Stratus; there is built-in
redundancy at points where the system could fail. There are, for example,
redundant disk drives, electronics, power supplies, cooling systems,
operator panels and data paths.
There is considerable intelligence built into the system. Mr Ryal Poppa,
Storage Technology chairman and chief executive, said: 'With Iceberg, a
global company will have access to its critical data virtually 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.'
Storage Technology's chief competitors in the memory market are
International Business Machines and EMC Corporation. The company emerged
from Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in 1987 after a troubled period in
the early 1980s. It reported 1990 net income of Dollars 69.3m on sales of
Dollars 1.14bn.
US prices for Iceberg range from Dollars 1.3m to Dollars 3.6m. Some 140
customers are commited to buying the new memory.

US BOND market investors and traders continued to trade cautiously ahead of
President George Bush's State of the Union speech - due late last night -
although short-covering and a weaker-than-expected consumer confidence
report provided a boost to prices yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  7/8 at 104
1/32 to yield 7.648 per cent. The short end of the market was also firmer,
with the two-year note up  7/32 at 99 19/32 , yielding 5.075 per cent.
Prices moved higher in early trading, thanks to news that the Conference
Board's consumer confidence index was 50.4 in January, down from a revised
52.5 in December.
The rise in prices was exaggerated by dealers buying bonds to cover short
positions before President Bush's speech. His address to Congress was
expected to outline measures to boost the ailing economy, none of which were
likely to be favourable to the bond market.
GERMAN government bonds ended higher on the day, shrugging off a sharp rise
in German money supply and strike worries.
German M3 money supply expanded at an annual rate of 5.7 per cent in
December, up from 5.1 per cent in November. Money supply grew at a rate of
5.2 per cent in the final quarter of 1991, exceeding the Bundesbank's 1991
target for growth of between three and five per cent.
The announcement yesterday morning pushed the Liffe bund futures contract
down from the opening level of 88.15 to 88.03, but then it picked up to
reach 88.40 by late afternoon, helped by demand for 10-year bunds.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch government bond market followed the German
bond market's lead to close firmer. Tap sales of the 8.25 per cent 15-year
bond are due to close today, having raised a total of Fl 4.8bn since the
beginning of last week. Traders said demand for the 15-year issue from both
international and domestic investors was strong.
UK government bond prices gained up to half a point yesterday following the
German bond market's lead and sterling's firmness in the foreign exchange
markets.
However, traders said many participants remained on the sidelines ahead of
today's auction of Pounds 1.8bn of the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from its opening of
115 1/2 to 115 15/16 by late afternoon while short-dated issues gained about
an eighth of a point.
YEN weakness against the dollar helped to push Japanese government bond
prices slightly lower yesterday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.25 per cent and closed at 5.26
per cent after trading in a narrow range of 5.245-5.26 per cent. Bond market
volumes were low ahead of today's 10-year auction, traders said.
The dollar continued to strengthen against the yen, reaching Y125.95 before
slipping slightly. The dollar rose after the G7 central bankers and finance
ministers failed to support publicly recent strengthening in the yen at
their weekend meeting.

<TEXT>
MR Torstein Hagen, the London-based Norwegian investor who controls a 27 per
cent stake in Nedlloyd, was yesterday nominated to the Dutch transport
group's supervisory board, ending a year-long war of nerves between the
company's management and its single biggest shareholder.
Nedlloyd said Mr Hagen had pledged that his two investment vehicles, Marine
Investments and DNO, would be long-term investors in the Rotterdam-based
company.
Mr Hagen also promised to act in the interests of all 'stakeholders', to
accept the company's current strategy and to support the work of the
management board.
Marine Investments said in a statement from Luxembourg that 'the two
companies and Mr Hagen have, however, signalled areas in which they may want
to see a change, but have accepted that this will be part of the normal
process of the workings of a supervisory board'.
Relations between Mr Hagen and Nedlloyd reached a low point at the annual
shareholders' meeting in May, when he led a shareholder revolt that
culminated in the voting-down of the company's 1990 accounts.
The move was aimed at winning three seats for Mr Hagen and his supporters on
an expanded supervisory board. Mr Hagen later scaled down his demands to one
seat.
Mr Hagen and Nedlloyd have clashed in the past over the pace of divesting
businesses that do not belong to the group's two core sectors, ocean-going
shipping and overland transport.

project to cut toxic waste

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals group,
yesterday said it would spend Dollars 50m on projects to cut its toxic
emissions by 79 per cent.
The announcement coincided with the release of findings by the Council on
Economic Priorities, a US public interest economic research agency, which
criticised Cyanamid's environmental record.
Ms Alice Tepper Marlin, founder and executive director of the agency,
described Cyanamid as the nation's third biggest emitter of toxic waste in
1989.
According to Ms Marlin, Cyanamid released an average of 41lb of toxic
chemical for every Dollars 1,000 of sales, or four times the chemical
industry average.
Cyanamid said yesterday that it would build a regeneration plant to recover
120m lb of sulphuric acid and other chemicals annually that were currently
disposed of by deepwell injection.
The company is also building a facility to recover acetonitrile and hydrogen
cyanide.
All of the new environmental projects will be located at the company's
Fortier plant in Waggaman, Louisiana, which the Council on Economic
Priorities described as the largest emitter of toxic pollution in the US in
1988 and the second largest in 1989.

FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fiat sees earnings setback to
L1,100bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's largest private sector company, is set to suffer another big
setback in net profits, possibly by as much as one-third to around L1,100bn
(Dollars 907m) for 1991.
The figures, derived from a letter sent to shareholders yesterday, suggest
that Fiat will be forced to cut its dividend when the payout is announced in
May.
For 1990, the company caused controversy when it maintained its dividend at
L370 a share for ordinary and preference shares and L400 for savings stock,
despite a marked earnings fall.
The latest drop in profits, which is broadly in line with expectations,
reflects sharply contracting demand for motor vehicles, Fiat's core
business. Earnings have also been squeezed by tighter profit margins and
heavy investments, which have not been compensated by better performance
from non-industrial activities like financial services.
Group sales rose 1.1 per cent to L57,828bn last year, while turnover for
Fiat's core industrial activities dropped to L49,689bn from L49,894bn.
Last year's figures include L2,176bn in sales for Ford New Holland and CEAc,
the newly-acquired farm equipment and components businesses.
However, L1,710bn in sales of Telettra, sold to Alcatel-Alsthom, are
excluded.
The company stressed that its Fiat Auto car business remained in profit
despite a continuing fall in demand. In 1991, the group's share of the
Italian car market, which it once dominated, shrank further to 46.7 per cent
from 52.8 per cent in 1990.
Difficulties on the cars side and the consolidation of loss-making
acquisitions like Ford New Holland and the Enasa trucks group in Spain meant
group operating profits fell to about L636bn last year.
Around L1,000bn of Fiat's 1991 pre-tax profits - estimated to be around
L1,600bn - were derived from extraordinary items. Selling Telettra made
around L700bn, while a further L200bn came from other disposals.

HOLLAND Sweetener Company (HSC), Europe's only producer of aspartame, a
low-calorie sweetener used mainly in soft drinks, plans to quadruple
production capacity in preparation for an assault on the US market, the
preserve of NutraSweet of the US.
HSC, a joint venture between Dutch chemicals group DSM and Tosoh of Japan,
is to invest more than Fl 100m (Dollars 55m) in expanding the production
capacity of its plant in Geleen, the Netherlands, from 500 tonnes to 2,000
tonnes a year by late 1993.
At the end of this year, NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Monsanto and the
world's leading supplier of aspartame, faces the expiry of restrictive
patents which have kept competitors out of its domestic market. The US
accounts for 80 per cent of the Dollars 1bn global market for aspartame, an
'intense sweetener' which is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
Mr Winfried Vermijs, president of HSC, said the Dutch-Japanese joint venture
expects to win between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the US aspartame
market within five years of the patents' expiry.
However, NutraSweet, together with Ajinomoto, its Japanese partner, is
reported to be planning to build an aspartame plant in France, bringing
greater competition to Europe, where HSC has managed to wrest a 30 per cent
market share away from NutraSweet in the four years since the joint venture
first began commercial production.
Mr Vermijs said the sharp rise in capacity would not lead to a surplus. 'The
world market is growing at 10 per cent a year,' he said.

Substantial exposure to the Far East, one of the better performing areas of

The figure of 271.2p per share at November 30 reflected a fall of just 1.7

with a drop over the same period of 6.4 per cent for the FT-Actuaries World

Usher-Walker is paying a total of Pounds 4.7m cash for two printing industry
supplies companies and raising about Pounds 6m through a placing and open
offer.
The printing inks group also warned that a write-off following the
reassessment of stock values, the cost of reorganisations, spending incurred
in its development strategy and a disappointing last quarter would have a
significant impact on its results for 1991.
However, it expects to pay a final dividend of at least 3.75p, unchanged
from the adjusted final last time.
Usher is paying Pounds 3.82m for Hydro Dynamic Products from the
administrative receivers of Stormgard and FFr7.72m (Pounds 789,000) for 90
per cent of Graph Imprim. It is also providing FFr700,000 to acquire the
formulae for products Graph makes and has an option to acquire the other 10
per cent.
HDP reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 819,000 in the year to March 31 1991
at which date it had net tangible assets of Pounds 814,000. In the same
period Graph had pre-tax profits of FFr2.19m and year-end net tangible
assets of FFr2.01m.
A total of 4.38m shares are being placed at 155p and are being offered to
existing shareholders on a 1-for-1 basis. The cash realised will be used for
the acquisitions and to reduce borrowings.
Usher-Walker shares yesterday closed at 165p, down 6p.

Expansion into Scotland left Shoprite Group's profits lower at Pounds 1.11m
pre-tax, against Pounds 2.25m, for the year to October 27.
Turnover at this Isle of Man-based grocery and vehicle retailer and property
company rose from Pounds 31m to Pounds 45.4m.
During the period 11 discount supermarkets and a distribution centre were
opened. However, the opening programme was delayed and income was
insufficient to cover overheads until the end of the year.
The openings were financed by the Pounds 3.9m placing and open offer in June
and asset disposals. Gearing at the year end was 45 per cent.
There was an exceptional profit of Pounds 345,000, being the surplus on
property disposals less pre-opening expenses. Interest charges increased to
Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 942,000).
The proposed single final dividend is maintained at 5.2p from earnings per
share of 8.7p (16.4p).

Miskin Group, the USM-quoted contractor, property development, plant hire

The results were qualified by Miskin's auditors on the basis that the

negotiations currently taking place with its bankers and principal
shareholders.
The loss, which compared with profits of Pounds 559,000 for the 12 months to
January 31 1990, was struck after exceptional provisions of Pounds 4.62m for
property write-downs and interest charges of Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 158,000).

<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Nursing Services reported a substantial half-year profit and
directors are looking for a return to sustained growth and want to
strengthen the balance sheet.
Therefore, they proposed a placing and open offer of 5.48m shares to raise
Pounds 6.27m to reduce borrowings and for working capital. The placing will
be with institutions and shareholders can clawback on a 1-for-1 basis at
120p per share.
The shares rose 42p to 148p.
Mr Robert Upsdell, chairman, said following the problems of the 1990-91
year, when a loss of Pounds 2.07m was incurred, the 28 weeks to October 12
1991 showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 705,000, compared with Pounds 421,000.
Earnings per share rose to 12.9p (7.7p) but there is no interim dividend,
compared with 1p and no final last time.
Borrowings were being reduced and were anticipated to fall further in the
coming months following asset sales. Expenditure was planned to increase the
capacity of two homes and the option will be taken by March 2 to buy
Gazedown, which runs the Greengables Nursing Home, for Pounds 690,000 and
assume its debt.
With the placing, 547,765 warrants will be issued on a 1-for-10 basis
entitling shareholders to subscribe for shares at 175p each any time prior
to September 30 1993.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Wrists slapped after accused found guilty
as charged - The first actions of a new City watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIRECTORS of Ultramar and Williams Holdings were rubbing their reddened
wrists yesterday as the recipients of the first publicly administered slaps
from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the policing arm of the Financial
Reporting Council.
Both companies had been found guilty of breaches of accounting standards,
exposed in statements released to the Stock Exchange in the morning.
Each accepted the charges - albeit somewhat grudgingly - and promised not to
transgress again.
Ultramar, the oil and gas group, and Williams Holdings, the industrial
conglomerate, suffered a little negative publicity as a result. In addition,
Williams suffered the indignity of its share price dropping 20p in the
morning after the announcement was released to the stock market, before
recovering slightly to close down 11p at 312p.
Ultramar contravened SSAP 8, a UK accounting standard dealing with taxation,
in its treatment of advance corporation tax (ACT).
By treating ACT as a cost of dividends rather than a tax charge on operating
profits (as the standard lays down), it reduced the tax charge by Pounds
12.3m. That had the effect of increasing earnings per share to 32.2p. Under
the advised SSAP treatment, the eps figure would have been 28.9p.
The approach adopted, which the company has practised over many years, was
highlighted in the notes to the accounts. The alternative earnings figures
were also given, printed on the same page as the consolidated profit and
loss account.
Ultramar argues that since most of its income comes from overseas, there is
very little UK tax charge against which to offset ACT, and adding it into
the tax charge therefore unfairly distorts the earnings figure.
'We're all in favour of improving financial reporting, but the only problem
is that standardisation doesn't always work,' said a senior executive in the
company who was involved in negotiations with the review panel.
Williams Holdings broke with the guidance given under SSAP 3, which deals in
part with earnings per share. It treated a series of exceptional items on
asset disposals and reorganisations as post-tax - a treatment permissible
under the standard only for extraordinary items.
As a result, the company's earnings per share stood at 22.3p, compared with
21.2p using the SSAP treatment. Again, the alternative treatment was flagged
in the accounts, and the recalculated earnings per share figures were
published.
Ultramar is no longer in a position to make amends directly. It was subsumed
by Lasmo, the UK oil exploration company, in a close-run Pounds 1.2bn
takeover bid concluded in December. As a result, it will not be publishing
1991 accounts as a separate entity.
The directors of Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, have
already given a written undertaking to the panel that its practices in the
forthcoming 1991 report will comply fully with accounting regulations.
Beyond the two companies, the spotlight is now likely to be trained on the
auditors to both companies. Ernst &amp; Young, auditor to Ultramar, covered
themselves with a 'qualified' audit report in the 1990 accounts. The letter
signing off the accounts explicitly highlights the treatment of ACT and
stresses that it does not comply with SSAP 8.
However, in the case of Pannell Kerr Forster (PKF), auditor to Williams
Holdings, there is no such statement. The letter in the 1990 accounts
resembles the typical standard one issued to unqualified accounts. It
states: 'In our opinion the accounts give a true and fair view . . . and
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985'.
Mr Richard Pearson, chairman of PKF, said last night: 'In view of the
disclosures made by Williams in last year's accounts we did not consider
that these particular circumstances warranted further mention in our audit
report.'
However, two parties have emerged contented from yesterday's events. The
Accounting Standards Board, can take comfort from a minor victory in its
campaign to boost the quality of financial reporting.
Its sister body, the review panel, can breathe a sigh of relief that its
first reprimands have worked well. The companies have accepted its edicts,
and have not threatened to challenge its decisions in the courts.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Hooper starts to show improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLARKE HOOPER, the international marketing services group, saw its pre-tax
profits fall sharply in the six months to October 31 1991, but improve over
the the previous year's second half.
Profit came out at Pounds 820,000 (Pounds 1.73m), generated on turnover down
Pounds 4m to Pounds 23.7m.
Mr Barry Clarke, chairman, said action had been taken to cut overheads by
some Pounds 2m. The reduced cost base had helped to improve profitability
substantially, the half year outcome comparing with Pounds 326,000 in the
second part of last year.
'We are now in a better position to start integrating resources and have the
opportunity to focus on the fixed costs of our business,' he said. One
cost-cutting measure was the integration of three Toronto offices into one
unit.
Mr Clarke said it was decided to maintain the interim dividend at 1.7p but
he remained cautious about prospects.
Earnings per share were cut to 2.8p (7.1p) in the period on capital
increased by last June's placing and open offer.
The chairman reported that several parts of the group were currently
'bucking the trend' of poor performance in the sector.
But he warned that 1992 was unlikely to see much improvement for the
advertising and marketing businesses.

defers preference dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Novo Group, which has interests in radio and electronic capital goods and
was formerly known as EMC Group, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 529,485
for the six months to end-September.
The results, which follow the acquisition of Novo Com-munications in April
last year, compare with Pounds 122,254 for the same period in 1990 after
stripping out contribu-tions from discontinued activities.
In the 18-month period to March 31 1991 pre-tax profits totalled Pounds
158,342.
First half earnings per share rose to 4.62p (1.17p) and directors said they
expected another satisfactory performance in the second half.
However, to preserve cash flow pending the renegotiation of US banking
facilities, dividends on the preference share capitals are being deferred.
As a result, there is no interim on the ordin-ary capital - 0.3p was paid
before.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Carlton bids for Pickwick Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Communications, the television services and production company which
last autumn won the London weekday ITV franchise, is making a Pounds 69m bid
for Pickwick Group, the distributor of videos and recorded music.
The recommended offer of 100 Carlton shares for 232 Pickwick values the
target's shares at 245p each, 42 per cent ahead of yesterday's opening price
of 173p. The cash alternative is 220p.
Carlton already does some video distribution in the US and UK and duplicates
videos through its Technicolor subsidiary. Pickwick will provide a European
distribution network, particularly in the sell-through market in which the
videos are sold rather than rented out.
BBC Enterprises and The Walt Disney Company are among the organisations with
which it has distribution arrangements.
Mr Michael Green, Carlton's chairman, said he admired Pickwick's cautious
approach to the video sector. 'I like the children's and the sports market,'
he said, pointing to the success of Glasgow Rangers' greatest goals. 'It's
not all about Hollywood blockbusters.'
Indeed 65 per cent of the videos sold were not in that category. Another of
Pickwick's hits is The Lovers' Guide, an educational sex video.
The price Carlton is paying looks quite high in terms of Pickwick's
estimated 1991 earnings. Hoare Govett, its broker, has forecast a fall in
pre-tax profit from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 4.3m, after a mere Pounds 82,000
made in the first half and problems in France. This would make Carlton's
cash bid 23 times earnings. With a recovery forecast to Pounds 7m this year,
the multiple returns to about 14 times.
Carlton, which has a market value of more than Pounds 1bn, is also
interested in the distribution network for the library of programmes that it
intends to build up once it takes over the former Thames Television service
next year. The acquisition takes it into a new area: audio tapes, which
account for about 60 per cent of Pickwick's turnover.
Pickwick came to the market in May 1987 when the offer for sale was more
than 50 times subscribed. After a heady share-price rise to about 260p in
1988, little progress was made, although profits continued to rise until
last year.
Carlton's offer has been accepted by Pearson, publisher of the Financial
Times, which owns 20 per cent, and by the holders of a further 5 per cent.

FT  29 JAN 92 / South African banks to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABSA and Bankorp, two of South Africa's largest banks, have announced they
are to merge their businesses to create a bank with assets of more than
R80bn (Pounds 15.9bn).
ABSA, the banking interest of Rembrandt, the South African tobacco-based
conglomerate, will acquire the entire issued share capital of Bankorp, the
banking arm of the Sanlam insur-ance group, at 312.5 cents per share.
This is a premium over Bankorp's closing price yesterday of 295 cents, but a
discount to the share's 1991 net asset value of 323 cents.
The total purchase price of R1.3bn will be financed through the issue of an
additional 116.5m shares in ABSA at R11.25 per share.
Bankorp shareholders will receive 100 ABSA shares for every 360 shares in
Bankorp.
The merger represents a shake-out at the top of the country's banking tree,
removing the weakest of the big five - Bankorp - and leaving ABSA larger
than any other bank.
Sanlam, through its investment arm Sankorp, owns 86 per cent of Bankorp and
this share will be reduced to 21 per cent in the enlarged ABSA.
It is envisaged that in due course Sankorp and Universa (a company owned 40
per cent by Financial Securities Limited, part of the Rembrandt group; 40
per cent by the Mines Pension Funds; and 20 per cent by Sage Financial
Services) will have equal interests of 25 per cent in ABSA.
The main trading divisions of Bankorp, such as TrustBank, Senbank and
Bankfin will continue trading under their existing names.
Two of the most important potential benefits for ABSA of the merger are a
more balanced market representation - ABSA is strong in home loans and
Bankorp in instalment sales and corporate markets - and a more
representative outlet structure.
Mr Piet Liebenberg, executive chairman of Bankorp, will become a
vice-chairman and deputy chief executive of ABSA.
Although the deal came as a surprise, analysts have long believed that it
was only a matter of time before Bankorp was swallowed up by one of the
other large banks.
Bankorp paid a heavy price for two years of 40 per cent asset growth in 1989
and 1990, culminating in write-offs of R386.5m in 1990.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Stripped of the good banking badge: The impact on Credit
Suisse of its credit downgrading by Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss bankers' worst fears were realised yesterday when Moody's, the US
credit rating agency, downgraded Credit Suisse from its precious Aaa credit
rating and said the Aaa rating of Swiss Bank Corporation was also being
reviewed for a possible downgrade.
Their chagrin will appear petulant to bankers elsewhere, many of whom have
been battling to preserve their capital in the face of colossal losses. In
stark contrast, the three biggest Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland,
Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse, a subsidiary of CS Holding, are
exceptionally strong and making record profits.
But Swiss bankers are trained to believe that there is a higher goal than
making profits. Their priority has been to retain 'triple A' credit ratings,
the badge of good banking. So it is difficult to exaggerate the shock caused
by Moody's announcement.
Mr Robert Jeker, Credit Suisse president, put on a brave face: 'We would
have preferred to keep the rating,' he said. But he took comfort from
Moody's reasons for the downgrade, which referred to the 'potential' for a
deterioration in the quality of its loans and other assets rather than an
actual deterioration.
Mr John Kriz, a Moody's vice-president who was involved in evaluating Credit
Suisse's rating, also cited 'the likelihood of a more adverse competitive
environment in Switzerland and abroad'.
Mr Jeker argued that the downgrade was because of factors beyond the control
of the bank's management. But in private interviews, senior executives do
not hide their annoyance: 'It is a question of prestige,' said one.
When an agency gives a triple A rating to a bank it is saying that funds
deposited with that bank carry almost no risk for the lenders. Until
yesterday, the trio of big Swiss banks were among only five private sector
banks which had been given the accolade of triple A for all forms of debt by
all three of the world's leading agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's,
based in the US, and IBCA in London. The other members of this bankers' club
are Rabobank of the Netherlands and Deutsche Bank of Germany. Morgan
Guaranty of the US also has this distinction, although it is denied to its
holding company, JP Morgan.
Over the past couple of months, Credit Suisse's chairman, Mr Rainer Gut, and
Mr Jeker have tried to reassure staff that a downgrading will make little
difference to the business. Mr Jeker insists that the downgrade
profitability. However, he is contradicting a statement made in last year's
annual report: 'Thanks to our Aaa credit rating we were able to benefit from
the shift in global business to European banks.'
Credit Suisse and its highly rated peers have been able to increase their
share of better quality banking business and widen the margin between
borrowing and lending rates because they are regarded as safe havens for
deposits, compared with Japanese and US banks which have had their capital
eroded.
In theory, a cut in Credit Suisse's rating will lead to a reduction in
profits from this traditional banking business but Mr Robin Munro-Davis,
managing director of IBCA, says: 'There are so few triple A banks in the
world that I don't think it will make much difference when raising funds.'
However, financial analysts are convinced that Credit Suisse made record
profits in 1991 in part because of this 'flight to quality'.
Mr Munro-Davis said a downgrade would have been more understandable a year
ago. The bank's profits after tax in 1990 were SFr549m (Pounds 215m), 30 per
cent lower than the previous year.
'There is no question that Credit Suisse today is stronger than 12 months
ago. That is blindingly obvious,' Mr Munro-Davis said. Both IBCA and S&amp;P
stress that they have no plans to downgrade Credit Suisse.
Moody's, however, is concerned that the quality of Credit Suisse's assets
may deteriorate 'over the intermediate term', because of the 'soft economies
in Switzerland and elsewhere'. It also highlights the weakness of the Swiss
property market, which 'could weaken Credit Suisse's domestic property loan
portfolio'.
Mr Jeker said he did not expect the bank to suffer from significant property
losses. Indeed, analysts point out that Credit Suisse's residential and
commercial loans are backed by collateral worth much more than the loans.
There would have to be an astonishing crash in the property market for
Credit Suisse to be badly hurt, they say.
Its record of minimising losses on overseas lending is also impressive,
especially in the US, where it has made about 15 per cent of all its loans.
Its experience in the UK, where it has a similar exposure, is not so good:
it made big loans to Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group, and to Polly
Peck, the fruit and electronics company, which is in receivership.
Mr Jeker does not dispute Moody's contention that the Swiss banking market
is likely to become more open to competition from foreign banks. Nor does he
deny competition between Swiss banks is intensifying. But he is convinced
that the net effect of these trends will be to reinforce the position of the
big three Swiss banks at the expense of the many smaller banks.
However, Mr Munro-Davis said that it would be difficult to 'prove' that
Moody's had made a mistake, even though his firm takes a different view of
Credit Suisse: 'It is almost impossible to prove that someone in the rating
business is wrong.'
MOODY'S, the rating agency, downgraded to Aa1 from Aaa the long-term deposit
rating of Credit Suisse and said it was reviewing the Aaa long-term deposit
rating of Swiss Bank Corporation. Moody's cited the 'soft' Swiss economy and
a 'potential' deterioration in asset quality. Credit Suisse Financial
Products, the subsidiary specialising in derivatives or sophisticated
financial instruments, also lost its Aaa long-term deposit rating.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Hanson shuts door on bid for ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON yesterday relin-quished his right to bid for ICI for the
foreseeable future when he told his annual general meeting that Hanson had
no plans to acquire the chemicals giant.
It was the first time since Hanson took its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI last
May that its chairman, Lord Hanson, firmly shut the door on launching a bid
for the chemicals group.
He told Hanson shareholders: 'We have never said we would bid for ICI - that
was all media speculation and market rumour - and we have no plans to do so
now.'
The Takeover Panel on mergers and acquisitions said that Lord Hanson's
statement was 'unambiguous' and therefore prevented the conglomerate from
making a bid for a 'considerable period of time'.
Only a 'material change' in ICI's circumstances would give Hanson the right
to try to acquire the chemicals company. A spokesman for the panel added
that even if there was a significant fall in ICI's profits for the year to
December 31, 1991 - to be announced on February 27 - this would not
constitute a material change in circumstances.
According to Hanson's advisers, Lord Hanson decided to rule out a bid for
ICI after he received scores of written questions from shareholders
concerning the group's investment in the chemicals company.
Lord Hanson told shareholders that he believed ICI had 'lost a great
opportunity' in refusing to talk with him. He added: 'As ICI's second
biggest shareholder we will continue to watch its progress with great
interest and affection.' ICI's shares fell just 2p to Pounds 12.67 on the
news that Hanson would not bid.
In response to a question about who would succeed him as chairman, Lord
Hanson could not resist blaming the media for speculation on the possible
heir apparent. 'The media believe that some talented executive should be
brought in for a huge fee . . . We have the succession. We just don't plan
to name it at this time.'
He said that Lord White, head of Hanson Industries in the US, would not
become a member of the board because he was chairman of Hanson's American
arm. 'It would not be best served by being directed from Britain,' he added.
Charges against Lord White, 68, who was accused of assaulting his girlfriend
Miss Victoria Tucker, the 29-year-old former model, on a skiing trip last
year in Aspen, Colorado, were dropped yesterday after she withdrew her
allegation.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Accounts watchdog issues reprimands: Williams Holdings and
Ultramar said to have flattered earnings per share figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LARGE companies were publicly reprimanded for their accounting policies
yesterday in the first significant actions of the Financial Reporting Review
Panel, the policing arm of the UK accountancy regulation bodies.
Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, and Ultramar, the oil and
gas group which has since been bought by Lasmo, were criticised in
announcements released to the Stock Exchange and the press.
Williams' shares fell by 20p after the morning announcement and closed 11p
down on the day at 312p.
Mr Sydney Treadgold, secretary to the review panel, said both companies had
used accounting practices which 'flattered their earnings per share'
figures. The treatments contravened both accepted accounting standards and
the 1985 Companies Act. He warned that the accounting policies of 'one or
two' more companies were likely to be exposed in the next few days.
The statements represent the panel's first public actions since it was
established in February 1991 and are an attempt to tighten up the quality of
financial reporting. Williams calculated 1990 earnings per share after
excluding exceptional items, one-off costs incurred as part of its
continuing operations. This treatment, contrary to accepted accounting
practice, increased reported earnings per share from 21.2p to 22.3p.
Ultramar included unrelieved advance corporation tax, the charge against
dividends before they are distributed to shareholders, as part of the cost
of its dividends, rather than as a tax charge. That boosted reported
earnings per share from 28.9p to 32.2p.
In both cases, the companies had flagged their departure from standard
accounting practices in notes to the accounts, and stated they believed
their own treatment more fairly reflected the state of their companies'
performance.
Williams has agreed to comply with the official treatment recommended by the
panel in its 1991 accounts. 'It's a technicality, I accept it and it won't
happen again,' said Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman.
Ultramar's directors also accepted the panel's ruling, but the company has
since been taken over and so it will not be producing its own accounts for
the last financial year.
Attention may now turn to the auditors of the two companies. Ernst &amp; Young
qualified its report in the Ultramar accounts to draw attention to the
divergence from accepted accounting practice.
There was no such qualification in the audit report by Pannell Kerr Forster,
auditor to Williams.

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US-Japanese consortium has won a much-contested tender to evaluate oil and
gas reserves off Russia's far-eastern island of Sakhalin.
Moscow says the study will lead to a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) exploration
and development project.
Marathon Oil and McDermott International of the US and Japan's Mitsui and Co
defeated four other teams, one of which included Exxon.
The deal appears to be the most ambitious of its kind to date. The Russian
government hopes to conclude several more agreements with western oil
companies to help revive flagging domestic production.
The deal, due to be concluded on March 31, is for a feasibility study into
the development of reserves estimated at 730m barrels of oil and more than
400bn cubic metres of gas. Such resources are of immediate interest to
Japan, which lies just south of Sakhalin.
A Mitsui official said the consortium had made 'small' changes to its
original proposals, after Russia set new conditions, some related to the
needs of local people.
A Russian industry expert said that local authorities in Sakhalin had
pressed for the tender to be restarted from scratch. The choice of the
US-Japanese consortium signified a victory for central authorities in
Moscow.
Although the agreement is formally for a feasibility study, the oil
companies are likely to have reached an understanding with Russian
authorities on profit-sharing. Moscow is also due soon to produce
legislation on mineral rights to clarify the position of foreign investors.
The feasibility study should take about 18 months. Production would be
unlikely to start until the late 1990s.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Government to go ahead with tight controls on unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has shelved plans to make agreements between unions and
employers legally binding, but will otherwise press ahead with almost all
the reforms laid out in last year's industrial relations green paper.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, indicated that several of those
reforms would be included in the Conservative manifesto. He has, however,
amended the proposal to seek employees' consent for union dues to be
deducted from pay on 'automatic check-off' from every year to every three
years.
The manifesto commitments will include the new 'check-off' plan, taken from
a suggestion made by the Institute of Personnel Management, plus:
the right of ordinary citizens to take out injunctions against unlawful
strikes
seven days' notice of strikes
the right to join a union of choice regardless of the Trades Union Congress
arrangement for regulating inter-union disputes.
The package is also likely to include tighter controls on the way unions
ballot on industrial action, including the proposal (not in the green paper)
that voting papers should be distributed and stored by an independent body.
Strike ballots would in future have to be conducted by post and be subject
to independent scrutiny.
The timing of the announcement, in a Commons statement on last July's green
paper proposals, seemed designed to focus attention on Labour's trade union
ties in the frenetic pre-election atmosphere.
The government would aim to introduce legislation in the first session of
the new parliament. The issue of legally binding collective agreements has
not formally been dropped, but is unlikely to become part of any
legislation.
The Confederation of British industry and the Engineering Employers
Federation welcomed the decision to shelve legally binding agreements.
To Labour fury at Westminster, Mr Howard said the proposals were designed to
'consolidate and build on the improvement in industrial relations which we
have achieved over the last 12 years'.

FT  29 JAN 92 / French pick IBM to take minority stake in Bull
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday chose IBM, the world's leading computer
maker, for a wide ranging technology, research and commercial alliance with
Bull, the loss-making state-owned computer group.
IBM is expected to pay an estimated Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.2m) for a 5.7
per cent stake in Bull.
This is the main part of a series of accords announced yesterday, also
embracing SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor company, and Apple,
the US microcomputer group.
The selection of IBM, the preferred choice of Bull's own management and
French president Francois Mitterrand, brings to an end six months of hectic
behind the scenes competition between IBM and Hewlett Packard, the rival
suitor.
This is the second phase of the reorganisation of France's state-owned
high-technology companies, following the proposal announced last month to
merge the state's civil electronics and nuclear energy businesses. IBM is
the second foreign investor in Bull since last year's controversial purchase
of a 4.7 per cent stake by NEC, the Japanese electronics company. This
cemented their accord under which Bull distributes NEC mainframes in Europe.
HP, which yesterday said it was 'disappointed for Bull', has agreed to
continue separate talks with SGS-Thomson for a possible chip purchasing
agreement but denied any suggestion that it might take an equity stake.
IBM is to supply Bull with its microprocessors and computers based on
'reduced instruction set computing' technology, which allows quicker
response times.
The French group will make available to IBM its own open-standards
technology, which enables different makes of computer to interconnect.
Mr John Akers, IBM's chairman, said: 'It is another step in the development
of a strong information technology industry in Europe and represents further
progress in the acceptance of open standards.'
The US computer group has agreed to purchase 150,000 notebook computers
annually from Zenith Data Systems - Bull's microcomputer subsidiary - over
the next four years for sale under the IBM label, say government officials.
Bull is to join a Texas-based centre for research into the next generation
of microcomputers, run by Apple with IBM and Motorola, the US electronics
group.
In a related accord, Apple is to form a task force over the next few weeks
with Thomson Consumer Electronics, the French state-owned maker of
audiovisual equipment, and France Telecom, the telecommunications operator.
It will research 'multimedia' terminals for the simultaneous processing of
video, graphics, voice and text.

FT  29 JAN 92 / When fare is not fair: Road travel in the UK has built-in
cost advantages over rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 9.30 on a Saturday morning in London. Alex and Sue, like many young
Londoners, are going to spend the weekend with relatives - in their case,
115 miles away in Birmingham, Britain's second biggest city.
They consider two ways of getting there. If they go by train, the cheapest
available second-class fare is Pounds 23 return, making Pounds 46 for the
two of them. If they jump into Sue's Peugeot 205 and drive, the petrol for
the round trip will cost them Pounds 11 - less than a quarter of the cost of
the rail tickets.
Not surprisingly, they choose to drive.
Inadvertently, Alex and Sue have just stumbled upon the reason why the
government is having so much difficulty privatising British Rail. The
trouble is, few but the rich can justify the cost of catching a train where
road transport offers a realistic alternative. Consequently, rail's share of
the UK passenger travel market is a miserable 6 per cent, and the railways
do not make money.
Superficially, it seems odd that rail travel should be more expensive than
driving. The cost of moving large numbers of people in a single train should
be much less than the cost of moving the same number of people in hundreds
of separate road vehicles.
The explanation lies in the fact that when a rail passenger buys a ticket,
he or she contributes not only to the cost of operating the train, but to
the cost of the railway tracks, signals and stations, too. The marginal
extra cost of a motorist's journey, conversely, is limited to the cost of
the fuel consumed: the road is provided by the government.
It is this disequilibrium that has undermined the viability of railways the
world over. Wherever governments provide roads that are free at the point of
use and there is enough space left to drive on them, passenger railways are
subsidised or struggling, or both.
The implication is that, if railways are to become profitable - and in doing
so, play a part in easing the world's worsening transport crisis -
governments will need either to start charging for the use of the roads, or
relieve train operators of responsibility for the railway tracks.
The first option cuts no ice with the roads lobby. Organisations such as the
British Road Federation say motorists in the UK already cover more than the
full cost of the road network through the taxes they pay.
They have a point. On current forecasts, the special fuel tax levied on fuel
used by road vehicles is expected to raise Pounds 10.8bn this year, and
vehicle excise duty another Pounds 3.1bn. The total of Pounds 13.9bn is more
than double the Pounds 6.1bn forecast to be spent this year on the building,
maintenance and policing of roads.
Excluded from this assessment, however, are the so-called social costs of
motoring. The Department of Transport says the costs to society of road
deaths and injuries was Pounds 6.8bn in 1990; a frequently cited study by
the Confederation of British Industry has put the annual costs of road
congestion at Pounds 15bn; and, in accordance with the widely accepted
'polluter pays' principle, the green-tinged Environmental Transport
Association, a lobby group, estimates that road users should be charged
Pounds 2.3bn a year to reflect the environmental damage they cause.
By comparison, the social costs imposed by rail travel are small; yet the
absence of a road pricing structure encourages people to make as much use as
possible of their cars to justify the high initial outlay made in acquiring
them.
Worse, the absence of charges for road use has created an adverse climate
for rail investment by distorting decisions on the relative merits of road
and rail schemes.
Under Department of Transport rules, the case for rail investment is judged
solely according to commercial criteria. An investment will only normally
proceed if the fare revenue it generates delivers a financial rate of return
of 8 per cent or more.
In the case of new road schemes, however, the absence of a pricing structure
means that commercial criteria cannot be applied. Instead, the Department of
Transport carries out a cost-benefit analysis to see whether the road should
be built.
Put simply, this means adding up the potential benefits to road users
(mainly, savings in drivers' time, savings in vehicle operating costs, and
reductions in accidents); giving them a notional monetary value; and then
calculating whether this value delivers an 8 per cent return on the cost of
the scheme.
Railways are doubly disadvantaged by this system: first, because the
appraisal of rail schemes excludes any consideration of benefits to users or
non-users, and second, because the appraisal of road schemes puts a value on
only the positive aspects of roadbuilding - not the negative ones, such as
environmental damage.
Thus, road schemes proliferate while investment in big rail projects is
scarce. Absurdly, in rare instances where the government decides that it
wants to proceed with a rail project even though it fails the normal
commercial test - as with the recent decision to approve the east-west
London CrossRail scheme - it uses a road-style cost-benefit analysis to
justify the project instead.
One obvious way of levelling the playing field between road and rail would
be to introduce a road pricing system which charged people not just for the
direct costs of the roads they used, but for the social costs, too. Then,
rational decisions about priorities for road and rail schemes could be based
on people's preparedness to pay.
Political realities, however, mean that road pricing is still some way off.
Voters do not like paying for what they are accustomed to receiving free.
But the privatisation of British Rail offers a different opportunity. If the
government decided to retain ownership of the tracks and privatise only the
trains, railways would for the first time be given the same status as roads.
Taxes on rail and road users could be brought into line, with each paying
the same proportion of their full economic and social costs. The government
would decide the provision of roads and railways in line with national
needs, using the same investment criteria for each, and the private sector
would be left to decide how best to make profitable use of them.
The result could be a new golden age for rail. Significantly, the would-be
train operators that have come forward already - Virgin, Stagecoach,
Orient-Express Hotels - have shown little interest in owning tracks, but a
great deal of interest in running trains. A level playing field between road
and rail transport would open the way to many more.
Far-fetched the idea may appear, but it is already a reality in Sweden. In
1988 the Swedish parliament, motivated by growing concern about the
country's transport problems, decided to split Swedish State Railways into
two: a national rail administration, Banverket, which owns the tracks, and
Swedish Railways, which runs the trains.
Today, the rail system operates much like the roads. Swedish Railways,
although still state-owned, has been put on a commercial basis with a view
to ultimate privatisation, while Banverket's investments are planned to
achieve maximum benefit to the social economy.
Rail vehicles, just like road vehicles, pay an annual licence fee to the
government, plus a fuel tax and a distance-related charge. Road users,
meanwhile, have faced matching increases in their tax regime - notably in
the form of a carbon tax applied to fuel.
Results of the scheme so far have included a transformation into profit of
the previously heavily loss-making Swedish Railways; the introduction of new
train services; the entry into the market of three private freight train
operators and one private passenger train operator; and plans for SKr45bn
(Pounds 4.5bn) of rail investment to the end of the decade.
Could it happen in Britain? Privatisation offers the opportunity, if
ministers could brace themselves to grasp it. The alternative, of course,
would be to privatise the roads and impose a tax on owners for the social
costs of operating them. But not even 13 years of Conservatism has yet put
that proposal on the agenda; and, given the private sector's lack of
interest in building toll roads, the question of finding a buyer could prove
more than a little troublesome.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Arts: Sidewalk Sidney - Manchester Royal Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Randhi McWilliams' prize-winner from the Mobil Playwriting competition is a
two-hander pushed way beyond its natural length. This is a reflection not so
much on the Mobil judges, who are dealing with raw scripts, but on the
production team who should surely have done more to knock it into shape.
McWilliams is a West Indian Londoner whose theme is the familiar one of
generational conflict between the immigrants of the 1950s and their
British-born offspring. His innovation is to extend the gap by a generation,
ignoring the children of the immigrants to look at what has happened to
their grandchildren. Abandoned shortly after birth by his teenage mother,
Dominic has been brought up by his grandmother, now dead, and his
grandfather, Sidewalk Sidney, a tetchy repository of all the injustices
meted out to his family and his community.
McWilliams' point, and it is a mature one, is that the issues of the old are
different from the issues facing the young. Dominic has a white girlfriend.
He is attacked twice during the play - but neither is the straightforward
racist assault that his grandfather assumes it to be. The first is a simple
knife attack by a black youth, while the second happens when he is mistaken
for a mugger as he rescues an old white woman from a black gang.
What McWilliams seems to be gesturing at is that outdated prejudices are
preventing young blacks from realising their potential. Sidney's
cantankerous bitterness conceals the soul within him, which is glimpsed
through his love for his grandchild and his unappreciated talent as a
song-writer. With stick raised in rebellion against the great colonialist in
the sky, Eddie Osei cuts a fine figure, grumbling comically to his dead wife
or thundering, Learlike, against his fate. Charlie Caine also does well to
ride the powerhouse of emotions that propel Dominic from amused indulgence
to drunken anger.
Sidney will never be able to accept his grandson's values - he moans about
the changes that Dominic has made to his songs, but those songs are the key
to a cultural reconciliation between the two. In order to make his
grandfather proud of him, Dominic must find a pride in his grandfather.
One can see why the play appealed to the Mobil panellists: it has an
attractive wisdom and a marvellous command of a West Indian patois that is
rich, rough and comically rude. It does not, however, display an innate
grasp of theatrical structure: the characters seldom stray from their
monologues, and the second act splinters into a series of crude episodes to
which director James Maxwell's only solution seems to be to turn the lights
up and down.
The tone, the design, the pacing are fatally prosaic. One can only hope that
McWilliams' Mobil winnings give him the space to develop along more
satisfying lines.

There is a fair amount of sport around tonight. Not being a soccer fan, I
shan't be watching Liverpool play Arsenal in The Match (8.00 ITV) but if I
can sneak away from the television I may well listen to some of the Test
Match Special, which begins on Radio 3 at 9.25 pm and runs until 5.00
tomorrow morning, covering the opening day of England's second Test against
New Zealand, live from Auckland.
The true and horrifying story behind 'Bridge On The River Kwai' is the
subject of Timewatch (8.10 BBC2). It was not just prisoners of war who were
forced by the Japanese to work on the Burma railway, but 250,000 Asian
labourers were also conscripted, of whom 100,000 may have died. Dispatches
investigates Britain's fifth largest company, Hanson Trust (9.00 C4). The
programme promises to examine 'the role played by 40 interlocking
Panama-registered subsidiaries, not mentioned in the Hanson accounts, in
helping the company avoid tax and maximise profits'. Hanson, it says, now
has a collection of companies mostly in declining, cyclical, or low growth
businesses that are unlikely to yield the sort of profits to which Hanson
shareholders have become accustomed.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Arts: Manchester, Swansea and the North to celebrate the
millennium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They were ringing the bells in Manchester last night and illuminating the
sky with fireworks to celebrate the city's selection as UK City of Drama in
1994. Add on the cost of the lobbying and the promotional literature which
secured the award and Manchester will have spent already a good chunk of the
Pounds 250,000 grant it received yesterday from the Arts Council to speed it
on its way.
But the whole Arts 2000 programme, under which a different part of the UK
hosts a specialist arts festival in the years running up to the millennium,
is more about prestige and confidence than cash. Manchester currently has
the chutzpah to go for the big events, like hosting the Olympics, and its
plan to regenerate the reputation and vivacity of the city through boosting
drama is just part of its ambitions. Next month it is holding a major
festival of Expressionism and in the summer the annual festival of arts and
television will be enhanced by a Pounds 1.3m three year sponsorship from the
local brewer, Boddingtons.
Against such commitment, built on a thriving theatrical base, the rival
claim of Sussex stood little chance, although selecting a region which has
almost totally ignored the arts in the past would have triggered a much
greater change in attitude and made more impact on the local population.
However the imagination and co-operation which took Sussex to the short list
should ensure that the theatrical life of the county is permanently
improved.
Yesterday's awards ceremony, hosted by Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts
Council, and originator of the scheme, brought the artistic enthusiasm of
the regions to London's South Bank. It made you realise that, despite the
proximity of the West End and the big national companies, London badly needs
its own artistic renaissance.
Swansea saw off challenges from Kirklees and Nottinghamshire to be chosen as
City of Literature and Writing in 1995. The fact that this spreads the
scheme to Wales undoubtedly played a part, but Swansea prepared an
imaginative programme, covering two languages, plus an international
dimension. The bequest by the council of a fine Edwardian building in its
docklands area as a National Centre for Literature also impressed the
judges. Swansea's approach seems very down to earth. It pledged yesterday
that it will incorporate in its plans the best ideas on offer from Kirklees
and Nottinghamshire.
The north, England beyond Yorkshire, is to be the Region for the Visual Arts
in 1996, at the expense of Glasgow, Bradford and Hampshire, who were also
short-listed from among a dozen applicants. In this case the selectors went
for an area with big ambitions but little past achievement. The region now
plans to open much needed art galleries across its wide open spaces, a
landscape which played a big part in its proposals.
Arts 2000 seems to have caught the popular imagination, at least that of
local councillors. Years designated to architecture, photography, opera,
etc, will be open to offers soon.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Moment of truth - Why Europe's
green investment market is set to take off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's green investment market looks set to grow by leaps and bounds in
the coming decade, superseding the US market as the place for
environmentally conscious investors to put their cash.
Impending EC legislation, Europe's dense population and the opening up of
eastern Europe will bring substantial business opportunities in the
environmental sector. That makes the beneficiaries attractive long-term
investments, say industry specialists.
Research and information systems, which remain limited in Europe's green
investment market, should also improve in coming years. Better investment
advice and, presumably, better returns should be available to investors
interested in the environment.
Europe's green investment market is still in its infancy. Britain - where
most of the activity takes place - saw its first green fund launched only
four years ago. While several more have appeared since then, the UK green
unit trust market is still only worth about Pounds 240m - a fraction of the
Pounds 55bn UK market.
Most European financial capitals offer at least a couple of green funds, and
there are signs of increasing activity - albeit at a slow pace.
In the US, where environmental legislation has been in place for longer,
green investment is a more mature market. The potential for investment
profits is being affected by concern about the economy, and environmental
regulations are even being blamed for slowing economic growth.
Investment analysts are therefore turning their attention to European
environmental legislation. The European Commission currently has under its
aegis about 250 directives, rulings or recommendations concerning the
environment. The directives will have to be implemented into law by EC
member states.
Rovid Technology Partners, the UK investment adviser, believes western
Europe's environmental goods and services market - worth Dollars 65bn
(Pounds 36bn) in 1988 - will more than double in value to stabilise at
Dollars 140bn 'some years into the next century'. The US market, already
worth Dollars 100bn in 1988, will stabilise at Dollars 120bn, it says.
The business boom will mean investment opportunities in such sectors as
waste management, air and water treatment and recycling, and investment
companies are showing signs of renewed activity after a couple of years'
hiatus.
While some companies will benefit from the growth of the green movement,
others will no doubt suffer. Environmental liabilities are going to cost
many companies a great deal of money, which will be reflected in share
prices.
The question now exercising financial analysts' minds is what exactly is a
green share; a company that has adopted environmentally-sound policies -
such as the Body Shop - or a company that operates in the environmental
services sector - such as Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management group? David
Owen, an analyst at Ecofin, the London-based financial consultants, says one
analyst's green share is another's bete noire. 'I don't see how a company
selling free-range pigs is going to help clean up Russia,' he says.
In the UK, Commercial Union and Legal &amp; General are expected to launch green
funds which invest in European shares, while venture capital companies are
increasingly active in the private sector.
Charterhouse in the UK, and Alex Brown and First Analysis Corporation in the
US, are currently raising funds from institutional investors in Europe and
the US for environmental venture capital funds worth up to Dollars 100m.
Companies in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain are expected to
attract most of the money.
Stuart Janney, managing director of Alex Brown, the Baltimore venture
capital firm specialising in environmental companies, says: 'We think that
the next seven to 10 years are going to afford an unprecedented opportunity
to invest in companies that are small now but which will be very big at the
end of this decade. And these companies are going to be European companies.'
The main question in the debut years of green investment was whether money
could be made from being green. That has been been proved - some such funds
have outperformed their stock markets - but the bandwagon effect is wearing
off.
As Roger Hardman, at James Capel, publisher of the much-referred-to Green
Book on environmental shares, warns: 'The day has passed when the average
green share could rely upon a better-than-average market rating purely by
dint of its environmental awareness. The premium ratings can still be
obtained - but they have to be earned whereas in the past they didn't'
Sorting the potentially profitable share from the rest remains problematic.
There is a dearth of information on European companies' environmental
records - especially when compared with the US, where information systems
have developed over the past decade or so.
Few European investment companies operate their own environmental research
teams, leaving a handful of research outlets supplying information to a
specialist market.
There is simply not enough investigative groundwork, argue industry
specialists. 'Too much information is extracted from press cuttings,
celebrity panels and somewhat poor questionnaires sent to company chairmen
to complete. You won't get a company chairman who doesn't feel that his
company is not green and positive in every way,' says one observer.
There are signs of movement on both fronts, but it will not happen tomorrow.
As Peter Webster, executive director of EIRIS, the ethical investment
research service, says: 'Investment is a slow business - they take decisions
at a slow pace.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Worldwide water supply drying
up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there a worldwide water crisis? Five hundred specialists from 100 nations
meeting in Dublin this week for the UN International Conference on Water and
the Environment (ICWE) believe so.
The assembled body of statistics and working papers gathered for the
conference makes convincing and sombre reading. Among the more notable and
alarming points are:
Eighty per cent of diseases and more than 33% of deaths in developing
countries involve inadequate water quantity and quality.
The world population will exceed 6bn by 2000, and reach 8.5bn by 2025 of
which 7.2bn will be in the developing world. Urban populations, have
increased from 1bn to 3.5bn during the past 30 years.
In some cities such as Sao Paolo in Brazil, effluent discharges are as great
as the natural riverflow through them.
Less than 2 per cent of the 2m tonnes of human excrement produced daily in
cities around the world is treated. The rest is discharged into
watercourses.
World water demand by the end of the decade, including requirements for
waste dilution, may reach 18,700 cubic kilometres annually. This is almost
half of the total global runoff water annually available.
The 1991 cholera outbreak in Peru cost an estimated Dollars 460m in lost
exports and tourism 'which would have more than paid for the water and
sanitation systems needed to prevent such an outbreak occurring'.
The polluting load from industry and domestic consumers 'long ago passed the
threshold of nature's recovery processes - with alarming consequences for
the natural environment and for the health of urban residents'.
The world trend of an accelerating growth in demand, rising to meet a
limited global freshwater supply, carries a warning of Malthusian doom.
Disease and war threatens if, as a family of nations, we do not act soon to
change the way we think about water.
Economists rather than engineers are now being looked to for solutions. 'One
of the fundamental changes required is a shift from preoccupation with
development of water resources by major construction programmes to more
efficient use of available supplies using water conservation and demand
management,' akeynote paper observes.
It is pointed out that badly maintained distribution systems frequently
waste as much as 50 per cent of the available water supply. Heavy subsidies
to agriculture and industry also result in inefficient water use. Typically,
one tonne of cereal can require 2,500 tonnes of irrigation water to produce;
one tonne of steel requires 90 tonnes of water, while one tonne of synthetic
fibre can require up to 5,000 tonnes of water.
Globally, agriculture uses 73 per cent of the world's water supplies.
Irrigated farmland has increased from 94m hectares in 1950 to 260m in 1990.
Even sacred cows such as food security policies should be reconsidered.
Arcot Ramachandran, the executive director of the ICWE, asks: 'In conditions
of scarcity, it is surely not unreasonable to raise the question whether
food security is best provided by transporting water over huge distances at
enormous cost in order to supply it at massively subsidised prices or
whether purchasing and stockpiling food may not, at least in some cases, be
a more sensible solution.'
The underlying theme of the Dublin conference is that mankind's historical
view of water as a cheap and abundant resource requires an urgent updating.
Abuse and overuse has made it into a 'fragile, economic good' which needs to
be rationally priced. For many countries, a failure to do so will result in
economic slow-down and even stagnation.
More rational water pricing policies worldwide would help conserve existing
water supplies and improve their efficiency, and would provide the
additional financial resources for future developments.
According to Ramachandran: 'One of the most important messages to reach
world leaders from this conference must be that they should put a realistic
economic value on their freshwater resources.'

Bryn Owen is 31 years old, has Down's Syndrome and works five days a week at
the Rhyl branch of McDonald's in North Wales. He loves his job - 'best of
all the tidying up, because I'm a tidy person.'
Bryn is responsible for making sure the tables, chairs and floor in the
central lobby are clean and tidy for customers, with whom he always has time
for a chat. He washes the windows and floor and empties the bins.
The company was initially approached by People Recruitment, part of Clwyd
county council, which finds jobs for people with learning difficulties. Bryn
started part-time in 1989 but was promoted to full-time work in 1990. His
supervisor, David Padmore, was conscious of Owen being there during his
first week's work. 'But now he's so much part of the furniture.
'The most important thing from everybody's point of view was that Bryn was
going to be treated normally. While he may be capable of doing only certain
things, he has fitted into the role that he's been given very well.'
And Alan Kay, branch manager, has no hesitation in describing what started
as an experiment as a great success. 'I think Bryn is absolutely brilliant
out there. He's very organised and keeps the place looking good.' At
Christmas there was proof positive that, in return, he is held in affection
by staff and customers alike. Many regulars brought him cards and presents.
'They really enjoy working with him. Everybody likes him,' said Kay.
John Major, the prime minister, will tonight address a reception launching
an Employers Agenda on Disability - aimed at making disabled employees less
of the exception and more of the rule. The initiative is being launched by
the Employers' Forum on Disability - itself an unusual entity. It is
strictly an organisation of employers which has as its aim improving the job
prospects of people with disabilities by making it easier for companies to
recruit and develop them. Employers are normally encouraged by charities or
government to hire the disabled; they are not exactly known for promoting
such recruitment themselves.
And no-one is pretending it is an easy task. According to the latest
government statistics, there are 6m adults with disabilities in Britain,
representing 14.2 per cent of the population. Of these, 2.4m are of working
age. But only 36 per cent of disabled men and 31 per cent of disabled women
work.
The law requires that organisations with more than 20 staff must employ
registered disabled people at the level of 3 per cent of their workforce.
Only 22 per cent of employers, in fact, meet that quota.
Twenty-one top-rank, blue chip companies will today announce that they have
agreed to adopt the 10-point agenda calculated to promote the recognition,
recruitment and career development of people with disabilities. A drop in
the ocean? More, perhaps, a wave. The effect of placing one person in one
job is not to be dismissed.
Rena Zdaniewicz, a paraplegic since a car accident 11 years ago, bucked the
trend at London Weekend Television by becoming a video editor - not only as
a disabled person, but as the first woman in that department.
'LWT had just started its equal opportunities policy when I joined, and, as
I became a success, it was very good for them and excellent for me because I
never thought I would be given the chance to edit because of being in a
wheelchair.
'In fact, it's been a great success. When you edit, you're sitting down all
day in a chair on wheels. As a wheelchair user, it's pretty ideal for me.'
LWT is involved with several associations that train disabled people for
employment and each year takes on people for work experience. But there is
still more to be done, says Zdaniewicz. 'LWT has three or four people who
are disabled out of about 600 employees. However, there were none.'
Chris Van-Hilton, aged 38, suffers from an acute form of arthritis which
severely restricts his mobility. It came out of the blue when he was 29 and
driving a lorry for a living.
He retrained, taking computer studies courses and is now a computer analyst.
Helped by Workable, which specialises in the employment of people with
disabilities, Van-Hilton was taken on for a one-year placement by Arco, the
chemical manufacturer, as an end-user computer analyst. The placement
finishes at the end of this week and Van-Hilton is keen to find a permanent
position.
'I think it has proved to Arco that to take someone with a disability does
not mean it will be a problem. I hope this would encourage other companies
not to be afraid to employ people with disabilities.'
Susan Weaver, Arco's personnel officer, said the placement was a success,
because it both provided Van-Hilton with a year's work experience and
increased the company's disability awareness.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mowlam opens attack on regulation
of Taurus - Financial Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR hit out last night at the government's handling of the financial
services sector, as the Commons discussed new regulations governing stock
exchange transactions.
The regulations, under the Companies Act 1989, are intended to provide the
legal underpinning for Taurus, the London Stock Exchange's electronic
transfer system which is expected to come onstream in May 1993. Addressing a
near-deserted chamber, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour City and corporate affairs
spokeswoman, attacked the government on three counts.
First, its strategy was inconsistent in underpricing privatisation issues to
attract small investors while seeking to install a transfer system that
would favour large transactions.
Second, by setting up a parallel regulatory regime for Taurus, it was
'courting trouble for the future' by countenancing self-regulation without
accountability to an outside authority.
Third, compensation fund arrangements were not 'properly structured.' By
keeping Taurus outside the scope of the Investors' Compensation Scheme, the
government was 'forgoing the opportunity to draw on a wider pool of
contributors.'
However, Ms Mowlam gave a 'guarded welcome' to the regulations. Mr John
Redwood, corporate affairs minister, said it was now up to the stock
exchange to develop a system.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM insists recovery is under way -
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY is already under way in many sectors of the economy, Mr John Major,
the prime minister, claimed in the Commons yesterday, refusing to be
downcast by the findings of the latest Confederation of British Industry
survey.
During prime minister's question time, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal
Democrat leader, recalled a New Year's Day BBC broadcast in which the prime
minister stated: 'In retrospect we will look back and say that economic
recovery has already started.'
Mr Ashdown called for less time 'talking up false economic dawns' and more
time taking action to secure genuine economic recovery.
Mr Major insisted: 'When we look back at the present time it will be
perfectly clear that in many sectors of the economy the recovery has indeed
started.'
Both the prime minister and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, were accused
by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, of misleading the
country over the extent of the recession, and of failing to take recovery
measures.

FT  29 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: British court cannot stop suspension of
Channel tunnel work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL TUNNEL GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER v BALFOUR BEATTY CONSTRUCTION LTD AND
OTHERS
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Neill, Lord Justice Woolf and Lord Justice
Staughton): January 22 1992
THE HIGH Court has no power under the Arbitration Acts to grant an interim
injunction in relation to a non-domestic arbitration, and will stay
proceedings though preliminary steps towards arbitration have not yet been
taken.  Accordingly, Channel tunnel employers seeking to restrain
contractors from suspending work, cannot obtain an injunction in the UK, but
must apply in Brussels which, as the agreed place of arbitration, is the
place with which the arbitration has its closest connection.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the defendant
contractors, Balfour Beatty Construction and others (TML), from Mr Justice
Evans's decision that on their undertaking that they would not suspend work
without giving the plaintiff employers, Channel Tunnel Group Ltd and France
Manche SA (Eurotunnel), 14 days' notice, he would not make an interim order
restraining them from doing so; and allowing an appeal from his decision not
to stay the action in favour of arbitration.
LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON said that Eurotunnel was the employer under a
contract to build the Channel tunnel. A consortium known as Trans Manche
Link or TML, was the contractor.
On October 3 1991, TML wrote to Eurotunnel stating that unless certain
conditions were met by October 7, it would suspend work on the tunnel
cooling system.
Eurotunnel issued a writ against TML claiming an injunction restraining it
from suspending work.
Mr Justice Evans decided that, on TML's undertaking that it would not
suspend work without 14 days' notice, he would make no order.
TML appealed. It complained that the judge was prepared to grant a mandatory
injunction requiring it to continue work, and only refrained from doing so
because an undertaking was offered.
The judge also dismissed an application by TML that the action be stayed in
favour of arbitration. TML appealed.
Clause 67 of the contract provided that any dispute should first be referred
to a panel of independent experts. The parties agreed to give effect to the
panel's unanimous decisions until revised by arbitration under International
Chamber of Commerce rules.
It was agreed that 'the seat of such arbitration shall be Brussels'.
Under clause 68 the contract was to be governed by principles common to both
English law and French law, and in the absence of common principles, by
general principles of international trade law.
Since both Eurotunnel and TML were partly French and partly English, his
Lordship wondered why they did not choose either English or French law - and
why they chose Brussels as the seat of arbitration. He suspected the hybrid
system would lead to a long and expensive dispute.
There was a dispute as to the proper price to be paid by Eurotunnel for the
cooling system. TML proposed Pounds 133.84m. Eurotunnel proposed Pounds
86.93m.
Also, TML said Eurotunnel was in breach of contract by abandoning the agreed
basis for interim funding of work. It maintained it was entitled to suspend
work (although it had not yet done so) by reason of those breaches.
There was no English law doctrine that if one party to a contract was in
serious breach the other might suspend performance, keeping the contract
alive.
In the hybrid system of law governing the contract, however, it was not
disputed that some such doctrine existed. It was called l'exception
d'inexecution or exceptio non adimpleti contractus.
The judge accepted there were matters in dispute which it would be the
arbitrators' task to decide if and when they were asked to do so.
He held that a stay should be refused because the time for arbitration had
not arrived: there had not yet been a reference to the panel.
Many types of contract provided for some preliminary step to be taken before
arbitration. That did not entitle a party to disregard arbitration procedure
and start an action at law just because the preliminary step had not been
taken.
TML was entitled to a stay if there was a dispute 'with regard to the matter
agreed to be heard'. It was not shown readily and beyond doubt that TML had
no right to suspend work or that Eurotunnel was right in its contentions.
Accordingly, the action would be stayed.
But that did not conclude the question whether there should be an
injunction.
By section 12(6) of the Arbitration Act 1950, the High Court had 'for the
purpose of and in relation to a reference, the same power of making orders
in respect of . . . (h) interim injunctions . . . as it has for the purpose
of and in relation to an action or matter in the High Court'.
That power could be exercised before there had been any request for
arbitration or appointment of arbitrators, provided the applicant intended
to take the dispute to arbitration in due course. The court's power in such
a case would be exercised 'for the purpose of and in relation to a
reference'.
Some of the parties were not English but French, and they had all agreed to
arbitrate in Brussels. The court was therefore not concerned with a domestic
arbitration agreement (see section 1(4) Arbitration Act 1975).
The crucial point on the jurisdiction issue was whether an English court had
power to grant an injunction where arbitration was to take place abroad, and
if so whether the power should be exercised.
It was often said that UK statutes had no application to things which
happened abroad.
One had to ascertain the connecting factor prescribed by Conflict of Laws
rules, in order to find which country's laws were to be applied.
The connecting factor for application of section 12(6)(h) to a case
containing a foreign element was the place the parties had chosen as the
seat of arbitration. If that was in England or Wales, English courts had
jurisdiction; if not, they had none.
It followed that the English court had no jurisdiction under section
12(6)(h) in the present case, since the seat of arbitration was Brussels.
Express choice of English law as the curial law did not confer jurisdiction
under section 12(6)(h) if the arbitration had a foreign seat; nor would a
choice of foreign law have taken away jurisdiction if the seat of the
arbitration was in England.
Non-availability of section 12(6)(h) was the first of three reasons why an
injunction should not be granted under the more general power to grant an
injunction conferred by section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981.
The second reason lay in section 25 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments
Act 1982, under which the High Court's power to grant interim relief might
be extended by Order in Council to arbitration proceedings held abroad.
No such Order in Council had yet been made. It would not be appropriate to
grant relief.
Third, there were dicta which supported the view that an English court had
no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction when a stay was mandatory
under section 1 of the 1975 Act (see Nissan (UK) v Nissan Motor Co, CA July
31 1991).
Whether or not there was jurisdiction, an interim injunction should not be
granted under section 37 when the parties had agreed to arbitration in some
place outside England and Wales and there was an arbitrable dispute.
Mr Justice Evans would have been wrong to grant an injunction if TLM had not
offered the undertaking. It was to Brussels courts that application must be
made, if it was their practice to grant an injunction in such a case.
The application for a stay was granted, and TML would be released from its
undertaking if it asked to be released. An injunction would not be granted.
Their Lordships agreed.
For Eurotunnel: John Dyson QC, Mark Howard and Vivian Ramsey (Freshfields).
For TML: Bernard Rix QC and Andrew White (Masons).

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major panicked into concession,
Labour claims - Value Added Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR claimed last night it had succeeded in 'panicking' Mr John Major into
ruling out any future increase in value added tax after charging that the
government would lift the tax to 22 per cent to fund income tax cuts.
Party officials said that the prime minister was forced to abandon a
well-used formula of saying that there were 'no plans' to raise the tax
after close questioning from Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, at question
time.
While other senior ministers had stuck closely to the agreed wording
throughout the day, Mr Major was compelled to say 'there will be no VAT
increase', Labour claimed.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, cited a later BBC
interview with Mr Douglas Hurd as evidence that Mr Major had blundered. He
pointed out that the foreign secretary had qualified the prime minister's
comments by saying they did not mean there would be no change in VAT 'until
kingdom come'.
Mr Cunningham said: 'The confusion reveals the dishonesty at the core of the
government's policy on VAT.'
The exchanges came after Labour had launched an 11-page dossier detailing
past Tory VAT increases and a billboard campaign depicting Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, in a mask as 'Vatman'.
In an effort to have the last word in current skirmishing on taxes and
spending, Labour is also expected to use a party political broadcast
tomorrow to level its VAT claim in reply to last week's Tory broadcast on
alleged Opposition plans for large tax rises.
Labour's broadside met with a swift rebuttal when Mr Chris Patten,
Conservative party chairman, dismissed it as a 'smear' and a 'scare story'.
But evidence that the Labour leader's demands for a definitive statement on
VAT from the prime minister had drawn blood came when Downing Street sought
to expand on Mr John Major's denial at question time in the Commons of any
'plans', either before or after a general election, for tax increases.
Earlier, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, used a press conference to charge
that past Tory pledges not to tamper with child benefit or to 'double' VAT
had rested on carefully worded texts.
To emphasise the point, he circulated a Conservative press statement from
April 1979 when Sir Geoffrey Howe, then shadow chancellor, had claimed the
Tories had 'absolutely no intention' of doubling VAT, then 8 per cent.
However, within two months the new Conservative government had increased the
tax by just under double to 15 per cent. Pointing out that indirect taxation
falls most heavily on the poor, Mr Smith said that while 25m people pay
income tax, 45m pay VAT.
The Liberal Democrats yesterday endorsed Labour's charges against the
Tories, but pointed out that Mr Smith had not opposed the 2.5 per cent VAT
increase introduced last year to reduce poll tax bills.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Local authorities warn on
legislation - Poll Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS came under renewed pressure yesterday to legislate more urgently
to end the confusion about the use of computer evidence in poll tax
non-payment cases in magistrates' courts.
In meetings with ministers and officials, local-authority association
representatives warned the government of the problems that would arise from
the decision to deal with the issue in the council tax bill, which is
expected to become law in early March.
Labour's local-government spokesmen, Mr Bryan Gould and Mr David Blunkett,
repeated Labour's offer to co-operate with an emergency bill to close the
loophole so it could pass through the Commons on a single day.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, Mr Gould
said councils would not be able to proceed with effective enforcement
procedures until the council tax bill had become law, and said authorities
might be flooded with legal challenges to the liability orders that have
already been issued.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local-government minister, said that the arrival of
the summonses was the most important element in getting people to pay the
poll tax, and there was nothing to stop councils issuing summonses, even if
they decided not to take cases to court before the computer evidence
question was clarified.
He added that altering the law on civil evidence through regulations would
have saved perhaps only a couple of weeks, as changes to regulations would
have to be followed by guidance to the courts.
It would, he asserted, have been 'very odd' to take a new and separate bill
to deal just with computer evidence in poll tax cases.
In response to concern about how poll tax collection difficulties would
apply also to the collection of the business rate, where individual amounts
owed were much greater, the local-authority associations received a
commitment from Department of the Environment officials that developments
would be monitored.
The government's proposed change which will ensure that computer evidence
can be used will apply only to poll tax, business rates and - in future -
council tax non-payment cases.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wakeham wins pledge over
profitability - British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has agreed with the government to speed up its withdrawal from
loss-making activities and to provide more scope for private-sector coal
production.
Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, told the Commons last night that Mr Neil
Clarke, chairman of British Coal, had accepted that the corporation's
overall objective must be to develop a mining business that achieved
'sustainable profitability'. British Coal would work within the government's
financial framework, notably the corporation's external financing limit and
the required rate of investment return of at least 8 per cent in real terms.
Mr Wakeham's announcement will support the view that the government is
working to knock the organisation into shape for privatisation shortly after
the election.
Earlier this month Mr Clarke asked Mr Malcolm Edwards, the corporation's
commercial director and a firm supporter of a British coal industry, to
leave. The move, which was criticised by MPs, was followed by the
announcement that more than 1,000 jobs would go at four pits in West
Yorkshire.
The agreement of profit objectives is no surprise, given that the
much-publicised report on British Coal by NM Rothschild, the government's
advisers on privatisation of the company, is designed to determine which
parts of British Coal are profitable enough for sale to the public.
Making the company as profitable as possible has always been a government
objective and Mr Clarke has made clear he views this as his task.
Mr Wakeham said British Coal should also further review its policies on
licensing both deep mines and opencast operations to enable the expansion of
competitive private-sector coal production.

THE TWO main parties took the Citizen's Charter campaign into the debate on
local-government services yesterday, as each claimed the monopoly on
effective measures to provide quality in council services, Alison Smith
writes.
The claims came as ministers emphasised that the government had taken no
final decisions on how compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) should be
extended to local-authority white-collar services such as architecture.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local-government minister, said that although the
government had suggested a 'double envelope' tendering process in the
consultation paper published last November, it was looking to professional
bodies to make suggestions on devising a system.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local-government spokesman, said that the
government's opposition to proposed Labour changes to the bill, such as
those which would enable councils to introduce customer contracts, exposed
its stance as 'hollow rhetoric'.

The measure - the King's Cross Railways Bill - had become bogged down in

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Privatisation to proceed, says
Rifkind - Tees &amp; Hartlepool Port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the transport secretary, yesterday announced that the
privatisation of the port of Tees &amp; Hartlepool would proceed as planned in
spite of controversy over the way the port's sale had been conducted.
This means that Britain's second biggest port seems set to be bought for
Pounds 180m by Teesside Holdings, a consortium led by Powell Duffryn, the
industrial group.
The last obstacle to the sale is the possibility of a judicial review which
had earlier been threatened by the management-employee buy-out team, one of
the losing bidders.
Mr John Hackney, the buy-out team's leader, yesterday appeared to be backing
away from the threat. He said that the team was seeking further legal advice
before making its decision.
Mr Rifkind, replying to a Commons written question, said he was satisfied
that the board of the Tees &amp; Hartlepool Authority had conducted the sale
'properly and fully' in accordance with the procedure agreed with his
department.
Mr Rifkind dismissed suggestions that an offer of seats on the board of
Teesside Holdings might have swayed the authority's board.
He also dismissed references to the record of companies associated with Mr
John Holloway and Humberside Holdings, members of the Teesside Holdings
consortium, saying he had found nothing in the evidence put before him which
would make it proper for him to withdraw his consent to the sale.
Maritime Transport Services, an unsuccessful bidder, warned that the outcome
might affect its involvement in bidding for other trust ports coming up for
privatisation. Mr Geoffrey Parker, chairman, said: 'We put in the best bid,
but failed to win.
'The decision is very hard to understand, but we accept the secretary of
state believes it is right,' he said.
'In the absence of any clear explanation, it makes us question our
involvement in future trust port bids.'
Mr Bill Andrews, chairman of Teesside Holdings and chief executive of Powell
Duffryn, said he was delighted with the decision.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Half of Scots support independence,
poll shows - Break with the Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG SURGE in support for Scottish independence emerged last night in an
opinion poll showing 50 per cent of Scots now back a full break with the
Crown - the first time that half the population has indicated a readiness to
end the Union.
The new figures demonstrate a drop from 41 per cent to 27 per cent since
September last year in those favouring a limited devolution of powers from
parliament and a sharp rise from 27 per cent to 50 per cent in those backing
independence.
According to the poll for ITN and The Scotsman newspaper, compiled from a
sample of 1,026 by ICM last week, those backing the status quo remained
constant at 19 per cent. The findings were welcomed by the Scottish National
Party last night. Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said the call for
independence was becoming 'irresistible'.
He added: 'A clear majority of Scots now recognise that only independence
will guarantee a prosperous future for our nation as an equal partner in the
European Community - as shown by a straight switch from second-class
devolution to first-class independence in Europe.'
The figures also show that backing for the SNP - the only supporters of full
independence - has risen by just seven points to 26 per cent, substantially
less than the headline numbers might suggest. Backing for Labour, which
advocates devolved powers to Edinburgh, has dropped two points to 41 per
cent with the Tories showing a similar fall to 23 per cent.
The outcome, none the less, is a further blow to the Conservatives who are
now believed to be ready to reconsider their opposition to any form of
Scottish devolution once the coming general election is over.
After the Kincardine and Deeside by-election last year, the Tories have
dropped to the third largest party in Scotland with just nine seats.
An independent analyst said last night that the poll suggests only one Tory
seat - Dumfries - can now be regarded as genuinely 'safe'.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tecs' value for money to be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAIRMEN of Training and Enterprise Councils are to carry out a
value-for-money review of all training programmes administered by the 82
Tecs.
The review was suggested by members of G10, the committee which represents
Tec chairmen, at a meeting yesterday with Mr Michael Howard, the employment
secretary.
Chief executives of the Tecs had asked their chairmen to raise their
concerns over the budget proposals, which include more training for roughly
the same amount of money as last year.
Some Tecs have said this meant they could not meet the government's
guarantee of a training place for all young people who wanted one.
Tecs have complained that their Business Plans - which cover areas such as
help for small businesses - cannot be met because of government negotiators
concentrating on training in their financial allocations.
Mr Howard said that in future operating surpluses made on Tec programmes
could be used for any purpose in the Business Plan.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Government seeks support on nurses'
pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Health is asking the independent review body on nurses'
pay to endorse 'broad objectives' on performance pay for nurses which it
hopes to implement next year.
The objectives are set out in a confidential paper for the review body this
year. They include freezing existing allowances such as London weighting and
asking the review body to establish 'target average percentage pay
increases'. A further objective covers the use of the money needed to meet
those increases. The review body would be expected to recommend the
proportion to be used on increasing pay for all nurses, and the proportion
to be available for performance pay.
The Department of Health stresses that 'improved performance or productivity
should not mean an automatic increase in the overall pay bill.' It adds:
'Money which might otherwise be used to enhance centrally determined
allowances and other payments could be used to better effect to reward
performance.'
The department gives little detail about how performance pay would be
calculated, beyond saying that both individual and group performance pay
could be used. Nursing union officials believe that the department is
leaning towards the unions' preferred option of group pay. 'Much work on
performance measurement systems in nursing is going on in the NHS at
present, but their use and objectives may be varied,' says the document.
However the department admits: 'We do not underestimate the skills which
local managers will need to sharpen or in some cases acquire if a flexible
pay package is to operate successfully.'
The proposals may have some effect on this year's offer from the pay review
body, which is expected to report next week, as the department is asking
that there be no increase in allowances this year. That will leave more room
for the department to manoeuvre on performance allowances in the future.
The main nursing unions remain suspicious of performance pay, although they
are prepard to discuss it with the department. Some managers and ancillary
workers in the NHS already have an element of performance pay.
Ms Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
said she was opposed in principle to performance pay. 'You can reward people
for things like punctuality but it is very difficult to introduce
performance indicators into nursing,' she said.
An RCN paper in response to the department says that it confuses the
flexibility needed to deal with local labour-market problems, such as those
encountered in London and the south-east, and performance pay. It says that
allowing the body to decide how much should be allocated for performance
would go beyond its present remit.
Ms Judith Carter, nursing national officer of the health union Cohse, said
there was no real evidence that performance pay improves performance. She
could not agree to nurses' pay in general being held down to allow room for
performance pay. 'The unions will be keeping a close watch on how the
department proposes to measure quality of care,' she said.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Attempt to block AEU merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to block the merger of the AEU engineering union and the EETPU
electricians' union on the terms currently proposed has been launched by two
AEU members, Chris Tighe writes.
Mr George Arnold and Mr Len Edmondson, both retired AEU national executive
members, fear the union's election of officials and traditions of
affiliation to the Trades Union Congress may be undermined by a merger.
Leaders of the AEU and EETPU say that, if the merger is approved in the
ballot, a further vote will be held within a year on whether the combined
union should affiliate to the TUC.
With the support of some branch officials in the north-east, where the AEU
is strongly represented, Mr Arnold and Mr Edmondson held a meeting of
members last night in Gateshead to urge them to vote against the merger.
Mr Arnold, a former chairman of the TUC's northern area, said yesterday that
they were not against the principle of the merger, but were concerned about
the plan not to ballot members on TUC affiliation until after the merger.
'As far as we're concerned, the rules of our union say we should be in the
TUC,' said Mr Arnold. 'I believe in one union for the engineering industry,
but I also believe in one trade union organisation for the country.'
Mr Arnold believes the EETPU, expelled from the TUC in 1988 for failing to
obey a ruling to withdraw from single-union deals, should seek to resume
affiliation before any amalgamation. Ideally he would like the vote
postponed, but a 'no' vote would force reconsideration of the issue.
Many union members, he said, shared his concern at the haste with which the
merger was being pursued.
In spite of the opposition, the vote in the merger ballot is expected to be
decisively in favour. Voting begins next week, with the result expected in
early March.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Clarke starts consultation on teacher
training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the education secretary, yesterday launched a
consultation document on his plans to reform teacher training, making it
more school-based.
The government wants to move graduate trainee teachers out of colleges and
into schools. Under the scheme, secondary schools will be invited to bid to
become approved teacher-training institutions, and graduates training to
teach at secondary level will be obliged to spend at least 80 per cent of
their courses in schools.
Resources for teacher-training will move from colleges to schools, and
criteria for courses will focus mainly on teaching practice - as opposed to
theory - which students will be expected to have acquired by the end of
their one-year post-graduate certificate of education course.
Mr Clarke's Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education will consult
schools and colleges on the proposals for two months but, unless there is a
change of government in the interim, courses conforming to the new
regulations will start in September, and all colleges will be obliged to
follow them by 1994.
The four-year Bachelor of Education degree is unaffected by yesterday's
announcement, but Mr Clarke emphasised his desire to reduce the length of
the course and increase its emphasis on teaching skills.
Mr Andrew Smith, Labour's teacher-training spokesman, emphasised the
'enormous practical problems for schools in making this work, which the
government has yet to address'.
The plans envisage schools bidding to take about 10 trainees each.
Performance indicators - such as exam results, staying-on rates and truancy
levels - will be used to select schools, and students will train in more
than one school.
Independent schools will be eligible to join the scheme. Mr Clarke said
graduate trainees will be expected to 'experience schools within a variety
of settings'.
Students will be required to satisfy at least 20 tests before being declared
'professionally competent'. These will include proving they can motivate and
interest pupils, set demanding targets, maintain discipline, and use a mix
of teaching methods appropriate to the age, ability and attainment of
pupils.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): FT moves to end dispute over RSI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL Times management yesterday moved to end a dispute with the
National Union of Journalists over journalists suffering from repetitive
strain injury (RSI).
The newspaper's chapel (union branch) has voted for strike action over
management plans to consider the compulsory retirement on ill-health grounds
of nine long-term RSI sufferers. The condition, which mainly affects arms
and hands, is being increasingly associated with computer keyboard work.
The latest offer, described by the management as 'reasonable and equitable'
and 'non-negotiable', includes an ill-health pension and a lump-sum payment
equivalent to at least 12 months' salary. Those who make a full recovery
will also get jobs back 'when suitable vacancies arise, subject to certain
conditions,' said the FT.
The chapel is due to meet today to consider the revised offer. Mr Alan Pike,
father (convener) of the chapel, said: 'The package is obviously better than
the management's original attempt to force people to leave on pensions
alone.' Meanwhile, the threat of industrial action remained, he said.
According to the company, individual sufferers could receive between Pounds
68,360 and Pounds 135,448 when cash sums from the pension scheme were
included.
The union said it was concerned that future pension payments were not
guaranteed and that much of the money the company said was on offer
consisted of individuals' pension or notice entitlements.
The FT said it had spent more than Pounds 1.4m trying to tackle RSI.

<TEXT>
with the possibility of more than 300,000 job losses by the end of the
decade - is outlined in a report due to be unveiled by the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament tomorrow, David White writes.
The report by Mr John Love-ring of Bristol University's School of Advanced
Urban Studies was commissioned by CND.
Reductions under the government's Options for Change review suggest about
100,000 job losses by 1995 according to the report, which puts current
defence industry employment at 600,000.
But it says the decline for the whole of the 1990s is likely to be much
steeper. It cites some 30,000 job cuts announced since 1990 and predicts
that employees in production, assembly and administration will be the
hardest hit.
Mr Lovering calls for savings from the defence budget to be used to finance
expansion in alternative markets. He also wants to see the launch of EC
policies to redirect resources. His report says the Labour party's proposals
for a defence diversification agency are 'inadequate'.

<TEXT>
WESTERN Isles Council, which lost Pounds 23m with the closure of Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, was in disarray yesterday after Mr Donald
Macleod, the convener (chairman), appeared to suggest that islanders should
not pay the poll tax which the council has increased by 370 per cent, James
Buxton writes.
Mr Macleod told BBC Radio yesterday that he had not favoured imposing the
losses from BCCI on poll-tax payers. Asked if he thought people ought to pay
the increased tax, he replied: 'I don't think so.'
Later he said he did not support non-payment and blamed his statement on
confusion caused by a bad telephone line.
Mr Angus Graham, another councillor, said Mr Macleod should resign because
of his statements. He said: 'He doesn't know what he's saying. I just think
that the best thing that could happen now would be for Councillor Macleod to
step down.'
The council voted on Monday to raise its poll tax from Pounds 26 to Pounds
122. Of that, Pounds 35 is to cover the cost of extra borrowing to replace
the BCCI loss.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Sea safety warning as losses rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFETY AT sea has seriously declined, according to figures released
yesterday by the Institute of London Underwriters, an association
representing marine and aviation insurance companies.
It described the upward trend in shipping casualties as 'ominous and
disconcerting' and said the number of ships of more than 500 tonnes gross
weight lost at sea was 182 last year - 30 per cent more than in 1990.
The loss of 1,708,464 tonnes of shipping - an increase of more than 30 per
cent on 1990 and the highest total for more than 10 years - cost insurers
Pounds 750m. Insurers are worried by the decline in the safety of tankers
and particularly of bulk carriers which carry commodities such as iron ore.
The institute said: 'The losses of bulk carriers, often in unexplained
circumstances and with considerable loss of life, continued in an alarming
manner; increasingly the evidence is pointing to structural failure as the
main culprit.'
The institute blamed the losses on the ageing of the world's fleet and
declining standards of maintenance as a result of cost-cutting.
Mr Roger Nixon, a member of institute's committee, said: 'Ships are getting
older, and the older they get the more easily they succumb to bad weather.'
He also pointed to changes in ownership patterns as adversely affecting
safety standards. The number of family-owned shipping companies has fallen
and ties between shipowners and captains have weakened.
Ships registered in 'flags of convenience' territories such as Panama, where
safety standards are more relaxed, were also more vulnerable. Panama and
Cyprus together lost about a quarter of the total in terms of both tonnage
and numbers.
Claims (including reinsurance claims) paid by the ILU's member insurance
companies - all of which specialise in marine and aviation business -
amounted to Pounds 4.069bn in 1991, 49 per cent more than the Pounds 2.729bn
recorded last year.
Premiums (including reinsurance) paid increased by only 32 per cent from
Pounds 1.67bn to Pounds 12.21bn.
MEASURES to reduce the risk of ferry disasters such as the capsizing of the
Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 are taking too long to implement, the
National Audit Office says in a report published today, Richard Tomkins
writes. Its investigation of ship safety says recent Department of Transport
ferry inspections have found that on-board evacuation announcements are
often inaudible, fire doors are unmarked or will not shut, emergency signs
are unclear and insufficient lifejackets are provided at muster stations.
Ship Safety, National Audit Office, Commons Paper 186. HMSO. Pounds 7.10.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Tories trip up in EC funds game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-running dispute between the government and Brussels over EC aid for
Britain's depressed regions has suddenly escalated. Prime minister John
Major yesterday said the money should be released 'speedily' to help fund
regeneration. But if Bruce Millan, European commissioner for the regions,
makes good his threat to block the funds because of the argument over the
way the money is disbursed, it means Pounds 1bn of grants for roads, ports
and other infrastructure could be lost over the next 12 months. David
Gardner in Brussels reports on the disagreement.
THE government's efforts to portray the EC aid row as partisan interference
have the look of a political boomerang.
The European Commission has threatened to withhold cash to depressed British
regions because of the government's policy on local authority spending.
But the affair appears to be merely a case of enforcing rules on regional
aid agreed unanimously in February 1988 at a summit of EC heads of
government - including the former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
At that meeting the leaders agreed to double funds for laggard and
industrially stricken regions, but set legal conditions on how the money
could be spent.
At the heart of the dispute is whether the EC funds are additional to member
states' regional spending or whether governments, Britain's in particular,
are using them to reduce the cost of capital programmes and curb local
authority spending.
Commission dissatisfaction that the legal conditions are not being met has
put at risk some Pounds 1bn to which British regions trying to create new
jobs are entitled.
On top of the Ecu160m (Pounds 114.7m) for coalmining areas - the Rechar
funds - withheld last year, a further Ecu1.26bn earmarked for nine
high-unemployment areas from Merseyside to Strathclyde in 1992-93 may now be
blocked until the row is settled.
At the centre of the dispute is Mr Bruce Millan, Scottish secretary in the
last Labour government and now the self-effacing junior British commissioner
in charge of EC regional policy in Brussels.
At the weekend Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, accused Mr
Millan of 'ganging up' with the Labour party to embarrass the government
ahead of the election.
Yesterday in the Commons Mr Eric Forth, junior employment minister,
criticised Mr Millan over the blocking of the Rechar funds. 'It is not
helpful to the communities involved or to the Labour party that a former
Labour secretary of state should be coming up with the sort of unhelpful
arguments to prevent availability of the funds to help communities in
Britain,' he said.
What the Commission as a whole is questioning is whether the regional aid is
reaching the targeted areas.
Most EC regional aid goes to southern Europe and Ireland (including Northern
Ireland), areas with per capita incomes 25 per cent or more below the EC
average. Britain receives about 38 per cent of the smaller pot for regions
in industrial decline.
This money should co-finance projects which would not otherwise go ahead,
and should have, as the 1988 regulation states, 'a genuine additional impact
in the regions concerned'. Thus, the row is about what, in jargon, is called
'additionality'.
The Commission says that a proportion of EC aid to UK regions is leaking out
to other local authorities which are not eligible, because it all ends up in
a single Treasury pot. 'We can see the tunnel carrying the money into the
Treasury,' a senior official says, 'but we can't identify it coming out the
other side. Eligible regions do not get the benefit . . . worse still,
signing up obliges them to draw down spending in other sectors in order to
match our funds.'
The UK says it takes the EC money into account at a national level and the
amounts - at least nationally - are greater than they otherwise would have
been.
But when sharing out rigidly controlled spending permission levels among
local government, it decides on the basis of overall capital needs rather
than specific projects.
'The possible availability of grants from the ERDF (European Regional
Development Fund) is not generally considered,' Lord Caithness, a junior
Foreign Office minister, wrote last April.
Shortly afterwards, Mr Millan saw seven UK ministers and emerged unconvinced
that the problem was simply one of 'transparency'.
If it were, officials in Brussels argue, the UK would be able to demonstrate
that the money is reaching its agreed destination, whereas repeated
complaints to Brussels from British local authorities indicate it is not.
The problem has been given a new twist because of the recently announced job
losses in the Selby coalfields in the Yorkshire area, and at the Ravenscraig
steel plant in Scotland. Mr Millan has said these regions could get more
money, but only if the 'additionality' question is settled.
No other member state has got into this difficulty, but there is no evidence
to support the UK government's charge of discrimination. Mr Heseltine's
remark that Mr Millan himself, when in government, operated the system he
now criticises ignores the fact that the rules were changed - with the
consent of a Conservative government - in 1988.
Denmark, for instance, had a system of sharing local government spending
which also presented problems, but changed it to comply with the 1988 rules.
Greece, which made substantial spending cuts to qualify for an Ecu2.2bn
balance of payments loan from the Community, had to restore to its budget
all reductions in 'additionality' spending and find the cuts elsewhere.
Italy had Ecu60m to which it was entitled reallocated to France last year
because of inability, rather than refusal, to provide matching finance.
This last precedent is more ominous for the UK. Mr Millan has only said that
the Ecu1.4bn in dispute 'could all be in jeopardy'. But one senior official
said last week that 'there could come a moment when the Commission has to
decide whether to hold this money or reallocate it to other member states'.
Mr Heseltine himself appeared to acknowledge the dispute as politically
damaging in a letter to cabinet colleagues leaked last month by Mr Gordon
Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman. The letter described the
government's arrangements for dealing with EC regional aid as 'no longer
tenable'.
He added: 'We cannot afford such an 'own goal' in areas which are
politically important to us.'

The long-running dispute between the government and Brussels over EC aid for
Britain's depressed regions has suddenly escalated. Prime minister John
Major yesterday said the money should be released 'speedily' to help fund
regeneration. But if Bruce Millan, European commissioner for the regions,
makes good his threat to block the funds because of the argument over the
way the money is disbursed, it means Pounds 1bn of grants for roads, ports
and other infrastructure could be lost over the next 12 months. FT regional
correspondents look at schemes under threat.
MR Bruce Millan's threat to block grants to depressed British regions
represents an escalation in his campaign to force the government to agree
that the sums should be additional to existing funding.
So far Ecu160m (Pounds 114.7m) - for coal mining areas - has been stopped.
The Ecu1.26bn (Pounds 904m) in funds now being considered covers virtually
all of Britain's depressed industrial and rural areas.
Local authorities of different political persuasions have supported Mr
Millan in his stance against the government. The irony is that partly
because of this support they face the prospect that agreed grants will be
cut off - and they have little chance of gaining additional funds.
Mr Geoffrey Burgess, chief executive of Cornwall County Council - a hung
authority - has backed Mr Millan's stance.
As an example he points out that Cornwall wanted to build 2.5 miles of road
between Falmouth and Penryn at a cost of Pounds 10m. It was to receive a
grant of Pounds 2.78m from an EC structural fund, but the government said
this meant the county would therefore have to find just Pounds 7m to build
the road, so it cut the council's capital spending allowance.
'In other words,' says Mr Burgess, 'the government is using the EC grant to
reduce its capital outlay in the county.
'We feel that the EC grants should be extra to our capital programme. We
have 25 per cent unemployment in places here and we are the one of the
poorest counties in England.'
Cornwall qualifies for grants as an Objective 5b, or rural, area. Strictly
speaking it should benefit from the EC's agricultural guidance and guarantee
fund. This is the smallest of the structural fund pots.
In practice, money from the two large structural funds - the European
Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund - can be used. Even
so, the sums for Cornwall are small.
Most of the other areas affected by the row are designated Objective 2 -
areas of industrial decline. These are where the most of the Pounds 904m
would be spent.
In Scotland, which hopes to get Pounds 96m of the Pounds 904m that Mr Millan
is threatening to hold up, Pounds 12.9m has already been blocked from the
European Regional Development Fund under Rechar, the European Commission's
programme for former coal-mining areas. This has affected the regions of
Strathclyde, Lothian, Fife and Central
Strathclyde, which with 2.2m people includes nearly half the population of
Scotland, fears that it may not be able to relaunch its EC-funded integrated
development operation - due to end in December - because of the row over
additionality.
The regional council is hoping for about Pounds 50m from Brussels next year
to relaunch the series of infrastructure and business generation projects.
The question marks over aid are also worrying councils in north-west England
 -for instance St Helens, which has most of Lancashire's abandoned
collieries and wants to carry out Pounds 10m of work at disused pitheads
using Pounds 5m from Brussels.
Mr Dave Watts, deputy leader of Labour-controlled St Helens Borough Council,
says: 'It ought to be straightforward really, but the government has
complicated things beyond belief. We have no way of putting in our share of
the redevelopment costs unless we take it from other spending . . . Even if
we persuade the private sector to put up the money, government rules say it
has to count against our capital spending.'
He says that there is growing concern about the European Regional
Development Fund. This is worth Pounds 49m to the five Merseyside local
authorities, including St Helens, over the next four years. He adds: 'We are
all on tight budgets and will not be able to find our share of the spending
as things stand.'
Over the Pennines at Bradford in West Yorkshire, the city council needs the
Brussels money for flood-prevention work.
Bradford Beck bursts its banks on average once every 10 years and this
threat could be removed with nearly Pounds 20m of engineering works.
Brussels is willing to pay Pounds 6.5m - but the council fears that under
the government's additionality rules it would have to cut capital from
elsewhere.
Mr David Moss, the city's operations officer for integrated development
says: 'The recession means we have missed the boat.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / Bank managers' judgment attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK MANAGERS pay too much attention to narrow financial criteria and not
enough to factors such as management skills and technical knowledge when
assessing business proposals.
This was one of the conclusions of a survey of 30 managers in the West
Midlands carried out by researchers from Birmingham Polytechnic.
Presented with the same business proposal - a real plan for a company to
provide information technology services to quantity surveyors - half of the
managers turned it down while half were prepared to back it.
Bank managers gave disproportionate attention to the founders' ability to
provide security for a loan when assessing risk, the researchers said. They
concluded that managers were trained to be generalists and called for more
specialisation.
Most of the bank managers paid little attention to the business's plans to
recruit a director to handle information technology issues although this
would have been crucial to its success, the researchers said.
Reasons given for rejection included the fact that the venture was
undercapitalised, was too speculative, or was being launched at the wrong
time.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Building societies suffer Pounds 54m net outflow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIGURES RELEASED by the Building Societies Association yesterday suggest
that societies may face even tougher market conditions than expected during
the next few months.
The association's monthly figures show that there was a Pounds 54m net
outflow of savings from societies last month, compared with Pounds 49m in
November.
Two successive months of savings outflows are extremely unusual, and they
suggest that societies may find it more difficult than they expected to cut
their savings rates in the wake of the 0.55 percentage-point cut in their
standard mortgage interest rates 10 days ago.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
stockbrokers, said: 'These results show that building societies may have to
rely heavily on wholesale funds from the commercial money markets this
year.'
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, said the pattern of
building society savings in December had been distorted by the BT flotation
at the beginning of the month.
Total mortgage lending by the societies last month was 14.8 per cent lower
at Pounds 3.22bn than it had been in November. Net new loans - agreed but
not yet paid out - fell even more sharply, dropping from Pounds 3.04bn in
November to Pounds 2.53bn.
'The figures suggest that lending will be subdued in the next few months,'
Mr Boleat said. Mortgage lending by Britain's nine leading banking groups
rose by Pounds 3.6bn in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a
Pounds 4.5bn increase in the third. The British Bankers' Association said
the fall reflected the depressed state of the housing market.
The number of new mortgages approved fell from 76,100 in the third quarter
to 64,400 in the fourth.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Air France to halt flights from Stansted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE yesterday dealt a blow to London's Stansted airport by suspending
all its flights from the new airport complex from March 30, while boosting
London City Airport by announcing expanded services from the much smaller
Dockland's airport.
Air France will introduce a new aircraft type to London City by operating
the ATR 42 turboprop regional aircraft on the Paris to Docklands service.
Crossair, the Swiss regional carrier, is also expected to announce soon the
start of regular services between Zurich and London City Airport using the
British Aerospace 146 regional jet.
The introduction of new aircraft to London City follows a recently completed
Pounds 7m extension of the airport's runway. The expansion is expected to
increase activity at the loss-making airport owned by the Mowlem
construction group.
Mr Bill Charnock, the airport's managing director, said the Air France
decision 'confirms our optimism in the future of the airport and is the
first of a number of announcements we expect from airlines offering new or
extended routes from our airport'.
Air France said it was rationalising its services to London's four airports
for its summer schedule starting March 30. Daily flights from Heathrow to
Paris and to Nice are being increased, Gatwick flights will serve only
regional destinations in France and not Paris, and all services from
Stansted will be suspended.
The suspension of the Stansted flights reflect the disappointing passenger
loads on these services, Air France said. The French airline was one of the
first big international carriers to operate from the new Pounds 400m
Stansted complex opened by BAA (formerly the British Airports Authority)
last year.
The decision is a setback for Stansted because the airport has been seeking
to attract big international carriers. Many carriers have been reluctant to
commit themselves until they see significant international traffic expansion
at Stansted.
The French national airline was also one of the first big carriers to
operate into London City Airport. But until now it was working in
partnership with Brymon Airways, the UK regional carrier, using de Havilland
Dash 7 turbo-props.
Air France will now operate its own services to London City. It said it
would schedule at least four daily return flights to Paris and possibly
seven.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Consensus seen on intangible assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTANGIBLE ASSETS such as brand names and patents are increasingly being
identified and valued, according to a report by Arthur Andersen, the
accountancy firm.
It suggests that there is growing consensus about how to value intangibles
and that such attempts are no more subjective than many other aspects of
valuation.
The research was sponsored by a number of companies which already place
values on their brand names.
Its findings stoke the debate about whether valuations of intangible assets
should be permitted in balance sheets - a controversial approach which has
been criticised by some users and regulators of accounts.
The Andersen report classifies intangible assets under four categories:
Brands including consumer goods brands, trademarks and corporate names.
Publishing rights such as book titles, copyright, and film libraries.
Intellectual property including patents, trade secrets, software and
blueprints. Licences including television franchises, landing slots for
airlines, import quotas and distribution rights.
It suggests that the most common approach to valuing intangible assets
attempts to quantify the value of cashflows or earnings attributable to
ownership of the asset.
The report argues that a 'considerable consensus' on valuation methods has
emerged over the past few years, and that earnings from intangibles can
often be identified and quantified effectively.
It says attempts to value intangibles 'involve a degree of subjectivity',
but stresses the uncertainties are no worse than in other areas, such as
valuing unquoted companies or pension funds.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE governor of the Mexican state of Tabasco has resigned after charges of
fraudulent municipal elections and growing unpopularity within his party.
Mr Salvador Neme Castillo becomes the third governor or governor-elect from
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) to resign since August.
He will be replaced by the current senator from Tabasco who, while also from
the governing party, is considered more conciliatory.
The resignation of Mr Neme Castillo - almost certainly at the approval or
behest of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari - is likely to send a strong
warning to sitting governors and aspirants that obviously fraudulent
elections or a weak and divided party will not be tolerated.
On January 12, in apparent recognition of the fraud and in response to a
20,000-strong demonstration by the opposition in Mexico City, the government
annulled the disputed elections and handed over the city of Cardenas to the
left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Clinton 'circus' turns spotlight on US media: Serious policy
issues are being ignored in the pursuit of a sex scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US newspapers and television stations have spent the last few months proudly
declaring that for this presidential election, at least, they wanted to
focus on issues.
This week they scuttled to redefine as an issue unsubstantiated allegations
of infidelity against Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early
front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination.
As a result, three weeks from the crucial New Hampshire primary, Mr
Clinton's alleged adultery with Ms Gennifer Flowers, a former Arkansas state
employee, has displaced unemployment, tax cuts and health care from the top
of the media's political agenda.
It has turned into what Mr AS Rosenthal of the New York Times newspaper
calls 'the print and TV sexual examination that is the monument to American
immaturity and prurience'.
High-minded journalists like Mr Ted Koppel, of ABC's Nightline news
programme, insisted they were not discussing the story, only the issue. But
the 'quality media' have for the most part contrived to have their cake and
eat it.
The Washington Post, for example, concluded in its editorial that Mr
Clinton, governor of one of the smallest and poorest states in the country,
had given answer enough and that it was time to get on with the campaign. It
backed this up with no fewer than seven other articles on the subject.
Cable News Network, meanwhile, declined to broadcast tape recordings
supposedly documenting Mr Clinton's love affair, on the grounds that they
had not been verified, but broadcast the equally unverified allegations in a
live press conference of Ms Flowers, who says she was the governor's lover
for 12 years.
The allegations will continue to be aired wherever Mr Clinton travels, for
at every campaign stop local newspaper and television reporters will ask him
the same question.
'Quality' news organisations in the US have not resolved many of the
problems in their relationship with tabloid journalism - which in the US
reaches heights of imagination undreamt of by the UK's Sun or Daily Mirror.
The Star, a US supermarket tabloid which paid for Ms Flowers' story, is
somewhat less bizarre than competitors such as the National Enquirer; it
retails more celebrity sex and miracle diets, and fewer rapes by Martians
and sightings of Elvis Presley.
Yet many upmarket journalists seem frightened of appearing less bold and
uncompromising than their tabloid competitors, worried that they might be
caught in a cozy conspiracy to hide the truth from their readers.
And they can repeat the Star's allegations with impunity, for the US's libel
laws make it almost impossible for a public figure to win a suit, even if
allegations against him or her are proved false.
Most of the top newspapers say that affairs long past are not germane to the
political campaign. Only if Mr Clinton lied or engaged in current and
flagrantly inappropriate conduct of the kind that drove Senator Gary Hart
from the election in 1987, would the allegations become relevant once again.
Yet almost all sent reporters to Arkansas months ago to check,
unsuccessfully, on rumours about these same affairs.
The effect on the political campaign may become clearer after the New
Hampshire primary next month, the first in this election season.
Many voters may agree with Mr David Broder, the Washington Post's political
columnist, that the Clinton circus represents 'the latest, but surely not
the last, step in the degradation of democracy by televised image-making'.
In this vast country, however, voters know so little about any of the
candidates that they may grasp at any straw to find out who they are voting
for.
Few candidates would trade places with Mr Clinton today, but he may console
himself with the thought that voters have now seen something of his
personality, even if they have not had a chance to examine his policies.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Palestinians snub Moscow Mideast talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS continued in Moscow last night to draw the Palestinians back into
Middle East peace talks after they boycotted the opening of the third and
multinational stage of the forum.
The Palestinians refused to attend following an argument with the US-Russian
co-sponsors over the representatives nominated by the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, regretted that the Palestinians had
stayed away but later hinted at a possible compromise that might enable
wider Palestinian participation.
The leader of the Palestinian delegation, Mr Faisal Husseini, announced the
boycott decision just moments before Mr Baker opened the conference. 'We
decided not to go because the Americans did not accept our formula,' Mr
Husseini said after meeting US and Russian officials.
Mr Baker did not mention the Palestinian boycott in his opening remarks. The
US official told delegates the meeting would send a powerful signal that
Arabs and Israelis were unequivocally committed to peace and reconciliation
and he proposed a number of confidence building measures aimed at reducing
regional tensions.
These included assistance with disarmament programmes and the establishment
of 'early warning' mechanisms to prevent conflict. He also mentioned
international assistance for refugees. Some 2m Palestinians are classified
as refugees.
The Moscow Forum has brought together 26 delegations, including those
representing the European Community, China, Turkey, Japan and Gulf and North
African Arab states, for discussions on wider Middle East issues such as
disarmament, economic development, water and the environment.
Syria and Lebanon have boycotted the Moscow talks, saying Israel has not
shown any willingness to negotiate 'land for peace' issues at the bilateral
sessions. The Palestinian withdrawal means that only Jordan and Egypt among
Israel's close neighbours are participating in Moscow.
Holding out the prospect of wider Palestinian participation in the
multilateral talks, Mr Baker said: 'We told the Palestinians we'd be
supportive of representation by diaspora Palestinians in working groups
where that representation was appropriate.'
Mr Yassir Abed Rabbo, a member of the PLO executive committee, said in
Moscow last night that Palestinians were anxious to participate but would
not compromise on the representation issues.
The PLO had insisted that Palestinians from Arab East Jerusalem and the
Palestinian diaspora be included in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation, but the US-Russian co-sponsors insisted the 'Madrid formula'
should apply to Palestinian representation in Moscow. In Middle East peace
talks in Madrid last October, representation was restricted to Palestinians
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip - Arab land occupied by Israel in the 1967
war.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Iran backpedals on economic reform: Political pressures are
forcing Rafsanjani to raise subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN'S attempts to control inflation and introduce a free market economy are
taking a step backwards with political considerations forcing the government
to double subsidies to ease the plight of the poor.
The draft budget, being debated in the majlis (parliament) for the new
Iranian year starting on March 21, raises spending on subsidies to 1,200bn
rials (Dollars 17bn at the official exchange rate of 70 rials to the dollar
but Dollars 857m at the free market rate of 1,400 rials).
The proposals run counter to IMF plans to liberalise the economy and have
brought the central bank governor to the brink of resignation. He says the
budget will boost inflation and result in chaos.
President Hashemi Rafsanjani has conceded that the 12 per cent of the
10,000bn rial budget which will go on subsidies is 'a notable share'.
Although nominally committed to reducing inflation, Mr Rafsanjani said,
'even though we took utmost care in all areas to reduce or limit current
expenditure to the level of inflation, in this case (subsidies), we were
forced to endure this problem for the sake of the vulnerable strata.'
The 'vulnerable strata' is the majority of Iran's 57.8m people living on
subsidised food. Subsidies on chicken and eggs were lifted last summer, and
the price of chicken shot up from 150 rials a kilo to 1,900 rials.
Last year saw incidents of unrest and rioting prompted by economic
discontent. The government tried to appease the rioters by promising to
raise the annual bonus for workers to the equivalent of three months' pay.
Another 'vulnerable' group is the country's 2m or so public sector employees
whose fixed incomes have made them one of the hardest hit in Iran's
inflationary economy. Many take second jobs to make ends meet. The budget
calls for large increases in their salaries, costing 850bn rials or 8.5 per
cent of the budget.
These two measures contradict Mr Rafsanjani's stated aims of eliminating
price controls and reducing inflation. It also goes against the
International Monetary Fund's guidelines on introducing a free market
economy by devaluing the rial through eliminating the country's three-tiered
exchange rate system.
Iran and the IMF have been talking for two years on rebuilding the economy.
One issue is the practice whereby dollars are sold to some ministries and
affiliated organisations at the highly overvalued official rate for the
import of 32 'basic' commodities. The artificially strong rate is criticised
for acting as an import subsidy leading to distortions in the economy. It
makes it impossible for the private sector, which has to use the free market
rate, to compete with the government.
The privileged rate also exacerbates political and economic corruption. Last
November, Mr Mohammad Hossein Adeli, the central bank governor and proponent
of stricter monetary policies, said one government-affiliated institution
was being prosecuted for selling dollars obtained from the government at 70
rials, for 200 rials.
He said the rate encouraged political favouritism: 'We should not
discriminate between the state sector and private sector, between those who
have political connections and those who have not, those powerful and those
powerless,' he told the Tehran daily Ressalat.
The second exchange rate, the 'competitive' rate of 600 rials to the dollar
is also used by ministries and their affiliates. Mr Adeli and Mr Mohsen
Nurbakhsh, the economics and finance minister, have said they want to unify
 -the official euphemism for devaluing the rial - the exchange rate by next
year.
They hope the rial will settle to a single level of 1,000 to the dollar, 400
below the third rate, known as the floating rate which hovers 30 rials below
the black market rate. Only 10 per cent of foreign exchange dealing is
conducted at the floating rate even though it is the most realistic.
Mr Adeli reportedly threatened to resign when the budget proposals, which he
termed 'political', were unveiled. He was harshly critical of its
inflationary aspects, particularly as inflation has doubled in the past year
from 9 to 18 per cent. Mr Adeli warned: 'If this plan is put into force, it
will only result in chaos.'
The goal of unifying exchange rates next year now seems hopelessly
unrealistic. Mr Rafsanjani has, for the meantime, rejected suggestions by Mr
Adeli to abolish the official exchange rate as the first step towards
unifying exchange rates.
Mr Rafsanjani recognised subsidised prices as 'a very serious problem' last
year but has not found a way of cushioning the blow to the poorest - the
'barefooted' - in whose name Ayatollah Khomeini's revolution was carried
out.
'Because for years we acted wrongly, we cannot deliver a shock all of a
sudden and say that it will immediately be the real prices,' he said.
With majlis elections due on April 10, Mr Rafsanjani is in no mood to
alienate voters or to risk further unrest. He hopes the election will
strengthen his support in the majlis at the expense of the radical faction,
which is critical of his foreign and economic policies.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Africa's economic success story encounters a darker chapter:
Thriving Botswana is facing harder times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER MORE than two decades of substantial growth, Botswana's economy is
having to adapt to harder times.
The diamond boom that boosted growth is levelling out, efforts to encourage
development of the non-mineral sectors of the economy face formidable
hurdles, and unemployment is rising.
Judged by yardsticks applied to the rest of the continent - or elsewhere for
that matter - Botswana continues to thrive. After 25 years of independence,
the country remains a stable multi-party democracy, with a hard currency and
GDP growth over the past two years of around 7 per cent.
But this figure is less striking when compared with the 13.5 per cent rate
in 1988-89, and the nearly 16 per cent annual average achieved between 1968
and 1978.
Diamond revenue, making up nearly 50 per cent of GDP and about 80 per cent
of export earnings, may have reached a plateau. Low prices are expected to
offset the recent expansion of Jwaneng diamond mine.
'Any growth in revenues from diamonds in the medium term will have to come
from increased values rather than increased volumes as in the past,' says Mr
Festus Mogae, the minister of finance.
The dominance of diamonds will be reduced when the Dollars 490m Sua Pan soda
ash plant, opened last year, reaches its capacity of 300,000 tons of soda
ash and 650,000 tons of salt annually. But this will not be until the
mid-90s, and most of the export receipts in the intervening years will be
used to repay loans.
Meanwhile the country's 1.3m population is growing at 3.5 per cent a year,
producing 25,000 new work-seekers a year.
Agricultural potential is limited in a country that is largely arid, while
there are increasing environmental problems caused in part by the country's
2.6m cattle herd.
Hence the warning in the National Development Plan for 1991-97 that the past
rate of economic development cannot be sustained.
Accumulated reserves, which reached Dollars 3.3bn in mid-1991, the
equivalent of around two years' imports, will cushion the belt-tightening
strategy outlined in the plan, the seventh since independence in 1966.
Nevertheless tougher times lie ahead.
What Mr Mogae calls a transition to 'more moderate and sustainable growth'
includes cuts of more than 40 per cent in development spending in the second
half of the plan period.
By reducing government spending on administration, nationalised industry and
parastatals, which together employ well over a third of the workforce, Mr
Mogae hopes to free enough funds to restore development spending to previous
levels - but not until 1997, when the next development plan will be in
place.
The impetus for growth in the coming years, say government officials, must
come from the non-mineral private sector.
In an attempt to stimulate the sector, the government has provided
incentives for would-be domestic and international investors in Botswana.
The Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) has been providing grants for new or
expanding businesses since 1982, establishing more than 20,000 jobs. The
incentive package offered to foreign companies in the export-processing-zone
mining town of Selebi-Phikwe includes a grant covering half the costs of
training citizens over the first five years.
It has so far attracted three textile companies, which have invested 10m
pula (Dollars 5.43m), and provided jobs for more than 1,600 people. The
scheme is expensive, with the Bank of Botswana estimating an eventual P18m
cost. But if it can survive competition from South Africa and boost
non-mineral exports, it will be worth the price, say officials.
Past efforts in job creation, however, have a mixed record. Many of the
smaller-scale projects using FAP resources have failed. Officials running
the programme blame 'general lack of business acumen, especially in the
areas of finance and marketing'. Low labour productivity and lack of local
managerial experience are recognised as serious obstacles to private-sector
expansion.
But private-sector ambitions must take into account the industrial dominance
of neighbouring South Africa.
Ultimately, Botswana's medium- to long-term prospects depend on political
stability in the region, and that rests on developments in South Africa.

A San Francisco federal court has upheld a secondary ban on third countries
re-exporting Mexican and Venezuelan tuna to the US, in another twist to the
row over dolphin-killing by Mexican tuna fishermen, Damian Fraser reports
from Mexico City. The federal court gave 27 countries until Friday to prove
they were not re-exporting Mexican or Venezuelan tuna, banned from the US.
Countries ignoring the order will be included in the embargo. The main
Mexican and Venezuelan 'tuna-launderers', San Francisco environmentalists
say, are Japan, Italy, Spain, France, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. US
law, upheld by a federal court last February, mandates an embargo on a
country's tuna exports if the fleet's average dolphin mortality rate is 25
per cent higher than the US's.

FT  29 JAN 92 / World Trade News: EBRD drops loan curbs on ex-Soviet
republics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is dropping
lending curbs on the former Soviet Union after economic reform pledges by
most of the new republics, Judy Dempsey reports.
The EBRD will now be able to exceed loans equivalent to an annual Ecus 36m
(Pounds 25.7m). This was supposed to match the former Soviet Union's annual
contribution, which was expected over five years to provide Dollars 200m to
the EBRD's subscribed capital, and would amount to one-third of the Soviet
Union's long-term commitment of Dollars 600m.
'But now that six republics (apart from the Baltic states) have applied to
join the EBRD, we had to revise our restrictions on lending,' an official
said yesterday. Russia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan were seeking membership.
EBRD lending curbs on Moscow, largely at the insistence of the US, the
biggest single shareholder, were for three years. Despite pressure from west
European governments to increase the ceiling, the US wanted the EBRD to
concentrate on lending to the fledgling private sector, rather than Soviet
state-run projects.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Thyssen chief calls for pay compromise

<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Germany's Thyssen group yesterday appealed for compromise in
deadlocked steel industry pay negotiations. A strike was 'unimaginable' in
the current business situation, Mr Heinz Kriwet told journalists.
Forecasting a further fall in group profits this year, and revealing a fresh
slump in the core steel business during the first quarter's trading, he said
he could 'imagine no limits to the possibilities' for a deal to be struck.
These could include more talks, or even mediation by 'an independent
person'.
Mr Kriwet, who said recently he would rather tolerate a strike than pay more
than 6 per cent, was responding to internal company reports and unofficial
union estimates that a ballot was swinging in favour of strike action.
Thyssen, Germany's steel-maker, employs about a third of the industry's
135,000-strong workforce.
The IG Metall union immediately rejected suggestions of mediation, and said
it would be prepared to talk only if the employers put forward a new offer.
'He knows the address,' a spokeswoman said.
Mr Kriwet had stressed that any further talks or mediation should be on the
basis of the employers' offer and the union claim on the table when talks
collapsed last week. 'They are not so far apart that agreement is no longer
possible,' he said.
The two sides' calculations differ, but both agree that there is at present
only one percentage point or less between offer and demand. Employers and
government fear that settling above 6 per cent in the steel industry will
lead to a flood of more expensive deals in other sectors.
Reviewing the group's prospects for the current year, which ends on
September 30, Mr Kriwet said a further fall in profits was 'highly likely'.
Although group turnover in the first quarter was up 8 per cent to DM9.2bn
(Pounds 3.2bn), the two steel businesses were still under pressure.

TURKEY'S new coalition government has concluded its first sizeable
privatisation, selling 51 per cent of a local gas company to Prima Gaz, the
publicly-listed French concern, for TL 350bn (Pounds 35.88m). Prima Gaz now
owns 100 per cent of Ipragas, a bottled gas producer, having already had a
49 per cent stake in the company.
Citibank the US bank advising Prima Gaz said the sale represented a clear
signal of the government's commitment to sell state assets. Mrs Tansu
Ciller,economics minister, says Turkey will press ahead with further sales.
The deal marks France's growing presence in Turkey's gas sector. Technigaz,
a subsidiary of the Bouygues Group, is already building a terminal for
Libyan gas near Istanbul, where SAE - another French concern - is installing
a city gas network. Officials say the French are keen to establish a
position before production from Iran, Qatar and the central Asian republics
comes on stream over the next decade.

<TEXT>
WESTERN industry - and governments if need be - should employ the former
Soviet Union's nuclear scientists, to prevent them being tempted into
dubious work in the third world, a senior US defence official said
yesterday.
These 'very capable' nuclear scientists 'ought to be a valuable economic
asset for commercial industry in western Europe or the US,' said the
official, who was in Brussels to brief Nato allies after 10 days of
US-Russian talks on dismantling nuclear weapons.
'It should not necessarily be the job of (western) governments to subsidise
the use of these scientists' talents, though it might come to that,' he
said.
However, he dismissed stories that there was already a nuclear brain, or
bomb, drain from the former Soviet Union. 'I know of no cases of
weapons-grade material leaving the former Soviet Union,' he said. Any
exports appeared to be of either depleted uranium, which is used in
conventional warheads, or minute quantities of plutonium, used to detect
alpha-radiation. 'Nor do I know of any (scientist) being approached to work
elsewhere or leaving.'
After the 24 talks in Moscow with the Russian general staff and the Atomic
Power Ministry the US official praised their sense of reponsibility in
proceeding with the dismantling of tactical nuclear weapons, promised by
former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last October and re-confirmed
since by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin.
Fears that Soviet nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands centre as
much, or more, on the 15,000-16,000 nuclear artillery shells, mines and
short-range missiles spread around the former Soviet Union, as on the more
tightly-held 11,000 strategic missiles. The US official said all of Russia's
fellow republics appeared to be 'responsible and supportive' in returning
the tactical weapons for storage and eventual dismantling.
The US has offered to help Moscow with a range of tasks, the official said.
These include help in 'providing secure transport of weapons from bases to
central storage inside Russia, disabling weapons before transport, providing
intermediate storage for weapons awaiting destruction, dismantling of
weapons, transport of disassembled components and long-term storage of
fissile plutonium and uranium.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / German money supply rises at rate of 9.5%: Soaring M3 figure
dashes hope for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BROAD money supply in Germany increased at an annual rate of 9.5 per cent in
the last three months of 1991, after a further sharp acceleration in
December, the Bundesbank announced yesterday.
The figures were cited yesterday as clear justification for the bank's move
in raising interest rates by a half percentage point last month, and suggest
there is little likelihood of any relaxation in its determination to bring
inflation in the economy under control.
The latest figures show that in December M3 money supply - the measure which
includes bank deposits of up to four years' term, and other savings accounts
as well as cash in circulation and current accounts - increased by 5.7 per
cent compared with the figure in December 1990, against 5.1 per cent in
November and 4.7 per cent in October.
The acceleration in the growth of money supply was fuelled primarily by the
expansion of credit from commercial banks to both enterprises and
individuals, the central bank figures show, with rises respectively of 12
and 14 per cent.
Over the last six months of the year, M3 money supply increased at an annual
rate of 8 per cent, and over the last three months, by 9.5 per cent,
according to Dr Otmar Issing, a member of the Bundesbank management board,
speaking in Bonn yesterday.
'In overall economic terms, everything is certainly not ideal,' he told a
conference on investing in Germany. The current inflation rate of over 4 per
cent was 'disturbingly high.'
'A central bank which is duty bound to preserve price stability cannot be
satisfied with that,' he added. 'Our task must be to protect the credibility
of monetary growth by bringing it back within the growth framework (of 3.5
to 5.5 per cent).'
The Bundesbank also had an international responsibility to preserve D-Mark
stability, he said. 'However unwelcome the consequences of a strict monetary
policy may be in one or another case. . . . the Bundesbank must maintain its
anchor role and take the necessary measures to preserve it.'
Monetary stability was an essential element in the attraction of Germany as
an investment destination, he said. But monetary policy alone could not make
it attractive. On the other hand, he underlined that longer-term capital
market interest rates actually fell in Germany after the Bundesbank raised
its discount and Lombard rates in December, a demonstration of trust in the
policy of monetary stability it represented. Dr Issing left his audience in
no doubt about the central bank's continuing worries about the high level of
public sector debt, arising from the state governments, and the Treuhand
privatisation agency in the east, as well as from central government.
'Regardless of the origin of state debt, we are running the risk of all the
charges suffered by other countries with unrestrained state debt: high
interest rates, excessive burdens on private investment capacity, and
restriction of the room for manoeuvre of financial policy,' he said.
It was now essential that there was a containment of public sector
consumption, dismantling of state subsidies, and to a much more radical
extent than hitherto, cutting back projects in the west of the country to
finance recovery in the east.
As for the current wage demands, there would be serious dangers for both
stability and economic growth if wage rises in both east and west continued
at the level of 1991. 'A complete change of thinking is needed,' he said.

GEORGIAN government forces yesterday seized Poti, one of the last
strongholds loyal to the republic's ousted president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia,
after a day of fighting in which at least six people died, Reuter reports.
Government troops met little resistance on moving into the Black Sea town.
Armoured vehicles rumbled along the streets as residents, mainly supporters
of Mr Gamsakhurdia, boarded up windows and remained indoors. The head of the
town's hospital and local officials said six people had been killed and at
least 20 others injured in fighting around a bridge to the north of the
town.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, elected by a landslide last May, fled to Armenia three
weeks ago after losing a bloody power struggle with the ruling Military
Council. He later returned to west Georgia, but his whereabouts have been
unknown for the past week.
The fall of Poti was another serious blow to his attempt to regain power. He
can now rely on support only in the port of Sukhumi to the north and the
town of Zugdidi to the east.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Third westerner may run east German state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEST German candidate, Mr Bernhard Vogel, former prime minister of the
Rhineland Palatinate and close confidant of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, seems
certain to become the third western prime minister running a former east
German state in the federal republic, reports Quentin Peel.
The move by the dominant Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the state of
Thuringia amounts to a calculated risk by the chancellor to bring his
eastern house into order.
The danger is that it will further infuriate east German opinion, already
bitter at the behaviour of westerners in enforcing the free market economy
on their collapsed socialist system.
The benefit is that it could provide new leadership to an eastern CDU, which
has so far failed to produce outstanding personalities and which is torn
between politicians tainted by co-operation with the former Communist
authorities, and angry young reformers without experience of office.

MOST east Europeans are dissatisfied with democratic and living standards in
their countries, according to a poll conducted last autumn and published
yesterday on behalf of the European Community. It also shows that a
significant minority want to move to western Europe.
Only in Lithuania did a majority pronounce themselves satisfied with their
democracy. In all, 10,000 people in 10 states or regions - Albania, Romania,
Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and
European Russia - were canvassed in the joint poll by Eurobarometer, the
Commission's opinion research division, and Gallup of the UK. Publication
has been delayed by the need to check methods in Albania and Romania.
Such negative opinions in these fledgling democracies - compounded by
general pessimism about the chances of rapid economic improvement in 1992 -
are hardly surprising. But the most sensitive aspect of this poll for
western Europe, where right-wing groups are exploiting fears of widespread
immigration, is the possible knock-on effect on potential emigration.
Three out of 10 (30 per cent) east Europeans interviewed said they had
considered going to work in western Europe, while only one in four (23 per
cent) European Russians said they had had similar thoughts. But when people
were asked to consider 'the likelihood of such a decision (to emigrate)
becoming a reality', the proportion of those who said they 'intend
definitely' to move west dropped to 3 per cent in eastern Europe, and less
than 1 per cent in European Russia.
EC officials say the combined figure for those 'definitely' or 'probably'
intending to move west was 8 per cent of the region's population, or 13m
people. But an official strongly cautioned that this was 'only a measure of
the psychological potential for migration, not an indication of the number
of people with suitcases packed'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday brushed aside speculation about
his health, flying to the south Russian port of Novorossiisk for talks on a
cruiser with leaders of the Black Sea Fleet, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The president, accompanied by Commonwealth forces Commander-in-Chief Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov, met military leaders to discuss nuclear arms ahead of the
president's visit to the UN this week.
The fate of the fleet, with its nuclear weaponry, has emerged as a big
source of tension between Russia and neighbouring Ukraine, which is trying
to wrest the bulk of its ships from the command of the 11-nation
Commonwealth of Independent States.
Mr Yeltsin faced close questioning aboard the 19,300-tonne cruiser Moskva
from fleet commander Admiral Igor Kasatonov and Commonwealth naval chief
Vladimir Chernavin.
They have insisted that the fleet must stay under united command.
Mr Yeltsin's appearance on the Moskva, a ship western naval experts say is
overdue for scrapping, could help dispel uncertainty in the west aroused by
his failure to take part in this week's Middle East peace talks in Moscow.
The president cancelled meetings with officials connected with the
conference on Monday and a spokesman said he was busy with domestic matters.
Mr Yeltsin's visit to the United Nations on Friday will mark his first
important venture abroad as a world leader. Western leaders will be seeking
reassurances the Commonwealth will survive and the future of the former
Soviet forces will be settled.
This raises important questions of sovereignty for Russia as well as vital
economic questions as the country comes to rely increasingly on foreign aid.
The Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday asked parliament for
sweeping powers to help him push through rapid economic reforms, Reuter
reports from Kiev.
'The foundation of our state is taking place in difficult times. The
economic downturn is continuing. . . People are losing faith in our ability
to improve the situation,' Mr Kravchuk told parliament's opening session.
He said that he had faith in Mr Vitold Fokin, his unpopular prime minister,
who has been widely criticised for excessive caution in starting a
privatisation programme which would speed the country's move to a market
economy.
Mr Kravchuk said he was seeking wider powers to enable him to form a new
government after consulting other parties.
It was not immediately clear when parliament would decide on his request
which, if granted, would give him decree-issuing powers similar to those
obtained by the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Azerbaijan helicopter shot down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ARMENIAN militants yesterday shot down an Azerbaijani civilian helicopter
flying over the strife-torn Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, killing
about 40 people, an Azerbaijani presidential spokesman said, agencies
report.
It was the most serious incident in the fight for control of the area since
a civilian helicopter carrying officials trying to mediate in the conflict
was shot down two months ago, killing more than 20 people.
The reports seemed certain to inflame tensions between the former Soviet
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh
intensified late last year after the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin,
ordered the withdrawal of troops sent to the region to keep the peace.
Tass and Interfax news agencies said the helicopter was hit while on a
flight from the town of Agdam to Shusha, an Azeri stronghold in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
'According to preliminary data, the helicopter was carrying around 40
people, including women and children. All passengers and crew members died,'
Tass quoted an Azeri official as saying.
The Armenian mission in Moscow confirmed the shooting down of the helicopter
but said it was 'presumably carrying weapons and ammunition to Azerbaijanis
who have been attacking the Armenian village of Karintag' (between
Stepanakert and Shusha).
Azerbaijan has abolished the autonomous status of Nagorno-Karabakh and
introduced presidential rule in parts of the region, actions dismissed by
Armenia as meaningless.

FT  29 JAN 92 / France loosens investor curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE has loosened one of its few remaining curbs on foreign investment,
the latest step in a gradual increase in liberalism which began in the
mid-1980s.
The relaxation is intended to benefit non-European Community businesses,
which will no longer have to seek prior government approval to buy French
companies. This applies to takeovers worth less than FFr50m (Pounds 5.11m)
of French companies with annual sales of less than FFr500m, representing 90
per cent of non-EC acquisitions in France.
From now on, non-EC investors will simply have to notify their plans to the
government, which will have 15 days - as against one month previously - to
veto bids deemed to threaten public order, health or national defence
interests. This puts EC and non-European companies on the same footing.
The move is of symbolic importance, coinciding with the government's
decision to allow IBM, the US computer maker, to buy a stake in Bull, the
state-owned computer group. However, the practical impact will be slight,
since the Finance Ministry held up only four of the 2,250 takeover proposals
presented to it in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available.
Among the blocked or delayed investments were plans by Toyota and Nissan to
take control of their French distributors, later cleared after the signing
of the EC-Japan accord on car imports. In that year, the government vetoed
the proposed takeover by Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier, of Pathe
Cinema, the French film theatre.
Underlying the relaxation is official concern over the continuing imbalance
between French investment abroad and foreign investment in France. In the
five years to 1990, French companies invested FFr535m abroad, while foreign
investors brought less than half that amount, FFr263m into France. Paris is
hoping new investors will provide jobs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush last night unveiled sweeping plans for cuts in
long-range nuclear missiles along with a modest package aimed at restoring
public confidence in the US economy.
In his State of the Union address to Congress, which will serve as a
launch-pad for his 1992 re-election campaign, Mr Bush announced fresh cuts
in US defence spending as part of a 'peace dividend' for the American
people.
In a speech punctuated by prolonged applause from congressmen, he declared
that America had won the Cold War. 'Now we can look homeward to set right
what needs to be set right,' he said.
The White House billed the speech as one of the most important in the
president's career, and it was seen as an opportunity to reverse the recent
slump in his popularity.
Mr Bush appealed to patriotism, calling on Congress and the American people
to bring the same sense of purpose to the US economy which characterised the
US military victory against Iraq in the Gulf war last year. His message to
the voters was to stay the course. 'Let me tell you right from the heart: I
know we are in hard times, but I know something else: this will not stand,'
he said.
Mr Bush called for Dollars 50bn (Pounds 27.6bn) in defence cuts beyond the
reduction planned over the next five years. 'By 1997 we will have cut
defence by 30 per cent since I took office,' he said.
His nuclear arms offer combines unilateral cuts of strategic nuclear
programmes with an appeal to the four nuclear-armed former Soviet republics
led by Russia to respond in kind.
The proposal includes the elimination of all MX mobile multi-warhead
Peacekeeper missiles; limiting production of the B-2 bomber to 20 aircraft;
cancellation of the small, long-range ICBM missile; and reducing the
warheads on the Trident submarine force by one-third.
Mr John Major, welcoming Mr Bush's initiative, said the UK had 'always been
committed to maintaining only a minimum nuclear deterrent'. Trident was
'necessary' to guarantee the UK's future security. But the UK is expected to
follow the US lead and limit warhead numbers on its planned Trident fleet.
This would represent the first time that US-Soviet nuclear disarmament has
impinged directly on the UK's strategic deterrent.
The UK Trident, due to be deployed from the mid-1990s with US missiles
equipped with British warheads, is designed for up to 128 warheads per
submarine. Substantially fewer are now expected to be deployed.
The US has previously been loath to make concessions in submarine-launched
systems, where it has enjoyed technical superiority. Mr Bush said Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's early response to his plan had been 'very
positive'. Further talks would take place this week in New York and at Camp
David, where Mr Yeltsin is due to stay on Saturday.
Mr Bush's long-awaited economic growth package includes a proposal for a
deeper-than-expected cut in capital gains tax to 15.4 per cent, phased in
over three years; a new 15 per cent investment tax allowance; an increase in
the personal family allowance to Dollars 500 per child; and a Dollars 5,000
tax credit for first-time home buyers. The measures reflect the constraints
of the federal budget deficit which is likely to reach Dollars 360bn this
year. The sweeteners for middle-income voters do not include an
across-the-board tax cut of the kind proposed by Democratic presidential
contenders led by Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Instead, Mr Bush said he would order the US Treasury to curb 'excessive'
withholding from the pay-cheques of ordinary Americans. This measure, he
suggested, could return about Dollars 25bn to the US economy over the next
12 months.
In his speech, Mr Bush also proposed a 90-day freeze on new federal
regulations and a review of all regulations which might slow economic
growth. The proposed freeze marks a U-turn for Mr Bush, who has presided
over the greatest extension of federal regulation in more than 20 years. He
is due to follow up his address with detailed proposals today in his fiscal
1993 budget.
Plans for a smooth run-up to the State of the Union address came unstuck on
Monday after congressional Republicans rebelled over provisions for health
care reform put forward by Mr Richard Darman, the president's budget
director.
The revolt forced Mr Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff, to order a
temporary halt to printing the 2,000 page budget document to allow Mr Darman
to remove the offending passages.
Mr Bush said that he would provide a health insurance tax credit of up to
Dollars 3,750 for each low income family, with some unspecified help for
middle-income families.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Economic gloom predicted in election run-up: CBI sees drop
in business confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S general election campaign will be fought against the background of
deep economic gloom, according to a report by the Confederation of British
Industry.
Yesterday's industrial trends survey recorded a big fall in business
confidence over the past three months and said manufacturing output was
declining at a higher rate than government figures show.
Meanwhile, an opinion poll in today's Daily Mail puts the Tories 1 point
ahead of Labour, at 41 per cent.
While the CBI study said inflationary pressures in manufacturing were at
their lowest levels for more than 30 years, it said job losses in the sector
were increasing.
It predicted that by the middle of this year factory investment will decline
by 32 per cent, compared with the period in late 1989 before the start of
the recession.
This bleak assessment for manufacturing, which accounts for just over a
fifth of the economy, supports indications that even a mild recovery is
unlikely to be visible over the next few months.
It will add to pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to stimulate
the economy in his second Budget on March 10.
The CBI findings sparked angry exchanges at prime minister's question time
in the Commons. Although Mr John Major insisted that the recovery might
already have started, Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats,
said the prime minister was 'talking up false economic dawns'.
The survey has tracked the economy for 33 years and is closely followed by
the Treasury and private sector economists.
It found that business optimism has dipped sharply since the autumn, partly
because the recovery promised by the government for the second half of 1991
failed to materialise. Another factor was the slowdown in other economies
such as Germany and the US.
It said factory output was continuing to fall, though at a slower rate than
in the early part of last year. According to the CBI's data, which are based
on analysis of its survey answers, manufacturing output in the third quarter
of 1991 was down 10.6 per cent compared with the all-time peak around the
start of 1990.
This is considerably more gloomy than the equivalent figures from the
government's Central Statistical Office, which show a 6.7 per cent decline
over this period.
The CBI projects a further fall in manufacturing output in the first quarter
of 1992, which would take the decline since 1990 to 13.2 per cent. This
would be comparable with the 15.5 per cent reduction during the 1979-80
recession.
Countering the CBI's statistics, the CSO said its figures gave a better
picture of trends in manufacturing. They were based on a broader sample of
companies, and used quantitative measures to assess output.
The CBI said its survey pointed to 73,000 jobs being lost in manufacturing
in the first quarter of 1992, as against 68,000 in the previous three
months. This would take the total fall in employment in the sector since the
start of the recession to about 500,000.
The CBI drew attention to its findings on manufacturing investment, which it
reckons will reduce the chance for UK companies to make up ground lost
during the recession.

Lord Hanson (left) yesterday ruled out a bid for Imperial Chemical
Industries eight months after taking a 2.8 per cent stake in the company. He
said Lord White (right), would not join the Hanson board because he was
chairman of Hanson's US arm which would not be best served by being directed
from Britain. Lord Hanson told the acquisitive conglomerate's shareholders
that his successor had been chosen but refused to name names. More than
1,000 shareholders attended the annual meeting in the Barbican Centre in
London. Most questions had to be submitted in writing before the meeting,
enabling Lord Hanson to read the answers from an autocue.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Lonrho to lose control of VW/Audi UK distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, is to lose control of its
Volkswagen/Audi import and distribution operations in the UK from the end of
1993. The business accounts for more than a fifth of Lonrho's worldwide
turnover.
It is understood that Volkswagen, the German carmaker, will take control of
the business operated by VAG (United Kingdom), a Lonrho subsidiary, when the
present six-year vehicle supply contract between VW and Lonrho expires.
Lonrho, which has suffered a steep fall in its share price after disclosing
a 24 per cent fall in pre-tax profits and a dividend cut last week, refused
to comment yesterday.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho joint deputy chairman, said: 'I am saying absolutely
nothing. It is a contractual relationship. It is confidential and private.'
VW, the leading European carmaker, is keen to control distribution in all
five European large volume markets. In recent years it has added ownership
of the Spanish and Italian operations to its control in Germany and France.
'The contents of the contracts with Lonrho are confidential,' it said
yesterday. 'We are not authorised to disclose any information on this
matter.' VAG (UK) referred all questions to Lonrho.
Lonrho shareholders have not been informed explicitly about the future of
the company's contract with Volkswagen. The only reference was in the 1987
Lonrho annual report, which stated: 'Since the year-end, an agreement has
been concluded between VAG (UK) and Volkswagen AG to allow Volkswagen AG a
greater interest in the distribution of Volkswagen AG group products in the
United Kingdom.'
It is understood that the previous two year rolling contract was replaced at
that time by a six-year agreement running to the end of 1993. Mr Spicer
refused yesterday to reveal any financial details for the subsidiary.
Information filed by Lonrho at Companies House reveals that the financial
performance of VAG (UK) and its related companies has deteriorated in the
past two years. Turnover for the year to September 30 1991 was Pounds
1.02bn, representing 21.1 per cent of Lonrho's total turnover of Pounds
4.846bn and an 11 per cent fall from Pounds 1.15bn in 1989-90. In 1990 it
provided just over half of Lonrho's UK turnover.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Bundesbank to attack Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank is to publish a special declaration next month to bring into
the open its misgivings about last month's Maastricht deal on European
Monetary Union (Emu).
The statement by the German central bank is expected to point to the need
for the European Community to decide further steps towards political union
to provide the right framework for a move to a single currency.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's failure at Maastricht to persuade other EC members
to make a full commitment to political union has been widely criticised by
members of the 16-strong Bundesbank council.
The council agreed the statement at its regular fortnightly meeting last
Thursday as a way of influencing the debate on parliamentary ratification of
the Maastricht deal.
News of the council's deliberations coincided yesterday with indications
that the Bundesbank may continue its high interest rate policy for several
more months.
Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank directorate member responsible for
economics, said the current 4 per cent inflation rate was 'worryingly high'
and was unlikely to decline in the short term.
In its statement next month, the Bundesbank is likely to state the need for
properly co-ordinated EC fiscal policies to deal with economic strains
arising from the move to European monetary union. It may also indicate
doubts about features of the Maastricht agreement on economic policy which
appear to counter free-market trade principles.
The council statement will appear together with an article on Emu from the
bank's economics department, to be published in February's Bundesbank
monthly report. The council has chosen cautious language to avoid being
accused of a direct attack on the government over its European policies.
The decision to publish a formal statement next month represents a
compromise, reached after several weeks of internal wrangling, about the
best way to make the central bank's views known. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, is sceptical about fixing a firm timetable for moving
to Emu, but has made only innocuous remarks in public over the issue to
avoid acrimony with Bonn.
A number of regional central bank governors on the council have, on the
other hand, been pressing for a more active Bundesbank stance. Publication
of the Bundesbank document has been delayed until next month to allow the
central bank to take account of the final version of the Maastricht
treaties.
Under the Maastricht accord, EC countries would move to a single currency by
1999 at the latest, provided they fulfilled strict economic convergence
criteria. The Bundesbank will state it has no quarrel with these criteria,
nor with plans to set up a European central bank geared to price stability.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rodd Hampson, managing director of House of Fraser, the department store
group owned by the Fayed family, is to leave the company at the end of the
month to return to his native Australia for family reasons.
Hampson has worked at House of Fraser for six years and has overseen the
slimming down of its department store portfolio and the modernisation of its
management systems. In his previous job as merchandise director of Harrods,
he was credited with inventing the slogan: 'There is only one Harrods; there
is only one sale.'
He will be succeeded by Andrew Jennings, who last year became general
manager of Harrods. Jennings, in his early 40s, began his retailing career
as a management trainee at Debenhams and worked at three department store
companies in South Africa before returning to the UK.

Christopher Melchers, 55, who for the past three years has been director of
corporate development at Britain's largest hotel group, Forte, has been
lured to the Milk Marketing Board as finance director.
The Milk Marketing Board, the 60-year-old cartel which represents dairy
farmers in England and Wales, is embroiled in a tussle with the Dairy Trade
Federation, the milk processors, over the future shape of the industry,
particularly in the light of the imminent single market.
Asked why Melchers should wish to join an outfit whose very existence was
potentially under threat, George Wright, the new chief executive, says the
organisation's existence has been under threat for the entire 28 years he
himself has been there. He adds that the strong City connections Melchers
has accumulated will be particularly valuable to the board in the midst of
current reform of the dairy industry.

Costain, the UK construction engineering and mining group which saw its
share price fall steeply for much of last year, has moved to strengthen the
management of its important US coal mining business by appointing Tom Parker
as president and chief executive of Costain Coal Inc.
Parker, 48, who has previously worked for Consolidation Coal, Shell Oil and
Conoco in the US, replaces Gordon Haworth, 58, who leaves the company by
mutual consent.
According to Peter Costain, chief executive of the UK group: 'Gordon Haworth
had just two years of his service contract to serve and it was thought that
now would be the right time to replace him with a younger man with a long
term commitment to improve returns in the US coal business - which we are
determined to achieve.'
Coal sales from the US and Australia accounted for 62 per cent of Costain's
1990 operating profit.

FT  29 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Portugal puts its faith in recent
reforms - High interest rates and privatisation have hit the equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Portuguese stock market fell to its lowest level since March 1987 this
week, suggesting that an upturn remains some way off in spite of reforms to
make the market more attractive.
The Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA) index, which reached an all-time high of
6,753.30 in October 1987, fell below 1,900 on Monday and closed at 1,894.5
yesterday.
The latest fall confirms a trend already apparent last year, during which
trading in shares on the Lisbon and Oporto exchanges declined by more than 6
per cent, while the turnover in bonds and government securities quadrupled
to record levels.
Commentators say that government policy to maintain high interest rates and
provide extra fiscal benefits for purchasers of shares in companies being
privatised effectively favours investment in government-influenced stocks at
the expense of the broader market. As long as this remains the case,
'investors will continue to leave the market', said Publico, a respected
daily newspaper, yesterday.
Last year's developments appear to support that verdict. Domestic and
foreign investors rushed into government bonds and the value of transactions
in government paper rose from Es341bn (Dollars 2.5bn) in 1990 to Es1,460bn.
In sharp contrast, the value of shares traded on the official market, not
including initial share flotations for privatisations, nor over-the-counter
trading on the secondary market, fell from Es260.2bn in 1990 to Es255.1bn.
The BTA index lost 8.8 per cent in 1991 to 1,953.8, and so far this year it
has fallen a further 3 per cent.
Analysts pin their hopes on recent reforms and the introduction of a
three-tier market. 'It is a question of confidence, and the reforms will
help,' says one analyst, but opinions are more cautious over prospects for a
recovery. 'Until interest rates come down, I do not see a strong recovery
for the market, though some individual stocks may rise,' comments another
analyst.
The market was split into three in January in an effort to make transactions
more efficient and transparent. The first tier, or 'official market',
includes a small group of 'top' companies listed on a new national
computerised continuous pricing system linking Lisbon and Oporto, and a
larger group of up to 50 companies which are quoted twice a day under the
old system in Lisbon and Oporto.
Continuous trading was launched last September with three companies to test
the system. Since then it has grown to 11 companies, and up to 30 companies
could eventually be included, provided they have a minimum market
capitalisation of Es500m.
The second tier, or 'second market', is for small and medium-sized companies
with a market capitalisation of between Es125m and Es500m. Those in this
tier will be quoted daily, but only on one of the two exchanges. At present
it consists of three stocks.
The third tier, or 'market without quotations', will be for companies which
do not meet the stock exchange's criteria on liquidity or financial
position. Earlier this month, 51 companies were relegated from the official
market to this tier. Companies in this tier can be traded on either of the
two stock exchanges.
The changes were welcomed by analysts. A leading fund manager says: 'These
measures are important because they clarify the importance of the different
markets and the degree of risk. Companies in the official market, for
example, will also have to provide better information.'
Other reforms should also help. A new independent securities exchange
commission was established last year to regulate and supervise the market.
The exchanges are now managed by two private companies which will ultimately
merge. The number of authorised brokers will be doubled to 20 in Lisbon and
from 10 to 14 in Oporto to encourage greater competition and better service.
Mr John Ferreira of brokers Carnegie International says: 'These reforms will
add credibility to the market and set the scene for the emergence of a much
more serious stock exchange.' But for now, bargain hunters with a long-term
view could take advantage of the current low prices.

<TEXT>
LATE-CLOSING bourses improved on Wall Street's opening yesterday, but there
were also strong individual influences to be absorbed, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS ended at its highest level so far this year, lifted by Wall Street's
firm start and further evidence that 1991 corporate results were better than
analysts' worst fears. The CAC 40 index ended 21.33 or 1.14 per cent higher
at 1,890.60. Turnover was estimated at FFr2.7bn, of which around FFr500m was
generated by the insurer, Axa. Dealers said that a block of at least 460,000
shares in Axa was crossed via Axa's broker Meeschaert, but there were no
further details of the transaction. The stock rose FFr8 to FFr932 with
521,560 shares traded.
The most active stock yesterday was Euro Disney, which jumped FFr3 to
FFr149.50 in 531,000 shares after Walt Disney reported better-than-expected
first quarter results.
The food giant BSN fell as low as FFr1,053 in early trading on news that the
Agnelli family had reduced its share of the voting rights in BSN to below 5
per cent. The stock recovered to close FFr4 down at FFr1,075 and dealers
expect the stock to rise further today in the wake of its pleasing 1991
turnover figures.
MILAN eased in quiet trading ahead as investors waited for Fiat's 1991
preliminary results, due later in the day. The Comit index fell 2.37 to
545.31 in turnover estimated at L95bn after Monday's L87.6bn.
Fiat ordinary shares closed L50 down at L5,120, but rebounded on the kerb to
L5,170. After the close Fiat reported a 70 per cent drop in consolidated
operating profit to L636bn. Analysts agreed that the results appeared to be
much worse than expectations but they were reluctant to make any further
comments until the company published more details.
ZURICH heard after hours that Moody's, the ratings agency, was downgrading
Credit Suisse long-term debt and putting Swiss Bank Corp, still AAA-rated,
on its watchlist. CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, was unchanged on the
session, but its bearers fell SFr20 to SFr1,910 in London after hours,
following a SFr20 drop on Monday.
SBC bearers closed SFr2 lower at SFr311 for a two-day fall of SFr6m and then
lost another SFr6 in London post-bourse trading. Dealers said it came under
slight pressure on news it had Dollars 130m of exposure to the US retailer
Macy, which on Monday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. SBC said
Dollars 20m of its commitments to Macy were unsecured.
The all-share SPI index eased eased 1.8 to 1,118.7.
FRANKFURT started well in the pre-bourse, consolidated in the official
session and was mildly excited after hours by news that Deutsche Bank was
raising its dividend from DM14 to DM15.
After a 1.62 decline to 682.58 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX
closed just 0.52 lower at 1,683.08, in German market turnover of DM5.9bn
after Monday's DM6.1bn.
Blue chips turned mixed after some early support, Daimler holding on to its
gains to close DM7.20 higher at DM751.70 on the hope that the US tax on
luxury cars might be repealed or reduced. Deutsche eased DM2 to DM704.50
before a late rise to DM707.70 on the dividend news.
STOCKHOLM fell as it waited for the government to reject the proposed merger
between Volvo and Procordia. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 4.0 to
983.3, and Volvo B by SKr8 to SKr390; but Procordia, which had fallen SKr18
in two days, closed unchanged at SKr198.
AMSTERDAM concentrated on Nedlloyd. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.5 to
122.0. The transport group confirmed that it was finally offering the
Norwegian investor Mr Torstein Hagen, who has a 27 per cent stake in the
company, a seat on the supervisory board. Nedlloyd rose Fl 2.20 or 3.8 per
cent to Fl 59.90 on high volume of 280,000 shares. Internatio-Mueller, the
technology and transport group, rose Fl 3.50 to Fl 63.00 on volume of
130,000 shares. There were reports that it may sell its 44 per cent stake in
the Rotterdam stevedore ECT, in which Nedlloyd holds a similar share.
MADRID rose slightly, with the general index up 1.65 to 255.06. Telefonica,
which announced an unchanged interim dividend on Monday, put on Pta5 to
Pta1,185, with the impetus coming after New York opened.
The banking sector was generally strong: BBV announced flat operating
profits, in line with expectations, and the stock rose Pta30 to Pta2,765;
Popular climbed Pta180 to Pta11,720. Repsol recorded the largest volume,
above 450,000 shares,but fell Pta20 to Pta2,955 on profit-taking.
OSLO saw Elkem rise to NKr76 on speculation of a merger, later denied, with
Norsk Hydro. It fell back to close NKr1.50 higher at NKr72 in turnover of
NKr54m. Norsk Hydro closed unchanged at NKr151 and the all-share fell 3.14
to 449.86.
VIENNA saw an improvement in turnover as the all-share index rose by 5.76 to
446.80.

FT  29 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 1.8% on
index-related buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES gained ground on index-related activity and the Nikkei average
advanced 1.8 per cent, in spite of a lack of general buying interest, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 383.41 ahead at 21,390.52, after opening at the
day's low of 21,027.66 and touching the session's high of 21,420.78 in the
afternoon.
Volume rose marginally to 160m shares from 137m, as small-lot bargain
hunting supported activity. Advances outnumbered declines for the first time
since last Wednesday, by 548 to 350, with 203 issues remaining unchanged.
However, activity centred around the Nikkei's 225 component stocks, and in
spite of the sharp rise in the Nikkei, the Topix index of all first section
stocks added only 9.0 at 1,583.47. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
just 1.41 firmer at 1,220.12.
An analyst at Daiwa Securities commented: 'Trading was futures-related, and
there was no real demand.' Small-capital component stocks in the Nikkei 225
average surged, with Godo Shusei gaining Y210 or 11.1 per cent to Y2,090.
Reports that the Osaka Stock Exchange was considering disclosure of stock
futures transactions and shortening futures trading hours lifted the futures
market in the afternoon. Traders said market participants expected the
measures to increase transparency in the futures market. However, an OSE
official said an official decision had yet to be made on such moves.
Small-lot bargain hunting by foreign investors was noted. Mr Nick Cant at
Baring Securities said foreigners had shifted buying from interest
rate-sensitive issues, such as banks and real estate, to export-related
high-technology stocks.
Issues which had previously firmed on lower interest rates lost ground on
profit-taking. Mitsui Real Estate retreated Y40 to Y1,220 and Tokyo Electric
Power shed Y10 to Y3,140. However, some electricals saw support, Hitachi
gaining Y10 to Y920 and Matsushita Electric Industrial also Y10 to Y1,430.
Ono Pharmaceutical moved ahead Y500 to Y5,380 in Osaka on reports of its
plan to launch a new diabetic drug. Buying spread to other drug issues and
food companies involved in bio-technological research and development.
Takeda Chemical added Y20 at Y1,250 and Meiji Milk Products climbed Y54 to
Y880.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was unaffected by the overall positive tone
of the market, and finished Y2,000 weaker at another all-time low of
Y680,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 201.99 to 22,704.90 in volume of 51.1m
shares. Activity was dominated by large-lot cross-trading by companies and
banks, which wanted to realise gains on their stock holdings ahead of the
March book closing; but some buying by individuals and foreigners was noted.
Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING remained the dominant factor ahead of next week's Chinese new
year.
HONG KONG saw selective local selling after the Hang Seng index failed to
break through the 4,600 level again. The index, nevertheless, closed 31.60
stronger at 4,586.33, in turnover a shade higher at HKDollars 2.05bn.
While profit-taking was seen in Cheung Kong, the real estate sector still
had its supporters. Hongkong Land was among the most active stocks as it
rose 35 cents to HKDollars 10.30.
SINGAPORE reported pressure on blue chips as the Straits Times Industrial
index shed 7.64 to 1,538.28. Initial gains disappeared as buyers withdrew to
await the State of the Union address last night from the US president, Mr
George Bush.
KUALA LUMPUR eased as investors remained cautious about taking positions
ahead of the holiday next week. The composite index ended 0.71 off at 569.84
after an early high of 571.17. Gains in Tokyo and a steady Wall Street
overnight prompted some bargain hunting at the outset.
SEOUL ended a two-day advance with the composite index pulling back 9.15 to
665.96 in turnover of Won417bn (Won537bn). Selling was aimed at large
manufacturing, financial, trading and construction stocks.
TAIWAN eased moderately from its 1992 high, the weighted index losing 28.82
to 5,312.67 as turnover decreased from TDollars 60.8bn to TDollars 49.8bn,
but observers said sentiment was still optimistic, reflecting a healthy
economy and a stable political situation.
AUSTRALIA rose after recovering from the sale of a large UK portfolio worth
some ADollars 20m. The sale caused a slight weakness but the market
recovered steadily during afternoon trading. The All Ordinaries index gained
10.1 to 1,626. Food group Goodman Fielder Wattie registered the highest
volume of 9.4m shares after a parcel of 7m shares worth more than ADollars
10m was placed by New Zealand Dairy.
NEW ZEALAND undid three days of gentle rises to close lower and subdued in a
market where most leaders were pegged back on reasonable volume. The NZSE-40
index receded 10.21 to 1,476.80 in turnover of some NZDollars 28.5m.
BANGKOK saw profit-taking, the SET index closing 5.20 down at 766.73 in
turnover of Bt6.51bn. Property and finance shares were active.
KARACHI dropped another 3 per cent, the KSE 100 index ending 46.32 lower at
1,442.31.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC ministers lack conviction on
CAP reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers yesterday agreed to continue with
their year-old negotiations to reform the Common Agricultural Policy, but
without any conviction that firm decisions could be reached before the
dispute over farm subsidies within the Uruguay Round world trade talks is
settled.
The current Portuguese presidency of the EC presented a compromise 'working
paper' which was vague enough not to give great offence to any of the 12,
but concrete enough for most member states to feel they had 'something to
nibble at', as a senior European Commission official put it.
Thus, the Brussels blueprint for overhauling the CAP has been kept in play,
and Mr Arlindo Cunha, the Portuguese farm minister, has undertaken to
produce a more detailed synthesis of amendments each of the 12 are seeking
next month.
'There is forward movement,' the Brussels official said, 'but it is very
difficult to ask them to commit themselves before they can see what is
happening in Gatt,' the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade conducting
the Uruguay Round.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director general of the Gatt who drafted the
agriculture chapter of the Round's conclusions which the EC is trying to
renegotiate, is in Brussels here today to hear the community's point of
view. But all the indications from yesterday's farm council were that it has
yet to settle on a unified position.
There is a fragile majority of 8:4 in favour of pressing on with plans to
cut CAP price support and replace it with direct compensation to farmers,
decoupled as far as possible from the surpluses they produce, which pile up
in expensive stockpiles and get dumped on world markets. The Danes, British,
Dutch and Irish take the view that a Gatt deal must come first.
But there is a more even split among member states over what needs to be
changed in Mr Dunkel's 'final act' paper, aimed at concluding the Uruguay
Round by Easter.
Five countries - the UK, France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium - want
priority to be given to renegotiating the Gatt prescription that the volume
of subsidised exports must be reduced by 24 per cent over the next six
years. This is in addition to a 36 per cent cut in export subsidies over the
same period, and is regarded as an unacceptable attempt to restrain trade.
The other seven adhere to the position defended by Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm
commissioner, that the priority is to get the direct compensation to farmers
categorised as a subsidy which does not distort trade. Mr MacSharry believes
that only if the compensation is accepted as permanent - like the price
support mechanism now - will it be politically saleable to all member states
and the EC's 9m farmers.
Neither camp looks as though it can secure a Gatt breakthrough, much less
when the EC is not presenting a united front. Mr Dunkel, the US, and the
Cairns Group of 14 agri-exporters led by Australia appear equally firm on
both points - but if anything marginally more so on the need to cut the
volume of EC subsidised exports.
There are four meetings of EC agriculture ministers scheduled between now
and the Gatt deadline, and little prospect that this division of opinion
will change without intervention at a higher political level.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers and traders welcome
milk board plan - The monopoly buyer's first step along the road to becoming
a co-operative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER TWO years of debate the UK Milk Marketing Board has this week taken
the first step along the road to becoming a voluntary co-operative, ending
nearly 60 years of a statutory monopoly on milk supplies.
The plans have been welcomed by both the Dairy Trade Federation, which
represents dairies and processors, and the National Farmers' Union. Both
organisations, however, were quick to point out that there was a still a
very long way to travel.
The MMB's reluctance to reform itself was underlined by Mr Bob Stevens,
chairman, who prefixed the announcement of the changes on Monday by saying
that the board would have preferred to maintain the old scheme, amended
within a European context.
But the pressure on the MMB has been steady, unrelenting, and from all
quarters - the dairy industry itself, the UK agriculture ministry and the
European Commission included. Signs that things were at last beginning to
move emerged late last year with the threat of a European Court action over
the board's insistence that it held the right to buy and sell low fat, or
skimmed, milk. The board legally holds the right of first refusal on all
liquid or whole milk produced in the UK. But farmers and dairies were
circumventing the scheme by tapping into the demand for skimmed and
semi-skimmed milk, which has grown to take about one third of the UK market.
While Mr John Gummer, minister of agriculture, rejected the European
Commission's 'reasoned opinion' against the board, he made it clear that he
was only doing so in order that the board would negotiate with the DTF
reforms to the whole milk marketing system.
In November Mr Charles Runge, chief executive, resigned, complaining that
the pace of change had been too slow. This was quickly followed by the
surprise appointment of Mr Andrew Dare, a former president of the DTF, as a
special adviser to the board. Mr Dare is seen as the man who facilitated the
co-operative plan.
The board's proposal to become a single voluntary co-operative with pooled
prices has hardly come as a surprise. The crucial change in thinking has
been the decision to hive off Dairy Crest, the wholly owned subsidiary with
a 25 per cent stake in the UK's manufactured dairy product market. Shares in
the company, thought to be worth about Pounds 300m, will be issued to milk
producers on the basis of milk supplied over a given period in the past.
Mr Dare said that the shares would be tradeable among dairy farmers, but he
stressed that full details of the share issue had not yet been worked out.
The plan will put Dairy Crest on an equal footing with its competitors,
appeasing the main objection of the Dairy Trade Federation. 'The trade don't
like the milk board owning a dairy company - they think it's getting all
sorts of favours,' Mr Mark Thomas of the NFU diary committee said yesterday.
However, industry analysts point out that the statutory monopoly enjoyed by
the dairy farmers, who have been guaranteed a buyer for all the milk they
produced, has also been cushioning the dairy trade. The trade has always
been able to get its milk, and always at the same price as any competitor.
While the MMB has acted as a shield to the milk producers, it has also
prevented them from setting up their own processing arrangements to compete
with the big dairies.
The MMB has sent letters to its 30,000 dairy farmers who will have to vote
on the proposals. But it is thought that the great majority of them will
back the plan and join the new co-op.
'We would like to see a large take up,' said Mr Thomas, pointing out that
the suppliers needed the muscle of size in an industry that featured four
major dairy companies supplying half a dozen large supermarkets. Even big
dairy farms with 300 cows or more would find themselves very exposed if
linked to a supermarket purchasing contract, he said.
Industry observers also believe that the conservative instincts of most
dairy farmers will keep them in the co-operative. 'Milk is a fresh product,'
said one. 'The farmers are used to someone picking it up and sending a
cheque at the end of the month. Initially you will only find the more
commercially minded and ambitious staying out.'
The board is proposing that milk prices will be set by 'an industry-agreed
pricing system to be discussed with the dairy trade, Maff (the agriculture
ministry) and the European Commission.' Such a system would very likely be
similar to the board's 'New Ways of Buying Milk,' scheduled to start from
April 1 this year. Milk, which has been priced high for liquid consumption
and low for cheese making, will then be priced according to its supply
profile, with a premium being charged for regular deliveries.
This will get rid of the MMB's much criticised present pricing system under
which 24 different levels are set according to the use to which the milk is
put.
At the same time further rationalisation is expected in Dairy Crest's butter
and cheese production plants, which have undergone two retrenchments already
but are still working well below capacity.
The Ministry of Agriculture yesterday repeated its position that it wants
detailed proposals from the MMB by Easter. Once past the ministry the
proposals will go before the European Commission. Mr Dare said that whoever
won the coming election would be unlikely to find time in the legislative
timetable until 'the back end of this year at the earliest'.
Once the co-op was established it would not last unless it was efficient and
flexible in responding to the market, he said. 'There is no hiding place.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet oil production forecast
to fall by 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRODUCTION from the former Soviet Union could fall to 400m tonnes this
year from 460m tonnes last year, Mr Viktor Lopukhin, Russia's minister for
energy and fuels, told a London conference yesterday.
But the minister was hopeful of restoring output to its level of two to
three years' ago by the middle of the decade. The Commonwealth of
Independent States produced 568m tonnes of oil in 1988 before output started
to decline rapidly.
Mr Lopukhin was speaking at a conference on 'Opening up the Russian Oil
Industry,' jointly organised by the Royal Institute for International
Affairs and the Centre for Foreign Investment and Privatisation.
The economic reforms initiated by the government of Mr Boris Yeltsin,
Russian president, have barely touched the oil industry yet. The government
has partly freed oil prices so that, in stages, they can rise to free market
levels, Mr Lopukhin said. But it will be at least another two years before
the sector becomes self-financing.
The state price for oil has risen from R70 to R350 a tonne. But western
critics say that price caps in place for oil mean that, as the general rate
of inflation increases, real oil prices will remain low and will not be high
enough to discourage wastage.
Mr Lopukhin said his ministry was commited to minimising the risks for
foreign investors in the Russian oil industry. On February 6, the state
legislature will debate a Bill that will put in place a legal framework for
foreign investment. He said the passage of the Bill would not be easy, but
expected legislation to be in place in a matter of weeks rather than months.
Russia needs foreign help to kick-start its ailing oil industry. If all the
oil wells that are currently out of operation could be started up again,
output would rise by an estimated 24m tonnes a year.
The republic also intends to initiate a programme of privatisation based on
the creation of several vertically-integrated oil companies around which
smaller companies could be set up to create competition, Mr Lopukhin
explained.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentine grain board forecasts
sharp cut in wheat crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA WILL see a sharp reduction in wheat production this year, but
higher world prices and better yields should improve revenues for the
country's hard-pressed farmers, according to government and private
forecasters.
The wheat crop should fall by about 16 per cent to 9.4m tonnes, according to
the latest forecasts from the government's National Grain Board. Cargill,
the US grain trader, forecasts a 24 per cent drop in the area planted with
wheat to 4.7m hectares, and expects output to fall to 9.2m tonnes.
None the less, Ms Marichela Gey, head trader at Cargill's Buenos Aires
office, said yesterday that improving yields had compensated for the decline
in the area planted. Yields had increased strongly in southern Buenos Aires
province, thanks to good weather and greater use of fertilisers while rising
yields there helped offset the impact of bad weather in other regions of the
Pampas, boosting the average national yield to 2.04 tonnes per hectare. Last
year the yield was 1.97 tonnes a hectare.
Argentina is expected to export between 4.5m and 4.7m tonnes of wheat this
year, compared with 5.2m tonnes in the first ten months of 1991, the latest
period for which official figures are available. But revenues for the whole
year should rise to about USDollars 550m, from Dollars 486m in the ten
months to October 1991. Prices last year began recovering after plunging in
1990 in response to subsidised exports from the European Community and the
US.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uganda's biological cobalt
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UGANDA WILL become a substantial cobalt producer, contributing about 5 per
cent of western world output, if the government supports a Dollars 54m
project proposed by BRGM, the state-owned French mining group, and Barclays
Metals, the metals trading subsidiary of Barclays Bank of the UK.
It would also be the first time that thiobacillus ferro-oxidans, the
naturally-occuring bacteria that is being used by some copper, gold and
uranium miners to liberate their metals from ore, would be employed in
cobalt production.
For the partners claim that bioleaching is not only the least costly way of
extracting Uganda's cobalt, it is also the most environment-friendly method.
They suggest they can produce 1,000 tonnes a year which would be profitable
with the cobalt price at its long-term historic average of Dollars 10 to
Dollars 12 a lb.
Environmental issues are important because Uganda's cobalt is in 1.1m tonnes
of pyrites stockpiled at the old Kilembe copper mine on the edge of the
Queen Elizabeth National Park in south-west Uganda.
Copper production at Kilembe stopped in 1972 since when various methods to
recover the cobalt have been looked at and found to be either too expensive
or too polluting.
BRGM (Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres) has been developing the
proposed bioleaching process over several years. There have been 'excellent'
recovery rates under pilot test conditions, according to Barclays Metals,
formerly known as Deak International Trading, which was acquired by the UK
bank 18 months ago.
Barclays Metals said yesterday that, together with BRGM, it was ready to
sign a joint venture with the Ugandan government to carry out a Dollars 4m
feasibility study which should lead to the construction of a Dollars 50m
bioleaching plant at Kilembe.
Negotiations about finance were well advanced with a number of agencies.
It would take about two and a half years from the time the go-ahead was
given for the feasibility study to move into full production, said Barclays
Metals. The Ugandan government would own 45 per cent of the project with
BRGM, the technical agent, and Barclays, the marketing agent, each owning 27
1/2 per cent.
Ironically, the present high cost of cobalt, an essential metal in some of
the superalloys used by the aerospace industry and for some motor industry
products, is causing some delays to the project. Cobalt has more than
doubled in price in the past few months because of production problems and
potential political upheavals in Zaire and Zambia, which between them
account for about 70 per cent of cobalt production outside the former
eastern bloc countries.

FT  29 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Investors fall foul of market
turbulence - Unwelcome precedent created by a Japanese equity fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Daiwa Investment Trust and Management launched its New Stage stock
investment trust fund four years ago, the company and the fund's investors
had few doubts that the irrepressible Tokyo Stock Market would provide
profits for all.
Those expectations appeared to be confirmed in 1989, when the market swirled
ever higher and there was a rush by other investment trust companies to
launch funds to satisfy stock-hungry investors. But instead of generating
profits, the New Stage has created an unwelcome precedent.
Japan's Ministry of Finance has just allowed Daiwa to extend the life of the
fund for another three years because the plunge in stock prices has pushed
it below par value. New Stage was apparently the first to be given approval
because, unlike some other equity funds likely to be extended in coming
months, that fund was not far below par value - about 2 per cent.
The ministry and the industry have agreed on the extensions in an attempt to
slow a rush of redemptions by investors, the threat of which has put
downward pressure on Japanese stock prices. At the same time, according to
Daiwa, many investors asked for an extension because to cash-in now would
mean a loss of money and a loss of face.
'A lot of our investors preferred to wait for a better result than to take
what is available now. We, Daiwa, also want to prove our sincerity to our
customers,' Daiwa Investment Trust and Management said.
Having reached a high of 38,915.87 in late 1989, the Nikkei stock average
has been languishing at around 21,000 in recent weeks. Market weakness has
had three damaging effects on equity investment trusts: it has eroded the
net asset value of the funds, slowed the flow of fresh funds and increased
the rate of redemptions.
The net asset value of equity and bond investment trust funds fell 9.8 per
cent last year, with the net assets of stock funds down from Y35,077.2bn
(Dollars 279.7bn) at the end of 1990 to Y28,562.4bn. The value of new stock
funds launched was down 43 per cent to Y8,640bn, the lowest level in six
years, while the net assets of bond funds rose 18.2 per cent, reflecting the
strength of the bond market.
Meanwhile, there was a 2.4 increase in redemptions of stock funds, with
pre-maturity redemptions the vast majority. With that trend in mind, the
Finance Ministry, which likes to see markets conducted in an orderly manner,
allowed Daiwa to postpone the redemption date, the first extension of its
kind since 1965.
In the early and mid-1960s, cancellations of investment trust funds pushed
stock prices lower in a troubled market which almost claimed Yamaichi
Securities - one of the big four brokers - as a victim. In 1965, investment
trusts accounted for about 7.7 per cent of shares traded, compared with 3.7
per cent in 1990 - the funds' market influence has lessened, but fears of
instability remain.
The name 'stock investment trust' is slightly deceptive as at the end of
November only 49 per cent of their total monies were invested in stocks,
with 17.4 per cent in bonds and most of the remainder in cash accounts.
The equity funds are particularly attractive to individual investors, who
are unable to afford to trade directly in shares, which, even in a depressed
market, is still expensive in Japan.
Individuals accounted for about 75 per cent of purchases in the late 1980s,
though that figure was closer to 90 per cent last year, reflecting the great
reluctance of financial institutions and industrial corporations to invest -
in 1990, the former accounted 13.5 per cent of purchases in unit type
trusts, and the latter 8.5 per cent.
While the weakness of stock prices has been a good reason not to buy, the
securities industry scandals last year also encouraged individuals to stay
away. The 16 Japanese investment trust companies are tied to securities
houses, many of which were shown last year to have favoured corporate
clients by compensating them for trading losses.
Mr Stephen Barber, president of MIM Investment Trust Management, one of four
foreign concerns granted investment trust licences at the end of 1990, said
the scandals were the 'final nail' last year. However, if the stock market
surges, he expects 'self-interest would cause people to forget the scandals
pretty quickly'.
The Investment Trusts' Association of Japan admits the scandals have an
effect, but a spokesman said the market turbulence of the past two years has
taught investors a valuable lesson: 'I don't think people really understood
that prices could go down and that they could lose money. Maybe its partly
the fault of sales staff, but both investors and salesmen forgot that there
was a risk involved.'
Another association official believed that some funds are at between 60 and
70 per cent of their par value, and investors in open funds will have to
decide whether to cut their losses or ride out the weakness in the market.
Much depends on the course of Tokyo stock prices over the next few months,
as signs of a recovery will encourage investors to stay with their funds,
while indications of enduring weakness are likely to prompt increased
redemptions.

FT  29 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Switzerland suffers setback
over financial proposals - Fresh controversy over plans for a national
electronic stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to strengthen Switzerland's financial centre have received a fresh
setback with the decision this week to redraft a plan to create a national
electronic stock exchange.
The decision, by leaders of the three main Swiss stock exchanges, comes only
days after the canton of Zurich, which hosts the country's largest exchange
and most other financial markets, confirmed its strong opposition to a
Finance Ministry plan to create a federal securities law.
Both projects could cut into Zurich's approximately SFr50m (Dollars 35.7m)
in annual revenues from securities business related taxes.
However, there is growing anxiety in Swiss financial circles that unless the
exchanges are consolidated and a clear federal law established, the strength
of Switzerland's financial centre will continue to deteriorate. Already,
about one-fifth of Swiss share transactions are made on London's Seaq.
The project to create a national electronic stock exchange has been dogged
by controversy since its 1989 launch. The initial plan was to set up a
system for bond trading only, with the capacity to add on share trading at a
later time. But the continuing slump in share trading volume highlighted the
need to consolidate the then seven stock exchanges operating in the country.
At the end of 1990, four closed, leaving Zurich, Geneva and Basle, Everyone
knew only Zurich had a future.
The project was then redefined, bringing the share trading element forward,
thus offering Geneva and Basle a face-saving way of fading from the picture.
The projected cost of about SFr30m, became higher, not least because the
exchanges were specifying the system match their efficient and reliable
manual settlement procedures.
Geneva and Basle exchange officials became embittered, sniping at their
Zurich cousins for investing in a new building with trading floors that
would be obsolete from the day they opened.
In December, Andersen Consultants, which had been hired to carry out the
project, submitted a definitive plan. After examining it, the exchanges
decided the risk was too high.
'We have decided to stop for the time being the approach we have been
taking,' Mr Gian Pietro Rossetti, president of the Association of Tripartite
Bourses (ATB), said, adding that the ATB was considering two ways forward,
either to buy and adapt a system already developed for Australia's stock
exchanges or to continue on the basis already started.
In either case, it would try to make better use of the substantial in-house
knowledge built up when developing the software for the Swiss futures and
options exchange (Soffex).
He denied claims the change of course was due to the reluctance of Zurich
brokers to invest in the electronic market at this time.

FT  29 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Italy considers FFr10bn issue of
long-dated bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO top borrowers may be preparing to launch offerings in the Euro-French
franc market.
Banks are currently bidding for the mandate to arrange a FFr2bn to FFr3bn
10-year deal for the European Investment Bank, due to be launched later this
week.
Italy, meanwhile, is in discussions with banks over a FFr7bn to FFr10bn
offering of long-dated bonds, according to market sources. The Italian
authorities are said to be considering a number of proposals for long-dated
issues, possibly as long as 20 years. Italy has become expert at raising
long-dated funds, an area of the yield curve which is closed to most
borrowers, having already launched long-dated deals in sterling and Ecu.
Meanwhile, the EIB is also said to be preparing an offering of floating-rate
notes in the Ecu market, which would appeal to Italian investors, who
already buy the Italian government's floating-rate Ecu debt, and for whom
the EIB name offers tax benefits.
In the Swiss franc market, Credit Agricole launched a SFr75m issue of
reverse-floating rate notes, the first use of the structure in the Swiss
market, according to lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation.
The seven-year notes pay interest at 12 3/4 per cent minus the six-month
London interbank offered rate (Libor), which currently stands at around 7
1/2 per cent, to give an initial interest rate of about 5 1/4 per cent.
However, because the interest rises if Libor falls, the issue provides a
hedging interest for money-market funds, which are exposed to falling
short-term rates.
However, the flow of such deals is likely to be limited by the lack of
opportunities in the swaps market.
The General Mortgage Bank of Sweden tapped the Swiss market for the first
time yesterday, with a SFr100m issue of subordinated debt.
In the sterling sector, the Nationwide Building Society added a Pounds 50m
tranche of floating-rate notes to an existing Pounds 150m issue, via Samuel
Montagu.

FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Marine Midland cuts loss to
Dollars 23.8m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MARINE Midland Banks, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's troubled US
subsidiary, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 23.8m  -
sharply lower than the USDollars 164.3m loss declared for the last quarter
of 1990.
In announcing the New York-based bank's seventh quarterly loss, Mr John
Bond, Marine Midland's president and chief executive, held out hope that the
result of substantial cost-cutting and rationalisation of the bank's
activities might soon repay shareholders.
'Despite a difficult economic environment and continuing real estate
problems, we see some light at the end of the tunnel and expect considerable
improvement in 1992,' he said.
For the year, Marine Midland posted an after-tax loss of Dollars 189.9m,
compared with a loss for 1990 of Dollars 295.6m.
This is relatively good news, however, for Hongkong Bank's profits, as any
improvements in Marine Midland's performance should flow through to higher
earnings for its parent. Hongkong Bank is due to report its 1991 results in
March.
Marine Midland ended the year with a tier-one capital ratio of 7.66 per
cent. During the September quarter, Hongkong Bank injected Dollars 200m of
additional capital into the bank. In May 1990, the bank injected Dollars
300m into its ailing subsidiary.
Over the past two years, Hongkong Bank has embarked upon a policy of
down-sizing Marine Midland's operations in the US. It has given up all
pretentions to be a money centre bank and is now concentrating on retail
banking and lending to small and medium-sized businesses in up-state New
York and the north-east generally.
It has virtually eliminated its exposure to LDC debt, has withdrawn from
vehicle financing, and is now taking a tougher line on real estate lending.
These policies are reflected in Marine Midland's balance sheet, which
contracted from Dollars 20.1bn in 1990 to Dollars 16.9bn at the end of 1991.
However, whether Marine Midland will ever be the investment bank hoped for
is doubtful. By concentrating on the north-east of the US, it has opted for
the role of a regional provider of finance - in a region not noted for its
sparkling economic prospects.

proposals

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE Ministry of Finance has been forced to scale down plans for
liberalisation of the country's fixed stock exchange commissions, expected
to be implemented as early as next year.
Recommendations by an advisory panel to the ministry urged that while
Japan's was the only leading stock market where commission rates on
stockbroking were fixed, liberalisation should be implemented gradually,
starting with large-lot transactions.
Fixed stockbroking commissions have been blamed as the main cause of
brokers' payment of compensation to favoured clients. Due to the lack of
price competition, Japanese brokers chose to win the favour of large clients
by offering compensation on their stock losses.
The Ministry of Finance earlier planned to revise Articles 130 and 131 of
the Securities and Exchange Law, the base for the present fixed-rate
commission system. However, the review has been met by bitter opposition
from the securities industry, which argues that liberalisation will lead to
higher small-lot rates, thus driving individuals and other small-lot
investors away from the stock market.
Mr Shogo Watanabe, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers' Association,
yesterday expressed displeasure with the advisory panel's recommendation. He
said hasty liberalisation would cause serious problems.
The advisory panel has appointed a working group to discuss details of
commission deregulation, including the timing of implementation, over the
next year.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance said it had completed its review of the
financial system. Reform bills to be submitted to the current Diet -
parliament - session include the establishment of a financial markets
watchdog, and tightening of penalties imposed on violators of the Securities
and Exchange Law.
The review of barriers separating banking and securities industries, and
interest rate deregulation by the ministry is also underway.
Moody's, the US credit-rating agency, has placed the long-term ratings of
Tokai Bank, a Japanese commercial bank, and its three subsidiaries, under
review for possible downgrades.
Moody's said the review of Tokai's Aa3 rating was prompted by the bank's
'growing vulnerability to asset quality deterioration'. Tokai has been
involved in a series of illegal loan schemes, where non-bank financial
institutions extended loans totalling Y63bn (Dollars 512.2m) based on
deposit receipts, allegedly forged by the bank's former employee, as fake
collateral.
Tokai recently announced it would take over the loans of the non-bank
institutions.

<TEXT>
BOND Corporation, the troubled Australian conglomerate once run by Mr Alan
Bond, has confirmed the scheduled sale of its half-share in Australia's
first private university - Bond University - to EIE International, an
offshoot of the Japanese property conglomerate.
The sale was mooted last year as part of a scheme of arrangement with one of
Bond Corp's main creditors, Australian Consolidated Investments.
A statement by Bond Corp to Australian stock exchanges indicated that EIE,
which already controlled half the university, had paid ADollars 55m for the
second half. This equated to book value, but was well below the ADollars
300m development cost of the university.
Late last year, the university cut staff by 40 per cent, citing
uncertainties over continued funding from EIE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENBEL, the investment arm of South Africa's second largest mining house,
Gencor, overcame declining earnings in its mining and resource-based
investments to lift earnings and dividends by 11 per cent in the six months
to the end of December.
Distributable income rose to R82.3m (Dollars 29.4m) from R74.5m, equivalent
to a rise in earnings per share from 17.1 cents to 19 cents. The dividend
was lifted to 15 cents from 13.5 cents. Earnings for the full year are
expected to be above last year's.
Mr Anton Botha, managing director, said the performance was creditable
considering the fact that 44 per cent of Genbel's assets were still
mining-related. This follows an active realignment of Genbel's investment
portfolio in recent years, particularly away from gold and into other
resource-based equities.
Mr Botha said that to be able to fulfil one of Genbel's primary roles,
namely as financing partner to Gencor, it would probably have to raise
additional capital. This would be in order to participate in some of the
existing, or prospective, large capital projects in the group, such as the
Oryx gold mine, the Columbus stainless steel project and the Alusaf
aluminium smelter.
He said various means of raising the finance were being examined. These
included scrip dividends, borrowings and sales of existing investments.
Gencor has announced that its R2bn rights offer, the largest in the
country's history, has been priced at a 14.5 per cent discount to the market
price. Shareholders are being offered 17 new shares for every 100 they hold,
at a price of R10 per share. The share price is currently around R11.70.

SOUTH Korea's city and regional banks' profits increased to Won1,767bn
(Dollars 2.23bn) in fiscal 1991 from Won1,396bn a year earlier, according to
provisional figures released by the Bank of Korea. Reuter reports from
Seoul.
Aggregate profits after tax rose 12.9 per cent to Won796.5bn in 1991 from
Won705.3bn in 1990. Banks' fiscal years mainly correspond to the calendar
year.
South Korea currently has 13 city and 10 regional banks. Hana Bank and Boram
Bank and specialised banks such as Korea Development Bank were excluded from
the list.
'Bank profits have increased as the scale of their business has grown,' the
Bank of Korea said. Total assets of the banks rose 23.5 per cent to
Won138,900bn in 1991 from Won112,500bn in 1990.
Repayment of loans by short-term finance companies contributed to the banks'
improved results. Return on assets fell to 0.57 per cent in 1991 from 0.63
per cent in 1990, while return on equity-capital rose to 7.3 per cent from
6.9 per cent the year before. Reduced overheads were a factor in increased
profits.
Korea First Bank had the largest pre-tax profit - Won216bn compared with
Won163bn in 1990.
Shinhan Bank again recorded the highest profit after tax - Won116bn in 1991
against Won99bn the year before.

ADVANCE Bank Australia has become one of the few Australian banks to report
earnings growth in the latest period. However, the Sydney-based bank had to
rely on an abnormal gain from share sales for its progress.
Advance yesterday reported a 13 per cent rise to ADollars 20.6m (USDollars
15.4m) for the November half, from ADollars 18.2m. The result came on a 4
per cent increase in revenue, to ADollars 141.2m from ADollars 135.5m. The
interim dividend is up from 13 cents to 14 cents a share.
The result included a ADollars 3.4m pre-tax profit on share sales. In
contrast to most of its larger rivals, Advance reduced its bad and doubtful
debt provisions by 19 per cent to ADollars 14.3m in the half.
Net non-performing loans were virtually static at ADollars 139.7m, and tax
accounted for ADollars 12.4m against ADollars 10.8m. Depreciation charges
eased to ADollars 8.3m from ADollars 9.1m.

repayment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ESTONIA may be exempted from repaying debts to Britain dating from before
the Soviet invasion in 1940. The debts include Republic of Estonia bond
issues worth about Pounds 600,000 (Dollars 1.02m) held by British nationals
before the Soviet annexation of the Baltic state.
Representatives of the Estonian government and Bank of Estonia have met
officials from the Bank of England, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and
Treasury in London to discuss outstanding financial claims between the two
countries.
Britain announced last week it has agreed to return gold deposits to
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The gold was deposited with the Bank of
England in 1940 at the time of the Soviet takeover, and was sold on the open
market by the UK government in 1967 for Pounds 5.8m, much to the Baltic
states' annoyance. However, it seems likely that following the resolution of
the gold issue, Estonia and Britain will waive outstanding claims. According
to Foreign Office documents, Estonia's debts to British nationals amount to
Pounds 609,587, relating to a sterling bond issue and a dollar bond issue,
while Estonian assets - excluding the gold - held in the UK amount to Pounds
492,907, including bank accounts and securities.
Last year, Estonia hinted the state was prepared to honour its debts,
although now this will not be necessary.

FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: USX results plunge into the red
in fourth quarter

<TEXT>
USX, the US steel and energy group, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter loss
of Dollars 394m, compared with a profit of Dollars 267m last year, as both
its US Steel business and the Marathon oil subsidiary plunged into the red.
US Steel, which has been hit hard by the US recession, reported a net loss
of Dollars 165m on sales of Dollars 1.3bn, against income of Dollars 51m on
sales of Dollars 1.6bn in the same period of 1990.
USX is unusual in that it lists the shares of its steel and energy
components separately and attributes earnings to the two separate parts of
the business.
Fourth-quarter losses per share at the steel group totalled Dollars 3.25,
compared with a profit of 99 cents a year ago. The figures included
restructuring charges of Dollars 80m and litigation and environmental
charges of Dollars 49m. Litigation and environmental charges totalled
Dollars 61m a year ago.
For the full year, the steel group lost Dollars 507m, against net income of
Dollars 310m in 1990.
Mr Charles Corry, USX chairman, said both prices and domestic demand had
been down substantially from 1990. While some economists remained hopeful
for 1992, the near-term outlook for the US Steel group was clouded by
continuing weakness in the domestic economy and over-supply in world steel
markets.
The expiration, at the end of the first quarter, of the voluntary restraint
agreements governing imports to the US added to the uncertain-ty.
The Marathon business produced a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 229m, or
90 cents a share, compared with net income of Dollars 216m, or 84 cents, in
the fourth quarter of last year. Sales were Dollars 3.6bn, down from Dollars
4.6bn.
The net loss included an unfavourable non-cash inventory market valuation
reserve adjustment of Dollars 260m, while the same period last year included
a favourable Dollars 140m adjustment. For the year, Marathon lost Dollars
71m, against income in 1990 of Dollars 508m.
Mr Corry said the decline in operating income stemmed primarily from lower
liquid hydrocarbon prices and reduced refined product margins.

ALLSTATE Insurance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck, the US
retail and financial services conglomerate, plans to sell its Canadian
operations, which include property/casualty and life insurance lines.
Allstate Insurance Company of Canada, based in Markham, Ontario, represents
less than 4 per cent of Allstate's consolidated operations, but it is
considered among the top 10 personal insurers in Canada.
The move appeared to reflect Sears, Roebuck's continuing effort to
restructure and focus its capital. This month it agreed to sell a small
stake, worth about Dollars 52.4m, in Seiyu, the Japanese supermarket chain
operator.
Mr Ray Kiefer, president of Allstate Insurance and chairman of Allstate
Insurance Company of Canada, said: 'The move is in no way reflective of the
financial results of the Canadian operation, which has just completed one of
its most successful financial years.' Sears' overall results for 1991 are
due in the next few weeks.
Mr Kiefer said the company intended to seek 'successful new owners.' The
Canadian company may sell its commercial division to concentrate on the
property/casualty and life markets.

charge
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK chemicals markets and a large fourth-quarter writedown pushed Nova
Corporation of Alberta into a CDollars 629m (USDollars 542.2m) loss from
continuing operations last year.
The setback was due largely to an after-tax restructuring charge of CDollars
675m, the bulk of which was applied to chemicals assets. The company said
the charge would boost future after-tax earnings by about CDollars 50m a
year, thanks to lower depreciation expenses.
The net loss for 1991 was CDollars 923m, or CDollars 2.99 a share, compared
with earnings of CDollars 185m, or 55 cents a share, the previous year. The
figures include losses of CDollars 294m last year and CDollars 18m in 1990
from Nova's 43 per cent interest in Husky Oil, which has subsequently been
sold.
Revenues fell to CDollars 3.1bn from CDollars 4bn.
Fourth-quarter income from continuing operations, before the restructuring
charge was CDollars 7m, down from CDollars 67m a year earlier.
Nova said that while its natural gas pipeline business earned 'steadily
increasing profits', earnings were hit by the weak performance of the
chemicals division.
Operating income from pipelines for 1991 advanced to CDollars 365m from
CDollars 279m. Nova transports almost all Alberta's natural gas output from
the wells to export points on the province's borders.
But earnings from chemicals tumbled to CDollars 29m, including a CDollars
16m fourth-quarter loss, from CDollars 373m. While margins have stabilised,
they remain depressed. The company said it expected little or no improvement
in the chemicals market for the time being.

lower earnings

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHELPS DODGE, the world's second largest producer of copper and a leading
fabricator of metal products, reported sharply lower earnings in 1991
because of lower prices for copper and higher production costs.
Results were also held down by reduced prices for carbon blacks, used for
toughening rubber for tyres, and fewer sales of truck wheels and rims to the
recession-hit US automotive industry.
For 1991, net income was Dollars 272.9m, or Dollars 7.86 a share, down from
Dollars 454.9m, or Dollars 13.12, in 1990. Sales were Dollars 2.43bn for
1991, against Dollars 2.63bn in 1990.
Mr Douglas Yearley, chairman, said last year's results were 'gratifying in
light of the state of the world economy'.
He praised the mining division for its solid performance in spite of a 14
cents drop in the average price per pound of copper to Dollars 1.05 in 1991.
The division suffered from higher production costs related to lower ore
grades treated at its Tyrone mine in New Mexico and higher stripping ratios
at its Morenci mine in Arizona.
In the fourth quarter, consolidated net income was Dollars 75.2m, or Dollars
2.16 a share, against Dollars 102.9m, or Dollars 2.98. This included Dollars
8.8m after taxes from a dividend on its 16.2 per cent interest in Southern
Peru Copper. Fourth-quarter sales fell to Dollars 613.3m from Dollars 636.1m
in 1990.

STANDARD &amp; Poors, the US credit agency, yesterday lowered its rating on
United Technologies' debt, citing the group's recent Dollars 1.5bn charge
for restructuring moves and environmental costs.
The agency cut its rating of UTC's senior debt from double-A-minus to

It said the charges reduced the near-term financial flexibility of the
aerospace and diversified manufacturing company and highlighted the

MERCK, the world's largest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday posted
fourth-quarter net profits 20 per cent higher at Dollars 529.8m, or Dollars
1.37 a share. Sales rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn.
Sales growth would have been 2 percentage points higher but for the rise in
the dollar exchange rate since last year, which caused lower dollar
translation on Merck's 46 per cent overseas sales.
The strong performance was led by Merck's newer drugs. The company's
Vasotec, Vaseretic and Prinivil blood-pressure drugs and its Mevacor and
Zocor cholesterol-reducing drugs, brought full-year earnings to Dollars
2.12bn, or Dollars 5.49 a share, up about 19 per cent.
Sales for the year advanced 12 per cent to Dollars 8.6bn from Dollars
7.67bn.
Merck also benefited from favourable tax rates in 1991. Pre-tax earnings for
the fourth quarter rose 19 per cent to Dollars 790.7m and for the year grew
17 per cent to Dollars 3.17bn.
The company said yesterday its new drug application for Proscar, to treat
and control benign prostate disease, would be reviewed by the Food &amp; Drug
Administration's advisory panel on February 4.
Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, New Jersey, turned in underlying
fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 121m, or 90 cents a share, up 15 per cent
from Dollars 105m, or 78 cents, a year earlier.
The company took an after-tax restructuring charge in the quarter of Dollars
3.11 a share which resulted in a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 297m, or
Dollars 2.21 a share.
Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.34bn from Dollars 1.25bn.
For the year, Warner-Lambert posted net income of Dollars 34.8m, or 26
cents, on sales of Dollars 5.06bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 484.9m,
or Dollars 3.61, on sales of Dollars 4.69bn.
Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings rose 15 per cent to
Dollars 559m, or Dollars 4.16 a share.
Warner-Lambert has also increased its annual dividend to Dollars 2.04 a
share from Dollars 1.76.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ Computer, facing severe price competition in the personal computer
market, reported sharply lower income and revenue for 1991 as the company
embarked upon an overhaul of its product and distribution strategies.
Fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 67m, or 77 cents a share, was at the
high end of analysts' estimates but down 51 per cent from Dollars 135m, or
Dollars 1.50, in the same period a year ago. Compaq's fourth-quarter sales
declined by 13 per cent to Dollars 873m from Dollars 1bn last time.
For the full year, Compaq reported net income of Dollars 131m, or Dollars
1.49, down 71 per cent from Dollars 455m, or Dollars 5.12, in 1990. In the
third quarter, it took a Dollars 135m restructuring charge.
Revenues for the year were Dollars 3.3bn, a decrease of 9 per cent from
Dollars 3.6bn in the previous year.
Intense price competition, fuelled by poor economic conditions was the
largest cause of Compaq's lower revenues, the company said.
In October, Compaq realigned its top management and announced plans to
launch new low-cost products that will be more competitive.
These products will include 'low-end and mid-range personal computers in
each segment of the market, including desktops and portables,' said Mr
Benjamin Rosen, chairman. The new products will begin to emerge around
mid-year, he added.
Compaq is also planning new products aimed at the Japanese market.
'In the fourth quarter we made a good start on bringing the company's costs
into line with market conditions,' said Mr Rosen. 'Costs will be our number
one priority in 1992.'
Compaq is anticipating slow economic growth in the US and Europe in the year
ahead as well as relatively slow growth of about 5 to 8 per cent in the
personal computer market, Mr Rosen said. 'The market will continue to be
very competitive in terms of pricing,' he added.
Fourth-quarter gross margins improved from the previous quarter, but this
was largely a result of favourable exchange rate trends, the company
acknowledged.
Earlier this month, Compaq announced it had withdrawn from a technology
partnership with Silicon Graphics, a workstation manufacturer.

preference stock

<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the US automobile group suffering severe losses because of
recession, is taking a further step to strengthen its balance sheet by
issuing Dollars 750m in a new preference stock. This is its third equity
offering in seven months.
The company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a
new class of preference stock convertible into the company's class E common
stock.
Dividends of the E stock are based on the performance of Electronic Data
Systems, the profitable information technology business that General Motors
acquired in the mid-1980s.
The share issue means that GM is using the success at Electronic Data
Systems to bolster the poor performance of its North American automobile
operations, which are estimated to have lost more than Dollars 6bn in 1991,
leading to a group loss of about Dollars 3bn.
Some 12m depositary shares of Dollars 50 will be issued in the US and a
further 3m internationally, while the underwriters will have an option to
buy a further 2.25m.
The issue forms part of a rush to issue new stock by corporate America,
which is trying to reduce the leverage of its balance sheet and take
advantage of the rise on the stock market and low interest rates.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported a 7 per
cent increase in second-quarter net earnings.
It said it had been helped by good volume growth in internationally markets,
where the company has been expanding aggressively.
Net earnings totalled Dollars 523m, or Dollars 1.47 cents a share, against
Dollars 490m, or Dollars 1.36, in the same period of last year. Net sales
rose 9 per cent in the October-December period from Dollars 6.86bn to
Dollars 7.51bn.
The company said the increases were due to 'broadly-based unit volume growth
in the US and international businesses'.
In the first half, net earnings totalled Dollars 1.059bn, 1 per cent up on
the Dollars 1.045bn recorded a year earlier. Earnings per share were Dollars
2.99, against Dollars 2.93, and net sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 14.7bn.
The company said the increase in earnings from unit volume growth had been
partly offset by the impact of lower wood pulp profits, interest and
goodwill related to its Max Factor and Betrix cosmetics acquisitions, and
adverse foreign exchange effects in the first quarter.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said he was pleased by the improving trend in
worldwide unit volume growth.
During the first half the international business had grown at double digit
rates, and despite recessionary softness in the US, volume there had
increased 5 per cent, with growth in most leading product groups.

FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: French computer industry thrown
a lifeline - A look at the result of six months hard bargaining between IBM
and Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, must be savouring her triumph.
The agreements she was able to announce yesterday morning between leading
French and US electronics companies suggest that six months of hard
bargaining have paid off handsomely. The French electronics industry has a
deal worth much more than the sum of its parts.
Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer, which lost over Dollars 1bn (Pounds
562m) last year and which cannot hope to return to profitability until 1993,
expects an injection of about Dollars 100m from International Business
Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer.
It also has access to IBM's most strategic technology, reduced instruction
set computing (Risc), on which small and mid-range computers are expected to
be based for the foreseeable future.
IBM will buy large numbers of portable and notebook computers from Zenith
Data Systems, Bull's personal computer arm, which is struggling back to
profitability.
One of the most important features of the agreement involves collaboration
between Bull and IBM's Computer Design Centre, a collaboration with Apple
Computer and the semiconductor company Motorola set up to design advanced
personal computer chips and operating systems.
This part of the deal alone gives Bull a powerful stake in the future.
SGS Thompson, the semiconductor company in which the French and Italian
governments each have a stake and which lost Dollars 96m last year with
little hope of improvement this year, has a promise from IBM that the value
of its annual purchases of silicon chips including the Inmos transputer from
the semiconductor manufacturer will double to Dollars 100m. It will
collaborate with IBM in semiconductor research.
Mrs Cresson and her government negotiators have, moreover, managed to
persuade Hewlett Packard, the large US computers and instrumentation group
which had been vying with IBM to conclude the technology deal with Bull, to
continue talks with SGS Thomson although Hewlett Packard is not thought
likely to consider taking an equity stake in the Franco-Italian concern.
Hewlett Packard made its disappointment over the Bull decision known
yesterday. It said: 'Bull has made the wrong decision. It is clear the
French Finance Ministry took a decision on financial rather than technology
grounds. It has passed over the opportunity for a long-term solution in
favour of a quick fix.'
IBM was desperate to get the Bull deal settled in its favour and was
determined to deny victory to Hewlett-Packard. The drawn out negotiations
were conducted personally by Mr Michael Armstrong, a former head of IBM
Europe and now in charge of IBM's world trade.
Mr Armstrong said after the announcement yesterday that bargaining with the
French had been tough. 'I'm very glad to be here,' he added.
IBM's prize is two-fold: it will have access to to the lucrative French
government market, something difficult to achieve in France without equity
in a French company, and it will have enhanced its European credibility
before the single market takes effect at the end of the year.
It will have new markets for its Risc technology products which command
lower profit margins than conventional technology and are therefore very
dependant on volume sales. IBM is expected to benefit from Bull's expertise
in 'symmetrical multiprocessing' an advanced computing technique which is
likely to be increasingly important in the future.
For Bull, the deal has a powerful industrial logic.
It has been looking for a US partner to balance the 4.9 per cent stake held
by NEC of Japan. The Japanese company, which supplies Bull with mainframe
technology, broadly welcomes the tie-up between Bull and IBM.
Mr Takehiko Inoue, NEC associate vice-president said the company welcomed
any strategic alliance that would help the business. NEC did not want to see
its investment imperilled.
Risc technology, invented by IBM about a decade ago, is an important part of
open systems, the worldwide move in the computer industry towards standard
components.
While open systems make it simpler for customers to connect together
computers from different manufacturers, they command intrinsically lower
profit margins than proprietary designs and are a principal cause of the
crisis in the world computer industry. IBM, with sales in excess of Dollars
60bn, lost money last year.
Bull failed to catch the first wave of Risc products and is now trailing. To
develop Risc technology from scratch would cost many hundreds of millions of
dollars.
The deal with IBM gives Bull immediate access to proven Risc technology and
offers it a rapid way of catching up with the competition.
It remains to be seen how the alliance between Bull and IBM affects the
future of the European computer industry.
Of the European-owned companies, only Olivetti of Italy has yet to find a
strategic partner.
An agreement to merge with ICL of the UK foundered two years ago on
management differences. It finally collapsed when the UK company was bought
by Fujitsu of Japan.
However, it is a member of the so-called Ace consortium, a collection of
companies sponsoring a particular flavour of Risc technology.

FOUGEROLLE, the French construction company, has mounted an offer for one of
its chief competitors, Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises in a deal which
values SAE at FFr4.6bn (Dollars 836m).
If the bid succeeds, it will create a major force in the French building
industry - with an overall annual turnover of FFr40bn - to compete against
France's construction groups such as Bouygues.
Fougerolle is offering an immediate payment of FFr1,100 for each SAE share,
or FFr1,200 a share payable in one year's time. SAE's shares, which were
suspended yesterday, closed on Monday at FFr920.
Fougerolle already owns 22.8 per cent of SAE and will have to pay up to
FFr3.5bn to take control of all the remaining shares. The acquisition will
be financed by an increase in the capital of Financiere Fougerolle, its
holding company, and by bank debt.
Paribas, the prominent French bank, has already agreed to sell its 5.2 per
cent stake in SAE to Fougerolle. Paribas also owns 47 per cent of Financiere
Fougerolle.
Another of SAE's minority shareholders, Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the water
and construction group, has undertaken to sell its 4.5 per cent holding to
Fougerolle.
Fougerolle also yesterday predicted a 20 per cent increase in its
consolidated net profits for 1991 to FFr400m, against FFr335m in 1990. It
also anticipates a 6 per cent rise in consolidated sales to FFr12.5bn for
the year.
Bouygues, France's biggest construction group, forecast a 5 per cent
increase in net profits from FFr626m in 1990 to FFr660m in 1991. This
estimate does not include a provision related to Bouygues' work on the
Channel tunnel.

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's largest bank, said yesterday it planned to increase
its dividend for 1991 by DM1 to DM15 (Dollars 9.28) per share, writes David
Waller in Frankfurt.
The bank said that the decision to raise the pay-out reflected satisfactory
1991 profits. Last month, it reported operating profits up 22 per cent to
DM5.2bn for the first 10months of 1991 and said it expected a 23 per cent
increase to DM6.3bn for the whole year.
Germany's large banks all reported good figures at the 10-month stage, a
result of strong demand for credit, high interest rates, and strong results
from own-account trading. But Deutsche Bank is the only bank to commit
itself to a dividend increase.
One reason why Deutsche Bank is able to raise the pay-out is that it took
early steps to make large provisions against its uninsured exposure to the
former Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian metals producer, plans board changes which
will give the company's two biggest shareholders more say in management
decisions, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Mr Kaare Moe, Elkem's chairman, is to be replaced by Mr Finn Jebsen,
president of Orkla, a Norwegian industrial company with interests ranging
from paper to branded food products.
Mr Jebsen currently holds a position on Elkem's board. He will be replaced
as a director by Mr Anders Eckhoff, a lawyer, representing Saga Petroleum,
Norway's biggest independent oil company. Orkla owns 30.2 per cent of Elkem
and Saga 12.4 per cent.
The board changes, already agreed in principle, are to be made formally at a
special meeting called for February 3.
At last year's nine-month interim, Elkem reported a NKr367m (Dollars 58m)
loss, before extraordinary items, against a NKr40m deficit previously. It
blamed difficult market conditions for its main products.
Elkem is currently reviewing measures to rein in costs, but last October
stopped producing manganese in Beuharnois, Canada, and implemented plant
closures in Norway.
Mr Jebsen said yesterday that the management changes would lead to closer
co-operation and co-ordination among the owners, the board and the corporate
management. He expected them to trigger an improvement in Elkem's operations
and future results.
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest stock market listed company, yesterday
rejected speculation that it is to merge with Elkem.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Saville Gordon returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J SAVILLE Gordon Group, the property, pipeline and securities trading
concern, staged a recovery in the half year to end-October, reporting
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.35m.
The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 2.43m last time following
writedowns in the share portfolio and a slump in property dealing.
The main turnround came in the securities trading division, which made
profits of Pounds 240,000 (losses of Pounds 3.38m). Turnover improved to
Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 3.37m).
Mr Terry Hutchinson, finance director, said the division would benefit in
the second half from BM Group's takeover of Thomas Robinson, the engineering
company in which Saville Gordon holds about 7m shares.
The first half of last year had been 'particularly unpleasant' for the
securities division. This time there had been more activity and Pounds 5m of
shares had been sold as the portfolio was run down.
This had helped to reduce debt to about Pounds 38m from its year-end level
of nearly Pounds 43m, when gearing was more than 90 per cent.
The main profit contributor was property investment at Pounds 2.75m (Pounds
2.76m). This was virtually all rental income, with dealing adding only
'peanuts', according to Mr Hutchinson.
Pipeline equipment and stockholding, reflecting the group's roots in scrap
metal and merchanting, was bogged down in the UK recession and saw profits
fall to Pounds 636,000 (Pounds 956,000) on reduced turnover of Pounds 10.2m

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Colefax and Fowler dips as US margins
suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING sluggish retail demand in the UK and a weak dollar kept first
half profits depressed at Colefax and Fowler Group, the wallpaper,
furnishings and fabric company.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 1991 fell from Pounds
815,000 to Pounds 505,000 in spite of turnover marginally ahead from Pounds
14.4m to Pounds 14.8m.
Mr David Green, chief executive, said margins had been particularly affected
in the US as a result of the weak dollar as most product was shipped from
Europe.
'We're not much of a price sensitive product but we decided to be reasonable
rather than greedy so that hurt margins a bit,' he said.
The group has not seen any signs of improvement in its principal markets and
does not expect to see a marked improvement in the near future.
Nevertheless, it maintained the interim dividend at 1.3p on earnings per
share down from 2.36p to 2p.
'One wants to give out a degree of confidence,' Mr Green said.
Efforts were being concentrated on cutting costs, although as Colefax was a
service company it was not able to cut employee levels dramatically.
Instead, it was focusing on tightening general controls such as stock
controls and debtor controls, Mr Green said.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Cost-cutting helps Electron House improve
to Pounds 0.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRON HOUSE, the electronic component distributor, reported an increase
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 219,000 to Pounds 595,000 on flat sales of
Pounds 60.1m, against Pounds 60.5m, in the six months to November 30 1991.
Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said overheads had been cut by 6 per cent in the
face of continued adverse market conditions, particularly in the computer
industry. The number of employees had fallen from 550 to 480 in the past
year.
He said: 'A recent strengthening in order receipts has only marginally
exceeded the weakness experienced in the summer and early autumn. The
argument that there is evidence of a sustainable upturn is, therefore,
unconvincing.'
In view of this economic climate, the rise in profits did no more than
justify maintaining the interim dividend at 1p. Earnings per share rose to
1.03p (0.19p).
Control of working capital and lower base rates cut interest payments from
Pounds 1.62m to Pounds 1.17m. Gearing, including off-balance sheet debt, was
unchanged at 120 per cent.
Costs had been reduced in the computer hardware distribution business, in
which the dominant product was printers, and profitability increased.
Nevertheless, margins had been tight because of intense competition and
weakness in demand.
The computer systems companies performed well in some areas and poorly in
others. Success was achieved in certain niche markets, on which the group
intended to build.
UK component companies remaining in the group produced slightly lower
profits on marginally increased sales, the main losses being in businesses
from which the group withdrew last year.
Electron sold Kelvin Impex, the agency company, to its management earlier
this month. Because of new accountancy guidelines, it will be obliged to
write off an extraordinary Pounds 1m of goodwill on acquisition which was
previously written off to reserves.
Mr Leigh said this write off would have no effect on earnings per share in
the full-year results.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Imro failed to protect public - MPs told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT Management Regulatory Organisation, which oversees pension fund
investment managers, has failed to protect the public, a group of Maxwell
company pensioners told a Parliamentary select committee yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Private Companies Pension Fund
Members Association told the Select Committee on Social Security that his
group would like an investigation into the activities of Imro. It had
authorised Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed the Maxwell
companies pension funds, and related companies under the Financial Services
Act.
He cited press reports that Imro staff had reviewed the records of
Bishopsgate just weeks before Mr Maxwell's death and had found nothing
wrong. Investigators' efforts to trace missing assets have focused on funds
missing from the investment managers.
'Whether or not Imro were negligent, it is clear that the authorisation
system does not operate to protect the public,' Mr Trench said, whose
organisation has about 450 members.
'We would have been better off without the Financial Services Act,' Mr
Trench said. 'At least before the FSA, the Department of Trade and Industry
could have organised a compensation scheme.'
The FSA gave a group of self-regulatory bodies, like Imro, the role of
authorising firms to conduct financial business and overseeing their
behaviour.
As a result of the collapse of the Maxwell pension funds, pension fund
members 'are on the precipice of poverty', Mr Trench said.
The pensioners told the Select Committee that existing pensions law had
allowed Mr Maxwell to siphon off the pension fund surplus of every company
he acquired. Mr Frank Field MP, chairman of the select committee, said: 'In
some cases, Mr Maxwell took out of the pension fund surpluses more than he
actually paid for the entire company.'
Mr Trench also recounted for the committee the strenuous efforts Mr Maxwell
made to persuade pensioners to remain with the fund, rather than transfer
out to a private scheme. Members of the private company pension schemes were
treated to a video entitled 'What's the Catch?' in which four young people
discussed the merits of belonging to their employer's pension scheme.
Mr Trench said: 'The best part is one young girl saying, 'Oh you don't
understand pension funds. You think they are run by a lot of old wrinklies
who will only invest in ICI and Abbey National.' How I wish we had those
investments.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fisons plant gets licence for UK after
refit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday said the UK's Medicines Control
Agency had relicenced its refitted Holmes Chapel plant in Cheshire.
Fisons was forced to refurbish the factory after the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) banned two products, Opticrom, a hayfever medication,
and Imferon, a blood product, following the discovery of quality control
problems. Before a plant can start manufacturing after refitting, it must be
relicenced by the Medicines Control Agency.
Analysts expect FDA officials to visit the Holmes Chapel facilities in
mid-March. They believe it may take some weeks after the visit for the FDA
to licence the site. Until then, the two products will continue to banned in
the US.
Last month Fisons said the ban would reduce its profits by Pounds 65m.
Shortly afterwards, Mr John Kerridge, chief executive and chairman, resigned
for reasons of ill-health.
Fisons shares closed up 20p at 369p.

<TEXT>
A marked reduction in visitors from the US in the aftermath of the Gulf war
hit profits at Partridge Fine Arts, the New Bond Street-based antique
furniture and objets d'art dealer.
American business reduced sharply over the 12 months to end-October and was
'not yet showing signs of fully returning to previous levels', said Mr John
Partridge, chairman.
Nevertheless, overall business improved during the second half with prices
of furniture proving particularly strong.
Pre-tax profits dived 47 per cent to Pounds 2.16m (Pounds 4.11m) on turnover
down some 27 per cent to Pounds 9.64m (Pounds 13.2m). Earnings per share
declined to 6.54p (11.77p); the final dividend is cut to 1.25p (1.85p),
reducing the total from 3.85p to 2.25p.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Labour accuses government of negligence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused the government of 'culpable negligence' for not
enacting social security regulations which it said could have helped
pensioners hit by the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
Mr Michael Meacher, the party's social security spokesman, said parts of the
1990 Social Security Act, if implemented, would have saved many pensioners
and employees by creating a debt on the employer when pension schemes are
wound up.
Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, last night rebuffed Labour's
claims. 'It is simply not the case that pensioners in these schemes will get
nothing or be left penniless,' he said.
'Under existing regulations if there are not sufficient assets to secure
what are called Guaranteed Minimum Pensions, the equivalent of Serps (State
Earnings-related Pensions Scheme) then those guaranteed minimum pensions can
be, and would be, underwritten by the government.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Liechtenstein deals boosted MCC profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maxwell Communication Corporation's profits were 'topped up by
Maxwell-arranged deals with Liechtenstein trusts', Price Waterhouse said
yesterday.
The accountancy firm's comments follow years of unease among City
institutions about investing in MCC because of its reliance on property and
foreign exchange deals as a source of profits.
Speaking from Singapore, Mr David Lee, the partner responsible for the
investigation into fraud at MCC, said that uncovering the extent of these
transactions would not be easy because it relied on getting information
about half a dozen secretive Liechtenstein trusts and 'stiftungs'.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm which has audited the MCC
accounts for many years, said last night: 'There is nothing new about the
source of these profits, or the transactions between MCC and the private
Maxwell companies, which were shown in the MCC audited accounts.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Divisions among Maxwell pension fund
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING City houses which managed some of the Maxwell companies' pension
funds were divided last night on their ability to say whether the
investments were still intact.
Imro, the investment industry watchdog, is attempting to find out whether
the Maxwell pension funds managed by independent City bodies have been
preserved.
One obstacle facing accountants and regulators who are trying to trace
hundreds of millions of pounds plundered from the Maxwell companies' pension
funds is that the location of some of the share certificates is unclear.
Most of the missing money was in the Common Investment Fund, a pooled fund
of around Pounds 700m - most of the Maxwell pension money - which was
managed by Bishopsgate Investment Management, a Maxwell-controlled company.
Much of its investments were taken to prop up Mr Maxwell's tottering private
companies.
Accountants and regulators are now turning their attention to the
investments that remained outside the CIF, managed by independent City
advisers.
Most of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension money not in the CIF was managed
by MIM, Lloyds Investment Management, Capel Cure Myers and Lazard Freres
Investment Management.
Legal &amp; General and Scottish Amicable looked after a small part of the AGB
and Maxwell Communication Corporation funds.
A spokesman for Travis Smith Braithwaite, the solicitors acting for the
trustees of the Mirror Group Pension Fund, said that 'more than half' of the
investments managed outside the CIF remained in place and that it was
continuing to search for the balance.
Travis Smith declined to comment on which assets had been traced so far, and
Imro declined to comment on individual members.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: CU establishes joint venture in Poland
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union has become the first UK insurer to invest in eastern
Europe, writes Richard Lapper.
It yesterday announced the formation of a joint venture with Wielkopolski
Bank Kredytowy of Poland.
To date German, Italian and French insurers have been more active than their
British counterparts in exploiting the opportunities emerging as a result of
economic liberalisation in eastern Europe.
CU will set up joint ventures with WBK to market life and non-life products
via the Poznan-based bank's 45 branches.
When operations begin in the autumn, the main emphasis will be on life
business. Non-life activities will be mainly confined to relatively simple
lines of household insurance.
CU's investment in the project is unlikely to exceed Pounds 10m - at least
in the initial stages - and it has no plans at present to develop activities
in other eastern European countries.
WBK, a state-owned commercial bank set up in 1989 and which will be
privatised this year, manages about 350,000 accounts.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BET shares fall 17p as its broker cuts
forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services conglomerate, saw its shares tumble 13 per cent
to 153p in heavy trading before closing 17p down at 159p in the face of
downgradings by analysts including the group's broker.
Analysts have recently turned bearish about BET and forecasts of its
performance over the year to March have recently been lowered by a growing
number in the City.
Last week, UBS Phillips and Drew, Warburgs, James Capel and Robert Fleming
Securities all lowered their forecasts. UBS, which was considered a strong
supporter of BET, cut its forecast from Pounds 158m to Pounds 130m pre-tax
this year and from Pounds 170m to Pounds 140m for next year.
The sharp fall was said to have been triggered by the decision of Cazenove,
BET's broker, to follow the trend. Cazenove would not comment yesterday.
The decision by UBS to lower its forecast and reverse its position to a
seller of the shares was also noted on the market as another key factor.
Analysts expressed concern about the effect of continuing slow business
activity in the UK and the US on the group's services, plant and
construction operations. The expected slow pace of recovery of the UK
economy and BET's involvement in low end business services were not
encouraging.
A further concern was the possibility that BET would cut its dividend. Mr
Mark Shepperd at UBS said: 'I no longer believe that (the dividend) is
absolutely safe.'
With the lower forecasts, the dividend is likely to be uncovered for the
next two years. It would be in the company's own interests to think about
reducing its dividend to allow more cash to be invested in its own business,
Mr Shepperd added.
Last year when BET announced sharply lower first half profits, its shares
gained 5p to 212p despite a 44-point fall in the FT-SE Index. Investors had
been cheered at the time by the group's decision to maintain the interim
dividend at 4.25pand by its improvement in the generation of operating cash.

<TEXT>
EUROCAMP, the camping holiday company which was floated last July, yesterday
reported pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.16m for the year to
end-October.
The figure, which compared with Pounds 5.66m previously, was struck on the
back of a 5 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 49m and after interest
charges reduced from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 470,000.
Operating profits of Pounds 8.63m compared with the Pounds 8.5m forecast at
the time of flotation.
The directors said the Gulf war had hampered business. Total bookings of
about 70,000 camping parties in 1991 were only slightly higher than in 1990.
The company reported large increases in its businesses on the continent with
bookings from the Netherlands and Germany up some 20 per cent and 50 per
cent respectively.
Bookings from the Netherlands accounted for 21 per cent of total business in
unit terms, with those from Germany making up 14 per cent.
The dividend is the 5.5p forecast in the prospectus. Pro forma earnings per
share were 21.1p (19.1p).
Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said Eurocamp's UK bookings up to
the end of December last year were 15 per cent up on the same period in
1990.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF the private Maxwell pension fund schemes yesterday appealed to
the government to intervene and make good pension losses suffered because of
the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
The pensioners and employees of AGB Research, the market research group,
were speaking on the day after it was decided to wind up four pension funds
covering about 4,000 employees.
Mr Mike Kirkham, managing director of AGB International, who could lose much
if not all of his 22 years of pension contributions, said yesterday that the
current status of the funds was horrendous. It was not known precisely how
many members there are or how much money is left.
'We believe in this situation we have the right to look to Parliament to
protect our interests as citizens from criminality and injustice. We look to
Parliament for restitution,' Mr Kirkham said.
Mr Alan Fishman of Clay &amp; Partners, the independent trustee of the funds,
has made it clear that while he hoped to continue paying benefits to
existing pensioners there might to little money left to pay current
employees and deferred pensioners, who have left the company but still had
some pension rights.
The reality of what that might mean was all too apparent at yesterday's
press conference.
Mrs Lola Baker, personal assistant to a managing director of one of the AGB
companies bought by Robert Maxwell in 1988 was told in November she was
being made redundant after 31 1/2 years with the company. The redundancy
never happened.
On December 5 she said she was called by Arthur Andersen, the administrator,
and told to leave the building and not come back. 'To date I have heard
nothing. I don't have much hope of getting a pension,' said Mrs Baker, who
is nearing retirement and has an adult son dependent on her. 'I have got
another small job and I shall just have to keep working as long as I can.'
Mrs Sheila Baker, a former AGB validation clerk with more than 10 years
service, was also unlucky in her timing. She was due to retire in October
but instead chose to work another two months to round out the year. Those
extra two months may result in her losing her AGB pension.
The pension member's association also called for an inquiry into the role of
the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation and in particular the fact
that Imro had approved Bishopsgate Investment Management, the main Maxwell
pension vehicle as recently as last autumn.
Mr John Breadmore, a former regular army officer who ran AGB's computer
systems for 13 years before becoming a private financial planning consultant
yesterday described Imro as 'just a cardboard tank.' He accused the
organisation of spending the last five years honing its rules.
'They have not got the outlook of a forest ranger up a tower, sniffing the
wind and looking for furry animals on the move,' said Mr Breadmore, who is
still receiving his AGB pension but is worried that this might not continue.
The pensioners are associating themselves with an early day motion supported
by 53 MPs. The motion calls on the administrators of Maxwell Communication
Corporation to put the interests of all the pension fund members before the
interests of the general creditors on the grounds that 'the members and
pensioners and deferred pensioners of the corporation's pension funds are
the innocent victims of the unauthorised transfer of pension fund assets'.
In contrast, the motion says, the general creditors 'knowingly and
willingly' did business with MCC and took on the risks involved.
'We will seek to press the claims of the pension fund members ahead of the
banks and other creditors,' Mr Kirkham said.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Volvo faces urgent talks as Sweden bars Procordia deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government and Volvo are to hold urgent talks to try to resolve
the future of Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals conglomerate
in which Volvo and the Swedish state are the main shareholders.
This follows the rejection last night by the Swedish cabinet of Volvo's
attempt to become Procordia's majority shareowner in a share swap deal worth
SKr38.7bn (Pounds 3.64bn).
Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, said at a press conference that the
proposed deal was 'unacceptable' as it would have meant a financial loss for
the state. The government owns 34.2 per cent of Procordia's equity and 42.7
per cent of the voting rights.
The mounting public controversy over Volvo's planned acquisition of
Procordia has cast serious doubt over whether Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's
executive chairman, can force the deal through in its present form.
On a business trip to the US, the Volvo chief said last night that it was
possible to discuss further the details of the proposed offer and reach a
solution through negotiations with the Swedish government.
Mr Gyllenhammar added that he was sorry the Procordia bid had caused so much
political turbulence in Sweden but he remained determined that the deal
should go through.
The Swedish cabinet's swift decision to oppose the proposed merger followed
the unanimous rejection of the deal yesterday afternoon by the government's
own recently appointed privatisation commission.
Mr Curt Nicolin, head of the commission, said that not only were there no
'convincing synergy effects' in the proposed merger, but the advantages for
Volvo had to be balanced by the clear disadvantages for Procordia.
The commission added that in all circumstances the interests of the state
and smaller shareholders in Procordia had to be safeguarded.
Volvo's unrestricted shares fell yesterday by SKr8 on the Stockholm bourse
to SKr390, their level before the proposed merger was announced on Saturday.
Mr Bildt denied publicly yesterday Mr Gyllenhammar's assertion that the
government was informed in detail about the merger intentions as long ago as
last October.

A US-Japanese consortium has won a much-contested tender to evaluate oil and
gas reserves off Russia's far-eastern island of Sakhalin, which Moscow says
will lead to a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) exploration and development
project.
Marathon Oil and McDermott International of the US and Japan's Mitsui and Co
defeated four other teams, one of which included Exxon.
Details have yet to be announced, but the deal appears to be the most
ambitious of its kind to date. The Russian government hopes to conclude
several more agreements with western oil companies to help revive flagging
domestic production.
The deal, due to be concluded on March 31, is for a feasibility study into
the development of reserves estimated at 730m barrels of oil and more than
400bn cubic metres of gas. Such resources are of immediate interest to
Japan, just south of Sakhalin.
A Mitsui official said the consortium had made 'small' changes to its
original proposals after Russia set new conditions, including demands
related to the needs of local people. The composition of the committee
responsible for taking the decision was changed in midstream, he said.
A Russian industry expert said that local authorities in Sakhalin had
pressed for the tender to be restarted from scratch, but that the choice of
the US-Japanese consortium signified a victory for central Russian
authorities in Moscow.
Although the agreement is formally for a feasibility study, the oil
companies are likely already to have reached an understanding with Russian
authorities on profit-sharing.
Moscow is also due soon to produce legislation on mineral rights to clarify
the position of foreign investors.
The feasibility study is expected to take about 18 months. Providing the
facilities and infrastructure would require a further three to five years,
with production likely to begin in the late 1990s.
Russia's Ministry for Ecology and Natural Resources said: 'Given the
extremely harsh conditions of weather and pack ice . . . this will be one of
the largest and most complex hydrocarbon developments ever attempted.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / US health care feud may overshadow Bush speech
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WHITE HOUSE power struggle over plans to reform the US health care system
last night cast a shadow over President George Bush's State of the Union
address, the launch-pad for his re-election campaign.
The high-level feud surfaced only hours before Mr Bush's keynote speech to
Congress, which was expected to include an economic growth package, deep
cuts in defence spending, and fresh proposals for reducing nuclear weapons
in the US and former Soviet Union.
Mr Bush was due to deliver his televised address at 9pm Eastern standard
time (2am GMT). The speech, to be followed today by the fiscal 1993 budget,
has been billed as a platform to buoy his sagging popularity.
But plans for a smooth run-up came unstuck after congressional Republicans
rebelled over provisions for health care reform put forward by Mr Richard
Darman, the president's budget director.
The revolt forced Mr Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff, temporarily
to halt printing of the 2,000-page budget document to allow Mr Darman to
remove offending passages.
Although the White House tried to play down the row, some administration
officials said it reflected a power struggle between Mr Darman and Mr
Skinner over control of domestic policy. It was also a measure of more
profound divisions within the Republican party.
Mr Darman's proposals included a tax on employer-provided health care
benefits for Americans earning between Dollars 100,000 and Dollars 125,000
(Pounds 55,000-Pounds 70,000) a year, as well as higher premiums to be paid
by the wealthy for Medicare, the health scheme for the elderly.
These provisions were aimed at funding tax credits for the poor to buy
health insurance, and tax deductions for the middle class whose employers do
not provide adequate coverage.
Congressional Republicans led by Mr Willis Gradison of Ohio objected
strongly to the plans, arguing that the offer of specific, politically
unpopular, proposals would play into the hands of the Democratic majority in
the House and Senate.
Mr Bush, who has promised 'long-term' solutions to the economy and disavowed
'quick fixes', was expected in his speech to propose a variety of sweeteners
for middle-income voters.
These are expected to include a personal tax exemption of up to Dollars
1,000 per child, a Dollars 5,000 tax credit for first-time home-buyers,
expanded individual retirement and savings accounts, and a health tax credit
for the poor and middle class.
Mr Bush is also expected to propose cuts of up to Dollars 50bn in defence
spending over the next five years, beyond those already contemplated. This
would be matched by a call for a modification of the 1990 budget agreement
with Congress which would allow defence savings to be spent on domestic
programmes.
The State of the Union speech will offer Mr Bush a platform to speak to the
Congress and the nation, but in the coming months the Democratic majorities
in the House and Senate will determine how much of his proposals actually
pass into law.

Lord Hanson's remarks to shareholders yesterday showed a mixture of coyness
and naivete scarcely to be expected from a septuagenarian. It appears that
whoever he has chosen as robust enough to succeed him is too delicate to be
exposed to the public eye. It also appears that he is still perplexed by
ICI's refusal to let him help with its business. Lonrho has shown what can
happen to a company if the founder stays too long. One hopes that Hanson is
not going the same way.

FT  29 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: BET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 10 per cent fall in BET shares, though less alarming than the
collapse a year ago, must have given the group's managers an uncomfortable
sense of deja vu. Then it was worries that BET was about to join the ranks
of failed 1980s conglomerates. Now the concern is about profit downgrades
and the outlook for the final dividend. The heavy trading volume suggested
large investors had decided not to take the risk.
Given that BET was already yielding more than 10 per cent, the reduced
profit figures were indeed less relevant than the safety of the dividend. It
seems curious that the market should be discounting a decision which will
not be taken until June. By then, management will be in a position to survey
a post-election economy. If recovery is anywhere in sight, a maintained
pay-out, though uncovered, might perhaps be justified by the group's cash
flow and financial position. But after yesterday's fall BET will have little
to lose from a cut, so the market's expectation could prove self-fulfilling.

FT  29 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something impressive about the bluntness with which the new
accounting standards regime is going about its business. Companies which are
found to have breached accounting standards will all be named whether or not
they repent, as Williams and Ultramar have done. Judging by the 4 per cent
fall in Williams's share price, the threat has teeth. There is no question
of Williams having tried to disguise its treatment of exceptionals, which is
made explicit on the face of the profit and loss account itself. But it
seems to have come as news to the market that the treatment was in breach of
the 1985 Companies Act.
It evidently came as news to Williams's auditors as well. Perhaps the review
panel should go further and name the auditors in each case, saying whether
the accounts were qualified for the breach in question (as they were in
Ultramar's case). That might prove embarrassing in one further respect. Only
three audit firms are represented on the review panel itself: two of them -
Pannell Kerr Forster and Ernst &amp; Young - were Williams's and Ultramar's
auditors respectively.
The toughness of the new regime was confirmed in another case yesterday.
Electron House, a distributor of electrical components, has sold a business
which it had previously acquired, writing off goodwill in the process. The
new rules say it has to measure the sale price against the original purchase
price, thus producing a Pounds 1m loss for a company which makes only Pounds
1m pre-tax. This year it can treat the loss as extraordinary. Shortly, such
a loss will have to be taken off earnings, which in Electron's case would
mean no earnings at all.

FT  29 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Volvo/Procordia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aside from Volvo chairman Pehr Gyllenhammer and Procordia chief executive
Soren Gyll, it is hard to find anyone with a good word to say about their
ambitious weekend merger proposal. Yesterday's rejection of the deal by
Sweden's privatisation commission - on grounds both of price and industrial
logic - will have thus come as little surprise to investors.
Though the odds are against it, the chances of a successful renegotiation
cannot be ruled out. The government has left the door open, and Mr
Gyllenhammer is a man not easily denied. Selling Volvo's stake in Procordia
 -an alternative solution to the company's cash flow problems - would
represent an embarrassing climbdown for him in the light of the much grander
vision he has just outlined. Admittedly, the state would hardly relish
swapping its shares in Procordia for a less marketable and less highly-rated
stake in a conglomerate Volvo. But the agreement over Procordia which the
politicians cite works both ways. To pursue the privatisation route, they
will surely need the consent of the company's other large shareholder.
The shares of both companies will no doubt continue to reflect the
uncertainty. A prolonged vacuum might encourage further profit-taking in
Volvo, whose price has been strong of late on hopes that the cost-cutting
programme will soon show through to the bottom line.

FT  29 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: The CBI piles on the agony
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,552.0 (+12.1)
It begins to look as if only optimists believe in a double-dip recession in
the UK. The term, after all, implies some attempt at recovery which
subsequently falters. There is not much sign even of that in yesterday's
Confederation of British Industry survey. The overall picture is one of
continuing decline, if at a slower level than a year ago. Particularly
worrying is the way in which many of the forward-looking indicators -
expectations for stocks, capital spending, export orders and output - have
deteriorated since the last survey in October. The only crumb of comfort is
the small majority of respondents still expecting an increase in domestic
orders.
But the climate of electoral and exchange rate uncertainty in early January,
when the poll was taken, means the results are more than usually likely to
reflect short-term mood rather than medium-term trend. This is particularly
true of the basic measure of business confidence, normally a reliable
indicator of economic activity six to nine months out.
Taken literally, yesterday's result suggests output could still be falling
at the end of the third quarter. But if that were in prospect, the stock
market ought now to be in full retreat. Instead, its slide in the last four
months of 1991 seems to have discounted merely an extension of the downturn
into this year's first half. Its modest rally since seems to be signalling a
weak second half recovery. It may be painting a more accurate picture than
the CBI.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter (3): SIB findings on life assurance policy
terminations challenged - and 'polarisation' defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JOANNE HINDLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Life policies oversold', argues for unit trusts to be
released from 'the shackles of polarisation'. But surely the purpose of
polarisation is to help consumers identify the status of a distributor and
determine whether or not it is acting on behalf of its client or the product
provider - ie independent or tied.
Polarisation should have nothing to do with product type and attempts to
make it do so would serve only to confuse the consumer and could eventually
weaken argument for polarisation at all. It would not take too much effort
for distinctions between products to be blurred. For example, where would
one place products such as pensions unit trust contracts, unitised
with-profits contracts, etc?
Polarisation rules should be strengthened to ensure standards of disclosure
of status are improved. It is for the distributors of any financial product
to make every effort themselves to educate consumers as to the efficiency
and appropriateness of that form of investment. However, nothing must affect
a consumer's understanding of the meaning of polarisation and the status of
the distributor.

terminations challenged - and 'polarisation' defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M D ROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In recent articles, sweeping generalisations have been made about the
life assurance industry which require challenge. First, among the leading
life offices such as Scottish Widows lapse rates are at nothing like the
levels referred to. Some 60 to 70 per cent of our policyholders stay over a
20-year period. They get remarkable value for money as do many who for
varying reasons cancel their policies early.
Much is made of the high front-end selling costs of life products. The
leading life companies over the years have helped create considerable
investment in UK industry through saving via life and pensions products. It
is quite absurd to criticise life offices for successfully achieving that
while complaining about lack of sales of other products whose manufacturers
have not devoted sufficient resource and money to their promotion.
Over recent years the tax system has changed, away from favouring regular
long-term savings through pooled investment vehicles; it is time to redress
the balance. It is not disputed that the life industry charges for its
services. What we do argue is that cost comparisons must be fairly based. We
see nothing about disclosure of charges under other savings vehicles such as
banks and building society accounts. What charges are hidden away? How do
real rates of return compare with those provided by life products and unit
trusts?
Little has been said about that because of a seemingly blinkered
concentration on life office charges and nothing else. This cannot be right
and what we seek is not only fair comparison but also balanced debate.

Sir, In three consecutive issues of the FT ('Life policies oversold' and
'Tied agents 'are overselling life policies'', January 24; 'The trouble with
endowments is. . .', January 25; 'City watchdog and the public', January 27)
reference is made to a Securities and Investments Board-sponsored
investigation into early termination rates of life assurance policies. It
seemed to me there must be some fundamental error in the investigation and I
examined the Norwich Union figures included in the survey.
Our first year termination rate in 1990 was 2.6 per cent for 10- and 25-year
endowments - a very reasonable figure. The figure included in the analysis
for Norwich Union showed a level three times higher than this. This has
confirmed my view that the investigation is flawed and I suggest no further
conclusions should be drawn from it.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter: Fiscal policy, better on auto pilot or using a
steering wheel?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J C R DOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan remarks (Economic Viewpoint, January 23) that fiscal
policy is in fashion again. He goes on to hope that we will not go back,
also, to the (as he sees it) benighted practice of varying fiscal policy
according to the needs of the situation (providing stimulus in a slump, and
restraint in a boom). As a survivor from an age when that was normal, may I
comment on each of these points?
First, I am not sure that - even when presented as such - fiscal policy was
dedicated to long-term aims. Whatever the theory, an evaluation of fiscal
intervention suggests that the impact of policy varied a lot year to year. I
doubt whether - in Samuel Brittan's phrase - the economy was, in fact, then
flying on fiscal auto-pilot. Perhaps it would be more true to say that the
authorities did not think that the short-term impact of fiscal policy was
important and did not pay attention to it, and made economic decisions on
this basis without being aware they were doing so.
The experience of these years was not a complete success. In the three years
before 1988, a powerful boom built up. Output grew too fast (3.5 per cent,
then 4 per cent, then in 1987 nearly 5 per cent); stock exchange prices rose
70 per cent and the current balance slid into worsening deficit. Fiscal
policy only became contractionary in 1988, but that was late in the day and
late clues can be painful as the depth of this recession shows.
One reason why 'fine tuning' went out of fashion was the view that it could
make fluctuations worse, because action was taken too late. That view was
probably correct. (A book I wrote in 1964 came to that conclusion - a
conclusion which has been generally accepted.) But in the last decade when,
to use Samuel Brittan's phrase, we were in theory on 'auto-pilot', we did
not seem to do much better. The lesson perhaps is not that we should lash
the steering wheel in one position and not use it, but that we should learn
to drive properly.
Applying that lesson to the present position would mean that the provisions
of the coming budget should depend on how bad the prospects are. If the
government continues to expect that the economy will quickly recover on its
own, it can surely make no case for a soft budget. Only if no strong
recovery is expected in 1993 - as, I am afraid, seems possible - could a
good case be made.
What seems to me highly desirable in any case is that the government should
not ignore the short-term impact of what it does, but should rather describe
and defend it (the Treasury's forecasting machine could easily produce
estimates). Abandonment of this discipline during the last decade has surely
been retrograde. In fiscal policy, governments have in their hands a
somewhat powerful weapon, and it is right that they should say each year
what they are going to do with it. Mistaken forecasts and mistaken judgments
would still be made; but openness is some protection.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Foreign Affairs: Failing the bread test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Islamic or not, no regime can solve Algeria's problems without a measure of
popular support
For the first three weeks of this year I was an FT reader, not writer.
Naturally I watched this space with keen interest, especially last week
when, on consecutive days, it carried two trenchant pieces on
closely-related themes. Robert Mauthner took western governments to task for
condoning the coup in Algiers, and thereby failing to live up to their
democratic principles. Martin Wolf argued that democracy is only a
particular instance of a more general good - freedom of choice, and that
democracy was incompatible with the views of 'fundamentalists'  - a
reference to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), the putative winner in
Algeria's cancelled elections.
I found this particularly interesting to read in the midst of a 'workshop'
on religious revivalism and contemporary politics. That probably sounds like
some solemn gathering sponsored by the Greater London Council in the heyday
of Mr Ken Livingstone. But it wasn't like that at all. It was a highly
enjoyable week-long seminar, organised by a remarkable body called the 21st
Century Trust, which holds such events three or four times a year, always
dealing with some Great Problem of Our Time. What makes the formula unusual
is that the 20 or so participants ('fellows'), drawn from as wide a spread
of countries as possible, are all under 40, and that they have to live
together under the same roof for eight days and nights. The Trust also
recruits two 'senior fellows' to guide them through the conceptual
minefields of their topic (that is where I came in), and invites 'visiting
speakers' to brief them on particular aspects.
One of these visitors to our workshop was Hisham El Essawi, the Harley
Street dentist who gained national fame by a valiant, if in the end
unsuccessful, attempt to reconcile Salman Rushdie with his Moslem critics.
Perhaps predictably, he anticipated Robert Mauthner's argument, suggesting
that 'while the west calls upon Moslem countries to be democratic' it also
'sees its interests threatened by democratic reform in the Moslem world as
it will undoubtedly bring about more and more Moslem rule'. Remarking on the
absence of 'voices of indignation at the cancelling of the democratic
process' in Algeria, he accused 'some writers' of latching on to 'a
statement made by a young man of no authority in the Algerian Islamic
Salvation Front, in which he said words to the effect that democracy is not
compatible with Islam', and blowing it up 'out of all proportions'.
Yet earlier in his talk he had also provided some ammunition for the other
side of the case. 'With regard to Algeria,' he said, 'one wonders how much
of a popular movement the Islamic Salvation Front is. They are no doubt well
organised and well financed by the Iranians who dearly love to export their
revolution, but with the support of only three out of 14m potential voters
one cannot be certain that it commands the support of the majority'. And he
begged us to 'give up your definition of the fanatic as the fundamentalist
or the one who takes Islam literally, for he is not. It is the moderate who
is the fundamentalist not the fanatic'. Going even further, he claimed that
'the concept of democracy is enshrined in Islamic teachings'.
Well, I suppose it is not for me, or for any of my non-Moslem colleagues, to
say whether Mr Essawi is a better 'fundamentalist' than the fanatics, or
whether Islam is more correctly interpreted as enshrining democracy than as
incompatible with it. Nor could I deny that western reluctance to condemn
the Algerian coup is in part a matter of self-interest, prompted by fear
that a FIS government would provoke a mass exodus of westernised Algerians
seeking asylum and employment in Europe.
Nor is it easy for any observer to say with confidence who has authority in
the FIS and who does not, especially since the government tends to arrest
its leaders almost as fast as they are appointed. But certainly more than
one of those leaders, and notably Ali ben Hadj, one of the original two
arrested last June, are on record as saying that an Islamic state cannot
tolerate a multi-party system. The idea that no more free elections would be
held after the one that brought the FIS to power is no mere paranoid fantasy
of western journalists or Algerian officers.
The dilemma, for sincere democrats, is not a new one. As Martin Wolf pointed
out, Hitler came to power through a democratic process. So, more or less,
did the communists in Czechoslovakia. Partly for those reasons, the
Communist party was outlawed in West Germany for the first two decades of
the Federal Republic - and is now illegal in Russia. Democracy works best
when there is a consensus on its basic principles among parties representing
between them a broad majority of the electorate. When that exists, the state
can afford to give equal treatment to anti-democratic parties.
In the absence of such a consensus, can rules restricting participation to
parties which accept the principle of democracy serve as a substitute? Or
will those rules themselves undermine the democratic process, by obliging
anti-democratic parties to dissemble their true aims, and so making it
possible for any party to question the sincerity of its opponents'
commitment to democracy? Can fundamental rights and freedoms be entrenched
by constitutional safeguards putting them beyond the reach of the elected
government? On paper they can, but what if the elected government tears up
the paper, asserting that its own popular mandate is better, or clearer, or
simply more up-to-date, than that of the body which invented the safeguards?
That last question is especially relevant to Algeria, where any rules set by
the incumbent regime were clearly tainted, in the eyes of many of the
people, by the fact that that regime itself lacked any democratic
legitimacy. It is a vicious circle. Some countries have found a way out,
after revolutions or coups d'etat, by forming a provisional all-party
government whose members agreed on a constitution, and sometimes got it
ratified by referendum, before proceeding to hold elections under it. But
would the FIS accept such a procedure? And if it did, would it be bound by
the results in practice?
What sincere democrats would hope, of course, is that over time either the
FIS itself or its supporters could be convinced of the virtues of democracy,
and the rightness of Mr Essawi's version of Islam, so that either the FIS
would accept democratic rules or its supporters would desert it. Presumably
President Chadli Bendjedid hoped to achieve this by a period of cohabitation
between himself as head of state and a FIS or FIS-led government, while the
army was not prepared to take that risk and therefore forced him to resign.
Perhaps the army was wrong, but as a non-Algerian I do not feel confident
enough to say so. What does seem clear, on the other hand, is that the
arguments which convinced Mr Chadli he could not solve the country's
problems without the help of a freely-elected government remain valid. What
led to the downfall of the former ruling party, the Front de Liberation
National, was the same combination of economic, social and moral crisis that
led to the downfall of communism in Russia and eastern Europe. In Mr
Essawi's words, it 'failed the bread test'.
By cancelling the elections the new rulers have at best bought time, and
probably not much time. Let's hope they have a clear idea of how to use it.

Sir, Why do most motor vehicles in the UK have the exhaust pipe positioned

acceptable to pedestrians.

The performance of British industry when compared with its overseas
competitors improved significantly during the 1980s, but is still well below
that of the best, and is falling behind again. Against this background it is
relevant to ask how public-sector bodies such as the National Economic
Development Office (Nedo) can make the most effective contribution to
improving the performance of Britain's industry.
The process of change and improvement in individual companies can be
outlined in the following terms. First, complacency has to be destroyed,
perhaps by imminent bankruptcy or the loss of a big contract. Second, there
needs to be a leader with a clear vision of what can and should be achieved.
Third, there needs to be an understanding of that vision and commitment to
it throughout the organisation. Fourth, the organisation requires the
wherewithal to bring about the changes envisaged, including a climate of
economic stability. Exactly the same process applies at the level of an
industry, or indeed of a nation. It may not be generally appreciated how far
the UK has gone down this road, nor how far it has yet to go.
In recent years, the principal shock to national complacency was the 1980-81
recession coupled with high exchange rates and an environment in which
industry could not look to government as a saviour. That recession hurt the
worthy as well as the unworthy. But the bruises of 1980-81 have now faded
and the current recession is preventing industry from focusing on the
long-term changes that are needed to improve competitiveness still further.
As a result, there is a continuing need for uncompromising analysis of the
performance of different industries to enable companies to measure
themselves against the best international standards.
Over the past four years, Nedo has published reports which pull no punches.
Other organisations such as the National Institute of Economic and Social
Affairs have also published detailed performance comparisons which challenge
companies in the UK. These analyses help with the second stage of managing
change - that of identifying areas for improvement.
One of the great changes in the UK since the 1960s and 1970s is the extent
to which the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry
no longer seek to negotiate on behalf of all employees and all employers.
While they are effective at consolidating and representing the views of
their members, there is no longer a feeling that they can deliver particular
actions such as imposing ceilings on pay rises. This belief in the executive
powers of institutions was corporatism; it was wrong-headed at the time and
it is now dead.
Those who speak of corporatism today, whether in derision or nostalgia, are
simply not aware of the profound changes of understanding and attitude that
have taken place. Change in companies can only be made by those who work in
them, or by those who are agents of their owners. However, in deciding what
to do, managers need access to ideas and a great deal of information so they
can select what is appropriate to their situation. There is no monopoly in
the provision of ideas. Consultants, industry bodies, research
establishments, universities, the government and Nedo can and should make a
contribution.
This is the kind of joint effort that Bill Jordan, chairman of the NEDC
Engineering Sector Group and president of the Amalgamated Engineering Union,
and Ian Gibson, chairman of the NEDC Engineering Skills Working Party and
chief executive of Nissan (UK), described in a recent presentation to the
National Economic Development Council when they spoke of their committees'
codifying and marketing best practice in the engineering industry.
The involvement of a top manager and a top trade unionist in such a
programme is an illustration of the third stage of improving competitive
advantage - gaining understanding of, and commitment to, change throughout
an organisation. Ideas for change, no matter how good, are ineffectual if
they are not understood, supported and adhered to by those who have to
implement them at all levels.
The National Economic Development Council's Sector Groups and Working
Parties involve about 500 senior industrialists and trade unionists, 80 of
whom are chairmen or chief executives in their organisations. Their
involvement both increases the credibility of any recommendations and helps
to ensure their implementation. Government is also a part of the tripartite
process with trade unions and employers. Proposals which demand changes in
government behaviour which are not consistent with the values of that
government are as useless as similar proposals addressed to trade unions or
to managers.
The fourth stage of managing change is providing the resources to implement
that change. At the level of an industry this generally means skilled people
and finance for investment. In the UK, significant progress has been
achieved in industrial training, but the backlog of years of under-training
is a challenge still to be met. Industrial profitability, although improved,
is still not at the levels required for the UK to match its international
competitors.
Among the resources that industry needs is the economic stability which
allows managers to plan for the future with confidence. Discussions at the
National Economic Development Council have helped to build an understanding
of the importance of these factors.
Over the last 10 years UK industry has made progress on all four
requirements for change. However, a successful transition is not one-off but
a continuous process. The challenge for the UK and its institutions is to
make continuous progress under all headings. The National Economic
Development Council's Sector Groups and Working Parties have sought to
become one of the principal agencies that drive this process.

Office.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Reading Lex ('UK tax', January 25) leaves me asking this question. Why
is a part of British industry moaning about the lack of capital allowances,
which would reduce its taxable profits, while another part is saying that
its taxable profits are too low, resulting in unrelieved advance corporation
tax (ACT)?
Never mind the voters' lack of interest in the niceties of corporation tax,
the chancellor, too, must be rather bored by the topic. Maybe if one of the
leading protagonists in the anti-ACT lobby had not got rid of its UK paper
and retail earnings and if others had not over-distributed to save their
skins, sympathy might be extended.

<TEXT>
Sir, Further to your article on companies' financial policies (January 27).
In a number of European countries, for example Germany and Sweden, companies
are automatically charged interest on monies not paid to their suppliers by
the appropriate due date.
This is a significant benefit to small companies which, if they do not
receive payment from their customers, can charge as much as 8 per cent over
the prevailing bank rate. It is therefore advantageous for the larger
companies to pay bills promptly as their interest charges on bank overdrafts
are below this level. The absorption of this principle into British company
law would, I believe, dramatically improve both confidence and liquidity in
business.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Family quarrel at Bundesbank: The ructions that have
followed Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, is not used to being
called a softie. Over the years, the long-time vice-president of the German
central bank, who took over the top job after the resignation of Mr Karl
Otto Pohl last August, has built up a reputation for being a hard-nosed and
sometimes dogmatic monetary technocrat.
During the last few weeks, however, Mr Schlesinger has come under growing
criticism within the ranks of the Bundesbank's 16-man policymaking council.
Some members accuse him of being too compliant in supporting the European
Monetary Union deal agreed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the Maastricht
summit last month.
Mr Kohl bowed to French and Italian pressure by giving his blessing to a
timetable for Emu which would bring about the demise of the D-Mark by the
end of the century. But he failed to achieve his stated target of linking
the move with European political union.
In the months before the summit, Mr Kohl had insisted - with Bundesbank
support - that Europe could adopt a single currency only if there was a
parallel move to a federal state. There is strong economic and political
logic to Mr Kohl's position, as monetary union is likely to be practicable
only if there is centralised fiscal control in Europe.
Only a week before Maastricht, Mr Kohl said publicly that he would not
accept giving up Germany's monetary sovereignty if the goal of political
union remained simply a 'castle in the air'. In fact, 'castle in the air' is
a good description of the relatively vague commitment to political union
that emerged.
In the past, Mr Schlesinger has made it clear that he, too, believes that
monetary union without political union will not work. Since Maastricht, his
comments on the Emu deal have been restrained; his critics on the council
say he should have been more vigorous in pointing out loopholes.
In recent weeks, several influential council members, ranging from Mr
Wilhelm Nolling, the Social Democrat chief of the Hamburg central bank, to
Mr Lothar Muller, the conservative Bavarian representative, have declared
their scepticism over Maastricht - effectively challenging Mr Schlesinger to
do the same.
After a long discussion at last Thursday's council meeting, the Bundesbank
intends to publish a special declaration next month on the Maastricht
outcome. Although the language will be cautious, the misgivings over the
lack of progress on political union are expected to be clear.
The family quarrel among the council members also has implications for
current interest rate policy. Bundesbank insiders say that disquiet over Emu
played a part in determining the size of the Bundesbank's pre-Christmas rate
rises, which upset the rest of Europe. The discount and Lombard rates both
rose by  1/2 point: Mr Schlesinger had favoured a  1/4 point increase in the
Lombard, partly because of the international sensitivity, but was overruled
by a majority of seven to six. (There were two abstentions, and one member
of the council was absent.)
There was a strong body of opinion on the council that Mr Kohl's agreement
to a firm date for the start of Emu made it vital for the Bundesbank to to
emphasise its anti-inflation credentials. Pointing to concern about
Germany's 4 per cent inflation rate and high wage claims, one council member
said yesterday: 'If Germany does not have price stability, the rest of
Europe cannot be stable. A high inflation rate in Germany leads to higher
inflation in the rest of Europe.'
Understandably, the Bundesbank is trying to keep the dispute as far as
possible under wraps. The issue of the Bundesbank's degree of independence
from government caused ructions during the 1990 introduction of the D-Mark
into east Germany. It was one of the factors behind the acrimony between Mr
Pohl and Mr Kohl that helped spur Mr Pohl's departure last year. Charges
that the Bundesbank is trying to interfere in a political process are one
reason for Mr Schlesinger's diplomatic silence in the last few weeks.
The row over German monetary union centred on the conditions under which the
Bundesbank would extend the sovereignty of its monetary policy eastwards.
This time the debate is potentially far more virulent: how and when the
D-Mark would be abandoned in return for a new European currency.
The Bundesbank's misgivings about giving up the D-Mark appear to be shared,
according to opinion polls, by a large percentage of the German population.
The Bundesbank cannot - and indeed does not want to - sabotage Emu directly,
but it can contribute to a climate of opinion in which parliamentary
ratification of the Maastricht treaty becomes difficult.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONGLOMERATION, that unfashionable left-over from the managerial thinking of
the 1960s, has acquired a second wind in continental Europe. Or so it would
seem, in the light of recent corporate manoeuvres in Sweden and France.
First there was Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar's proposed merger, unveiled at the
weekend, of the Volvo vehicle group with Swedish food and pharmaceuticals
concern Procordia - a deal that was yesterday savaged by the Swedish
government's advisory privatisation committee as devoid of industrial logic.
Then came the French plan to merge Hachette with Matra, which would result
in an outlandish-sounding combination of missiles, electronics, vehicles and
publishing. The synergy here, for want of a better word, appeared to lie
chiefly in the presence on both boards of Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere.
The two deals came close on the heels of earlier plans hatched by French
prime minister Mrs Edith Cresson for a three-legged state conglomerate built
around France Telecom, the industrial division of the French nuclear
industry and the consumer electronics arm of Thomson. Precious little
industrial logic there. So why the outbreak of horizontal merger activity?
One common feature, apart from the presence of powerful political or
business figures in the driving seat, is that these deals offer new homes or
partners for troubled companies. A large question mark hangs over future
strategy and operations at Volvo, for example, where the car business has
been deep in the red. Hachette faces heavy losses at La Cinq, the bankrupt
television station. The limping partner in Mrs Cresson's visionary high-tech
grouping, meantime, is Thomson's loss-making electronics business.
Nationalistic sentiment
There is also a powerful defensive and nationalistic strand running through
these deals. Part of Mr Gyllenhammar's case for putting Procordia together
with Volvo lies in the protection it would afford against foreign predators
following the lifting of restrictions on foreign ownership of Swedish
companies.
As for Mrs Cresson, her fascination with 1960s-style conglomeration no doubt
reflects a fondness for that other outmoded beast from the 1960s menagerie,
the heavily subsidised national champion. Profits from the French nuclear
and telecoms industries will presumably now provide a life-support system
for French electronics in such a way as to avoid running foul of European
competition policy.
Difficult trick
The first snag in all this is that the conglomerate trick is an
exceptionally difficult one to pull off. Companies that seek to diversify
away from troubled core businesses all too often botch the takeovers and end
up with more weak businesses. British Aerospace is a classic case in point.
The initial falls in the share prices of Procordia and Matra at the prospect
of having to absorb the respective problems of Volvo and Hachette eloquently
spelt out this risk.
As far as the case for national champions is concerned, the focus of the
argument has now switched from the United States to the Far East. Yet this
ignores the fact that some of Asia's highest-growth economies have achieved
their success precisely by inviting foreign multinationals to generate the
lion's share of the growth. And the payment of subsidies, whether explicit
or hidden, usually proves to be a debilitating distortion for the domestic
economy in question.
Not all of the recent wave of takeovers and mergers in continental Europe
have been devoid of industrial logic. Nestle's bid for Source Perrier can
readily be rationalised as the expansion of a portfolio of international
brands. Krupp's approach to German steel-maker Hoesch was clearly driven by
industrial logic.
The trouble with an active market in corporate control is that it offers an
all-too-tempting escape route for industrialists driven to distraction by
the problems of their core business and an equally tempting playground for
the power-hungry. Shrewd de-conglomeration is a harder game to play and so,
not surprisingly, rarer.

Enzo Berlanda, the new head of Italy's stock market and companies watchdog,
Consob, may be the breath of fresh air the country's financial markets have
been waiting for. While chairman of the senate's finance committee,
Berlanda, 65, played a central role in pushing forward long-awaited
legislation to modernise Italy's financial markets and improve their
'cowboy' image.
His appointment was warmly greeted by the trade - not always the case when
an ex-politician parachutes into a top job in Italy. Milanese brokers
praised his professionalism and honesty in particular.
But with trouble brewing with Brussels over aspects of the stock market
reform and long overdue legislation to protect minority shareholders still
stuck in parliament, Berlanda may need all his political skills in his new
job.
The European Commission has already started to take action over the law on
Sims, Italy's new breed of broking-cum-fund management institution - on the
grounds that it violates the Treaty of Rome by obliging foreign houses to
set up shop in Italy. And with the Rome parliament about to be dissolved,
Berlanda will have his work cut out trying to get the new rules on minority
shareholders' rights in takeover bids passed before the polls.

After four years of trying, the Norwegian corporate predator Torstein Hagen
has finally been offered a seat on the eight-strong supervisory board of
Nedlloyd, the poorly performing Dutch transportation group. As Hagen claims
to speak for over a quarter of Nedlloyd's equity, the event is scarcely a
victory for shareholder democracy.
Hagen has had to make several concessions. He has got fewer board seats than
he wanted. Moreover Nedlloyd says that despite his appointment, which still
has to be agreed by its employees' council, there will be no change in its
strategy, structure, or articles of incorporation. So it is hard to see how
he could push through any radical reshaping of the group.
Whether investors in Hagen's own Marine Investments company will take as
patient an attitude, is another question. They are unlikely to be prepared
to wait much longer for a decent return on their highly illiquid stake in
Nedlloyd.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's first equity
investment in a privately owned eastern European company - Hungary's
Microsystem - looks to be less than a textbook case of how to harness
international equity flows for cash-strapped entrepreneurs.
Microsytem approached Salomon Brothers International for help with a small
equity private placement last May. EBRD, which had hired Salomon's European
investment banking chief Ronald Freeman to head its own merchant banking
operation, also got involved. All went well until Salomon's London office
began feeling the fall-out of the US treasury bond scandal.
Upset by the lack of commitment and high turnover of Salomon staff working
on the deal, Microsystem chairman Peter Vadasz complained to Lord Young, the
former UK cabinet minister and Salomon director, who had introduced him to
the firm in the first place. Vadasz said Salomon's handling of his placement
resembled something written by Kafka, and its 'irresponsible, cynical and
unaccountable' behaviour was damaging his company.
The appeal to Mrs Thatcher's former troubleshooter seemed to do the trick.
Salomon plumbed its own pocket to make up the difference, enabling its
partner EBRD to close its first equity investment in eastern Europe, and
everyone is smiling again.
But it may take a little longer to repair Salomon's reputation in an area
where it was supposed to reign supreme.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Leading Article: CBI adds to the gloom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK economy 'is probably 'bumping along the bottom'', the Bank of England
declared back in August. Yet even the Bank has been proved over-optimistic.
Mr Lamont must now concede that there was no recovery in the second half of
last year. Moreover, employment, investment and output are still falling,
bumpily and painfully. The room for cutting interest rates may be small; but
what little there is should be taken as soon as possible.
The Treasury's optimism has been sustained by a convenient myth: that media
gloom is deepest just when the recovery is under way. But yesterday's gloomy
Confederation of British Industry survey has put the ball firmly back into
the optimists' court.
It would be wise, the cautious may argue, to view this CBI survey with a
pinch of salt. No one knows what might be influencing those who completed
it: election nerves, a desire to influence the government or the previous
night's television news. But this is not an excuse that the Treasury can
employ. The CBI has long pushed the advantages of forward-looking confidence
surveys over backward-looking official figures. But no one has more
enthusiastically backed this view than Britain's beleaguered chancellor.
Economic sense
The Treasury's faith in CBI surveys does, in fact, make good economic sense.
In recent decades, there has been a very close relationship between changes
in its business confidence index and changes in output. While the CBI's
business confidence index was rising, from - 26 in July to +2 in October,
this economic relationship also had considerable political appeal. All of
which explains why the latest fall in its confidence index, back to - 24, is
so worrying, both for the government and the economy. Taken at face value,
it suggests that manufacturing output will fall throughout the first half of
this year. The government looks set to fight an election after the longest
post-war recession, and before the recovery has begun.
This forward-looking CBI survey is already behind the times. Over the past
few months, a pall of gloom has engulfed the UK economy, matched by the rush
of economists to revise down their forecasts for 1992. It is easy to see
why: non-oil output fell in the three months to November, compared with the
previous three; retail sales fell in December and are expected to fall again
in January; high debts and painfully high real interest rates have cut
consumer confidence; even the fall in last year's trade deficit, to its
lowest level since 1986, was largely caused by depressed demand for imports.
Wreaking damage
This combination of sluggish demand and depressed animal spirits is wreaking
damage that will persist long after the election. More companies now than in
the last CBI survey are expecting to cut investment and employment this
year, citing uncertainty about demand as the main reason. The only good news
is that increases in producer costs and prices are at their lowest recorded
level in the past 30 years.
On economic grounds the case for lower interest rates is compelling. Easier
monetary policy would reduce the damage to the real economy that will be
inherited by whoever wins the election. Moreover, there is room to cut:
sterling remains more than a pfennig above its effective floor against the
D-Mark, and almost 10 pfennigs above its official floor. The government
should cut rates and sell pesetas until it is just above its official floor.
That, after all, is what wide bands are for.
Whether the government will choose to cut rates now or later is a political
judgment; it is also one entailing obvious risks. With the short-term
interest rate differential against Germany at less than 1 percentage point,
cuts might have to be reversed if sterling comes under heavy pressure. This
consideration will no doubt tempt Mr Lamont to delay any move on interest
rates until the Budget clears the way for Mr Major to declare the official
election campaign open. He would do better to cut now and, who knows, he may
even sneak a second cut in March.

Dear heavens, don't Americans, or an awful lot of them, make you cringe?
Their obsessive self-regard is so embarrassing. Last week's 40 Minutes (now
run by a woman, incidentally) was about a 'Wild Man Gathering' for chaps who
wanted to 'get in touch with their feelings'. They spent a weekend in the
country living in tents, playing games in the woods, sitting around the camp
fire, and wearing silly hats. Other countries call it Scouting For Boys but
in the US this is called 'male bonding'. To be fair, no self respecting
Scout would be able to weep to camera with the readiness of this little lot.
It was yet another vivid example of the fixation on introspection among
Americans today, all of a piece with psychoanalysis ('I want to know all
about me, me, me') and the women's movement ('Never mind about anyone else,
the world is unfair to me, me, me'). Behind the programme there seemed to be
some idea that the 'real man' movement is a reaction against feminism, but
the more you watched the clearer it became that the feminists now have these
men exactly where they want them. 'There's something about having this man
come up behind you' said one of the Men 'and you can feel his whiskers, and
his arms around you, and he's telling you he loves you and he's fond of you,
that's what we need'. To be just like women, in other words.
And yet . . . it is very difficult not to admire Americans (or an awful lot
of them) because theirs is such a vigorous culture, however shallow and
transient some aspects of it may be. The thought was prompted by last
night's Without Walls on Channel 4, the first of five 'conversations' about
the 'fin de siecle' with Saul Bellow floating in some high glass tower in
Chicago, flanked by Conor Cruise O'Brien and Mario Vargas Llosa. Bellow, who
has always been a bit of an Eeyore, seems to get more pessimistic with age.
He began the programme by asserting that for the first time in the history
of the republic parents now doubt that their children will live as good a
life as they have (do they?) and later made it clear that it is the
demagogues of 'multiculturalism' and the awfulness of 'political
correctness' which induce gloom. But the producers had no trouble in
bringing us people such as writer David Rieff who see matters in an entirely
different light. The point is there is a debate going on, and in the US the
'culture' is something which changes and develops, and is a part of today.
Compare that with the picture of a national culture presented in The
Germans, a series beginning on Channel 4 tomorrow evening. In part, of
course, the contrast may come from the different approaches of the
producers, but whereas America emerges as a society which is troubled
because it is wrestling with the problems of today, Germany seems to be
hunting for a cultural identity which is hidden somewhere in its past,
whether in the church, politics, or social mores. Perhaps The Germans is too
predictable in its approach, but that is unlikely to be making the broad
picture desperately inaccurate. Give a bunch of Martians these two
programmes and ask them to choose one society to live in, and the bright and
lively ones would surely opt for the US. Of course a very, very bright
Martian might say 'If you really wanted us to begin to understand about
these societies you should have screened open-ended studio discussions with
the speakers against black backgrounds, instead of all those busy-busy
street scenes which told us so little. You could have called them After
Dark'.
Possessors of Astra satellite dishes will find that transponder 26 is
currently carrying advertisments for something called The Adult Channel
which, we are told, will open on Friday night, transmitting from midnight
until 4.00 am, seven nights a week. Those interested in a regular supply of
the sort of soft porn which is being illustrated in the advertisments -
nipple arousal seems to constitute an awfully large proportion - must write
to a Bristol address with a cheque for Pounds 28.50 for six months or Pounds
50 for a year. Two thoughts are prompted. First, Pounds 50 for a single
channel transmitting four hours a day, compares badly with the cost of BBC
television. BBC1 transmits about 20 hours a day and BBC2 about 16.5. A
colour licence costs Pounds 77. Thus the cost-per-hour of the Adult Channel,
if my arithmetic is right, will be about seven times the cost of BBC
television: 3.4p instead of 0.5p - and the BBC chucks in five radio networks
for nothing. Secondly, having watched the supposedly 'adult' material put
out on Astra by the Dutch and Germans on Saturday nights, and occasionally
Fridays, and assuming this is even a vaguely accurate guide to what is
available to the new Adult Channel, I wonder how long any real adult will be
able to stand it. The Germans have a regular strand, something like the
Carry On films but set in the Tyrol with lots of lederhosen and regular
bonking: this seems to set both the standards and the pattern for everything
else. The joky and mechanical nature of the sex is about as far removed from
(say) the truly erotic bed scene in Don't Look Now as it is possible to be.
Even in the more serious movies sex rarely has anything to do with love,
sensuality, or passion; it is unimaginative, repetitive, and gonad numbingly
boring.
How does Channel 4 continue so successfully to spread abroad the notion that
it is a 'special' channel, showing radically different material from other
channels, dealing largely in innovation and catering mainly for minorities?
Of course it gets low viewing figures, but is that on its own a good enough
argument? Consider this evening's schedule as displayed in Radio Times. It
begins with The Oprah Winfrey Show, a chat show imported from the US, and
goes on to a repeat of Laurel And Hardy. Then comes another American series,
Kate And Allie (Channel 4 has always screened more cheap American imports
than any other channel). Tonight With Jonathan Ross is the most flippant and
superficial chat show anywhere on British television, which is saying
something. It is followed by Channel 4 News which is good but would not look
out of place on other channels. Brookside is a soap opera which attracts
some 5.5m viewers, about 25 per cent of the ratings achieved by Coronation
Street and EastEnders. Travelog is a travel programmed much like other
travel programmers, Dispatches a good current affairs series, much like
others. He-Play is a series of 15-minute dramas by new writers, an admirable
idea, but one used by BBC2. Golden Girls is another American comedy and The
Secret Cabaret With Simon Drake a variety show. Drop The Dead Donkey
(another repeat) is very funny, but the sort of comedy which might well
appear on any channel. At 11.30 with 291 Club we finally come to an example
of material unlikely to be screened elsewhere: a (sort of) black talent
show. The Jonathan Ross show has another airing at 12.30 and is followed by
a 10-minute puppet show. BBC2 is a far more idiosyncratic network with much
greater success in getting specialist programmers into its Top 10, last week
Food And Drink, Perpetual Motion and Crufts 92 while Channel 4 filled its
Top 10 with three soaps, five game shows, and two American comedies.
Those who reckon that the spin doctors and media manipulators have pretty
well perfected the art of leading the populace by the nose might take note
of the fortunes of Kylie Minogue and Samantha Fox. Huge efforts have been
made to turn both into Madonna-style sex symbols but in both cases the
British have guffawed and changed channels. In her latest attempt to trade
up from the teenybopper market Minogue has made a video in which she pouts a
lot and flaunts her stocking tops, yet no one takes a scrap of notice. When
Fox appeared on the Jonathan Ross show last week and Ross explained what a
jolly big star she is in India, the London audience just laughed. After Ross
had shown a clip of her jerking her big hips in sequinned hot pants they
laughed some more. Perhaps the public is a bit less biddable than the doom
merchants believe.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Arts: London Sinfonietta, Glass and Larrocha - Queen
Elizabeth Hall/Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Sinfonietta has been criticised more that once over recent
seasons for the narrowness of its programming - for keeping faith too
exclusively with the composers of the post-war generation with whom its
reputation was established, and in doing so failing to nurture as wide a
range of younger composers as they might have done.
There has been undoubtedly been some substance to those accusations but the
orchestra's programme on Monday, conducted by Oliver Knussen, was exemplary
in its youthful content: the eldest of the five composers represented was
33, the youngest 21, and only one of them, Magnus Lindberg, could be
regarded as an established, familiar figure.
The proper happy ending to such an enterprising, sparkily delivered
programme would of course have been a revelatory experience, a sequence of
performances bringing into the spotlight young composers of fully rounded
individuality and assurance. It wasn't quite like that; only Lindberg's
substantial piece Joy seemed to be stamped with authority and stylistic
confidence, while David Horne's Out of the Air, first heard in Birmingham
last year, impressed again for its sustained fluency rather than its
striking ideas.
The remaining composers - linked, it seems, by an attachment to Tanglewood,
where Knussen is a course director - generally worked within a middling
post-modern idiom that was as hard to pin down as it was unmemorable. In Rob
Zuidam's Dinamismo di cane al guingazaglio the music was streaked with hints
of brassy Dutch minimalism; for Detlev Galnert's Mahler/Skizze the mood was
dark, compacted and expressionist, while John Gibson's Flight of Fancy was a
suite of uncomplicated character pieces that had Coplandesque hints of wide
open spaces.
The Lindberg piece was at once far more ambitious and demanding. It was
commissioned by the Ensemble Intercontemporain and first played by the group
a year ago; the 23 instruments are augmented by a battery of electronic
keyboards and sampled sounds. There are recognisable Parisian fingerprints -
the synthesised skitterings patented at IRCAM and the discomfiting unison
doublings of live and electronic tones - but they are contained within a
lucid if fractionally overlong scheme that is packed with the big gestures,
the real ideas, that make Lindberg's music fascinating and rewarding.
*****
The very last two adjectives which could have been applied to Philip Glass's
solo piano recital in the Royal Festival Hall last week would have been
fascinating and rewarding; that Glass should feel the financial or artistic
need to embark on such a gruesome enterprise was the only point of interest.
He is a competent pianist, no more, and his playing was spotted with memory
lapses as he riffled through a series of arrangements drawn from his music
of the last 15 years.
Taken out of context Glass's work seems more schematic than ever, though one
is left with some admiration for his scoring, which evidently provides an
edge and muscularity to the textures that his pianism could never imitate.
Perhaps a more brilliant performer might have enlivened the textures, added
light and shade, teased out inner parts; but then more brilliant pianists
would be unlikely to concern themselves with such warmed-up musical gruel.
Alicia de Larrocha is now a member of a select group of pianists, those
whose solo recitals attract substantial numbers of people to the Festival
Hall. The limpid beauty of her playing brings with it an uncompromised
benediction; the qualities of serenity, warmth and radiance have been
distilled by the years. No wonder there seemed to be a notable number of
student-age audience-members on Sunday afternoon: in her manner and style
the least didactic of pianists, she is nevertheless a mature model of
pianistic virtues and graces.
She plays Haydn without the least recourse to point-making, and Beethoven
without letting the faintest touch of pressured, whipped-up urgency mar her
unfolding of argument. Eloquently simple line-shaping, concentration on
colour-shading: these were the features, and the delights, of her Haydn F
minor Andante and Variations and her Beethoven D major ('Pastoral') Sonata,
Op. 28. It is hard to describe both performances without making them sound
placid, lacking in dramatic vitality; and hard to do justice to the shining
musicality with which they were imbued, which gave the impression - rare,
wonderful illusion] - that the notes were singing themselves, free of all
editorial interference.
Upon these composers Miss de Larrocha sheds a light that is all her own. In
Granados - on this occasion four of the best-known numbers from the Goyescas
Suites plus 'El pelele' - she is of course incomparable, the pianistic
equivalent of Victoria de los Angeles in her ability to enrich these lovely
but slight piano reveries with a feeling of what one can only call
civilisation, so that their importance seems out of proportion to their
length and weight.
Over the years Miss de Larrocha seems to have become an ever more patient
expounder of the 'Fandango by candlelight' and the pulsating rhythms of 'El
pelele'. The climax is built with infinite control, over a broader, steadier
span, but there seems no loss of coruscating vitality in the fingerwork.
Precious pianist, precious experience.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Tourists urged to tread green
path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those striving for the label of Environmental Correctness should spend their
summer holidays in Benidorm rather than hiking through the Himalayas.
Taking small groups of tourists to 'unspoilt' destinations can be
environmentally far more damaging than taking hundreds of thousands of
visitors to a resort with a well-developed infrastructure, according to the
environmental charity Ark.
Ark says that the very appeal of 'unspoilt' destinations 'lies in their
ecological fragility: the subliminal sales pitch is 'experience the coral
reefs before they are destroyed'. Destroyed by tourism, that is]'
In any event, 'eco-tourism' to remote destinations accounts for a minute
percentage of holidays taken abroad, Ark says. Anyone thinking of mounting
an environmental campaign aimed at the tourist industry needs to focus on
the holidays taken by the majority of travellers.
Ark is pitching its message at everyone travelling through Manchester
Airport this summer and all 2.5m package tourists flying on Britannia
Airways during 1992. The Britannia passengers will be shown a 90-second
video encouraging them to save water and show some respect for the local
culture of the resort they are about to visit.
Tourists departing from Manchester Airport will be given a glossy magazine
which looks like a holiday brochure, but which asks readers questions such
as whether they have 'ever rolled over luxuriously in the hot sand only to
feel the warm squidgy-ness of old chewing gum welded to your chest?'
The video and glossy magazine are part of a Pounds 75,000 Ark campaign which
is subsidised by Thomson (the UK's largest holiday company and owner of
Britannia Airways), Manchester Airport and the European Commission.
Roisin Orosz, Ark's campaigns director, argues that focusing on
holiday-makers rather than hotel owners or package tour operators is likely
to be the most effective way of making the tourist industry look after the
environment.
'I feel it's not an industry that will respond well to pressure group
tactics. Tourism is a demand-led industry. There is very little
environmental legislation covering tourism, but it will react very fast to
any consumer shift,' she says. If the customers demand facilities more in
keeping with the local environment and culture, the industry will provide
them.
'We have to get tourists on our side. We have to use psychology,
advertising, marketing - all the techniques that are used to get people to
change their attitudes and behaviour. A lot of Spanish resorts are becoming
aware of their tacky image. Without changing it they can see their star
waning.'
An example of the marketing tactics used by Ark is that the glossy magazine
has a cover price of 40p. Nobody will be asked to pay for the publication;
Ark simply believes if that people think they are getting magazines of some
value for nothing the publications are less likely to be thrown away at the
airport or holiday resorts. Later this year Ark plans to begin distributing
a children's activity pack on the environment.
A further plan is for a national opinion poll on tourists' attitudes towards
the areas they are visiting. The poll will not deal directly with
environmental issues. Instead, it will try to assess travellers' perceptions
of the cultures of the countries in which they take their holidays.
The thinking behind the poll is that the more tourists understand and
appreciate the places they visit the more likely they are to want to
preserve the natural, cultural and architectural environment. 'There is a
fear about holidays which makes us want to recreate our own culture when we
go abroad,' Orosz says.
She believes, however, that the more people travel, the more secure they
feel and the readier they are to involve themselves in cultures other than
their own. 'Tourists have come of age. Simply going abroad is not enough
anymore,' she says.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Jobs: A challenge to give some practical help - Redundancy
victim proposes sponsored market for unemployed to sell their skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bit of help is worth a lot of pity.' The Jobs column had shamefully let
those wise words slip from mind since first learning them from its
Lancashire grandmother. But they've just been recalled by a challenge to act
on them in a highly topical context.
The challenger is reader Peter Laurence currently writing his dissertation
for a master's degree in business administration at Warwick University,
where I gather he is studying part-time. For he says that his choice of
subject for the dissertation - 'Recruitment in a recession' - has rebounded
on him. Soon after he chose it, his employer made him redundant.
Which has focused his mind sharply on one particular aim of his studies: to
find ways of re-harnessing the skills of capable people who've lost their
jobs. The personnel chiefs he interviewed had various views on who could
best help. Many predictably, named the government. Several felt the
unemployed could do a better job on their own behalf. But a lot also thought
the media could play a more positive part.
Mr Laurence has therefore made a proposal. It is that the Financial Times
should invite employers to join in sponsoring - say - half the cost of a
regular space in our recruitment advertising pages, in which unemployed
job-seekers could offer their services at a commensurately reduced price.
'Provided both sides of the recruitment fence responded,' he says, 'names
could be selected at random once or twice a week as beneficiaries.'
So what about it?
Well, I'm glad to say the FT's classified advertisement director Brian
Powell shares my view that the idea is worth a try. Indeed, he says that if
it comes off, he'll join in the sponsorship by giving the enterprise a
special rate.
Even so, much preliminary work is still required. The next step of course is
to test support from employers, and I'd be grateful to hear from any willing
in principle to contribute some given sum to costs. Depending on the
answers, we'd then have to decide the amount of space that could be
provided, and how much of it to allow to each job-seeker at what price.
In other words, the last thing I need at the moment is any self-advertising
copy. But never fear, as soon as I do, I'll make it known.
NOW to the table below which offers some partial answers, at least, to a
question the Jobs column is often asked by people who've been offered a post
abroad. It is: if I went to work in such and such a country, how much would
it cost me to keep up the standard of living I have here at home?
As on previous occasions, the figures have been kindly supplied by the
Employment Conditions Abroad consultancy, which acts as a trade association
advising its 700 subscriber-organisations on pay, perks and suchlike in
various parts of the world. Anyone wanting to know more about ECA's
activities should contact Barry Rodin at 15 Britten St, London SW3 3TY; tel
071-351 7151, fax 071 351 9396.
The question of living-costs overseas is complicated because expatriates'
spending patterns tend to vary not only with the country they have gone to,
but with the one they came from in the first place. So the table takes
executives from nine different home countries, and shows their typical
annual outlays when working in each others' lands. They are in all cases
doing the same kind of job at similar rank, characterised by the head of a
function such as marketing in a company of medium size. Other currencies are
expressed in sterling at the exchange rates prevailing in early December.
The first column of figures shows their typical gross salary in the native
country. Then come the sums which, according to ECA's most recent surveys,
the executives would have to fork out to maintain their habitual pattern of
spending both at home and in the other eight lands.
Unfortunately, since expatriates' accommodation is often subsidised to
varying degrees by their employer, no account is taken of housing costs. The
figures cover only consumer goods and services, including durables, as well
as the standard utilities.
FINALLY to a couple of jobs in the City of London offered by headhunter Theo
Stegers of Recruitment Matters on behalf of separate banks, both European,
which he may not identify. He therefore promises to abide by applicants'
requests not to be named to his clients at this stage of the proceedings.
Both of the jobs are in the foreign-exchange field, the first being at the
head of a sales and marketing team, ranked as at least assistant director.
The bank in question has a high credit rating with strengths in FX, money
markets and their option-based derivatives, the headhunter says. And while
it is particularly keen to improve its corporate coverage in Britain, it
would gladly consider other countries and market sectors.
Candidates need a minimum of five years success in corporate sales, plus the
management ability to lead a 14-strong team.
Salary range Pounds 70,000-Pounds 85,000, plus bonus on results, and usual
City-banking perks including car and mortgage-assistance.
Mr Stegers's second offer is a strategic trading post specialising in
high-yielding non-standard currencies, nowadays including those of former
Soviet countries as well as Thai baht and the like. Somewhat unusually.
however, the recruit will not only be striking deals with other traders, but
also selling the bank's FX expertise to corporate customers such as large
companies with holdings of the so-called exotic currencies that they wish to
have exchanged.
Provided that candidates have thorough knowledge of markets for such
currencies, they could either be traders seeking to add corporate sales
experience to their armoury, or vice versa. Salary again up to Pounds
85,000, with similar perks.
Inquiries to 15 Great Eastern St, London EC2A 3EJ; tel 071-377 1600, fax
071-377 1801.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Management: Sell-off generates heat and light - A look at
how regional electricity companies are changing their corporate cultures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the most wrenching privatisation of all. Last year's sale of the UK's
electricity industry drove no fewer than 17 companies from the protected
pastures of state ownership out into the jungle of the private sector.
Each of these companies had to undergo a sweeping cultural transformation to
deal with its new existence, stripping out ingrained practices and replacing
them with new ones that served the demands of the stock market and
competition.
'All of them have a long way to go,' says Terry Neill, a consultant with
Arthur Andersen who specialises in utilities. 'Their thinking is conditioned
by fact that it took 10-15 years to build a power station. It was very
engineering focused.'
Nonetheless, all the electricity companies have put cultural change high on
their agenda. The goals are clear enough. Management must learn to drive the
business to satisfy the market and shareholders rather than bureaucratic
requirements. Staff need to be made more aware of customers, of the bottom
line, and the need for quality.
'Our advice to management is to recognise the scale of the issue,' says
Neill. 'The winners will be those that can execute to the tightest
timetable.'
But there is no obvious route to these goals and companies have adopted a
variety of tactics. Two which illustrate this are Northern Electric and
Yorkshire Electricity, both of them regional distribution companies (RECS)
based in the north-east of England.
For Northern Electric, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the key point is to
drive an awareness of quality into staff. This means teaching each employee
that he or she has a customer, even if that customer is another member of
staff.
'We were not in a British Telecom situation' says Neil Midgley, the quality
improvement manager, referring to the telephone utility's poor reputation at
privatisation. 'We were generally perceived by customers as giving a
reasonable service. But we felt we'd have to improve that service and that
would lead to greater efficiency.'
Northern hired Crosby Associates, a consultancy which specialises in quality
management, to design a plan. This entailed putting 112 key managers through
a four-day course. They in turn trained others throughout the company. Over
a 15-month period, the entire 5,500 staff clocked up some 50,000 hours of
training.
The training has been backed up by team briefings to involve staff in the
company's affairs and keep them abreast of its prospects. 'The bottom line
emphasis is much stronger in management lines,' says Midgley. 'Previously it
wasn't the done thing to talk to the sharp end about the accounts.'
Although Northern expects that it will be several years before the full
effects of this training come through, it already claims to see improvements
in attitudes. Staff have become more responsive to clients, more willing to
suggest ways their work could be improved, and they are displaying a closer
interest in the company's fortunes. The fact that most of them became
shareholders at privatisation helped.
The company's senior management has focused on improving asset utilisation
and cost control, and on refining systems to measure company performance.
David Morris, Northern's chairman, says: 'We are aiming for the biggest
involvement of troops making the maximum number of decisions. It's all about
delegation and motivation.'
At Leeds-based Yorkshire Electricity, they decided to lead the changes by
opening up as many parts of the business as possible to commercial
pressures. This, it was hoped, would produce the desired changes in staff
attitudes as they became aware of the demands of their markets. The
consultants they hired were Hay MSL, specialists in management structures.
The key to the Yorkshire plan was to break the company up into its component
business parts and cluster them beneath a holding company. Each part thus
became more conscious of its identity and its performance. 'We wanted to
know what the contribution was from each business and each had to be driven
by its own markets,' says Malcolm Chatwin, the commercial director who will
shortly be taking over as chief executive.
This involved setting up an internal pricing system so that individual
departments could charge each other for their services.
This, according to Chatwin, 'had a very testing effect'. For example, the
contracting departments which dig holes in the road or install wiring were
made aware that these services could also be supplied by outside
contractors. But departments also became aware that they need not just work
for Yorkshire Electricity, but could supply their services to other
companies as well.
'Commercial and customer pressure has far more effect than management
pressure' says Chatwin.
Yorkshire found these changes easiest to introduce into the non-traditional
parts of the business, like contracting, where time-honoured practices are
less entrenched. But it has also been painful because staff have learnt they
will have to accept swingeing pay cuts to remain competitive or risk having
their business closed down.
The traditional electricity distribution side of the business is proving
more resistant to change, partly because trade unionism is more established,
partly because it remains a monopoly sheltered from competition. But this
year's centralised union pay negotiations for the power industry should be
the last, Yorkshire believes, paving the way to more flexible practices next
year.
Also, as time goes by, the monopoly will be eroded by the reduction in
protection under the timetable established by Offer, the industry regulator.
Although this will add to pressures, it makes it essential that Yorkshire
adjust in time to deal with the new competition.
Of the two approaches chosen by Northern and Yorkshire, the more rigorous is
Yorkshire's - at least in the view of the stock market. There is a sense
that Yorkshire has got most firmly to grips with its business, and that its
strategic decisions must therefore be sound.
On the other hand, the rigour has also created internal strains which could
prove troublesome. For example, the 'market price' imperative which imposed
wage cuts on uncompetitive segments of the business also dictated huge
increases in salaries for top management. James Porteous, the chairman,
received a pay boost of more than 150 per cent last year. The fact that
Yorkshire's profits also soared added to the sense of injustice among staff.
By contrast, Northern is perceived by the stock market to have less
hard-nosed management and to be less certain about the direction in which it
is heading. On the other hand, its emphasis on quality at the point of
contact with the customer has put it at the top of the industry league with
the least number of complaints made to Offer.
John Dean, the electricity analyst at Wise/Speke, the Newcastle stockbroking
firm, points up a further difference between the companies. Northern, he
says, was one of the first to embark on change, in the early 1980s. So it
has been evolving for many years and needs less shock treatment than
Yorkshire. The emphasis it has put on financial controls has also reduced
customer bad debts to the lowest in the industry.
'Yorkshire's approach is the more high profile,' says Dean. 'But both
companies are producing strong results. It's too early to make definitive
judgments about their strategies.'

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Iraqi supergun fired 'using British
parts' - Trade and Industry Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROTOTYPE Iraqi supergun made with parts supplied by a British company was
test-fired four times, on one occasion launching a projectile a distance of
229km (143 miles), MPs will hear today.
The final firing took place in September 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and only three months before the beginning of the Gulf war.
The disclosure comes in written evidence submitted by Customs and Excise to
the Commons trade and industry committee, taken from a report by the United
Nations team investigating Iraq's weapons programme.
The report says Iraq was developing five superguns. The two biggest had a
calibre of 1,000mm and a barrel length of 151m, while three had a calibre of
350mm and shorter barrels.
One of the smaller guns, with a 52m barrel of steel tubes supplied by Walter
Somers, the Halesowen steel company, was constructed at Jabal Hamryne, north
of Baghdad. It was test-fired four times between June and September 1990, on
the final occasion propelling a 67kg test projectile 229km.
Foreign office officials yesterday told the committee the 'capacity for
deception and scale of deception in Iraq' was a main lesson the government
had learned from the supergun affair. Mr John Goulden, an assistant
under-secretary at the FCO, said the British government had been caught by
surprise by the true extent of Iraq's weapons programme.

PRISONS: The government yesterday agreed to a narrower definition of the
proposed new offence of prison mutiny, as the prison security bill
progressed through its final Commons stages, David Owen writes.
The move followed Labour claims that the original wording could have
resulted in prisoners engaged in peaceful protests about minor issues being
charged with the offence, which will carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.
The revised bill states that mutiny occurs when two or more prisoners
'engage in conduct which is intended to further a common purpose of
overthrowing lawful authority in that prison.'
ANIMAL WELFARE: The use of animals for the testing of lipsticks, shampoos
and other cosmetic products would be banned under a private member's bill
introduced by Mr Jimmy Dunnachie (Lab Glasgow Pollok) yesterday.
He said guinea pigs and rabbits had been used for most of the 4,000
procedures for testing cosmetics and toiletries carried out in 1990.
Mr Dunnachie appealed to Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, to refuse to
grant new licences for such tests.
The Animal Experimentation (Cosmetics) Bill will come before the House for
its second reading on February 14, but is unlikely to make significant
progress due to time restraints.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM says recovery under way despite
CBI report - Business Confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY was already under way in many sectors of the economy Mr John Major,
the prime minister, claimed in the Commons yesterday when refusing to be
downcast by the gloomy findings of the latest Confederation of British
Industry survey.
He faced jeers from the opposition benches when Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
Liberal Democrats leader, recalled a new year's day BBC broadcast in which
the prime minister had stated: 'In retrospect we will look back and say that
economic recovery has already started.'
Mr Ashdown called for less time 'talking up false economic dawns' and more
time taking action to secure genuine economic recovery.
The prime minister retorted: 'You are becoming a professional gloom-monger.'
Mr Major insisted: 'When we look back at the present time it will be
perfectly clear that in many sectors of the economy the recovery has indeed
started.'
Later, the prime minister joined Mr Derek Conway (C Shrewsbury and Atcham)
in accusing Labour of trying to 'talk down' the economy.
He said that recent trade figures showed clearly that export volumes were at
record levels even in a worldwide economic down-turn.
Both the prime minister and Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, were accused of
misleading the country over the extent of the recession, and of failing to
take measures essential for recovery by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and
industry secretary. He called for action before the Budget on March 10 to
stimulate investment and the economy generally.
Mr Brown warned in a statement that the CBI survey showed that if no action
was taken 'hundreds of companies, thousands of jobs and millions of pounds
of investment will be lost to the economy before the summer'.
He said a Labour party survey indicated that investment had been falling
faster than at any time since 1932.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Anglo-Irish conference accepts end
to talks - Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH and Irish governments yesterday reluctantly accepted that it was
not possible to launch fresh political talks on Northern Ireland's future
before the UK general election.
At a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast, both sides insisted
that the various exchanges between the parties over the last two years had
been valuable in producing a basis for political dialogue.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Gerry Collins, Irish
foreign affairs minister, said they hoped the potential for talks would be
developed at the appropriate time.
Asked about his own future, Mr Brooke said not only his commitment but also
his enjoyment of the affairs of Northern Ireland had been made consistently
clear.
Security matters dominated the agenda with the Irish government expressing
concern over the case of Mr Brian Nelson, a former Army agent awaiting
sentence in Belfast for terrorist offences committed while he was a member
of a loyalist paramilitary organisation.
Nelson admitted several offences last week arising from an investigation by
Mr John Stevens, Cambridgeshire deputy chief constable, into allegations of
collusion between loyalist paramilitary groups and elements of the security
forces.
Ministers condemned the murder of eight Protestant construction workers by
the IRA near Cookstown earlier this month and reaffirmed their rejection of
any attempt to promote political objectives by violence.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to cross-border security. The use of
lethal force by the security forces and police accompaniment of soldiers on
patrol were also discussed.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties fight on council services -
Citizen's Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO main parties took the Citizen's Charter campaign into the debate on
local-government services yesterday, as each claimed the monopoly on
effective measures to provide quality in council services.
The claims came as ministers emphasised that the government had taken no
final decisions on how compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) should be
extended to local-authority white-collar services such as architecture.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local-government minister, said that although the
government had suggested a 'double envelope' tendering process in the
consultation paper published last November, it was looking to professional
bodies to make suggestions on devising a system.
The process involves considering bids first against a quality threshold, and
then selecting the lowest bid from those which pass that threshold.
But the proposal has been criticised by the Audit Commission, the
local-government watchdog, which has made it clear that if there is to be an
extension of CCT, it would prefer a continuation of the present
arrangements. The commission believes that technical competence and quality
should be judged alongside cost considerations rather than the two elements
being separate.
As MPs began detailed consideration of the local-government bill, Mr
Portillo stressed that it was about improving local services. People should
not conclude that because it talked in terms of efficiency, economy and
effectiveness that it was not concerned with quality, he said.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local-government spokesman, said that the
government's opposition to proposed Labour changes to the bill, such as
those which would enable councils to introduce customer contracts, exposed
its stance as 'hollow rhetoric'.
He warned that ministers would still have 'unfettered power to fix the
privatisation of council services' even under proposals to restrict their
ability to set new rules for CCT.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tecs' value for money to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAIRMEN of Training and Enterprise Councils are to carry out a
value-for-money review of all training programmes administered by the 82
Tecs.
The review was suggested by members of G10, the committee which represents
Tec chairmen, at a meeting yesterday with Mr Michael Howard, the employment
secretary.
The appraisal was agreed during discussions on budgets for Tecs in 1992-93.
Chief executives of Tecs had asked their chairmen to raise concerns over the
budget proposals, which include more training for about the same amount of
money as last year. Some Tecs have said this meant they could not meet the
government's guarantee of a training place to all young people who wanted
one.
Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of G10, said that Tecs had come on stream at
different times and were at different stages of development.
Tecs have complained that their Business Plans - which cover areas such as
help to small businesses - cannot be met because of government negotiators
concentrating on training in their financial allocations. Mr Dancer said it
had been agreed that Business Plans should be important elements in funding
negotiations.
Mr Howard said that in future operating surpluses made on Tec programmes
could be used for any purpose in the Business Plan, and that 10 per cent of
the total Tec budget would be an acceptable level of surplus.
The Department of Employment yesterday launched a series of measures
designed to ease arrangements between Tecs and national providers of
training who deal with different Tecs. Several national providers have
pulled out of Youth Training because they said it was too difficult to
negotiate with many Tecs.

FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tax staff vote to end industrial
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX WORKERS have voted by a narrow majority to end industrial action after
concessions from the Inland Revenue on a disputed performance-pay system.
They voted by 22,865 to 21,283 to accept the interim package, which includes
the winding-up of the staff appraisal system. Their union, the Inland
Revenue Staff Federation, said the system was distorted because of its links
to performance-pay awards. It recommended acceptance of the interim deal,
which will include lump-sum payments of Pounds 300 for about 14,000 staff.
The industrial action, approved by a ballot in December, included an
overtime ban and a 'work to charter' which entailed concentrating on tasks
of benefit to the public rather than those which benefited the Revenue.
Mr Clive Brooke, federation general secretary, said the ballot result should
indicate clearly to the Treasury that industrial relations would remain
difficult in the Revenue unless a final package could be agreed.

defence

<DATELINE>
   A STARK VISION of the future for the defence industry
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
with the possibility of more than 300,000 job losses by the end of the
decade - is outlined in a report due to be unveiled by the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament tomorrow.
The report by Mr John Love-ring of Bristol University's School of Advanced
Urban Studies was commissioned by CND.
Reductions under the government's Options for Change review suggest about
100,000 job losses by 1995, according to the report, which puts current
defence industry employment at 600,000.
But it says the decline for the whole of the 1990s is likely to be much
steeper, and could surpass that of the coal and steel industries in the
1970s and 1980s.
It cites some 30,000 job cuts announced since 1990 and predicts that
employees in production, assembly and administration will be the hardest
hit.
'A massacre of small contractors may occur, while the major contractors face
the danger that a major cancellation or failure to secure an order could
precipitate a severe crisis,' the report warns.
Mr Lovering calls for savings from the defence budget to be used to finance
expansion in alternative markets. He also wants to see the launch of EC
policies to redirect resources. His report says the Labour party's proposals
for a defence diversification agency are 'inadequate'.

FT  29 JAN 92 / The Guinness Trial: Ex-Morgan chief 'not consulted'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell said yesterday that he
had not been consulted about the purchase by Morgan of Guinness shares held
by LF Rothschild, a New York investment bank.
Mr Graham Walsh said LFR had been mentioned to him by Mr Roger Seelig, a
former Morgan finance director and a defendant in the trial, as one of the
'friends' which had bought Guinness shares during the bid battle for
Distillers.
Mr Seelig had referred to LFR in a discussion about placing Morgan's
Distillers shares that had been converted into Guinness shares after being
assented to Guinness's bid. He had also spoken of trying to place shares
bought by 'friends' of Guinness.
There had, Mr Walsh said, been no discussion of Morgan buying the LFR
holding to stop it being put on the market and affecting the Guinness share
price. As the holding was less than half of 1 per cent of Guinness's shares
he would not have thought it would have had any effect on the price.
Mr Walsh agreed that Mr Seelig had been concerned that disorganised sales of
Guinness shares might disrupt the market and jeopardise the company's share
re-purchase plans.
He said he had only learnt about Morgan buying the LFR holding after the
event. He had been irritated because it had not been the first time he had
not been consulted about a large share purchase. He added that his
irritation had not been directed at Mr Seelig.
He said he had assumed that if Mr Christopher Reeves, Morgan's group chief
executive, had authorised the purchase it had been on the basis that the
shares were a good investment.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance director at the Henry
Ansbacher merchant bank, deny fraud and false accounting charges.
Mr Seelig's cross-examination of Mr Walsh continues today.

LUNN POLY, the UK's largest chain of travel agents, yesterday backed down

Lunn Poly's decision to remove the brochures came after the companies had

Pickfords accused Lunn Poly of 'bully tactics'. It said it might proceed
with legal action if it did not get an undertaking from Lunn Poly that it

Lunn Poly said it had agreed to return the brochures to its display racks

FT  29 JAN 92 / Western Isles chief fuels poll tax row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Isles council, which lost Pounds 23m with the closure of Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, was in disarray yesterday after Mr Donald
Macleod, the convener (chairman), appeared to suggest that islanders should
not pay the poll tax which the council has been increased by 470 per cent.
Mr Macleod told BBC Radio yesterday that he had not favoured imposing the
losses from BCCI on poll-tax payers. Asked if he thought people ought to pay
the increased tax, he replied: 'I don't think so.'
Later he stated that he did not support non-payment and blamed his earlier
statement on confusion caused by a bad telephone line.
Mr Angus Graham, another councillor, said Mr Macleod should resign because
of his statements. 'We are now once again into the Hebridean farce
situation,' Mr Graham said. 'He doesn't know what he's saying. I just think
that the best thing that could happen now would be for Councillor Macleod to
step down.'
The council voted late on Monday night to raise its poll tax Pounds 26 to
Pounds 122. Of that increase Pounds 35 is to cover the cost of extra
borrowing to replace the loss on BCCI. The rest of the rise has been caused
by other cost increases.
Adding the council's water charge of Pounds 58, which went up from Pounds
51, Western Isles residents face bills totalling Pounds 180. This is less
than the Pounds 217 they had faced last year before the government cut all
poll tax bills in Britain by Pounds 140.
The council is also deciding how to cut about Pounds 2.6m from current
spending, which this financial year will total Pounds 56m.
The council had postponed setting its poll tax until almost the last
possible legal date after a final campaign to win help from the government.
Last week council meetings were postponed as a delegation went to London to
plead for assistance but failed to see Mr John Major, the prime minister.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Consensus seen on valuing of intangibles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTANGIBLE ASSETS such as brand names and patents are increasingly being
identified and valued, according to a report by Arthur Andersen, the
accountancy firm.
It suggests that there is growing consensus about how to value intangibles
and that such attempts are no more subjective than many other aspects of
valuation.
The research was sponsored by a number of companies which already place
values on their brand names.
Its findings stoke the debate about whether valuations of intangible assets
should be permitted in balance sheets - a controversial approach which has
been criticised by some users and regulators of accounts.
The Andersen report classifies intangible assets under four categories:
Brands including consumer goods brands, trademarks and corporate names.
Publishing rights such as book titles, copyright, and film libraries.
Intellectual property including patents, trade secrets, software and
blueprints. Licences including television franchises, landing slots for
airlines, import quotas and distribution rights.
It suggests that the most common approach to valuing intangible assets
attempts to quantify the value of cashflows or earnings attributable to
ownership of the asset.
The report argues that a 'considerable consensus' on valuation methods has
emerged over the last few years, and that earnings from intangibles can
often be identified and quantified effectively.
It says attempts to value intangibles 'involve a degree of subjectivity',
but stresses the uncertainties are no worse than in other areas, such as
valuing unquoted companies or pension funds.
The report's publication comes just ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the
Accounting Standards Board, the UK accountancy regulator, which will discuss
the treatment of goodwill and intangibles in financial reporting.
Mr David Tweedie, board chairman, welcomed the report as one of several
documents which are helping to stimulate debate. He said the board was
likely to issue preliminary draft statements on the definition and
recognition of assets by Easter, and another on the valuation of assets
later this year.

FT  29 JAN 92 / CBI reports sharp fall in business confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in business confidence was reported yesterday by the
Confederation of British Industry in a report casting further doubt on the
speed of recovery from the recession.
According to the CBI's latest quarterly survey of industrial trends,
manufacturing output and investment are continuing to fall.
It found little evidence of any imminent upturn, though it supports
contentions that a steady increase in growth across the economy may be
visible in the second half of this year.
The survey covered 1,241 companies in 50 manufacturing sectors. It was
conducted between December 18 and January 15.
After a big increase in business optimism recorded in the CBI's October
survey, only one in 10 of companies contacted in the new study said they
were more confident about the commercial outlook than four months ago.
With 34 per cent of businesses saying they were less confident, that gives a
balance of 24 per cent which gave a pessimistic view of the period to May.
The balance of pessimism in the new study is much the same as in July last
year when the recession was about a year old, and on some economists' views
was starting to peter out. The CBI's 'confidence index' swung up markedly in
the October survey, when a balance of 2 per cent said they were more
optimistic, a finding that encouraged expectations about a recovery.
According to the CBI, factors which have reduced confidence recently include
the worsening economic outlook in big export markets such as the US and
Germany. Also, many companies were disappointed that the increase in UK
demand predicted by the Treasury for the second half of 1991 failed to
materialise.
While in the October survey a balance of 2 per cent of companies said they
thought output would rise in the period to January, production has continued
to decline.
A balance of 29 per cent of companies in the new study said production was
down in the past four months compared with the May-September period, about
the same as reported three months ago.
On investment, a balance of 16 per cent of companies expect to spend less on
plant and machinery over the next year, compared with a 7 per cent balance
in October which anticipated a reduction in spending.
New orders, a good advance indicator of economic change, are still extremely
hard to come by. A balance of more than a third of companies said their
order books had shrunk in the past four months, about the same as in the
October survey. A balance of just 2 per cent of companies think orders will
increase in the next four months, the same as October.
Export prospects also appear to have worsened. A balance of 7 per cent of
companies are expressing overall pessimism about the potential for exports,
while in October a balance of 14 per cent were optimistic.
One bright spot concerns inflationary pressures, which remain weak, as
companies try to remain competitive by cutting costs and imposing lower wage
settlements.
According to the survey, a balance of just 5 per cent of companies said they
increased their costs per unit of output over the past four months  - the
lowest figure since October 1959.
On prices, profit margins have been squeezed still further thanks to
companies attempting to build sales in a weak market. A balance of 19 per
cent of businesses say they have been unable to raise domestic prices in the
past four months, the lowest result since February 1959.
In line with the overall tone of gloom, the survey is more pessimistic than
the one in October on the outlook for employment, with a balance of 41 per
cent of businesses saying they will cut jobs.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Health care fracas leaves Darman bruised: The budget
director's embarrassing row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Darman, the most talented, original and mistrusted member of
President George Bush's cabinet, has long been riding for a fall.
This week Mr Bush's budget director finally stumbled, the victim of a
congressional Republican revolt over health care proposals included in the
president's fiscal 1993 budget.
Mr Darman personally penned the proposals, which included taxes on the
richest Americans whose employers pay for their health insurance. On Monday,
just as the printing presses were rolling, Mr Samuel Skinner, the new White
House chief of staff, ordered deletions from offending passages.
The embarrassing last-minute changes amount to more than a power struggle
between Mr Darman and Mr Skinner, who wants to curb the budget director's
influence on domestic policy.
The order to 'stop the presses' goes to the heart of the Bush
administration's dilemma ahead of the November 1992 election: how to
reconcile the short-term political requirements of ensuring the president's
re-election with the need to tackle the country's long-term problems, such
as health care.
About 37m Americans have no health insurance. Yet federal spending on health
care entitlements is growing at an explosive rate, undermining efforts to
reduce the budget deficit, likely to reach Dollars 360bn (Pounds 198.8bn)
this year. At the same time, Democrat presidential candidates have made
health care reform one of their campaign centre-pieces.
Under Mr Darman's original plan, the government would have taxed as income a
portion of the employer-provided health benefits for Americans earning
between Dollars 100,000 and Dollars 125,000, and charged the wealthy higher
premiums for Medicare, the public-sector scheme for the elderly. This would
have helped to fund tax credits for poor and middle-income Americans to buy
insurance or offset insurance costs which employers failed to cover.
Mr Darman, who prides himself as one of the few long-term thinkers in the
administration, argued that his proposals would preserve the pay-as-you-go
principle set down in the 1990 budget reduction agreement with Congress. But
congressional Republicans, angry at the lack of consultation, called the
plan nave.
In part, these suspicions are a legacy of the 1990 budget accord which
included tax increases supported by Mr Bush. Conservatives accuse Mr Darman
and Mr John Sununu, then White House chief of staff, the two architects of
the accord, of betrayal. Many congressional Republicans believe that
forfeiting the 'no new taxes' pledge cost them their best re-election card.
Another factor fuelling resentment is that Mr Darman - in the words of one
White House colleague - 'has controlled virtually every single comma on the
domestic agenda'. His skill at the bureaucratic game helped ensure huge
influence in an administration where the president's mind has often been
focused on foreign affairs.
Since moving in as chief of staff, Mr Skinner has made clear his
determination to broaden the circle of advisers to the president and beef up
the White House domestic policy unit. Inevitably this means cutting Mr
Darman down to size; the health care fracas looks like the first of several
bruising clashes.

<TEXT>
US CONSUMER confidence slipped this month from already depressed levels in
December, indicating the economy remains in the grip of recessionary forces.
The Conference Board, a New York business consultancy, said its closely
followed index of confidence fell to 50.4, compared with 52.5 last month and
76.1 as recently as August.
The dip surprised many analysts who had forecast a marginal gain in
confidence. An index of business sentiment released this week had also
pointed to some improvement in confidence among manufacturers.
Consumer confidence is below the level registered during the Gulf war and
the deep 1981-82 recession.
Mr Fabian Linden, the board's director of consumer research, said the public
'remained uneasy about present conditions and uncertain about the future.'
Economic recovery could not occur without 'a marked improvement in
consumers' spirits and their willingness to spend.'
The board's survey of 5,000 households indicated that lack of confidence was
closely related to poor employment prospects. Nearly one in four of those
surveyed said someone in their household had experienced a jobless spell in
the previous 12 months.
Of those who had recently found new jobs, 45 per cent said they were earning
less money than in their previous position.
The survey indicated that 40 per cent of all households had deferred big
purchases in recent months because of fears over the economy.
The latest figures showed that consumers were gloomier about both current
conditions and future prospects than in the closing weeks of last year.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Cavallo optimistic of debt breakthrough

MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, promises that when he
faces the country's bankers in New York tomorrow for the first round of
formal debt talks, his proposals will be 'realistic, complete and very close
to what we expect to be the final agreement.'
Mr Cavallo wants to restructure Argentina's Dollars 37bn (Pounds 20.4bn)
commercial bank debt this year, a decade after the debt crisis began.
Argentina is now paying only Dollars 60m a month in token interest payments
and has accumulated more than Dollars 8bn in interest arrears.
However, before talks can advance Mr Cavallo must finalise negotiations with
the International Monetary Fund for a three-year extended fund facility
loan.
The IMF is reported to be offering about Dollars 2.6bn, while Argentina is
demanding Dollars 3.5bn. The Argentines also want as much of the loan as
possible to be paid out quickly, whereas the IMF is more cautious.
The IMF is expected to announce today how much it will lend. The facility
should unlock more loans from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development
Bank and the Japanese government.
Argentina hopes these loans, plus available central bank reserves and
Dollars 1.8bn in privatisation receipts, will add up to the Dollars
5bn-Dollars 6bn needed to finance a reduction in the bank debt. This would
be done by offering banks a range of options, including:
Replacement of old loans for bonds bearing a fixed, low-interest rate, or
for bonds with full market interest rates but which are worth less than the
original loan. Payment of these bonds will be guaranteed by US Treasury
bonds. Bankers want as small a discount as possible. Mr Cavallo has been
advised to demand a 50 per cent reduction.
Cash payment of part of the Dollars 8bn in arrears, with payment of the
balance to be refinanced. The more the banks receive in cash, though, the
less will be available to buy guarantees for the bonds.
Permission from banks for Argentina to buy its loans back in the secondary
debt market. Mr Cavallo said he might swap debt for Argentine government
bonds, which could be cashed in for shares in state companies as they are
privatised.
The minister's presentation to the IMF states that GDP will grow 39 per cent
to Dollars 196bn in 1994. Net interest payments on all Argentina's debts
would be equivalent to about Dollars 250m a month, while principal would be
repaid with privatisation revenues.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Israel worried over Iran's nuclear plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL, for years a discreet partner with Iran against Arab powers, has
begun to voice concern over Tehran's military ambitions, saying it is in the
early stages of developing a domestic nuclear weapons programme similar to
that pursued by Iraq.
This week, the defence establishment has alleged publicly that unspecified
German and other European companies, some of whom previously co-operated
with Iraqi non-conventional arms projects, were now working in Iran.
'Israel will not remain inactive on the subject of German and European aid
to Iran in the development of nuclear and chemical weapons and will not
remain indifferent to the active threat of an extreme and unpredictable
regime,' Mr Eliyahu Ben Elisar, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and
defence committee, told Ha'aretz newspaper.
In the past, notably during the reign of the late Shah, Israel itself traded
oil, arms, equipment and technological know-how with Iran, which it
cultivated as an important regional counterweight to Arab states. Contacts
survived the Shah's overthrow, despite the advent of the virulently
anti-Israeli Khomeini regime, and Israel continued to supply arms during the
Iran-Iraq war.
In late 1989, the US confirmed Israel had bought oil from Iran in a deal
linked to efforts to win the freedom of Israeli servicemen held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
Now, however, with those efforts still frustrated, officials say they are
worried by Iranian ambitions to become a dominant regional power, filling
the vacuum left by Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War a year ago. Their concern
has been heightened by Iran's opposition to Middle East peace talks, which
most Arab states have accepted, and its efforts to forge ties with Islamic
former Soviet Asian republics.
In off-the-record briefings, military sources have said Tehran is in the
early stages of a nuclear programme which, if successful, could produce an
'Islamic bomb' by the end of the decade. They say it is modelled on the
Iraqi efforts to acquire foreign technology.
They say Iran is seeking co-operation with China and Pakistan, having
ordered a small reactor and acquired a 'calutron' isotope isolation device
from Beijing for research purposes. It is also trying to buy a 5-10 megawatt
reactor from India.
The sources say Israel has no evidence that Soviet nuclear scientists have
been brought to Iran, as some reports have suggested. But they say links
have been made with European companies -which they did not name - for the
supply of equipment with nuclear uses.
Israel is also worried by Iran's conventional forces. The sources say Tehran
acquired 'several dozen' 500km-range, Scud-C ballistic missiles from North
Korea last year to add to its shorter-range Scud-B rockets, and has plans to
acquire longer-range missiles.
Iran, the sources say, has shown no sign of giving back more than 100 Iraqi
jets whose pilots flew them across the border during the Gulf War.

A LEADING Gulf business figure yesterday told other Arabs hoping for

of money, Reuter reports from Abu Dhabi.
Mr Haj Abdullah al-Mohairbi, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, said: 'With the exception of the Gulf monarchies, the rest of
the Arab world is bad for both short- and long-term investment.'
Political instability 'discourages potential investors from throwing their
money into these troubled regions.'
Similar views are increasingly heard in private conversations but few have
expressed them so openly.
'Name one Arab country that enjoys full security and stability and both the
public and private sectors in the Gulf states would not hesitate to invest
their money and resources in it,' said Mr Mohairbi, who is also the deputy
speaker of the United Arab Emirates Consultative Council.
'Following the invasion of Kuwait. . .Gulf states became convinced that
prospects for investing in non-oil-producing Arab countries did not exist.'

NEARLY 140,000 workers in 53 jute mills in West Bengal, India, went on
strike yesterday for more pay, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta.
Trade unions have supported the strike but have exempted the five jute mills
owned by the government and a unit managed by a workers' co-operative.
The Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) said jute mill workers' wages
compared favourably with those prevailing in other industries.
It admitted that eight jute mills were paying substantially lower wages in
violation of a 1988 pay agreement. But these were not members of the IJMA.
The IJMA wanted rises tied to productivity.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN police yesterday arrested 10 white extremist leaders,
including Mr Eugene Terreblanche, leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), in connection with violence which erupted last
year when the AWB held a protest against the government's political reforms.
The arrests could provoke further violence from the extreme right, which has
become increasingly radical as Pretoria moves ever closer to sharing power
with blacks in an interim government.
The extreme right, including the parliamentary opposition, the Conservative
party, has refused to participate in multi-party talks to draw up a
post-apartheid constitution, insisting on a return to classic apartheid.
In his speech at the opening of parliament last week, President F. W. de
Klerk tried to split the Conservatives by offering to discuss the notion of
a separate white homeland in the multi-party talks. Some fringe groups will
now enter the talks on that basis, but it seems unlikely that the
Conservatives - or any big faction of the party - will do so at this stage.
Mr Terreblanche and nine other leaders of the AWB (its name means Afrikaner
resistance movement) were picked up by police at their homes early
yesterday, and were later released on bail. They are to be charged with
causing public violence when they attempted to disrupt a public meeting
addressed by Mr de Klerk in the western Transvaal town of Ventersdorp.
Two AWB members and a black passer-by died when about 300 AWB members
clashed with police. Mr Terreblanche told a press conference last week that
he could prove that police had opened fire in Ventersdorp without
provocation. Ventersdorp is Mr Terreblanche's home town and the headquarters
of his movement.
The clash proved the loyalty of the South African police - many of whom hold
right-wing political views - to their commanders. But it also highlighted
the threat posed by the right: as there is no constitutional means of
removing Mr de Klerk from power (because of the ruling Nationalists' large
majority in parliament), white terrorism could become the only outlet for
dissent.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Economic Planning Agency yesterday said the economy was in a period
of correction, or adjustment, for the first time in 15 years.
The agency's monthly report, although cautious, painted a picture of
underlying strength. It said consumer spending remained firm, and while
capital spending was not expanding, it remained at high levels. The agency
also saw signs that the decline in home construction had bottomed out.
The 'correction' referred to in the report was a shift of the economy to
non-inflationary stable growth. Use of the term amounted to a recognition by
the agency that some sectors of the economy were undergoing strain. The
report also cited a number of government measures to support the economy,
including the pre-New Year cut in the official discount rate by half a point
to 4.5 per cent, and budget proposals to boost public infrastructure
investment.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday said
industrial production in December was 1.4 per cent lower than in December
1990. This was the third consecutive month to register a year-on-year
decline. December's output was also 0.9 per cent lower than November's.
Perhaps most worrisome is the continuing steady rise in inventories, which
could foreshadow further cuts in production in coming months as
manufacturers try to balance output with demand. Inventories rose by 1.6 per
cent over November, leaving the index of inventories 12.8 per cent higher
than a year ago.
In total, industrial production expanded by 2.1 per cent in 1991, the lowest
rate of growth since 1986.

<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S former ruling party, divided by the collapse of a three-year
experiment in democracy, decided yesterday to call a national conference,
Reuter reports from Algiers.
The National Liberation Front central committee, which began an emergency
meeting on Saturday, failed to decide whether to support the nation's new
rulers and whether the party's leadership should be changed.
FLN secretary-general Abdelhamid Mehri was a supporter of former President
Chadli Benjedid's democratic reforms, which were scrapped after Islamic
fundamentalists gained an unbeatable lead in the country's first multi-party
parliamentary election.
Many in the party want to endorse this month's army-backed upheaval in which
Mr Chadli resigned, the half-finished election was cancelled and
fundamentalist preachers were ordered to keep politics out of the mosques.
The new FLN meeting will include central committee members and
representatives of the rank and file.
Mr Mehri suggested yesterday that the emergency meeting be suspended and the
conference held.
'If the central committee wants me to announce my resignation to facilitate
things, I am ready to do so,' he told the committee.
He has faced a barrage of criticism from party ranks after he described the
new presidential council, headed by formerly exiled FLN dissident Mohamed
Boudiaf, as unconstitutional, and held talks with Islamic fundamentalists.
He first suggested the 15-man political bureau he heads should resign en
masse, but at a session on Monday offered only his own resignation.
The BBC, quoting Algiers radio, said early yesterday the FLN political
bureau had resigned. Committee members said no decision on a leadership
change had been taken.

FT  29 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Long wait for mobile-phone calls home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIKO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL travellers hoping to ring home from round the world by
hand-held mobile phones are likely to have a long wait, judging by the
problems a top contender is having, Michiko Nakamoto writes.
Iridium, a subsidiary of Motorola, the US electronics group, which is a
leading contender to provide global satellite communications systems, is
having trouble enlisting widespread international support for its proposed
system.
The group, planning to start up a global satellite communications system
using hand-held phones by 1997, has had to modify its proposed system, which
will use a constellation of 77 low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, to make it
more marketable than in its original form.
Iridium proposes making its process complementary to, rather than in
competition with, terrestrial cellular systems, by allowing subscribers to
use the same handsets for cellular systems as well as its satellite one.
The move follows the group's failure to win enough financing in the first
phase of its Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.76bn) project before a self-imposed
deadline last November.
Iridium postponed the closing on November 15 of an international private
placing of its shares aimed at raising Dollars 175m until after an
international conference in Spain where radio spectrum allocations will be
considered for various applications, including mobile satellite systems.
Publicly, the group contends its decision to postpone the closing was to
accommodate a number of prospective European investors unwilling to make
pledges ahead of the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC-92), set
for Torremolinos, Spain, from February 3 to March 3. If the WARC does not
allocate the necessary spectrum, introduction of Iridium's proposed system
could be delayed.
Mr Leo Mondale, Iridium's vice-president for international relations,
admitted financing did not depend entirely on the WARC decision. 'I can't
say yes, we have cheques from all these people subject to the result of the
WARC,' he said.
The problems are not only financial. Global communications systems need
international political acceptance to start up. With four to six groups
proposing varying systems, the competition and political manoeuvres are only
just beginning.
Iridium has already run up against Inmarsat, the international consortium
backed by its 64-member countries, which provides global communications
systems via satellite to ships and aircraft.
Inmarsat has its own plans to develop a global hand-held communications
system but does not expect to launch this until the end of the decade. In an
attempt to enlist Inmarsat's support, Iridium stresses it would lease
capacity to Inmarsat members and has approached some individually.
Separately, the US group claims potential competitors, including Inmarsat,
would like to see the decision on spectrum allocation delayed, to stop
Iridium gaining a head start.
Inmarsat maintains it favours spectrum allocation. But if allocation is to
be made, it should be open to all satellite systems.

A San Francisco federal court has upheld a secondary ban on third countries
re-exporting Mexican and Venezuelan tuna to the US, in another twist to the
row over dolphin-killing by Mexican tuna fishermen, Damian Fraser reports
from Mexico City.
The federal court gave 27 countries until Friday to prove they were not
re-exporting Mexican or Venezuelan tuna, which under the Marine Mammal
Protection Act is banned from the US. Countries not complying with the court
order will be included in the embargo. The main Mexican and Venezuelan
'tuna-launderers', according to San Francisco environmentalists, are Japan,
Italy, Spain, France, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia.
US law, upheld by a federal court last February, mandates an embargo on a
country's tuna exports if the fleet's average dolphin mortality rate is 25
per cent higher than the US's. In August the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade found the US could not use trade curbs to impose environmental
laws on Mexico in this instance, and the embargo violated Gatt rules. In
September Mexico dropped the Gatt case. A solution has yet to be found.

cuts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean)
signed a mutual tariff reduction agreement yesterday at the end of their
summit, and said they wanted an Asean free trade area in 15 years or less.
But the low level of intra-Asean trade, and the inclusion of clauses
allowing individual countries to exempt sensitive products from the tariff
cuts, suggest the pact's success depends more on Asean's determination than
on the small print.
Mr Anand Panyarachun, Thai premier and the pact's promoter, said he would
ensure that Thailand's tariffs for manufactured products imported from Asean
(grouping Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore and
Brunei) were no more than 30 per cent by the start of next year. He promised
to try to cut them to 20 per cent by 1994, and to reduce rates for the 15
sectors chosen by Asean for accelerated cuts to below 5 per cent as soon as
possible.
Ms Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's international trade and industry minister, said
the country had identified numerous products for which Malaysian tariffs
could be set at 0-20 per cent next year; cars and probably cement would be
excluded for the time being. Manila also wants to be exempted from tariff
cuts on cement.
The agreement on the common effective preferential tariff (CEPT) scheme,
linked to a more general economic co-operation pact, is restricted to
products with an Asean content of at least 40 per cent and covers
manufactured, processed agricultural and capital goods but not agricultural
raw materials. Starting on January 1 1993, tariffs are to be cut to 20 per
cent within five to eight years, preferably year by year, and the aim is for
the tariffs to fall below 5 per cent in the subsequent even years.
Governments can move faster if they want, but they can also put 'sensitive'
products on an exclusion list, or use 'emergency measures' to suspend tariff
preferences if imports threaten to cause 'serious injury' to a domestic
economic sector.
But Asean members agreed to scrap quotas for CEPT products, end other
non-tariff barriers for CEPT products within five years, and make exceptions
to foreign exchange curbs to allow payments for CEPT products.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESS could find time to approve a Uruguay Round package this year, but
key members of the coalition favouring trade liberalisation would have to be
satisfied by changes in the draft text, a senior congressional staffer said
yesterday.
However, the draft submitted by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), would first have to be
improved, and market access talks would have to produce big incentives if US
business is to sign on.
The coalition expected to lobby for the Round has three parts: businesses
needing rules in the 'new areas' - services, intellectual property rights,
and investment; agriculture; and basic manufacturing, which has submitted
'zero for zero' tariff cut proposals.
Some tariff cuts have been approved, but others remain unfinished.
Meanwhile, the services industry coalition has not taken a definitive
position on the Dunkel draft.
There is considerable worry about getting sufficient market access
commitments on services by April 1 - considered the last possible date for
talks if Congress is to get the package through this year. The US needs
commitments from the Asians, Latin Americans and Japanese, but talks are
being held up by the agriculture negotiations.
Pro-Gatt forces are weakened by dissatisfaction with the intellectual
property rights text, particularly the 10 years given developing countries
to implement patent laws.
Another briefer said the US was a victim of a 'high-tech lynching' in
Geneva, with the rest of the world convinced that US dumping laws were
'outrageous.' He said a big lobbying effort would be required to sell
Congress on the proposed Multilateral Trading Organisation.
The agriculture lobby is pleased with most of the Dunkel draft, but
protected commodity groups - peanuts, dairy, sugar and cotton - will oppose
the final package.

FT  29 JAN 92 / World Trade News: 'Little benefit' in FTAs for Latin America
 -A look at a report querying the gains in more open access to US markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE benefits to most Latin American countries of free trade pacts with the
US are likely to be small, according to a new World Bank study*.
The report questions some gains expected by the many Latin governments
seeking freer trade with the US. Some 16 Latin American governments, led by
Mexico, have signed framework pacts with the US as a first sign of their
intent to seek free trade accords. There are parallel efforts to seek free
trade accords among Latin countries themselves.
Except Brazil or Mexico, most countries stand to gain less from the free
trade agreements (FTAs) than does the US, the report finds. It suggests free
trade pacts within Latin America should be a higher priority than with the
US for most countries, because 'Latin American countries probably stand to
gain significant long-term export benefits from reduced trade barriers among
themselves.
'The main incentive for the Latin American countries to form FTAs with the
US may be to attract investment or halt the spread of new trade
restrictions,' says the paper, written by two World Bank economists, Mr
Refik Erzan and Mr Alexander Yeats.
It sees dangers for Latin America as a whole in haphazard free trade
negotiations with the US, because such FTAs would give advantages to US
exporters over exporters from other Latin countries.
'It is possible that a series of FTAs could be negotiated that would provide
the US with preferences that convey a major competitive advantage over other
countries in the region,' it says. 'As a result, Latin American countries
may be better off joining a customs union rather than a free trade
arrangement.' A customs union involves members setting up a common outside
tariff which does not exist in an FTA.
The study concludes that 'a US FTA with Mexico would greatly influence
Mexico's trade with other countries, even if those countries also have an
FTA with the US.' Most of this impact would be on exports from countries
outside Latin America: an exclusive US-Mexico FTA would displace about
Dollars 440m (Pounds 243m) of other countries' exports, but only Dollars 28m
of these would be from Latin America. Gains to Mexican exports, based on
1986 figures, would be Dollars 1.6bn.
Overall, full FTA preferences with the US would raise Latin American exports
8-9 per cent. But the expansion of Mexico's exports would exceed those for
all other countries combined and 'Mexico plus Brazil together account for
almost 90 per cent of the total gains.'
The report suggests a modest impact because of the small percentage of Latin
American exports to the US affected both by an important tariff of greater
than 5 per cent and a non-tariff barrier.
Only 1.7 per cent of Chile's exports are affected by both, 8.5 per cent of
Mexico's, 10.7 per cent of Argentina's, 12.5 per cent of Brazil's, 0.7 per
cent of Venezuela's and 10.4 per cent of Colombia's, against 55.1 per cent
of South Korea's exports, 56.4 per cent of Hong Kong's and 21.4 per cent of
Singapore's
The authors make no formal study of the potential for the expansion of US
exports, but their comparisons suggest 'US trade gains, particularly for
highly-protected transport and machinery products, are likely to be
considerably greater than those for Latin America in the US market'.
This is because during the study period, average level of tariff protection
is higher than in the US. The report makes no assessment of recent
significant tariff cuts introduced over the past 12 months by various Latin
American governments.
Trade gains for Latin America would be even more limited if no parallel
action is taken to remove US non-tariff barriers, which are particularly
important for countries such as Uruguay, which has a heavy concentration of
textile and clothing exports.
But if textile quotas for other countries continue (under the so-called
Multi-Fibre Arrangement, MFA) and they are lifted for Latin American
countries under FTAs, there is a large potential for Latin America to
replace far eastern and other suppliers as exporters to the US. However, as
the report suggests, a phase-out of the MFA as part of the current Uruguay
Round trade talks and the likely transitional arrangements for textiles in
any conceivable FTA with the US would probably limit the impact.
The report will be seen as having two main limitations. It addresses only
the direct trade implications of FTAs and the economic model used by the
economists is limited, for example in its ability to assess the impact of
non-tariff barriers. Further, some governments are already stressing the
importance of non-trade gains of FTAs. The Mexican administration, for
example, sees an accord providing a spur to investment flows and making it
harder to reverse its economic reform programme.

VELA International Marine, a subsidiary of Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil
company, has ordered three very large crude carriers of over 300,000 dwt
each with the A P Moller shipping and industrial group's Odense Steel
Shipyard at Lindoe, Denmark, Hilary Barnes reports from Copenhagen.
The order, understood to be worth about DKr3bn (Pounds 270m), was
facilitated by the Danish government, which has prolonged shipbuilding
subsidies, due to be phased out in 1994, for an extra year.
Vela has ordered single-hull vessels, with an option to change the order to
double-hull later. The Lindoe yard, regarded as one of the most efficient in
Europe, is completing an order for seven double-hulled tankers of 286,000
dwt each for A P Moller itself.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Third westerner may run east German state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A west German candidate, Mr Bernhard Vogel, former prime minister of the
Rhineland Palatinate and close confidant of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, seems
certain to become the third western prime minister running a former east
German state in the federal republic, reports Quentin Peel.
The move by the dominant Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the state of
Thuringia amounts to a calculated risk by the Chancellor to bring his
eastern house into order.
The danger is that it will further infuriate east German opinion, already
bitter at the behaviour of westerners in enforcing the free market economy
on their collapsed socialist system.
The benefit is that it could provide new leadership to an eastern CDU which
has so far failed to produce outstanding personalities, and is torn between
politicians tainted by co-operation with the former Communist authorities,
and angry young reformers without experience of office.
Mr Vogel, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute, a CDU think tank in Bonn,
has been proposed by Thuringian Christian Democrats to their Free Democrat
partners in government after the resignation last week of Mr Josef Duchac.
Mr Duchac had been under pressure after revelations he had once performed as
a clown to entertain the officers of the former East German Stasi security
police.
Reports from Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, yesterday showed conflicting
reactions. Some said Chancellor Kohl was showing typical 'Wessi' arrogance
towards the East, foisting his own candidate on the local party. Others
admitted that easterners did not trust anyone from their own land.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Czechoslovaks queue to cash in on capitalism: Investment
funds are changing the face of the mass privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE course of a few weeks, an investment fund, called Harvard Capital and
Consulting (HC&amp;C), has changed the pace and nature of the entire mass
privatisation programme in Czechoslovakia.
Funds are a relatively new phenomenon in a country which is embarking on a
radical programme of economic reforms. In recent months, more than 450
private investment funds have mushroomed in Czechoslovakia with the aim of
participating in the sell-off of state-owned enterprises to the population.
Set up by large banks, enterprise managers, or individual entrepreneurs, the
funds have started marketing their investment expertise aggressively in an
effort to woo Czechoslovak citizens, who are often confused by the
privatisation process.
Under the mass privatisation programme, an estimated Kcs200bn (Pounds 4bn)
worth of state-owned assets will be distributed to citizens above 18 years
of age in the form of vouchers. For a small fee - about a week's wages -
citizens can buy and register a voucher book entitling them to shares in the
new private companies once the privatisation process is completed.
Long queues, unseen since the demise of communism, have now reappeared in
the country as would-be participants attempt to register their voucher
books. Yet, while only 700,000 people had registered before Christmas, the
number has sharply increased to more than 2m since then. It was the Harvard
Fund which created this surge of interest.
Advertised five times a day on television, the fund has attracted
participants by promising a tenfold return in a year's time. Waiting for
customers at local post offices, where voucher books are bought, the fund's
22,000 agents offer Kcs10,350 in one year to those willing to assign their
voucher book, bought for Kcs1,000, to the fund.
According to Mr Viktor Kozeny, the young director and owner of the fund, the
guarantee is a simple put option as seen in western capital markets. By
entering this fund, clients become shareholders of the fund's capital. In
one year's time, they can choose to sell their share in the Harvard fund at
either the promised guarantee, or a market price if higher.
However, the scheme, decried by privatisation officials as a hoax, has
caused havoc. Other funds have started offering similar financial
guarantees; Investicni Banka, which opened a investment fund with Flemings
of London earlier last year, is now promising a guaranteed return of
Kcs11,000 in one year.
Privatisation Ministry officials believe this is a very dangerous trend. The
Harvard Fund, they point out, is in no position to know today if it will be
able to meet its obligations in a year. They also claim it is misleading
people in its advertising.
'We look at our critics and we smile,' Mr Kozeny responds from his
chauffeur-driven limousine. 'There is no law in the country which prevents
me from making such a promise.' He maintains that the shares will increase
greatly in value and therefore he will be able to match his guarantees.
Not everyone agrees. One local banker points out that state-owned assets are
evaluated on a book value basis, and in many cases their market values will
be markedly lower. Second, the ability to live up to guarantees depends on
the liquidity in the capital markets at the time of the sell-off.
'If 250,000 people each ask the Harvard Fund for Kcs10,350 in a year's time
the fund will have to come up with Kcs2.5bn.
'To do so, the fund will have to sell some of its assets. If all funds do
this, the market could collapse and funds go bankrupt.'
Bankers further believe that liquidity problems will be compounded by the
funds' need to cover their costs. Investment funds are supposed to pay the
fund managers, usually gathered in a holding company, a 5 per cent fee on
the value of fund assets. This is supposedly met from customers paying an
entry fee into the fund and a yearly management fee.
However, in the words of one banker: 'If about Kcs200bn of state-owned
property become the assets of the funds via the voucher scheme, then 5 per
cent equals Kcs10bn. The domestic market will not have this money and will
have to rely on foreigners buying in or the whole thing may collapse.'
In the view of HC&amp;C's president, money should not be a problem. Mr Kozeny
says he is setting up a credit enhancing facility with the help of foreign
money. 'Moreover, money could come from my other companies.'
As the head of 13 companies, including a credit managing company charged
with collecting bad debts among enterprises and a consulting company
advising joint ventures, Mr Kozeny seems unruffled.
The lack of legislation governing the activities of investment funds has
prompted officials to prepare a law which, they say, will be presented to
parliament this spring. Investment funds at present are bound only by a few
paragraphs on joint-stock companies in the Business Code which was adopted
in parliament last November.
The new law should force funds to spread risks by investing the vouchers in
at least 10 enterprises. Moreover, funds may not be allowed to acquire more
than 20 per cent of a company's equity.
'But what', asks Mr Kozeny, 'will prevent my other companies from also
buying equity in a profitable local enterprise?'
At the Privatisation Ministry, an official laughs. 'The Harvard Fund will
end having to administer half the properties privatised this spring, which
account already for half the country's companies. He will have to set up a
new central planning commission.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Hanson (left) yesterday yesterday emphatically ruled out a bid for
Imperial Chemical Industries eight months after taking a 2.8 per cent stake
in the company. He told shareholders of the acquisitive conglomerate that
bears his name that arrangements had been made for the succession to him and
Lord White (pictured), who runs the group's North American operations, but
he refused to name the heir apparent. More than 1,000 shareholders attended
Hanson's annual meeting in the Barbican Centre in London. Most questions had
to be submitted in writing before the meeting, enabling Lord Hanson to read
the answers from an autocue.

<TEXT>
France's Communist-led CGT trade union federation held a splendid party on
Monday night for its departing first secretary, Mr Henri Krasucki, who is
retiring at the age of 67. It was a distinctive send-off, in the form of a
Mozart concert at the Opera Comique in Paris, with extracts from The
Marriage of Figaro and The Magic Flute. It should have given Mr Krasucki
particular pleasure, since he is renowned in trade union circles for his
passion for Mozart.
In the cold light of day, however, Mr Krasucki may not be all that sorry to
be going. After all, his departure effectively completes a generational
changing of the guard of the leadership of the three main French trades
unions federations. In 1988 Mr Edmond Maire retired after 17 years as leader
of the CFDT, and in 1989 Mr Andre Bergeron retired after 26 years as leader
of Force Ouvriere.
Mr Krasucki, by contrast, has only been 10 years in the job; but it may be
enough. For the plain fact is that Mr Krasucki leaves his union in a steep
and apparently unstoppable crisis of falling membership.
In 1947 it claimed 4m members, before the schism with a socialist minority
which broke away to form Force Ouvriere. In 1977 the CGT was still claiming
2.3m members, but by 1981 the total had shrunk to 1.9m members. In the past
decade this decline has gathered speed, and even the claimed total
membership is now no more than 855,000, and 200,000 of them are pensioners.
The two other main federations have also declined in recent years, though
much less steeply than the CGT; but they are also both significantly
smaller. In elections to works councils, according to official figures from
the Labour Ministry, the latest score by the CGT was just under 25 per cent
(compared with over 36 per cent in 1980); whereas the CFDT scored under 20
per cent, and Force Ouvriere got under 13 per cent. In fact, the biggest
single group of those elected to works' councils, is now the category of
non-union candidates.
In other words, the CGT phenomenon of falling membership is part of a larger
phenomenon which is affecting the general union scene in France; indeed, one
might even say that the country is entering a crisis of residual trade
unionism. According to the latest comparative study by the OECD, France now
has the lowest union penetration of any member country - only 12 per cent.
And that membership is disproportionately represented in the public sector,
where it reaches 26 per cent, while dropping to a mere 8 per cent in the
market sector.
In Scandinavian countries, union membership remains at near saturation
levels. But many other industrialised countries experienced significant
falls in union membership in the 1980s: this was true of Spain where it
dropped by over 31 per cent, Britain (21 per cent) and Italy (18.6 per
cent). But the drop was much the steepest in France: down 41.6 per cent,
from 3.37m to 1.97m.
One general factor in declining union membership could be the relative
decline of traditional smokestack manufacturing. But in France the acute
problems of the CGT seem likely to be directly related to its connection
with the Stalinist French Communist party, which is itself in free fall.
The paradox is that Mr Krasucki, who has presided over the steepest
collapse, is normally held to be something of a reformist Communist; whereas
his successor, the 58-year-old Mr Louis Viannet, has the reputation of an
unreconstructed party hard-liner.
In his opening speech to the CGT Congress on Sunday, the be-spectacled Mr
Viannet proclaimed the imperious necessity of 'changing what does not work'.
But the changes will need to be spectacular if he is to bring the union out
of its nose-dive.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Some democracy fatigue sets in over the Alps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE much-admired Swiss form of direct democracy, in which every important
government decision must be ratified in plebiscites, appears to have run
amok.
The Swiss will be invited to go to the polls four times this year to vote on
perhaps a score of national issues, from vivisection to membership in the
International Monetary Fund and the European Economic Area.
This is far beyond the normal level of plebiscites (there were votes on only
four issues at the federal level last year) and suggests to many that the
system is no longer be working properly.
Under the Swiss constitution, the federal parliament is required to submit
all its important decisions to a vote. Moreover, any citizen may petition
for a referendum on a government decision that he does not like. He may also
petition for a plebiscite, or 'initiative' as it is called, to decide
whether a law should be withdrawn or amended. Provided the required number
of signatures are obtained (50,000 to contest a government decision, 100,000
to launch an initiative), the plebiscites must be held.
The system has been lauded for promoting consensus and compromise in an
ethnically diverse country, but there are signs that it is being abused by
special interest groups and distorting the policy-making process.
The main problem is that, while Switzerland's population has nearly doubled
since the system was established in 1892, the number of signatures required
to force a referendum has remained unchanged (with the exception of 1977,
when it was adjusted to take account of women's being given the vote). Thus,
as all sorts of special interest groups have discovered, it has become
progressively easier to raise the number of necessary signatures.
Another problem, which has also not escaped the attention of special
interest groups, is that Swiss voters have a preference for voting against
whatever is being proposed by the government. Fourteen have blocked
government proposals. Among those defeated was the 1986 proposal that
Switzerland join the UN and last year's proposal to subject Swiss citizens
to value added tax. The success rate for initiatives is much lower.
Moreover, there is evidence that the average citizen is suffering from
vote-fatigue. The average turnout in the past couple of years for federal
referendums and initiatives has been only 43.6 per cent, with only
significantly higher turnout for an issue that is close to the Swiss heart.
Nearly two thirds of the electorate turned out in 1989 to express their view
on the abolition of the Swiss army, and a surprisingly large minority
supported the idea.
Political observers say these trends have begun to have an effect on the way
the government operates. Whereas policies used to be prepared in an
objective atmosphere by committees of civil servants, they are now subjected
to political scrutiny at a very early stage to assess whether or not they
are likely to attract a majority in a referendum.
Among this year's potentially troublesome plebiscites is that on whether the
country should join the IMF. The Government has wanted to join for several
years but only managed to get a decision through Parliament last year. Now
it appears that an unlikely coalition of conservative isolationists and
left-wing opponents of IMF pressures on developing countries will succeed in
reversing the decision.
The proposal to cut the stamp duty on securities transactions perhaps
illustrates best the weaknesses of the system. The Government has been
loathe to give up this tax because it is a large source of revenue, but
revenues have been declining recently because, whenever possible, Swiss
securities avoid the duty by executing their trades in London or Luxembourg.
Opponents of a Swiss government plan to build a new railway through the Alps
have failed by a whisker in their petititon to force a referendum on the
issue. They gathered only 49,380 signatures, 620 short of the minimum
required.
This may be good news for those concerned about Switzerland's relations with
its European neighbours, but the Swiss ecology party, which sponsored the
petition, was obviously not: it said that its failure was due to late
delivery of signatures from some districts and that it was considering an
appeal to the courts.
