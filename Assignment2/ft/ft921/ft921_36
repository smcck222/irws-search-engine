FT  22 JAN 92 / European Court may censure UK over water purity laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Court of Justice is expected to find the UK guilty of failing
to comply with EC law on drinking water purity.
The court's advocate general yesterday endorsed two of the charges brought
against Britain by the European Commission.
The development will be an embarrassment to the government, which is trying
to emphasise the success of its environmental policy.
It came as Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, was in Brussels
talking to Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment commissioner, about the
British presidency of the EC later this year.
The court's judgment, likely to be made around Easter, will do little to
improve relations between the UK and Brussels environment authorities.
These were soured in October when Mr Ripa di Meana asked the UK to halt
seven construction projects until it was established that it had complied
with a directive requiring environmental impact studies.
The advocate general's opinion was yesterday was that the UK had not
adequately transposed the 1980 directive on drinking water into national law
and that nitrates in East Anglian water exceeded the limit of 50
milligrammes per litre laid down in the directive.
But he said a complaint about lead pollution in Scottish water should be
dismissed for insufficient evidence. Court judgments usually follow the
advocate general's opinion.
Mr Heseltine declined to comment on the dispute after meeting Mr Ripa di
Meana but said Britain had one of the best records in complying with
Community regulations.
In London, Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's minister for environmental protection,
said: 'The EC ruling shows the government is granting licences to pollute
and the water companies are putting profits before pollution controls.'
Friends of the Earth, the environmental organisation which initiated the
complaint, said that during 1990 5.3m people in East Anglia and the Midlands
received water with nitrate in excess of drinking water directive standards.
The Water Services Association, representing the 10 big water and sewage
companies, said that, even where nitrates were above set levels, they were
well within World Health Organisation limits.
The UK water industry has a Pounds 1.8bn programme to reduce nitrates and
comply with the directive by 1995.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Sharp cut in UK investment by German groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION is exacting a heavy toll on German manufacturing investment in
Britain, which fell by almost half in the first six months of last year to
about Pounds 470m, according to figures published yesterday.
The report, by the German Chamber of Commerce in Britain, shows that
investment in the UK fell to a rate of Pounds 940m a year in the first half
of 1991, down from Pounds 1.8bn the year before and Pounds 1.5bn in 1989.
The chamber said the drop reflected the severity of the UK recession rather
than a diversion of investment into eastern Germany.
The figures are a blow to UK hopes that foreign manufacturing investment
would help to offset cuts imposed by British companies.
However, the survey, covering 361 of the 967 German companies in the UK,
suggests that investment will pick up again once the recession is over.
About 82 per cent of manufacturers said they planned further investments
soon; 19 per cent of companies without manufacturing plants said they
planned to set them up, and most companies were pleased with the return they
had earned on their investment, with labour productivity and with industrial
relations.
In spite of this endorsement of the UK as the second largest recipient of
German investment after the US, German industrialists raised serious doubts
about the long-term outlook for British industrial competitiveness.
Mr Juergen Gehrels, chief executive of the British operations of Siemens,
the electrical and engineering group, said Britain would not be able to
attract foreign investment indefinitely on the basis of low labour costs.
Mr Gehrels said Britain's decision to opt out of the European Community's
social charter was vital to maintaining its attractiveness as a
manufacturing base. However, he warned: 'It may be that Britain cannot yet
afford to join the social charter. But it will have to if it is to become a
modern pluralistic society.'
He said it would prove impossible to win purely on the basis of labour
costs. The chamber's report urges greater investment in training and
transport infrastructure.
The survey found that 82 per cent of German companies which already
manufacture in the UK plan to expand over the next five years by investing
almost Pounds 1bn.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Algerian Dollars 1.5bn loan in jeopardy: Reluctance of some
lenders to refinance foreign debt may endanger funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 830m) loan package to Algeria, intended to refinance
the country's foreign debt with nearly 100 commercial banks, has been put
into jeopardy by the reluctance of some lenders to back the plan.
Failure to complete the deal would call into question the government's
policy of refinancing Algeria's entire Dollars 23.5bn in outstanding foreign
debt. It could also endanger new loans recently agreed with supranational
agencies to support economic development.
The difficulties emerged yesterday as cabinet ministers met for talks on the
economy with the five-strong collective presidency, established a week ago
following the cancellation of multi-party elections.
Although western bankers did not link the refinancing problem directly with
the political turmoil in the North African state, it will come as a further
handicap to the Algiers authorities as they seek to maintain order.
Algeria's debt burden, which stands at double its annual export earnings of
Dollars 11bn-Dollars 12bn, has made it difficult to contain inflation or
unemployment. These adverse economic conditions were seen as fuelling
popular support for the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front, which had
been on target to win the elections.
Credit Lyonnais, which is leading the eight-year loan package, was last
night attempting to salvage the deal, designed to refinance principal
repayments falling due between now and the end of next year, which would
postpone the burden of repayment.
Agreement has come from banks representing Dollars 1.4bn of the total, but a
small number have declined to participate.
Under normal circumstances places could be taken by other institutions.
However, some banks have made their commitment conditional on the deal
gaining support of all Algeria's commercial creditors.
Among the banks so far declining to accept the package is New York-based
Bankers Trust.
If the deal collapses, Algeria may have no alternative but to seek a
restructuring of both commercial bank debt and other foreign debt
obligations.
Failure could also endanger a Ecu400m (Pounds 287m) loan agreed by the
European Community. The facility was agreed on the understanding that
commercial bank debts would be refinanced. Only Ecu250m has been disbursed
so far.
Some other international loans are proceeding as planned. For example, the
final three parts of a Dollars 1.33bn trade finance package for development
of liquefied natural gas facilities are still expected to be signed next
month.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Letter: Positive return would come from provision of child
care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BRONWEN COHEN and Mr NEIL FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Balls ('The Double Bind for Working Parents', January 17)
dismisses as 'wild claims' the findings of our analysis of Treasury savings
from public investment in childcare contained in our report 'Child care in a
Modern Welfare System'.
Our study examined increased tax revenue from a growth in women's employment
and higher levels of women's pay (through a reduction of the career break
penalty) and from increased employment in childcare. It also identified
substantial benefit savings through reduction of child and family poverty.
We conclude that while the cost of providing childcare is high, it would
provide a positive return in the medium and long term.
We are somewhat confused by Mr Balls's arguments. We envisage an expansion
of the female labour force by 1.5 to 17.3 per cent, and not as Mr Balls
asserts of 33 to 150 per cent. Strangely, he seems to assume that the
provision of childcare would result 'in a large influx of unskilled labour
and that public subsidies for childcare would inevitably favour skilled
women'. We have recommended a structure of services which would provide
access to all families but which would facilitate an upgrading of skills and
a reduction in skill wastage. It is widely recognised that the economy
suffers from supply side constraints including skill shortages making it
inflation-prone. We argue that the provision of childcare services would
increase the skilled as well as the unskilled labour supply enabling the
economy to be run at a higher level and still meet its inflation target.
Our report details the strong social arguments which themselves make the
case for the public funding of childcare. These include, in addition to
those mentioned in the article, a substantial reduction in the unacceptably
high levels of child poverty in this country. However, although we stress
that our study is exploratory, we do believe that it demonstrates that the
arguments for public funding of childcare are not just social but indeed
economic. We would, however, agree with Mr Balls that it is important to
ensure that public subsidies of childcare are in a form which is not
distributionally regressive as with for example, tax allowances.

The article should have read: 'The report argues that the extra tax revenue,
generated in part by an estimated 33-150 per cent rise in full-time
equivalent employment of women with children under five, would more than pay
for the scheme.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / Personal View: Russia needs three kinds of economic aid -
and quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YEGOR GAIDAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two months ago, the president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, formed a new
government pledged to radical economic reform. That government has a clear
strategy, and has already put in place many of the elements central to it.
The first is the freeing of markets - for goods and services, and for
foreign exchange. On January 2, most consumer prices were freed. Only a few
basic goods remain controlled and their prices have, on average, tripled.
Most industrial prices, except those of energy and freight transport, are
also free.
After 75 years of price control, this was a big step. Some people say that
the government should have gone more slowly. I do not agree. The queues in
the shops were quite intolerable. Money had become so useless that much of
the trade between enterprises was done by barter. An economy of that kind
can never prosper.
In any case, once price rises become expected, they must be allowed to
happen. If not, suppliers are unwilling to sell and supplies to the market
fall steadily. It would have been nice to be able to privatise first, but
delay was impossible. Russia shall, however, privatise as fast as
practicable, and at least as fast as the countries of eastern Europe.
Some ask: 'How can people afford the higher prices?' This largely misses the
point. The prices only rose because the people - taken as a whole - had the
money to spend. Care must be taken, however, to protect the poorer people -
such as pensioners - who already used to spend all their income.
We have done all that we can to protect these groups. On January 1 the basic
pension, child support and the minimum wage were increased by 90 per cent.
This is less than the rise in prices, but any bigger increase would have
been irresponsible. Pensions cannot be paid by printing money, as happened
last year. Any more generous social safety net will have to depend on
foreign assistance.
Freeing domestic prices is the principal step to a healthy market economy.
But Russia is also determined to participate fully in world trade. This
means freeing the market for foreign exchange. Up to now, foreign exchange
has been grossly under-priced and allocated by government officials.
On January 1, the government created the framework for a normal foreign
exchange market. Importers will buy dollars through their banks at a market
exchange rate. Exporters will have to sell to the government at least 10 per
cent of their foreign exchange earnings (at the market price). As soon as
they become more confident that real convertibility has been established,
they will certainly sell more. There will thus be a unified foreign exchange
market.
There is one exception - which is, in fact, superficial. Exporters of oil,
gas, timber and precious metals will have to sell to the government 40 per
cent of their foreign exchange earnings at half the market price. This is,
in essence, a royalty similar in effect to the levies taken on natural
resource exports by most governments in the world.
Freeing markets is the first element in the reform. The aim is that prices
should rise once and for all - to eliminate the monetary overhang - and then
remain stable. The task of stabilisation is the most difficult, and involves
three steps.
First, the budget must be balanced. This is a goal from the first quarter of
this year. On the expenditure side, freeing prices means that most subsidies
will be eliminated, especially on meat. Drastic cuts will also be made in
defence procurement.
On the tax side, much of the old, indirect tax structure has collapsed, and,
for the last three years, the Finance Ministry has been preparing instead a
value added tax. The VAT has now been introduced at 28 per cent. There are
also an enterprise wage tax (37 per cent) and a profits tax (32 per cent).
The tax yield is difficult to forecast, but the government shall do all it
can to collect in revenue as much as it spends.
This is one significant step in achieving monetary control. The other is to
impose effective limits on lending to enterprises. Here the government is
engaged in urgent discussions with the central bank, since effective limits
are essential to the success of the programme.
The final need is to stabilise the rouble. At present, the supply of foreign
exchange is so small that the rouble is grossly undervalued. Prices of
traded goods in Russia today are about 20 times below world prices
calculated at the existing exchange rate. This situation is fraught with
danger. Unless the exchange rate appreciates, prices are bound to go on
rising many times over.
Tight money is the key to raising the external value of the rouble. But we
also need to peg the exchange rate, in order to set a ceiling to inflation
and to give enterprises the confidence to part with their dollars.
Unfortunately, Russia has no international reserves for this purpose: they
were squandered by the Union government. Foreign assistance is urgently
needed in preparing a fund to stabilise the rouble.
While we have already taken significant steps towards establishing financial
discipline, there has to be some moment soon when all the remaining measures
are put in place. If we are to stop inflation rolling, March is the time to
act.
The possible package is being discussed with the International Monetary
Fund, since a programme that is to succeed must have outside support. We
need three kinds of help.
The first is humanitarian aid. The western response here has been generous
and we greatly welcome the conference today in Washington called by Mr
Baker.
The second is general balance of payments support. Last year, imports fell
by more than a third. This had a devastating effect on living standards and
on industrial production which depends on certain critical imports. We
cannot immediately restore our exports, so help is essential to prevent
economic collapse. Finally, we need a stabilisation fund to peg the rouble
at a reasonable rate.
The sums of money needed are similar on a per head basis to those given to
Poland. President Yeltsin wrote to the G7 about the stabilisation fund in
early December. The G7 countries are now waiting for the outcome of our
discussions with the IMF. However, it would greatly help Russia's ability to
plan if the G7 finance ministers, at their meeting in Washington later this
week, could give some indication of what help might be available on what
conditions.
Stabilisation plans must be announced as soon as possible. Unless the people
can see that inflation is going to be capped, wages will increase again and
we shall then be into a disastrous wage-price spiral.
Aid offered now can help prevent this. It would be much more valuable than
aid offered later.
The author is deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation and minister
of economics and finance.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Observer: Codswallop at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE centre of every great institutional row, you will usually find an
organisation chart. It is not surprising, therefore, that some of the
noisiest debate about last week's report on the future of Lloyd's, the
insurance market, should centre on its final chapter, which discusses how
the market should be led and supervised.
The report argues that Lloyd's problems are essentially commercial, and sets
out ways to make the market more competitive and profitable. It concludes
with proposals to reorganise Lloyd's leadership, to give it more of a
business emphasis. Mr David Rowland, chairman of the task force that
produced the report, believes that this reorganisation is essential to bring
about the wider changes he recommends.
He might have expected at least a polite hearing for these views. Instead,
he has been blown a raspberry.
To understand why, look at the present management of Lloyd's. Currently, the
28-member Lloyd's council is responsible both for the strict new regulatory
regime introduced after the scandals of the 1970s, and for the market's
support services.
The task force argues that this does not work. There is no clear focus of
responsibility for the development of Lloyd's as a business. And, says the
report, the independence and distance required for the council's regulatory
functions 'are not helpful in developing and supporting Lloyd's collective
business performance; rather they are obstacles to the total commitment of
all concerned to Lloyd's competitive success'. Consequently, there should be
a clear split between a market board responsible for running the business of
Lloyd's and a regulatory council responsible for policing it.
Raspberry-blowing
That was where the raspberry-blowing started. Lloyd's council welcomed the
report as a whole, but singled out this proposal, alone among the task
force's 65, for immediate rejection. It argued that the market needs a
unified leadership, handling both regulation and business issues.
Mr Rowland expressed his regret, in moderate terms, that the council had not
seen fit to accept his advice. Lloyd's chairman Mr David Coleridge replied,
in somewhat less moderate language, that some of the task force's thinking
was 'codswallop'.
That must not be his final word. There is an underlying agreement between
the two sides of the debate: that Lloyd's commercial crisis is the central
issue. The question, therefore, is how best to ensure the business
leadership that the market badly needs.
Clearer approach
Mr Rowland's approach, with its organisation charts and call for a new
Lloyd's act of parliament, may not be the best solution. But it is clearer
and more comprehensible than the council's counter-offer: a review of its
own structure 'closely attentive to the need to maintain a strong business
orientation in decision taking in the market'.
What makes the council's rejection of the report's final chapter
particularly unfortunate is that it contains within it the foundations of a
workable compromise, described as a transitional structure. This would
require no legal changes, but achieve most of the desired aims. It is a
useful starting point for discussion.
The debate is the more important because of the other contentious issue that
remains unresolved in the wake of the task force's report. Among those
directly affected, there has been great dismay that the report has found no
solution to the problems faced by those Names exposed to the worst losses of
the late 1980s, and no easy way out for those trapped in 'open years' where
liabilities cannot yet be estimated.
That was predictable: no report produced by consensus was ever likely to
resolve these difficult issues. The bitterness they create will continue to
eat away at the heart of the market, however; it has given a fresh edge to
the debate on governance. Rightly or wrongly, the council's response to the
task force's organisational proposals has been seen as the protective
reaction of the Lloyd's establishment, and a poor omen for the prospects of
the rest of the report. The council must think again.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Arts: All My Sons - Young Vic Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Miller's All My Sons was his first success. In an introduction to the
published text, he wrote later: 'The audience sat in silence before the
unwinding and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is
reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's
invention a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.'
Over 40 years later the power must still be working. The audience at the
Young Vic last night was transfixed throughout, and no wonder. All My Sons
remains a marvellously constructed play. Although it is about the aftermath
of the second world war in middle America, it could just as easily have been
written about the aftermath of Vietnam. In fact, neither the period nor the
place much matter. It could be anywhere, any time.
Since the plot contains a strong element of suspense and surprise, I shall
not go into detail. Suffice it to say that the wrong man has been blamed for
knowingly supplying defective parts to aircraft which led to the deaths of
21 pilots. The airman son of the engineer who really is guilty was reported
missing in action. The play is about retribution catching up.
Miller's mastery lies primarily in the way he presents a small community and
in the simplicity of the language. The Keller family is remarkable for its
sheer American middle class ordinariness: well-off, comfortable but in no
way pretentious. Joe Keller, the self-made father, has diversified out of
armaments into consumer goods. His wife Kate is somewhat superstitious, but
otherwise a model American mother. Son Chris is educated, but happy. The
neighbours respect them, even regard them as 'the holy family'. Then the
plot unfolds.
The play starts deliberately slowly - that is part of the skill. Indeed it
is still building up when it comes to the climax. You will note, however,
that there is never a line out of place. Every word, every movement,
contributes to the whole. The comparisons that were made with Ibsen after
the first performance, and which Miller acknowledged, are entirely
appropriate.
Yet there is great deal more than plot and characterisation. Miller uses the
sparest of language. Some of the most powerful lines seem to be made up
almost solely of monosyllables. For example: 'You had two sons, but you've
only got one of them now.' And towards the end Chris says to his father: 'I
know you're no worse than most men, but I thought you were better.' The
result is a writing style that is completely unselfconscious. Nothing jars.
David Thacker's production in the round of the Young Vic brings out the
shine and the detail in even the smallest parts. Of the larger ones, Matthew
Marsh's slightly hunched Chris is unforgettable. So is the sometimes
neurotic, sometimes confident Marjorie Yates as his mother. Ian Bannen plays
Joe Keller as a very big, but ultimately broken man. This is a well-written,
well-made, well-acted play par excellence.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Arts: Roy Ayers - Ronnie Scott's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clubowner Ronnie Scott must be confident of this showy vibraphonist's
appeal. The American has already spent a week at Scott's new club in
Birmingham and follows now with a three-week residency at the London base.
But there are few good vibes players around and the instrument does seem to
have some pulling power on the margins of jazz: perhaps because it offers
both melody and percussion in large, equal measures or because it is played
standing up and with some vigour.
Whatever the reason, it is hard to ignore.
Roy Ayers has the added advantage of being an unrepentant showman who owns
an expensive looking piece of equipment from which he can summon all kinds
of sounds with a flick of the switch and the application of mallets. This he
does with alacrity and even managed a clever but tacky mini-tribute to Miles
Davis by hitting the trumpet button on the machine. He can play though and
when the vibes are right, backed by a tough all-American no-nonsense rhythm
section, the swirling vibrato is mesmerising.
Legend has it that Ayers was encouraged to take up the electric xylophone at
the age of five by Lionel Hampton, the original big band vibes man, when he
gave him a pair of mallets to get the young Ayers started. He moved quickly
away from a pure jazz sound, however, and by the mid-1970s was established
as an uncomplicated and entertaining fusion player.
Thus he neglects to play long, sustained solo parts throughout a set of
sweaty jazz funk. Instead the repertoire of songs with titles like 'Everyone
likes the sunshine' relies heavily on a seductive groove and the old
charmer's line of cheeky chat. He even resorts to the trusted technique of
invoking 'everyone to put their hands in the air', for example. He likes to
sing as well and has a soulful voice which delivers smoothie nonsense
reminiscent of ladies' men like Barry White or Luther Vandross.
While guitarist Zachery Breaux whacks out the soul riffs, Ayers puts down
his mallets, fixes a table at the front with a mischievous eye and sings, 'I
believe in the spirit of do-do'.
Later in the set he wiggles his ears, a seductive device which Ayers' wife
apparently finds irresistible.
On this first night more than a few in the near capacity audience seemed to
like it too.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Arts: London International Mime Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the London Mime Festival raises one issue par excellence, it is the
inadequacy of existing categorisation of the performing arts, which not only
affects what an audience chooses to see but what it expects to find. The
dominant reaction to the first night of the Belgian Compagnie Mossoux-Bonte
at the ICA was a rather bored reluctance to dismiss anything so obviously
foreign and arty. Equally predictable was the pocket of initiates heard
sounding off in high indignation about the philistine English.
The festival, the venue, even the company's own sales pitch conspired
against The Last Hallucinations of Lucas Cranach the Elder, which struck me
as a brilliantly lucid and surprisingly unpretentious subversion of an
artist's work and his times. Cranach (1472-1553) was a German painter and
woodcut designer who was court artist to the Elector of Saxony at Wittenberg
and also worked for Luther.
His 'Adam and Eve' is one of the prizes of the Courtauld Collection, while
one of his portraits of Luther is owned by Bristol's City Art Gallery.
The combination of sacred and secular in his work provides Patrick Bonte and
Nicole Mossoux with a fascinating lever for a pictorial fantasy based on the
early protestant mind. The lights go up on an array of frames in which, with
jewel-like definition, a collection of pictures are set. In one, a pompous
young man confronts a stuffed fish; in another, the torso of a woman sits
fingering a book; in a third is the head of a sensuous but rather plain
young woman.
The young man, one notices, has bejewelled, spider-like hands. He reappears
in a second scene of court portraiture, as an effete noble in gaudy finery
caressing a blowsy wench.
Adam and Eve make their entrance as sleekly muscled nude torsos flirting
over a bright green apple: their heads and legs are cut off by the picture
frame, focusing the eye on the eroticism of the allegory and distorting it
by making the covert appear overt. This, one imagines, is how Cranach might
have seen the Courtauld painting in his wildest dreams.
Most revealing of all is the image of the recumbent nude, a skinny, twisted
figure not beautiful in either face or form, but with a dignity which
insists that she belongs to a different aesthetic to our own. Immediately
one is reminded of all those etiolated bodies, with breasts stuck on like
mud pies and necks at unnatural angles, which make Cranach's work seem so
strange. There is plenty of time for such thoughts in a show which proceeds
at a processional pace from frame to frame. For those who went expecting
performance fireworks, it undoubtedly seemed a damp squib; take it on its
own terms, as work that feeds on the visual arts, and its cracked visions
crawl from every canvas.
Philipe Genty, who brought his new show to the Queen Elizabeth Hall for
three nights last week, offers a very different package: here is mime as
sleight of hand and foot, accomplished, magical and ultimately mundane. A
figure wrestles with a quilt which gets smaller and smaller until it
self-destructs into feathers of polythene from the snowy depths of which a
slender puppet emerges. A second puppet wrestles with a deck chair which
gets bigger and bigger until it becomes a tumbling apparatus for 'real'
actors.
Genty's two stocks-in-trade, or so it would appear from this show, are his
mastery of changing scale and his style of puppetry, which enables teams of
bowler-hatted puppeteers to move in and out of focus without destroying the
illusion of the puppets on the ends of their sticks. His work is charming
and clever, but gave no indication of being more than a series of variations
on these two themes.
And so to the Black Mime Theatre, one of the home contributors to the
festival, which offers a piece about women and alcoholism that is endearing
in its earnestness. Three women re-enact the stories of their alcoholism as
a warning to ordinary mortals about the evils of drink. The acting is raw,
wholehearted and infuriatingly inaccurate if you look for the sort of detail
in which mime is supposed to specialise (what waiter ever poured wine out
over the back of his hand?). It uses dialogue and singing and has a
following of its own at the Young Vic (until Saturday). But I cannot help
wondering what the French or the Belgians would make of its rough readiness.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Arts: History in the making - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of this column was to express a few straightforward thoughts about
history on television because there is, as you may have noticed, a lot of it
about. On Mondays we get Voices From The Past showing travel films which
'reflect the ideas and attitudes of an earlier age', last week the 1947
voyage of the Passat, one of the last of the working square riggers. Sure
enough, as well as some wonderful pictures there were some pretty old
fashioned ideas such as that busy-busy 'let's be jolly' music which used to
fill every moment of the cinema newsreels when nobody was talking, and
Duncan Carse described the bodies of the seamen as 'machine like in their
precision and endurance'. Then, at the climax of the voyage when the mother
and father of a storm broke over the ship, the commentary petered out and
the viewer was left trying to work out what on earth was going on.
Tuesdays have been bringing Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint, a
fascinating account by Bamber Gascoigne of a 15th century trip by a German
monk to Jerusalem and the Sinai desert. This has been an unusually
entertaining series because of the way that Gascoigne and producer Douglas
Rae have shown not only the differences between tourism in the 15th century
and today (which you would expect) but also the amazing similarities (which
you might not). Last week Gascoigne told us some of the rules for Christian
pilgrims in mediaeval Jerusalem: don't give alcohol to Moslems, not because
Islam forbids it but because they will get drunk and attack the next lot of
pilgrims; don't paint your coat of arms on the monuments; and don't race one
another to the next site.
On Wednesday we had Timewatch, BBC2's regular history series which, this
month, went back over the argument that arose after the Houses of Parliament
burned down in 1834 and a new building was needed: should it be classical or
gothic? This was not the clearest possible exposition of the debate, which
has such obvious echoes today. I was never sure whether there was any
possibility of the new building being constructed using the techniques
exemplified by Crystal Palace and St Pancras Station rather than the
classical or gothic style. Incidentally, having mentioned the 1947 music it
should be noted that this Timewatch sometimes used music and speech
simultaneously, a daft and self defeating yet increasingly widespread habit
today.
Wednesdays are also bringing Churchill, a four-part television biography
written and presented by Martin Gilbert. The structure is wholly familiar:
newsreels are interspersed with interviews, some from the archives and some
shot specially. It seems remarkable how many of Churchill's staff are still
around and still lively; they must have been considerably younger than he
was.
We are also treated to shots of the presenter posed in front of some empty
room saying 'Here is where . . .' which does precious little for the viewer
but doubtless pleased the production staff who presumably got some nice
foreign trips.
There are occasional amusements: the description of Churchill on the
saluting base in north Africa when the surrendered German general came past
in a smart uniform and splendid car but towed by a mule, and the two men
caught one another's eyes and both began to laugh; and the moment when
Churchill got out of the bath in the White House, urging Roosevelt to stay
with the words 'The Prime Minister has nothing to hide from the President of
the United States.' But generally it is a dry and dutiful account which
seems to add little to what was known. It would make an excellent schools
programme.
It is pretty clear that all those mentioned so far are history programmes,
and there are others about which there would probably be little argument:
The Treaty, for example, although presented in the form of a two-hour drama,
was actually another history programme, this time dealing with the partition
of Ireland. It was a notable achievement for writer Brian Phelan and
director/producer Jonathan Lewis who managed to make cross-table negotiation
on the detailed drafting of a political document seem dramatic . . . which
it is, no doubt, but making it seem so in a television drama is an
impressive trick.
The difficulty with reaching any broad conclusions about history on
television arises when you start trying to decide what is not history.
Sometimes the dilemma is not particularly important. For instance a
programme which has recently begun on BBC2, The Day The World Changed,
appears to be considered by its producers as a historical series but after
watching the first two - with Steven Berkoff choosing the day when Herschel
Grynszpan shot a German in Paris, and Liz Lochead the day when Mary Queen of
Scots was beheaded (to be screened this evening) - I have my doubts.
It seems clear that the presenters are being encouraged to make their
approaches deeply personal and to 'come on strong', and the result is that
the programmes convey more about their presenters than about their
historical subjects. But what about the four-part documentary on The
Falklands War on Channel 4? Watching this makes you realise that
historiography is probably changing, and television is probably changing it.
Throughout the whole of recorded history up to now a nation's perception of
its own recent history has been inevitably nationalistic: the communications
did not exist for it to be anything else.
Now here is a series, produced by Denys Blakeway and Hugh Scully, which,
just 10 years after the event, is proving to be everything that television
news coverage at the time was not: broad ranging, carefully considered, with
access to virtually all sources of information on both sides of the conflict
at all levels.
Monday's programme on what really happened over the sinking of the Belgrano
included information delivered to the viewer by the captain of the British
submarine, the captain of the Belgrano, the commanders of the Royal Navy in
London and in the South Atlantic, members of the British war cabinet, and of
the Argentine junta. That is not to say that we were given the whole truth
(though it began to feel like most of it) but it is to say that we are in a
better position to judge what was done in our name than, for instance, our
forebears listening to fourth-hand hearsay evidence 10 years after the
victory over the Spanish armada (most of our gratitude on that occasion
being due to foul weather in the Channel, I believe).
Yet many people would not even concede that The Falklands War is 'history'
at all. Even among those who do, there will be many who would certainly draw
the line at The Washington Version which, in programmes on Thursday, Friday
and Saturday, gave a detailed and completely engrossing account of the
planning and conduct of the the Gulf War as seen from a US standpoint.
The Gulf War took place just 12 months ago: at what point do matters cease
to be current affairs and begin to be history? In the end the only logical
answer to that may be that anything which has happened is history and the
rest is speculation. What seems so striking, as you watch not only hefty
international stories about wars and other great events but also accounts of
popular taste in the recent past (Paul Madden's investigation of The
Avengers on Without Walls or the wickedly funny accounts of fashions in
interior decoration in Signs Of The Times) or detailed descriptions of the
development and use of particular vehicles (delightful programmes on the
Morris 1000 and the Avro Shackleton in Perpetual Motion) is that, with
history as with so many other subjects, television is telescoping the
process of communication. The raw material of history is being delivered
straight into the nation's sitting rooms.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Management: In pursuit of a lean machine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is increasing worry in Britain about the effect of low levels of
education and training - employers are often criticised for not spending
enough on training compared with their German counterparts.
Yet a new US study* suggests some of this criticism may be misplaced. The
study of productivity in 56 car plants owned by 24 companies around the
world reaches a surprising conclusion: that European car workers may be
over-educated. It finds that European workers are better trained than
American ones, yet are still far less productive.
The authors argue that European car plants are not managed well enough
according to the principles of flexible - or lean - production to make the
best use of their well-educated workforce. Conversely, US plants are
relatively good at extracting value from poorly-prepared workers.
'European plants appear unable to exploit the potential of their relatively
well-educated and highly-trained workforce,' concludes the study by
academics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
On a training index which ranged from 1 for very little training to 4 for a
lot, Japanese plants in Japan scored the highest at 3.6. Japanese-owned
plants in the US scored 3.5, while European plants scored 2.9, and US-owned
plants in the US scored only 2.3.
Japanese plants in Japan were better organised for lean production, making
more use of techniques such as team working and just-in-time inventory
control. They scored 83 on a flexibility index of 0 to 100, compared with 39
for US plants in the US, and 35 for European plants. But although the US
plants scored poorly on these measures, they were considerably more
productive than European ones.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Rocky road to Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The term 'sustainable development' has become an international buzzword in
the run up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development -
the Earth Summit - to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June.
The term is defined as 'economic development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs'.
But a new survey by SustainAbility, a UK environmental consultancy,
demonstrates that the road to Rio is still very rocky and uphill. 'Not
surprisingly the debate about sustainable development has so far taken place
mainly at the rarefied international level,' it says. 'Most local activists
and ordinary business people are still not actively involved.'
The study found that some environmental organisations were rethinking their
position on whether they can or should work with business and industry. But
there was still a considerable amount of reluctance.
In discussions with the World Wide Fund for Nature in Geneva the researchers
found that the organisation was split on the extent to which its various
national branches should work with business.
'There is absolutely no hope in terms of ecological leadership or vision in
the political or business communities,' said David Suzuki of the University
of British Columbia.
Tony Cleaver, chief executive of IBM UK, was more positive. He thought the
most hopeful sign was 'the increased awareness of environmental issues, both
in business and in politics, coupled with the increasing belief that it is
possible to marry economic growth and environmental responsibility'.
Environmentalists rated chemicals and power generation as the main problem
industries, followed by the petroleum industry and public and private
transport.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Management: Digesting facts on feast and famine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two sides to weight control: calories eaten, and calories burned
up. The only way to lose weight permanently is to strike a balance between
the two.
But the realities of business life are heavily stacked against balance of
any sort. It is too easy to get locked into a pattern of dumping an
increasing number of calories on to a system that is increasingly sedentary.
Most business meals are large and laden with fat, sugar and alcohol.
They are also eaten under stressful conditions, late in the evening and on
the run in hotels, aeroplanes and conferences.
This recipe for chronic fatigue and overweight is followed by hundreds of
thousands of managers around the world. The morbid results are high blood
pressure, diabetes, heart disease, blood cholesterol, not to mention
shattered self-confidence.
Once the warning lights start flashing, you go to the doctor and get put on
a diet. Unfortunately, most diets employ draconian methods - and are
scientifically dubious to boot - making them a short-term success, but a
long-term disaster.
This is because they concentrate exclusively on how many calories are going
in (to be discussed in the next Health Check). They ignore the key
ingredient for long-term success: your metabolic rate, or the number of
calories used up by your body every day.
When your doctor tells you that you are overweight your knee-jerk reaction
is probably to go on a diet, perhaps skip a few meals, cancel that lunch
reservation at your favourite restaurant. But to do that will send the wrong
message to your body.
The body does not know you are skipping lunch because you want to lose
weight. Its survival mechanisms will be alerted to an imminent famine and it
will slow down the metabolism to conserve energy.
It will even prepare to use its own muscle protein as a calorie source. If
you spend lunchtime sitting still at your desk, your metabolism will be
reduced further.
So how can you increase your metabolic rate in a safe and practical way?
The good news is that you need to eat - but eat wisely. Shift the bulk of
your daily calories to earlier in the day, when your metabolism is higher
and you can handle the calorie load.
The overwhelming majority of executives that I see every year report that
they consume 60 per cent or more of their daily calorie intake at dinner.
The only possible message to the body is to store those calories as fat.
There is nothing wrong with having snacks between meals. Eating nuts,
wholewheat biscuits or fruit maintains the metabolic rate and keeps the
level of blood sugar constant.
Exercise is also important, but there is no need to don the sneakers and
sprint round the park. Mild exercise can increase your metabolic rate,
particularly after meals. Leave the table 15 minutes earlier and walk
briskly back to the office. Recent research shows that for every 15 minutes
of brisk walking after a meal, your metabolic rate will remain high for 30
minutes, while you are back at the office sitting in front of the computer.
That is high leverage.
Do not wait for that imaginary weekend or vacation to come when you begin to
eat sensibly and play a strenuous game of tennis. You did not get into this
situation overnight, you are not going to get out of it overnight either: so
start now.

Holland

<TEXT>
SHOP STEWARDS at Ford New Holland, the tractor maker owned by Fiat and Ford,
decided yesterday to organise selective strike action in an attempt to gain
improvements in a three-year pay offer providing 4 per cent in the first
year, Michael Smith writes.
Mr Dave Vos, convener, would not say what form the action would take or when
it would happen, but on Monday he mentioned the possibility of one-day and
two-day strikes.
The 1,600 manual workers who have been made the offer oppose the duration of
the deal and the company's proposal to introduce temporary workers. Skilled
workers want financial recognition for new responsibilities they say they
have taken on.
Ford New Holland has refused to change its offer.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Testing time for the new man of
letters - The job facing Alan Johnson as leader of the postal workers' union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALAN TUFFIN inherited a special telephone when he took over as general
secretary of the UCW postal workers' union in 1982.
'That's the hotline. If it rings, it's either the prime minister or the
chancellor of the exchequer,' said Mr Tom Jackson, Mr Tuffin's famously
mustachioed predecessor, as he cleared his desk.
A decade later Mr Tuffin is preparing, in turn, to hand over his office to
Mr Alan Johnson, whose election as UCW general secretary-designate was
announced on Friday.
The telephone - not the vibrant red one might imagine for a hotline, but a
dusty, old-fashioned ivory model - still sits on the desk. It has only rung
once in Mr Tuffin's time as UCW leader. 'Somebody wanted to know if it was
Sainsbury's,' says Mr Tuffin wistfully. 'I've never had the luxury of a
Labour government. I've had to deal with a hostile, anti-trade union
government for all the time I've been general secretary.'
Number 10 no longer quakes at the prospect of postal workers flexing their
industrial muscle. The Christmas card is still played most years, as postal
deliveries are briefly threatened as part of pay negotiating tactics. But
there have been just two national postal strikes in the past two decades -
apart from some stoppages at Crown Post Offices last year, which affected
few people.
If a Labour government is back in power by the time Mr Johnson takes over
next year, the worst of the union's fears on privatisation of the postal
service are unlikely to be realised. However, the union would still face a
number of threats and pressures. They include:
New rules from the European Community that are likely to increase
competition and tighten up on cross-subsidies, for example between letter
and parcel services. The effect might be the loss of Post Office business -
and UCW members - to largely non-unionised private operators.
New technology, which might mean the reduction of postal sorting jobs. UCW
membership has been bolstered in recent years by the growth in postal
volumes; but further technological advances might outstrip volume gains.
That has been the case among another of the union's former strong membership
groups, BT telephone operators.
Internal Post Office reorganisation, including separation of the different
businesses, to which the union is only now beginning to respond.
Fragmentation of bargaining has stretched negotiating resources and, at the
same time, the UCW's local structure is under threat from Post Office
management.
A special union conference next month will discuss how to slim down the
existing 800 branches to about 80. To date, the union has managed to avoid
the kind of political divisions which consume so much energy in some other
unions. A smaller number of more powerful branches might leave the UCW more
vulnerable to factionalism in future.
The need to professionalise and streamline head office bureaucracy. The UCW
elects rather than appoints its officers, a policy meaning that, in many
cases, parallel professional appointments have to be made to ensure a
reasonable degree of head office competence. Management consultants have
recommended changes but a special conference of the union last year rejected
many of the proposals.
Radical internal reorganisation is unlikely until after any merger with the
National Communications Union. Mr Tuffin hopes to see the merger agreed
before he steps down next year; the election of Mr Johnson, who is fervently
pro-merger, increases the chances of that happening.
Combining with the NCU to form a union with about 350,000 members - of which
the UCW will contribute about 200,000 - would not put the merged body into
the super-union league, neither would it ease the difficulties of being
linked to a single sector at a time of great change. A merger would,
however, allow the best use of resources as the search for new membership
groups becomes more urgent.
What of Mr Johnson himself? He is comparatively unknown outside the
communications union world. He did, however, hit the headlines briefly a few
months ago when the union extracted an apology from Reebok, the maker of
training shoes, over advertising posters featuring postmen pursued by dogs.
Mr Johnson is well-known for his sense of humour but, as an ex-postman,
finds jokes about dogs too close to the bone.
He is seen as having great promise - a natural successor to Mr Tuffin, but
from an updated mould. Mr Peter Hain, the UCW's former head of research and
now Labour MP for Neath, thinks Mr Johnson will be 'one of the brightest
stars in the trade union movement'.
Now 41, Mr Johnson is young for the job but, as a man who had three children
by the time he was 20, he has some practice of being ahead of his years. He
was orphaned as a child, narrowly escaping a children's home when it was
decided his older sister should look after him. He is a Queens Park Rangers
fan and assiduously follows The Archers on Radio 4.
Like Mr Tuffin, he came up through the union's ranks and is stoutly
Kinnockite. He is a lucid speaker, reputed to be a quick and meticulous
negotiator, and is said to abhor old-style table thumping. His election
address points out that union members need no 'recitation of the problems
they face; they need to be confident that we have the vitality and ingenuity
to find solutions'.
As for the ivory telephone on what will be his new desk - he plans to keep
it, just in case.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories step up spending attack -
Economic Strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives stepped up their assault on Labour's economic strategy
yesterday with an updated costing that puts the eventual price of the
opposition's public spending pledges at Pounds 37bn a year.
The costing - carried out by civil servants but with the interpretation of
Labour's plans provided by ministers - will provide the basis for a
sustained publicity campaign against the opposition's tax and spending
policies.
Last night a Conservative party political broadcast warned that income tax
increases to fund those pledges would mean the average voter being Pounds
1,000 a year worse off under a Labour government.
That will be followed by a poster and advertising campaign claiming that the
losses - based on the assumption that basic rate tax jumped from 25p to 35p
 -would range from Pounds 1,000 a year for the average reader of the Daily
Mirror to Pounds 2,625 for FT readers.
Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, insisted that the
figures, which attracted derision from the Labour party and a sceptical
response from journalists at a Westminster press conference, were based on a
rigorous analysis of Labour policy documents and statements.
Pouring scorn on Labour's oft-repeated assertion that the party's only firm
pledges were to raise child benefit and pensions, Mr Mellor cited many other
commitments.
They ranged from a promise to equalise retirement age at 60 (estimated cost
Pounds 3bn a year), to the Pounds 100m it would cost to introduce a no-fault
compensation scheme for NHS patients.
Mr Mellor quoted extensively from the policy pronouncements of Labour's
shadow ministers to undercut the party's disclaimer that, apart from the
pensions and child benefit proposals, all other commitments would depend on
economic growth. New pledges over the past few months meant that, once all
the policies were 'up and running', the annual cost had risen by Pounds 2bn
from the Pounds 35bn the Conservatives had estimated last June.
In private, senior Tory strategists admit that some of Labour's pledges
could be met by higher public borrowing, while in practice they would expect
others to be delayed or dropped if Labour took office.
They insist, however, that their latest costings provide a graphic
illustration of a fundamental contradiction behind Labour policy - the
promise of large-scale increases in public spending above those planned by
the government with a parallel pledge not to raise the tax burden for most
voters.
Labour angrily rebuffed the Conservative calculations. Mr Gordon Brown,
shadow trade and industry spokesman, said they were 'full of errors, riddled
with falsehoods, exaggerated, compounded and multiplied by bogus figures'.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said he had found Pounds 3bn of
errors in his area of responsibility alone, including an exaggerated cost
for Labour's planned minimum wage.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour says Britain's recession
'worst in EC' - Prime Minister's Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR attempted yesterday to demolish repeated government claims that the
present recession was international in scope, contrasting the shrinking
British economy with growth in other European countries.
The government hit back with a fresh assault on Labour's taxation and
spending pledges. According to Mr John Major, the prime minister, the
implication of such pledges was that either borrowing would rise to
'unprecedented' levels or taxes would be increased 'to a quite remarkable
extent'.
During a rowdy session of prime minister's questions, Mr Major said that
Labour's policies would ensure 'a longstanding and deep recession in this
country'.
Labour had been 'rumbled' on its spending and tax plans and did not like it,
he said.
He denied that recessionary conditions were confined purely to Britain.
Almost every industrialised country was experiencing 'economic problems', he
said.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, attacked Britain's relative economic
performance, claiming it was the worst in the Community in terms of
unemployment, investment and production.
While other European countries were growing, Britain's economy was
'shrinking' by 2 per cent, he said.
That theme was also pursued at an earlier Labour press conference, when the
party cited figures showing that business closures were running at 2,225 a
week last year.
'All the figures which should be going up are still going down,' said Mr
Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary. 'All those that should be
going down, including inflation, are still going up.'
Budget submissions sent to the Treasury by industrialists showed
overwhelming support for investment tax allowances, Mr Brown said, but
ministers had ruled out such incentives.
Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office junior minister, last night accused Labour MPs
of making 'inflammatory' charges that the Asylum Bill to deter bogus
applicants for political asylum in Britain was motivated by racist and
electoral considerations.
The Bill was given a third reading by a government majority of 82 (298-216)
and now goes to the Lords.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clark advises on private hearing
for MoD expert - Trade and Industry Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence was yesterday believed to be insisting that an
official who interviewed suppliers of parts for the Iraqi 'supergun', due to
appear before the Commons trade and industry committee today, be allowed to
give evidence in private.
Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, was summoned before the
committee yesterday to discuss the testimony of Mr Bill Weir, an MoD
materials expert. A decision would not be made until this morning, Mr Ken
Warren (C Hastings and Rye), chairman of the committee, said.
Mr Warren said he was taking Mr Clark's advice on whether the inquiry risked
straying into areas of 'classified information'.
Officials of Walter Somers, the Midlands-based metallurgical company,
yesterday admitted to the committee that the company had had two separate
contracts with Iraq for the supply of 10-metre tubes, and not one as
previously thought.
The company believed both were for a petrochemical project, but it now
appears the first tubes were for a scaled-down prototype of the Iraqi
supergun, codenamed Project Babylon, designed to launch satellites into
space. The second was for an artillery adaptation.
The two phases of the project were described to the committee last week by
Dr Christopher Cowley, a metallurgist who worked with Canadian arms expert
Dr Gerald Bull on the design of the supergun.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Brooke in talks offer as Major
scorns pact - Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night revived his
political initiative for the province by writing to leaders of the four main
parties inviting them to round-table talks.
Mr Brooke is believed to have decided that the conditions are right for a
fresh attempt at removing the obstacles to formal negotiations on the
political future of the province after discussions with all Northern
Ireland's leading politicians in recent days.
A close ally of Mr Brooke said last night that the upsurge in terrorist
violence and hints of a new readiness for talks within the province's
political circles meant there was no case for postponing discussions until
after a general election.
However, it was acknowledged that Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and
Labour Party leader, might still have reservations about resuming talks with
a general election imminent.
The Northern Ireland Office said that no date or venue had been fixed for
any meeting with Mr Hume, Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, Rev Ian
Paisley of the Democratic Unionists and Mr James Molyneaux of the Ulster
Unionists.
Mr Molyneaux and Mr Alderdice have already indicated a readiness to resume
discussions.
Earlier yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, fuelled speculation
that he was contemplating a deal with Unionist MPs in a hung parliament when
he scorned calls for a pact among the main British parties on preserving the
1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
Labour and Liberal Democrats expressed fears that the prime minister was
prepared to jeopardise progress towards a political settlement.
Nevertheless, Downing Street officials rejected such an interpretation of
the prime minister's comments, while Tories and the Unionist party have
denied that any discussions have taken place.
Mr Major was asked by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, if he would
support a 'a cross-party approach to Northern Ireland affairs during the
election and unequivocally reject any partisan trading with the Anglo-Irish
Agreement'.
Liberal Democrats, many of whom believe a hung parliament will be the most
likely outcome of the forthcoming contest, want to force the other main
parties to set out more clearly what post-election deals they might
contemplate.
Mr Major's reply did not mention the agreement and said only: 'This party
stands four-square against terrorism and we have set out our policies
clearly . . . on many occasions. I do not see any imminent change.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Smoker's claim of constructive
dismissal fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NURSING auxiliary yester-day failed at an industrial tribunal in her claim
of constructive dismissal over a smoking ban at work.
The decision, which is subject to appeal, confirms the right of employers to
introduce smoking bans on their premises. Workplace smoking bans are
increasingly popular with employers who are fearful of claims against them
from workers seeking compensation for the effects of passive smoking.
The tribunal decided Mrs May Dryden, 63, was not forced to leave her job at
Glasgow's Western Infirmary after Greater Glasgow Health Board introduced a
smoking ban.
Mrs Dryden, who smokes 25 cigarettes a day, told the tribunal she could not
go eight hours without a cigarette and therefore had to leave her job.
She said the health board banned smoking on its premises last summer. It did
not set aside rooms for smokers or allow them time to smoke outside.
The tribunal's decision will affect hundreds of smokers who still work for
the health board. Written reasons for the decision will be given later.
The health board said it was pleased the tribunal had decided in its favour.
It would wait for the written reasons before commenting further.
Mrs Dryden said: 'I am disappointed for myself but I am more disappointed
for my colleagues that evidently nothing is going to be done about this
situation.'
Up to one in five employers now operate anti-smoking policies. They include
Midland Bank, IBM, Marks and Spencer and the Inland Revenue.
Ms Alison Hillhouse, director of Ash, the anti-smoking group, said the
ruling was encouraging.
The Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest)
said the ruling meant British workplaces were moving closer to those in the
US, where 'employers are dictating what people do outside their working
hours'.

A SECOND strike ballot of Financial Times journalists has produced a larger
majority in favour of strike action if the management goes ahead with plans
for compulsory retirement on health grounds of nine people suffering from
repetitive strain injury.
In the latest poll, 83 per cent supported strike action, against 71 per cent
in the last ballot. There were 93 per cent in favour of action short of a
strike (91 per cent).

FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: The government weighs its pair of
choice dates - Speculation over timing of the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APRIL 9 or May 7? Both are encircled still in pencil rather than ink in Mr
John Major's diary. But as the general election campaign gathers momentum
his pen is poised over the first.
The message on the Whitehall networks is that, barring disasters, the prime
minister will not delay. Senior ministers do not demur from their officials'
judgment.
One mandarin confessed this week he planned a holiday for late March. The
campaign, he judged, would then be in full swing. Another had stepped up a
detailed analysis of Labour's policies in case, as he put it: 'We get a
Kinnock government sooner rather than later.'
As the decks are cleared, Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, is
drafting a series of notes on the responsibilities of civil servants once
the election is under way.
At the request of the Treasury, they may include an outline of the role of
civil servants in the presentation of the Budget if Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, presents it after the election has been called.
Some officials have been looking back to the precedent of 1955. In April
that year, Mr 'Rab' Butler, then chancellor, gave his Budget four days after
Sir Anthony Eden had announced the election date.
Those with memories refreshed by a recent Whitehall minute recall that Mr
Butler cut income tax from nine shillings to eight shillings and sixpence in
the pound and raised the tax threshold for a married man from Pounds 210 to
Pounds 240.
Within months of the Conservative victory, however, Mr Butler paid for the
income tax cuts by increasing purchase tax - the 1950s equivalent of VAT. By
the end of the same year Mr Butler had been replaced as chancellor by Mr
Harold Macmillan.
A repeat of that chronology is highly unlikely. If the speculation in
Whitehall proves correct, Mr Lamont will set March 10 as the Budget date. Mr
Major would prefer March 3, but presumably would be loath to overrule the
chancellor. The latter date would give him just enough time to go to the
country on April 9.
So he does not have to commit himself until then. He insists also that, if
necessary, he will stay in Downing Street until the constitutional deadline
of July 9 - in practice, late June.
For its part, Conservative Central Office has long encouraged the view that
May 7, the date of annual local elections, is the most likely choice.
It has the advantage of tidiness and would allow more time for tangible
evidence of the promised economic recovery to emerge. Mr Chris Patten, the
party chairman, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, are said to regard it
as the best option.
The view of the Treasury establishment is that the recovery might still be
faltering during an April campaign but the light at the end of the tunnel
would at least be brighter.
Mr Patten, meanwhile, is said to have been weighing several factors, ranging
from the better campaigning weather during late April to the dispersal of
the Liberal Democrat campaign effort between local and general elections on
May 7.
He must also be worried that final poll tax bills will begin to fall through
letter boxes in the last week of March, playing to one of Labour's strengths
during an April 9 campaign.
There are now clear signals, though, that Mr Major is keen to go anyway in
April. Others in the cabinet - including Mr Kenneth Baker, the home
secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - are lining up behind
that judgment.
The arguments are both personal and practical. Although an instinctively
cautious politician, Mr Major has become impatient with delay. As one
insider puts it: 'He has become frustrated by all the agonising. He wants to
get on with the job of being prime minister.'
Nor does he want the embarrassment of 'standing down' party activists when
he makes a keynote speech to the Conservative Central Council meeting in
Torquay on March 14. That would evoke too many memories of the dithering of
Mr James Callaghan in 1978.
There are more practical considerations. The admission by the Treasury that
the economic recovery has once again been delayed has added force to the
argument that the best Mr Major can offer is the promise rather than the
reality of an upturn. Nor does he any longer have the luxury of waiting for
the three-month run of opinion poll leads which provided the trigger for the
1983 and 1987 elections.
That said, the argument runs, nothing is likely to happen in the four weeks
between April 9 and May 7 which would improve Conservative fortunes - and
much might go wrong. More positively, an April poll would leave a
tax-cutting Budget fresh in voters' minds.
A reduction in the basic rate of income tax or a large increase in tax
thresholds would crystallise the taxation issue which Mr Major hopes will
dominate the campaign. And the Budget would provide the philosophical glue
for an election manifesto that still lacks a striking central theme, or big
idea.
Not all are so upbeat. When told that the bookmakers were offering odds of
66:1 against a late June election, one minister said he would probably wager
Pounds 100. Another senior minister advised: 'Put your money on April but
leave yourself a small escape hatch.' Mr Major has done just that.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Uncertainty hold back Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY over the outcome of the general election is depressing
confidence and holding back a growth in demand, west Midlands business
leaders warned yesterday.
'There is a certain amount of fear about what is going to happen. This is
bound to create some degree of uncertainty,' said Mr Bryan Townsend,
chairman of Midlands Electricity and vice-chairman of the Confederation of
British Industry's west Midlands regional council.
The council brings together the principal manufacturing and service
companies in a region whose economy is more dependent than any other in the
UK on the health of industry.
Although believing that west Midlands industry is well-placed to profit
'once demands starts to grow', Mr Townsend added that such growth is a
matter of confidence and 'there won't be that confidence while there are the
uncertainties'.
He was speaking in Birmingham after a meeting of the CBI's regional council,
which expressed some optimism about an upturn in the economy during the
second half of this year.
With most plants in the west Midlands working at less than full capacity, as
recent surveys have shown, Mr Townsend effectively ruled out an
investment-led recovery. 'If you're working 20 to 30 per cent below
capacity, new investment is difficult to justify,' he said.

FT  22 JAN 92 / North shows fall in confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence in the north of England fell sharply in the fourth
quarter of last year, according to the latest Business Survey North,
published yesterday.
Only 16 per cent of the 582 north-eastern and Cumbrian companies surveyed
expected an improvement in business conditions in the first quarter of this
year and 27.9 per cent expected them to worsen.
That contrasts strongly with the third-quarter Business Survey North, issued
in October, when 36.7 per cent expected an improvement and only 13.6 per
cent a decline, stimulating hopes that the region was moving out of
recession.
In the latest survey, 55 per cent of companies expected an increase in
turnover this year and 19.4 per cent a drop. But 25 per cent expected
profits to fall, reflecting growing pressure on margins.
During the fourth quarter, sales at home and abroad rose slightly and
profits improved, but investment remained weak and export orders fell. The
proportion of companies working at more than 90 per cent capacity dropped
from 24.6 per cent to 20.3 per cent.
The survey, covering manufacturing, service and primary industries, is
undertaken quarterly by the Northern Development Company and the Tyne and
Wear and Teesside Chambers of Commerce and Training and Enterprise Councils.
The report partly attributes the decline in confidence to worries over
rising costs.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Network of clubs to serve small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a nationwide network of small-business clubs were announced in
London yesterday.
Durham Small Business Club, which is promoting the idea, hopes the new
network, named Small Business Clubs Nationwide, will start to operate with
20 member clubs on April 1. It is intended for small established businesses,
many of which find chambers of commerce are too expensive or too formal.
According to Mr Tom Moffat, chairman of the Durham Business Club, member
clubs of the new organisation would have to be professionally managed with
full-time staff - unlike many existing business clubs which were run on a
part-time, voluntary basis.
At a conference to launch the plan in London yesterday 10 representatives of
existing business clubs, training and enterprise councils and local
authorities said they were interested. A second conference is to be held in
Durham tomorrow.
Mr Moffat believed business clubs would complement rather than compete with
the chambers. They might eventually form part of a three-tier
business-support network with start-ups helped by enterprise agencies,
smaller established businesses belonging to a club and larger businesses
belonging to a chamber.
Few businesses take steps to reduce the risk of bad debts or to encourage
their customers to pay on time, according to a survey by Barclays Commercial
Services (BCS), the bank's factoring subsidiary.
Four out of five businesses polled said they had no form of credit
protection cover for their invoices even though late payment and non-payment
were significant causes of business failure. Only one in four said they
offered a discount for early settlement.

<TEXT>
ROYAL BANK of Scotland, the fifth-largest UK banking group, yesterday
promised its 100,000 small-business customers that it would remove their
overdrafts only in exceptional circumstances and with advance notice
wherever possible.
The pledge featured in Royal Bank's charter for small businesses, which
appeared yesterday amid warm praise from customers.
Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum for Private Business, said the
charter came very close to the contractual agreement the forum was seeking.
He gave it 82 marks out of 100, placing it well ahead of the other banks in
terms of approval from business people.
The FPB and other small business groups were closely involved in drawing up
the charter. Royal Bank is the last of the top seven UK banks to produce
such a charter.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Spending reported stable at year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of low inflation and reduced fears of unemployment have helped
to stabilise consumer confidence, according to a Gallup/BSL regional
consumer survey published yesterday.
The nationwide survey suggested that consumer spending in the fourth quarter
of last year was little changed from the third quarter. It was 1.5 per cent
lower than in the last quarter of 1990.
The improvement in consumer confidence has been most marked in East Anglia,
the north-west of England and the south-west. The north, east Midlands and
south-east, excluding London, showed improvements above the national
average.
The fear of unemployment, while slowly diminishing over the year, continued
to restrain consumers across the country. Expectations on inflation and the
cost of living improved significantly, however.
For the first time since the middle of last year, households expected their
financial situation to improve over the next 12 months. Only Greater London
and Wales expected them to deteriorate.
In Scotland consumer confidence improved over the year to reach the UK
average by the end of last year. The north-south divide has narrowed in the
recession as unemployment has grown more quickly in the south and house
prices have fallen further, Cambridge Econometrics said yesterday.
It said in a report on regional prospects that on measures such as income
per head and unemployment, the south remained more prosperous.
The report forecast virtually no growth for this year for Greater London -
the region suffering worst in the recession. Scotland, which escaped the
worst of the recession, was predicted to grow faster in the short term than
any of the English regions and Wales.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Investor wins case on savings account
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE, the second-largest building society, was ordered yesterday to
pay compensation to an investor who lost money because the society's
publicity failed to make clear that a better savings account existed than
the one in which she was investing, David Barchard writes.
Mr Stephen Edell, the building society ombudsman, ruled against a second
complaint by another investor that he had lost money because a slightly
better 90-day account had been introduced during the period in which he was
required to give notice before withdrawing his money.
Mr Edell said yesterday: 'Fundamentally, it is up to people to look after
their own investments. Investors should be vigilant about their investments,
but I don't think that building societies ought to hide the interest rates
paid on closed accounts.'
The complaints followed an outcry against the society last spring when many
of its savers discovered that they were trapped in a lower 90-day interest
account and could not transfer their funds after a better account had been
introduced.
There was uproar at the society's annual meeting in the summer as members
attacked the directors for not telling them about the better account and not
relaxing the90-day rule for giving notice.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Weak credit demand damps recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR credit remains subdued, providing little sign of any imminent
recovery from the recession, according to Bank of England figures published
yesterday.
Bank and building society lending to the private sector grew by a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 1.1bn last month, about half the figure predicted by the
City, while money supply growth remained weak. That increase in M4 lending
followed a freak Pounds 5.7bn increase in November. It took growth in the
figure back to depressed levels.
The data indicate that the desire of companies and individuals to reduce
debts, rather than to take on new credit, will continue to hold back the
economy.
Narrow money or M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins in circulation
and indicates underlying demand pressures, rose 0.3 per cent in December
compared with November to give a 2.8 per cent increase for the year.
The figure, coming after November's year-on-year rise in M0 of 2.9 per cent,
underlines the fragility of consumer activity and accords with recent data
showing weak retail sales.
Broad money or M4 - cash plus bank and building society deposits - rose by
0.8 per cent in December compared with November.
Last month's year-on-year increase in M4 was 6.2 per cent, up from
November's 5.7 per cent. Much of the change was due to higher monetary
growth prompted by the unexpectedly large increase of Pounds 1.2bn in
government borrowing in December.
The figures from the Bank coincided with a report from Britain's nine
biggest commercial banks, which said that last month they lent a net Pounds
39m to the private sector - after a Pounds 3.5bn figure in November which
has been dismissed as a statistical quirk.
The British Bankers' Association, a trade body for the banks, said
December's figures pointed to 'no upturn in lending'. It said that in the
past nine months manufacturers had repaid more than Pounds 2bn in debts.
Demand from individuals for credit had been 'modest' in recent months.
According to detailed figures from the association - which are not adjusted
for seasonal variations - retailers last month repaid debts worth Pounds
406m and manufacturers reduced their credit overhang by Pounds 674m.
Groups in the financial sector that went against the trend included leasing
com-panies and securities dealers, which took on new credit of Pounds 514m
and Pounds 518m respectively.

BRITISH COAL yesterday announced plans to cut 1,100 jobs at four collieries
in the Yorkshire area.
It said the cuts at four pits - Kellingley and Prince of Wales near
Pontefract, Sharlston near Wakefield, and Whitemoor, part of the Selby
complex - were intended to increase competitiveness by March next year when
contracts with the power generators expire. It fears it may be priced out of
the market without streamlining.
The numbers, which were released at a regional meeting of British Coal, are
not official but British Coal confirmed that they were indicative. It is
understood that voluntary redundancies will be sought before March 28 this
year when an enhanced payment agreement expires.
Union officials fear the losses could total more than 1,300. Mr Ken
Capstick, vice-chairman of Yorkshire National Union of Mineworkers, said:
'I'm disgusted. This is not rationalising the industry, it's butchering.' He
said he expected more cuts to be announced tomorrow at a meeting of the
company's South Yorkshire group.
Mr Alan Houghton, Selby group director, said: 'The contracts with the
electricity generators expire in March next year and our policy is to make
the Selby group of pits strong enough to claim a major share of the market.'
Mr Houghton will meet NUM leaders at the four pits today to spell out how
they will be affected.
Mr Kevin Barron, shadow energy minister, is understood to have received a
letter from the NUM totalling the job losses. He said: 'The Tories are
determined to kill off everything that doesn't make them a fast buck - even
at the expense of the long-term interests of the country.'
During question time in the Commons yesterday Mr John Major, the prime
minister, expressed regret at the job losses. Responding to Mr Barron, Mr
Major said: 'I am sorry to hear of the job losses to which you refer, but
the only secure future for the coal industry or indeed any other industry is
to put itself in a position where it is producing, at a price people can
afford, something that people want.'
One Selby miner said: 'Miners feel betrayed. They were tempted into taking
on larger mortgages and now they are being kicked in the teeth.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / Row over running of Lloyd's grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE signs that the leadership of Lloyd's of London is increasingly
isolated in opposing proposed reforms to the way the market is run.
With feeling running high among the market's underwriting and broking
businesses, Lloyd's Council, the insurance market's governing body, may be
forced to backtrack on its initial rejection of a proposal that its
responsibilities for business development should be handed over to a new
market board controlled by Lloyd's agents.
In its 240-page report, published last week, the 14-man task force also
recommended that the council's independence as a regulator should be
reinforced by the appointment of an independent chairman.
On Monday Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, and Mr David Coleridge, chairman,
reiterated their opposition to the task force proposals on governance. Mr
Lord described them as unworkable.
Yesterday Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents
Association, which represents more than 150 agencies, said he was 'amazed'
by the council's instant rejection and by Mr Lord's comments. 'The
governance chapter of the task force report is fairly fundamental to other
things we want to achieve,' he said.
Mr Nigel Rogers, managing director of Octavian Group, one of the most
rapidly growing Lloyd's agencies, said: 'I haven't spoken to anyone who
thought that the council was right. The groundswell of opinion means that
they will have to reconsider.'
Mr Chris Burton, joint chief executive of AJ Archer, a listed Lloyd's
agency, described the council's decision as 'very disappointing'. He added:
'I endorse the idea of a market board and I believe this view to be widely
held.'
The Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Lloyd's
Names, the individuals whose assets provide the market's capital, says it
will press the council to reverse its decision.
Mr Val Powell, the association's chief executive, said: 'We are in round
three and the boxing could get pretty dirty.'
Names will be urged to attend meetings next month to register their
opposition to the council's stance.
The association saw the task force's proposals as analogous to the two-tier
boards common in Germany, with the council and the market board playing
roles equivalent to those of supervisory and management boards.
The market board was necessary because the business had 'not been driven
properly', it said.
Professor John Kay of the London Business School, a member of the task
force, emphasised the importance of a division of the council's regulatory
and executive management roles. 'I can't think of any business structure
where they are combined,' he said. 'You wouldn't ask the chief executive of
BT to be director-general of Oftel.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / Channel 5 bid delayed by video worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission has decided to delay the advertising
of the fifth television channel because of fears about the need to retune
several million video recorders.
The new channel, which should be able to reach three in four homes in the
UK, will use frequencies at present used in linking television sets to video
recorders.
The winner of the franchise, to be awarded by competitive tender, would not
only have to pay for setting up a new national transmitter system but also
for retuning about 3m video recorders that might be affected.
The ITC has decided it needs much more information on how potential
applicants propose to tackle the matter.
Additional draft guidance notes will be issued this week, including an
expected extra section on retuning. Comments have to be sent to the ITC by
the middle of next month.
The commission previously said it intended to advertise the licence in
January, with a closing date three months later.
A March or April date now seems more likely. The commission took the view at
a meeting last week that a few weeks' more delay was preferable to technical
chaos later.
Some potential applicants are concerned about the targets set by the ITC in
draft documents issued in November.
The ITC said the channel should begin broadcasting no later than the end of
December 1994 and that at least 40 per cent of the population should be
covered from the outset.
The ITC decision not to renew Television South West's broadcasting licence
for south-west England was influenced by a misleading ITC assessment of the
television company's business plan, the Appeal Court was told yesterday.
On the second day of TSW's legal challenge to the ITC's decision last
October to award the south-west franchise to Westcountry TV, Mr Gordon
Pollock QC, for TSW, said the assessment led the commissioners to proceed on
a 'mistaken view of the facts'.
He said the commissioners had been led to believe that, in effect, TSW's
forecasting methodology for growth in national net advertising revenue was
'off the wall'.
There was, however, overwhelming evidence that TSW's forecasts were
credible, he said.
The hearing continues today.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Car buyers prefer fixed price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent and GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE OUT of five new car buyers would prefer to have a lower, fixed basic
price for a car, rather than a higher price from which they have to
negotiate their own discount, according to the 1992 Lex Report on Motoring.
The study, based on a Mori survey of nearly 1,300 regular car drivers in 160
locations throughout the UK, claims that only a minority of new car buyers
like to bargain with a car salesman to get a good deal.
The findings appear to support the initiative taken last autumn by Vauxhall,
which lowered the dealer margins and list prices of some new models to
reduce 'haggling' in new car purchasing.
The Lex study says that men feel more comfortable bargaining with car
salesmen, with 50 per cent of men saying they enjoy haggling, compared with
only 28 per cent of women.
The report also discloses that 78 per cent of motorists would support random
breath testing, and 85 per cent support the inclusion of eye tests for night
vision in the driving test.
The latest report of the Advertising Standards Authority, published
yesterday, found particular cause for complaint with the motor industry,
Gary Mead writes. The authority upheld complaints received in November
against Citroen UK for inaccurately suggesting the superiority of some
aspects of a Citroen 1.4-litre Avantage over a Ford Escort 1.4LX.
Complaints were upheld against Peugeot Talbot for a claim concerning the
environmentally 'clean' nature of diesel engines against conventional petrol
engines fitted with catalytic converters, and against Seat UK for a
newspaper advertisement that combined a slogan featuring a car costing
Pounds 5,444 with a photograph showing a model costing Pounds 8,099.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Belfast gets centre for badly addressed letters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR BELFAST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POST OFFICE is creating 300 jobs in Belfast with the opening of a
national processing centre to handle badly addressed mail from all over
Britain, it was announced yesterday.
The new handling centre for undeliverable letters will be opened in May at
Donegall Quay, part of the Laganside inner-city redevelopment area.
Mr Bill Cockburn, managing director of Royal Mail, said: 'We are setting up
a new national centre with state-of-the-art computer technology in place of
numerous manually operated offices to make our return-letter service faster,
more efficient and cost-effective. We are one of the few postal
administrations in the world which offers a return-letter service - and
which does not make any additional charge to the customer for this service.'
The sender of an undeliver-able letter will get it back within two weeks
with an explanation.
The Royal Mail spends Pounds 8m a year dealing with mail that cannot be
delivered, accounting for 120m of the 15bn items handled each year.
The government's policy of decentralising jobs to the regions has created
about 1,500 jobs in the province in the past 18 months.
There will be two centres for stray mail. Belfast will deal with letters
only and Portsmouth will handle packets.
The European Community awarded a Pounds 900,000 grant to the centre because
Northern Ireland is designated a special development area.

FT  22 JAN 92 / NHS funding reform extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXTENSION to the controversial element of the health service reforms
allowing family doctors to buy medical treatment on behalf of their patients
was announced yesterday.
But both Labour and the Liberal Democrats said they would end the practice,
known as fundholding.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, said: 'The next Labour government
will end GP fundholding; we will do it because we will not tolerate two-tier
lists on which the length of time you wait depends on your GP's budget.'
While Labour portrayed this as standing by its existing position, the Tories
interpreted the opposition's announcement that it was looking at ways of
giving all GPs a greater say in National Health Service planning as 'a total
U-turn'.
Under the government's plans, another 5,000 general practitioners will be
able to become fundholders, controlling the budget for treating their
patients for a range of conditions.
Several pilot projects will be launched, designed to improve the operation
of fundholding and to extend the benefits to all GPs. The announcement was
welcomed as 'a step in the right direction' by the British Medical
Association.
Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, told the Commons that the first
wave of GP fundholding practices had been a 'clear success'. The changes he
announced were designed to 'allow advantages of fundholding to be enjoyed by
more patients and doctors'.
The fundholding provisions have been one of the most contentious parts of
the government's health service reforms launched in April 1991. Those
reforms removed the right of family doctors to refer patients to the
hospital of their choice. That meant most GP practices could refer patients
for treatment only to hospitals and organisations with which the district
health authority has contracts for services.
However, some 1,700 GPs in larger practices were allowed to become
fundholders controlling part of the budget for treating patients. Those GPs
can effectively refer their cases - about 7 per cent of all NHS patients -
to hospitals of their choice.
The freedom of referral that fundholding practices enjoy extends to only a
limited range of conditions. They include minor and elective surgery, such
as corneal grafts, hernia repairs and varicose-vein stripping. Operations
costing more than Pounds 5,000 are outside the control of fundholders.
Such operations are often the ones with the longest waiting lists, and
delays to them cause most unhappiness to NHS users. Critics predicted that a
two-tier health service would be created by fundholders, who would use their
control of budgets for operations to buy faster treatment for their patients
at the expense of the rest.
That seemed to happen, as some hospitals began to offer special deals to
fundholders' patients - including shorter waiting times. The government
moved quickly to change the rules, but the impression persisted that
fundholders' patients enjoyed benefits denied to others.
That impression was reinforced by the experience of GPs who have become
fundholders. The Twickenham,
south-west London, practice of Dr Ian Wild and partners, who became
fundholders last April, shows how their freedom to refer has been used for
the benefit of patients.
Although the practice cannot buy shorter waiting times than non-fundholding
practices, it still has freedom to shop around on behalf of patients for the
best deal for each operation. The practice has also been able to use its
budget to arrange for services previously available only through hospitals,
to be offered to patients at the local health centre.
The picture is reflected in a study carried out for the King's Fund
Institute by Professor Howard Glennerster of the London School of Economics.
It found that fundholding had shifted the balance of power within the NHS
from the consultant to the GP. The conclusion is that fundholding has often
improved the quality of health service for patients.
Such findings had prompted Labour to tone down its opposition to
fundholding. But as the party is pledged to restore GPs' freedom to refer
patients to the hospital of their choice, Mr Cook believes GPs will lose
interest in the additional bureaucracy of fundholding.
The BMA also says many of Britain's family doctors do not want to become
fundholders.
Labour said yesterday that it was looking at ways of giving all GPs a
greater say in NHS planning and in specifying what hospitals should be
providing. But that would not be on the basis of giving them control of
budgets for treating their patients.
Mr Waldegrave also announced that there would be experiments to see whether
non-fundholding GPs could be given more control over operations.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Prestwick bid backed by council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM bidding to buy Prestwick airport in Scotland from BAA, formerly
the British Airports Authority, is to be offered a loan of up to Pounds 1m
on concessionary terms by Strathclyde Regional Council.
The consortium, Ayrshire Community Airport Project (Acap), said it hoped
shortly to reach agreement with BAA.
It said Federal Express, the US cargo airline that uses Prestwick, had an
option to take a stake in Acap and put a nominee on its board.
Two other companies are interested in acquiring Prestwick, which suffered a
drastic fall in passenger traffic after the government removal in March 1990
of its monopoly on transatlantic flights from Scotland. That led several
airlines to transfer operations to Glasgow.
Last week AAP, a company controlled by Mr Peter Kay, a Scotland-based
businessman, submitted a cash offer of Pounds 4.75m to BAA. It said that
last August BAA was prepared to sell it the airport, but negotiations
lapsed.
British Aerospace, which builds aircraft at Prestwick and wants to keep the
runway open, is also talking to BAA.
Acap is chaired by Mr George Younger, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland and
Conservative MP for Ayr, and comprises local businessmen and local
authorities.
On Monday the dominant Labour party group on the regional council agreed
that Acap should be offered Pounds 1m over four to five years at 11 per cent
interest.
A possible outcome, according to backers of Acap, is that BAA would sell
Prestwick to BAe, which would then hand over its operation to Acap. Neither
BAA or BAe will comment on that.
Federal Express would not comment on the claim that it had an option to buy
a stake in Acap. It said it would work with whoever the successful bidder
was.

A CONSORTIUM of ABB Power Plants and Japan's Marubeni Corporation has signed
a letter of intent with the Indonesian Electricity Board to build a Dollars
700m (Pounds 391m) power station at Tanjung Priok, near Jakarta.
The order, for a 1,170MW combined cycle oil/gas fired station, is further
evidence of the importance of the Asian market for western power generating
equipment companies.
ABB's share of the order will be about Dollars 350m. The Swiss-Swedish
engineering group will supply equipment including its latest GT 13 E gas
turbines. By using combined cycle technology, the overall thermal efficiency
of the plant will be 50 per cent.
Manufacturing for the order is likely to be carried out in Switzerland and
Germany. Plant construction is due to start in the spring with completion at
the end of 1994.

FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US criticism baffles backers of patent
rights draft - Intellectual property negotiators say it is as good a deal as
they will ever get / GATT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRITICISM levelled at the Uruguay Round draft accord on intellectual
property by the US pharmaceutical and film industries has left negotiators
in Geneva baffled. The general view is that the US has got as good a deal as
it could have hoped for, far better than it imagined possible when the trade
talks were launched in 1986.
Then, many developing countries were opposed even to discussing intellectual
property protection under Gatt auspices. Over the ensuing five years' talks,
their attitude has changed. The result: a 34-page draft covering all forms
of intellectual property that would strengthen and harmonise protection
standards and allow effective national and international enforcement. Its
main features include:
Protection of patents for 20 years, regardless of place of invention or
whether products are imported or produced locally. Main permitted exclusions
would relate to animal and plant inventions and biotechnological processes
for their production; thus Gatt would not require 'patents on life'. There
would be strict limits on compulsory licensing of patented products by
governments, now commonly used for pharmaceuticals in rich and poor
countries.
Copyright would be protected at least 50 years, to include computer programs
and data compilations; authors of computer programs and films would, broadly
speaking, have exclusive rental rights, as would performers and producers of
sound recordings and broadcasts.
Trademarks would be protected at least seven years, and geographical
indications, important for European wine producers, would also gain
protection. Semiconductor layout designs would be protected for 10 years.
For the first time, trade secrets would be protected from unauthorised
disclosure.
All these rules would have to be implemented in national legislation by
Gatt's 102 members, observing the basic fair trade precepts of national
treatment (equal treatment for domestic and foreign right-holders) and
non-discrimination between trading partners. A council on trade-related
aspects of intellectual property rights (Trips) would supervise operation of
the accord, sitting alongside Gatt and the envisaged General Agreement on
Trade in Services under the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO).
This represents a big concession by developing countries. The Trips council
would be separate from Gatt, but intellectual property disputes would be
subject to the MTO's integrated disputes settlement machinery. In principle,
countries could be subject to 'cross-sanctions', reprisals on goods trade
for breaches of the intellectual property accord - which third world nations
had opposed. On the other hand, the accord would require all signatories to
abide by the MTO's disputes procedures, which would curb recourse by the US
to 'Special 301' provisions to win concessions.
Threats of unilateral action under 'Special 301' have scored successes, most
recently in making China toughen intellectual property protection. The deal
signed by China last week mirrors the international accord in most respects,
but goes further in two areas where US industry now claims the Uruguay Round
draft is deficient.
First, China (which would not be a party to the Trips accord because not a
Gatt member) has agreed to bring in the new rules this year. The poorest
countries, such as Burundi and Bangladesh, have an extra 10 years or more to
implement the accord; most developing countries, such as India and Thailand,
have five, and industrialised nations one. For areas where no patent
protection exists, such as pharmaceuticals, developing countries have 10
years to put legislation into effect.
But for pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals, the accord would require
developing nations to allow the filing of patents from the time the accord
comes into force (probably 1993) and to treat them 10 years hence as if the
legislation had been in effect from the start. Since drugs may require at
least 10 years' safety testing, those invented now would be protected at the
point at which they came on the market. If they reached the market earlier,
the patent-holder would be given interim exclusive marketing rights.
Not satisfied with this, the US pharmaceuticals industry wants protection
for drugs already invented but not yet on the market, the second deficiency
it sees in the draft. China last week agreed to give 'pipeline' protection
back to 1986, but Washington found no backing in Geneva for a similar
multilateral deal.
'We've asked developing countries to accept a 10-year transition for
liberalisation in textiles. It's simply not realistic to ask them to accept
retro-active protection on patents,' one European negotiator said. Another
sore point for the US involves a bilateral dispute with the EC on allocation
to artists and performers of proceeds from a levy on blank audio and video
tapes. It says this system, now in operation in France and Germany, in
effect discriminates against the US film and record industry.
Most other countries believe US industry is deluded if it thinks it can get
a better overall deal through unilateral action than the draft multilateral
accord. India has rebuffed US threats in the past. Washington has not so far
sought to re-open the talks, but trading partners fear it could want to if
the EC presses demands for changes to the Uruguay Round text on farm subsidy
cuts. Then India will almost certainly resist on the textiles accord, and
the unravelling of the Uruguay Round package could begin.

Wheeler group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTS worth Dollars 900m (Pounds 502.7m) to expand a leading oil
refinery in Thailand have been won by Foster Wheeler, the US-controlled
engineering and construction group.
Three Foster Wheeler subsidiaries have been contracted by Esso Standard
Thailand to raise capacity of its Sriracha refinery from 63,000 barrels a
day (b/d) to 145,000 b/d. The expansion will enable the refinery to produce
unleaded petrol and low-sulphur diesel, allowing later expansion to 185,000
b/d.
The contract is one of three won in Asia by Foster Wheeler in 16 months. In
autumn 1990 it signed contracts for a Dollars 1.5bn oil refinery in
Indonesia; in September last year, it was named project manager to expand an
LNG plant in Bintulu, Sarawak, part of a Dollars 2.9bn investment programme
by Petronas, Malaysia's state oil and gas corporation.
The Sriracha expansion project, to be co-ordinated by Foster Wheeler's UK HQ
and a new engineering centre in Thailand, includes building 16 process
units. It is due for completion at the end of 1995, though conversion and
desulphurisation units allowing output of unleaded fuel will be on stream in
1993.
Foster Wheeler has been involved with Esso Thailand since it built the
original Sriracha plant between 1968 and 1971, and the first expansion to
the plant in 1983-85. The three subsidiaries working on the Thai project
will be Foster Wheeler Energy, Foster Wheeler International in Thailand, and
Foster Wheeler (Pacific).

FT  22 JAN 92 / US poised for tussle on economy: Taxes, spending and health
care to dominate Congress session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress reconvenes today, with the House and Senate poised to plunge
into debate on the US economy, the single most important issue in the 1992
election.
Tax relief, economic growth packages, health care and the size of a 'peace
dividend' from defence cuts will dominate the second session of the 102nd
Congress. Legislative business will be put on hold, however, until after
President George Bush's State of the Union address on January 28.
The following day, the Bush administration will provide Congress with its
fiscal 1993 budget (which begins in October). By unveiling these two policy
pronouncements in succession, the White House hopes to gain early public
support for its proposals ahead of the Democratic counter-attack.
One intriguing tactical question is how far Mr Bush is ready to compromise
with the Democratic majority in the House and Senate in order to ensure that
some of his proposals - such as middle class tax relief, a cut in the
capital gains tax, and help for first-time home buyers - pass into law.
In his three years in office, Mr Bush has relied a great deal on his power
of legislative veto to curb the Democratic majority. The exception was the
1990 budget deficit reduction agreement when he agreed reluctantly to a tax
increase.
Reaching agreement on the scope of middle class tax relief - a Democratic
favourite in an election year - will require Mr Bush to compromise.
The main issues this session are:
Budget, taxes and spending: much will depend on the proposed cut in defence
spending. Mr Bush is considering slashing Dollars 50bn over five years
beyond current proposals; Democrats are looking at Dollars 100bn. The 1990
budget agreement seems certain to be modified, even if over all caps on
total spending remain.
Health care: Mr Bush may unveil proposals for tax credits for uninsured
Americans, but sweeping legislation will have to wait until after the
November election.
Defence: The Pentagon wants to preserve personnel, so weapons systems such
as the B-2 Stealth bomber and the Seawolf submarine will be either axed or
drastically scaled back.
Trade: debate on President Bush's trade mission to Japan will dominate early
in the session. More important is whether Mr Bush will have a General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal to submit to Congress by the spring.
Foreign aid: Congress must confront the sensitive issue of the Dollars 10bn
housing loan guarantee request from Israel to help settle Soviet Jews; the

HITACHI, the Japanese consumer electronics group, will move the annual
production of 70,000 projectors for TV sets from its plant in Anaheim,
California, to Tijuana, Mexico, by 1993.
The decision confirms Tijuana's leading position as an electronics assembly
centre, but the move may be seen by opponents of the proposed North American
Free Trade Agreement as evidence that closer economic integration with
Mexico leads to the loss of jobs in the US.
The announcement follows a similar decision last year by Zenith, the US
electronics company, to close its plant at Springfield, Missouri, employing
a workforce of about 1,000, and move it south of the border. Hitachi's
California plant has 250 employees.
Hitachi said it was closing the California plant because of lower wages in
Mexico, which put total production costs in Tijuana at about 15 per cent of
those in Anaheim.
Tijuana is already one of the world's largest centres of TV production, and
includes factories owned by Goldstar, Toshiba, Samsung, Sony, Sanyo and
Matsushita.
Mr Peter Lilley, UK trade and industry secretary, has offered Mexico's oil
sector British 'equipment, contractors and experience in deep waters', and
said he was 'certain' Mexico would reduce curbs on foreign investment in
petrochemicals soon.
Mr Lilley, on a trade mission to Mexico, stopped short of asking for the
changes in Mexico's constitution that would allow the British experience to
be fully taken advantage of.
Mexico was going to enjoy an economic miracle in the 1990s, just as Britain
had in the 1980s, he added.

FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: European yarn output falls 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 13bn-a-year European textile industry slid further into recession
in the third quarter of 1991 and further behind the rest of the world, the
International Textile Manufacturers' Federation (ITMF) said yesterday.
Yarn production fell almost 10 per cent and fabric output 8 per cent from
the previous year.
For the whole world, however, yarn production for the quarter was 1.5 per
cent higher. Asian output rose more than 5 per cent, and changes ranged from
a 24 per cent drop in the UK to a 17 per cent increase in Pakistan.
ITMF figures cover cotton and artificial fibre spinning and weaving. They
exclude other natural fibres, such as wool and silk, as well as clothing
manufacture.
Third-quarter world fabric production was 2 per cent lower than in 1990.
Among the losers, Spain showed a 10 per cent drop, Switzerland 26 per cent,
and Turkey and Britain both 12 per cent.
Pakistan registered an increase of 17 per cent, the ITMF said.

<TEXT>
FRANCE has launched a trade promotion campaign targetted at the Japanese
market, aimed at reducing its growing trade deficit with Japan, Ian Davidson
reports from Paris.
The campaign follows a visit to Japan by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, finance
minister, which is being interpreted in France as a direct riposte to the
trade promotion visit of President Bush. Mr Beregovoy sought from the
Japanese government, and believed he had secured, pledges of no
discrimination in favour of the US at the expense of the Europeans.
Saying he was not in Japan as 'a travelling salesman', Mr Beregovoy stressed
his aim of closer co-operation with Japan, and France's openness to direct
investment.
The French export campaign, spread over three years, aims to improve the
image of French goods, promoting 12 specific sectors, including aeronautics,
food, pharmaceuticals, environment and car components.
France's trade deficit with Japan runs at about FFr30bn (Pounds 3bn) a year.
'This is a difficult market, but not impenetrable,' Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, French foreign trade minister, said yesterday. 'Japanese
imports are growing each year by 20 per cent, and we must get our share'.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Philippines debt deal in shadow of election: Senators' fears
of tax reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE agreement between the Philippines and the International Monetary Fund
reached last week over the level of the 1992 budget deficit is a crucial
step towards containing the country's Dollars 29bn (Pounds 16.2bn) external
debt.
Put a new IMF programme in place, bankers argue, and Dollars 5.3bn of
commercial debt could be restructured in a way that would substantially
reduce the impact of one of the country's most debilitating problems.
But central bank and finance department officials are racing against the
clock to secure Senate approval for tax changes demanded by the IMF before
elections in May.
Without the new tax laws, which are designed to tackle the budget deficit,
the IMF will refuse the Philippines its 'stamp of good house-keeping' and
the rescheduling would be back on ice.
Manila would also then miss out on a year's aid from its largest bilateral
donor, Japan, if the IMF's approval came after Tokyo's current budget cycle
ends. And there would be a freezing on new aid from multilateral donors who
seek comfort from IMF-backed structural adjustment programmes.
The IMF has agreed to allow a national government budget deficit of 9bn
pesos this year and a consolidated public sector deficit (which includes the
losses from 14 government corporations and the central bank) of 37.7bn
pesos, equivalent to 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product. This compares
with an estimated consolidated deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP in 1991 and
5.8 per cent in 1990, according to Mr Jose Cuisia, central bank governor.
Failure to pass the tax measures would be a 'disaster', according to Mr
Ramon Mitra, a leading presidential candidate and speaker of the House of
Representatives which has passed the measures. 'They are not new taxes, they
only enhance government's ability to collect taxes.'
Despite what many economists and businessmen see as the overwhelming case in
favour of the tax measures - most controversial of which is a modification
of VAT - the Senate's approval is still in doubt.
Anything that smacks of tax increases may be seen as political suicide in
the run-up to an election in which many of the senators are standing for
office.
Even with the IMF squared away, bankers will have to move quickly to
implement the commercial debt rescheduling that was agreed in principle last
year before the administration changes at the end of June.
Mr Cuisia and Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, must first seek
about Dollars 600m from the IMF, the World Bank and the Japanese government.
This will be used as collateral for new debt instruments issued in line with
the Brady/Miyazawa plan applied in Venezuela and Mexico.
The debt instruments would reduce interest rates and the stock of debt for
the Philippines; the banks would be able to convert debt into bonds that
provide a better quality of security.
Mr Cuisia expects most banks to opt for the Principle Collateralised
Interest Reduction bonds (PCIR or par bonds) which are secured by
zero-coupon US Treasury bills. The bonds mature in 25 years when the
proceeds will have grown by enough to repay the banks. Manila will pay a
reduced coupon, which rises over time to 6.25 per cent and one year's
interest will be collateral-ised.
A second bond is the simple Interest Reduction Bond. These are not
collateralised, carry an interest charge that starts at 4 per cent and rises
to Libor-plus  13/16 per cent and have a seven-year grace period. They were
designed primarily for Japanese banks which can not easily secure long-term
liabilities with a fixed-rate instrument.
In addition to these two types of so-called 'exit bonds' for creditors that
want to leave the Philippines, new money bonds are available for banks that
want to maintain an exposure in the country.
For every Dollars 1 of new money, a bank is permitted to convert Dollars 4
of outstanding debt into Dollars 4 of debt conversion bonds. The bonds are
priced  13/16 per cent above Libor with a five-year grace period. Venezuela
and Uruguay did a similar deal last year with a swap rate of 5-for-1.
The more banks opt for the PCIR bonds the less the country will have to
worry about its foreign debt as Manila has no principal to repay on these
bonds, bankers say.
Before banks opt for any of these options the central bank will offer them
the opportunity to buy back debt at a discount, similar to a 1990 deal when
Dollars 1.38bn was retired. The central bank expects it will need Dollars
300-Dollars 600m from its foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 4.3bn for
this.
In the event the Senate does not pass the tax measures, scuttling the IMF
deal and all that hangs on it, there could be an immediate loss of
confidence.
Bankers fear renewed pressure on the balance of payments and a reversal of
the recent net flow of dollars back into the country. Furthermore, any
increase in pre-election government spending not matched by higher tax
revenues would add to a domestic borrowing level that is threatening to run
out of control.
'Failure to put the debt deal in place before the elections would not be the
end of the world,' says one Filipino official of a foreign bank. 'But the
new government would start at a much disadvantaged position.'
Imelda Marcos yesterday formally launched her bid for the presidency, saying
she was determined to heal political wounds. The widow of ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos was the first major politician to file candidacy papers for
the May 11 polls.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday tried to calm anger in the US over a
veteran politician's claim that American workers are lazy and illiterate.
It also rebutted US suggestions that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
attempted in a television interview to distance himself from an auto trade
agreement he had made with Mr George Bush during the US president's recent
visit to Japan.
The incidents come at a difficult time in US-Japan relations, with officials
and politicians on both sides of the Pacific considering how to deal with US
demands for cuts in Japan's trade surplus with the US. Mr Bush, who is
campaigning for re-election this year, has been accused of failing to secure
large concessions during his visit and faces mounting political pressure for
tough action against Japan.
The politician who criticised American workers is Mr Yoshio Sakurauchi, the
79-year-old speaker of the lower house of the Diet. He said in a speech on
Sunday in his rural constituency that 'American workers don't work hard
enough, yet they demand high pay'.
According to Japanese newspaper reports, Mr Sakurauchi also described the US
as 'Japan's sub-contractor' and said that 'managers in the US cannot give
written orders because about 30 per cent of American workers are
illiterate'.
Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, said yesterday he disagreed with
Mr Sakurauchi and that Mr Sakurauchi's comments did not reflect the views of
the Japanese people in general. Mr Sakurauchi's post is largely honorary and
he has no role in the government. Mr Sakurauchi himself denied describing
the US as Japan's sub-contractor or referring to American workers as
illiterate. He apologised for making a speech which was 'short of
explanation' and 'liable to cause misunderstanding'.
But by yesterday, the damage had been done. Mr Sakurauchi's original
comments had been widely reported in US newspapers and television. Mr Owen
Bieber, president of the United Auto Workers' Union, condemned Mr
Sakurauchi's criticisms as 'bigoted'.
US tempers were further inflamed by reports of Mr Miyazawa's comments on
plans by Japanese motor companies to increase purchases of US components by
Dollars 10bn a year by 1994 and to 'expand sales opportunities' for US cars.
He said that since Japan was a free market economy the figures should be
seen as 'goals which the companies work towards rather than as firm
promises'.
US officials believe the Japanese car companies' commitments amount to firm
pledges. Mr Michael Farren, US under-secretary of commerce for international
trade, responded with a sharp warning that Japan would face a 'very negative
reaction' should it fail to 'expeditiously move to meet and exceed the
goals' set while Mr Bush was in Tokyo.
Last night Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said she did not
view Mr Miyazawa's remarks as backing off a pledge that Japanese companies
would buy more American car parts. She said: 'the commitment is by the auto
companies on their own. It is not a government-to-government agreement.'

MILITANT workers ended their occupation of South Korea's largest car plant
yesterday after police threatened to storm the Hyundai factory with
helicopters, armoured vehicles and thousands of officers, AP reports from
Ulsan.
The workers took over the plant after it was closed by the company following
a union strike vote. The workers were demanding special bonus payments,
better working conditions and reinstatement of workers dismissed for union
activity.
Early yesterday, helicopters flew over the plant dropping leaflets informing
workers of the dawn evacuation deadline and threatening an assault after
12,000 riot police massed around the factory compound.
Some 3,000 to 4,000 car workers had been reinforcing towering barricades of
trucks, cars dragged off assembly lines, vehicle parts, tyres and hijacked
fire engines.
Clusters of workers pounded the ground with steel pipes, keeping time with
rousing pro-labour songs blasting out across a compound littered with broken
car parts.
South Korea's wages have doubled in four years because of union pressure.
The government has asked companies to keep down pay rises to improve
competitiveness.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UN censures Libya over Lockerbie PanAm bombing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council called unanimously on the Libyan government last
night to answer fully official charges that its agents caused the 1988
Lockerbie air disaster and blew up a French airliner in West Africa.
In its resolution, the council strongly deplored 'the fact that the Libyan
government has not yet responded effectively' to requests for co-operation.
It urged Tripoli to provide a full and effective response 'so as to
contribute to the elimination of international terorrism'.
However, the resolution proposed by Britain, France and the US stopped short
of expressly blaming the Libyan government for destroying PanAmerican flight
103 in December 1988 with the loss of 270 lives and the UTA flight 772 in
Niger nine months later. That crash took 177 lives.
None the less, the UN action was widely interpreted as a warning to Libya
that it must turn over two alleged terrorists named by Britain and the US in
the Lockerbie case or face a threat of economic sanctions.
France has not requested the extradition of Libyans it suspects of causing
the UTA crash.
At the outset of the debate, Mr Jadallah Belgassem, the Libyan minister for
strategic industries, termed 'completely baseless' evidence uncovered by
British investigators. He said Libya's own inquiries had made no progress,
because Britain, the US and France refused to reveal evidence in their
possession.
Libya had already co-operated and was ready to do so 'to the fullest
extent', but in a legal context not the political one imposed by raising the
question improperly in the Security Council. He cited the 1971 Montreal
Convention for the protection of civil aviation and affirmed Libya's
readiness to abide by it.
Mr Belgassem called for neutral arbitration and referral of the case to the
World Court if that failed.
Sir David Hannay, UK delegate and Security Council president, replied that
the convention was 'simply irrelevant' to the issue. Those accused of
bombing the PanAm flight must face and receive a proper trial that, clearly,
should be held in Scotland or the US.
It was not practical for an international tribunal to conduct a trial and
the World Court had no criminal jurisdiction.
Representatives of Sudan and Iraq, which are not Council members, and the
Arab League, supported the idea of arbitration and the delegate of Iran said
Tripoli was not legally bound to turn over the accused Libyans.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Donors meet to co-ordinate aid for CIS republics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MORE than 40 donor governments and international financial institutions meet
in Washington today to co-ordinate their assistance to the fledgling
independent republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
Although formally convened by Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, to
discuss means of making international aid to the former Soviet Union more
effective, the two days of talks are also expected to provide a forum for
wider ranging discussion of how to deal with the underlying economic and
financial crisis afflicting the former Soviet superpower.
Mr Baker will open today's plenary session by welcoming senior government
officials from donor countries and representatives of the IMF, the World
Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other
institutions gearing themselves up to admit the new independent republics
and expand lending and technical assistance.
He said yesterday the conference was meant to send 'a message of hope' to
the former Soviet republics, but US officials played down expectation of
substantial US financial assistance.
Behind the scenes, five specialised working groups will concentrate on
specific aspects of aid. They will cover provision of shelter, ways of
ensuring continuing energy supplies, medical assistance, technical help and
food aid itself.
Most European participants in the conference seem determined to make it a
success, despite their hurt feelings over the way the US convened it.
The European Commission believes that helping the CIS avoid a winter of
chaos and privation is an international task, and that the US has a key role
in widening the aid effort to bring in Middle East, Asian and Latin American
donors.
'We are happy with the conference because there needs to be co-ordination
between actual donors - mainly the EC, the US, Japan - and potential donors,
like the Arab countries,' said a spokesman for Mr Frans Andriessen, EC
external affairs commissioner who leads the EC delegation.
The Commission thus appears to have swallowed its pride and overlooked the
fact that when its president, Mr Jacques Delors, first proposed last
September an international conference on aid to the former Soviet republics
 -admittedly in the narrower context of the Group of Seven industrialised
countries - the US did not respond.
Mr Andriessen is expected this week to propose a follow-up meeting to the
Washington conference, to be hosted by the Commission in Brussels in April.
Some EC member states are, however, still upset about what they see as
Washington's bid to get the political kudos for an aid programme mostly
funded by others. Among these states are Germany, overwhelmingly the largest
donor if all types of aid are considered, and France, which has sent a
junior minister and not its foreign minister, to Washington.
The conference also coincides with renewed transatlantic trade friction over
the Uruguay Round negotiations.
The EC is the largest aid donor to the CIS, providing Ecu47.46bn (Pounds
34bn) out of a worldwide total of Ecu62.4bn. But included in the total are
special payments, such as the Ecu8.35bn Germany is spending to move Russian
troops out of its eastern states by 1994.
On food aid, the EC and the US are not far apart. The US has offered
Ecu2.98bn in agricultural credit, and the EC Ecu1.75bn. The US is giving
Ecu132m worth of food aid grants while the EC budget includes about Ecu450m.
About Ecu200m of the EC aid is being targeted at Moscow and St Petersburg.
Technical assistance for transport, energy and food distribution and storage
is proving slower to deliver. The Community is the biggest donor here,
having pledged Ecu900m in 1991-2. But technical aid from the US will amount
to Ecu388m.

GERMAN banking workers walked out of branches and financial institutions all
over Germany yesterday in support of their claim for a 10.5 per cent pay
increase this year, against an employer offer of 4.5 per cent.
However, retail banking was not noticeably disrupted by yesterday's warning
strikes. Negotiations are due to resume today.
Steel unions and employers, meanwhile, struggled to close the one percentage
point gap between claim and offer in what were described as 'last ditch'
talks to avoid industrial action.
Officials from the steel union said before yesterday's talks, called ahead
of a strike ballot planned for Sunday, that further progress had been made
since last week's failed negotiating round.
At that stage management was offering a package worth 5.2 per cent, while
the union had offered to reduce its official 10.5 per cent demand to just
over 6 per cent.
In other negotiations, a 10 per cent claim from shoe industry workers was
sent to arbitration after talks were formally broken off. Journalists joined
the pay round with a demand for 11 per cent, while coal miners, who are
faced with mass redundancies in the next few years, resumed negotiations on
an unspecific claim 'in line with inflation'.
Despite some harsh words from the union side, and further warnings of the
impact on inflation and the availability of jobs from Mr Theo Waigel,
finance minister, there was no tangible increase in tension.
Unions representing 100,000 chemical industry workers in eastern Germany
yesterday accepted a two-stage pay increase worth 20 per cent, which will
bring wages up to 65 per cent of west German levels.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Battle over Russia's runaway central bank: Why control over
credit may be vital for Yeltsin's survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BITTER subterranean struggle is now convulsing the Russian administration.
It is between the Russian cabinet and the country's central bank, and it is
about control of credit.
The stakes are high: either the government wins control of credit in a
matter of weeks, or it falls, according to Professors Jeffrey Sachs of
Harvard and Anders Aslund of the Stockholm Centre for Soviet and East
European Economies, two foreign advisers to the Russian government.
In their view, the demon is Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the
academic-turned-chairman of the central bank. Mr Matiukhin, on government
estimates, advanced credit mainly to the commercial banks, to the tune of
Rbs600bn last year.
Credit was advanced at an accelerating rate as the year progressed and at an
interest rate of 6 per cent. The credit went to industrial enterprises, and
now keeps them afloat, protecting them from market influences and allowing
them to hoist prices without regard to sales. It allows military-industrial
plants to produce armaments no one wants even when the budget allocation to
defence equipment has been cut to 12 to 15 per cent of last year's level.
Since the main prize the government hopes to achieve in the immediate future
is a cut in the rate of inflation, control of money supply is critical. A
plan last year to bypass the central bank by creating a new Russian state
bank was dropped.
The government has since tried to depose Mr Matiukhin. Last month Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, told the
daily newspaper Izvestia that a new chairman - Mr Boris Feodorov, a senior
executive with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in
London - would soon be taking over from Mr Matiukhin. That has not happened.
Mr Matiukhin survives mainly because he is responsible not to the government
but to parliament. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, or
chairman, is himself the sternest of critics of the government's economic
policies, having called for its dismissal and for Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian president, to distance himself from the government which he heads.
Mr Matiukhin claimed in a recent interview that he now has tight control of
monetary policy, following talks with Mr Gaidar and his colleagues. However,
he has resisted providing information either to the government or to the
International Monetary Fund, from which the government wants to put a strong
team inside the bank to run monetary policy.
But Mr Matiukhin can also claim to have been wronged by the government. When
he was stoking up the fires of credit last year he was quietly encouraged to
do so by a Russian government which wanted to destabilise the central,
Soviet power.
But now that Russia is independent and requires monetary prudence, Mr
Matiukhin is being turned upon and savaged by Mr Yeltsin's government.
Indeed, Mr Yeltsin himself took a sideways swipe at him in his speech to the
Russian parliament last Thursday, when he alleged 'sabotage' of reform by
powerful forces.
The government is preparing new stratagems inside and outside parliament to
deal with Mr Matiukhin.
As Russia's application to join the IMF as a full member is being processed,
there will be more pressure from the world economic community to open the
bank's books and to enforce discipline - otherwise the desperately needed
support for reform, through a stabilisation fund for converting the rouble
and for purchasing imported food, will not be forthcoming.
A showdown is not far off.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY, by far the largest donor and international lender to the former
Soviet Union, is going to the Washington conference determined to spread the
load.
If all sources of aid and credit committed since September 1990 were put
together, EC members would have provided about 75 per cent of the total, and
Germany alone 57 per cent, according to figures from the European
Commission.
That includes food and medical assistance as well as export credits and
credit guarantees, balance of payments support, specific payments to finance
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany, the dismantling of nuclear
missiles and technical assistance.
'Given the importance of the reform process in the Commonwealth of
Independent States for the future of the whole world, the burden must be
fairly borne on all shoulders,' the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
'Failure of the reform process will not only have a negative effect on one
country, or even one group of countries, but on the whole world.'
At the same time, thanks to its aid efforts, Germany has the best experience
of how carefully aid must be targeted within the CIS. The leading
non-governmental aid agencies argue that blanket food aid, and private
programmes of aid parcels, are not what is needed.
'We must have patience and not rush into sending assistance,' says Mr Peter
von Oy, chief executive of the Care agency. 'The European Community kept
saying aid must go at once, at once, at once. I kept saying it is far more
important to ensure it is properly distributed.
'Food is not necessarily what is most needed: medical aid is even more
urgent. But in the medical field we need measures which will last for a few
years: which will mean progress and change.
'It is not just a question of sending medicines which will be accepted
officially, but which are simply unheard of in Russia. They don't know how
to use them.'
Germany is proud of the DM400m (Pounds 140.8m) private aid effort launched
last winter. Yet this showed that initiatives like food aid parcels sent
through the post fail to reach the needy and could create resentment among
recipients.
As a result, groups like the Red Cross and Care have focused on specific aid
programmes or targeted particular areas, like the Chernobyl radiation zone.
The Foreign Ministry, which has co-ordinated the German aid programme, is
also switching its focus from immediate short-term food aid, to medium- and
long-term assistance.

FT  22 JAN 92 / EC carriers condemn postal rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community rules on customs and value added tax give national post
offices a competitive advantage worth more than Pounds 50m a year, private
postal operators said yesterday, writes Roland Rudd.
The Association of European Express Carriers called for an overhaul of the
system, which it claimed was 'unfair and uncompetitive'.
It has compiled a report outlining the difference in treatment of express
mail by private operators and state post offices. A copy has been sent to
the European Commission.
Mr Peter Davies, UK managing director of DHL, the international carrier,
said that private operators were forced to satisfy a number of customs and
VAT regulations which did not apply to post offices.
Private carriers, for example, had to prepare and submit to customs or input
on a computerised system an import customs entry, calculating the amount of
duty and VAT due. The operator is liable to a fine if it miscalculates the
amount.
The assessment for post offices is carried out without charge by customs
officers.
The association's study has been compiled ahead of the Community's green
paper on postal services, due to be published later this month.
A final draft of the green paper shows the Commission favours more
competition but does not advocate changing customs and VAT regulations.
Mr Davies said: 'DHL has never advocated the abolition of postal monopolies.
Our principal concern is that we be allowed to offer in the UK and
throughout Europe our value added services without being at a competitive
disadvantage to any national post office.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S fragmented air traffic control system could start buckling by this
spring, leading to long delays and cancellations, according to Mr Giovanni
Bisignani, managing director of Alitalia, writes David Gardner in Brussels.
Mr Bisignani, who has just taken over as chairman of the Association of
European Airlines (AEA), which groups 23 flag carriers, said the failure to
establish a unified air traffic control system had not been exposed last
year because of the exceptional downturn in traffic, caused by recession and
the Gulf war. Even so, AEA members clocked up 50,000 hours in flight delays
in 1991.
'We cannot go on with 22 different operational systems and 33 different
software systems,' he said. 'We need action and quick. It is not a lack of
physical space; the system is inadequate.'
He called on the European Commission to press for a unified control system
as the precondition for a single market in civil aviation. Brussels' hands
have been tied because air traffic control falls under national jurisdiction
largely for reasons of national security.
Mr Bisignani underlined that fragmentation imposed unacceptable costs -
Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.22bn) a year in Europe - on airlines at a time of
crisis in the industry, whereas the unified US control system dealt with
three times the volume of traffic and cost airlines Dollars 2.5bn.
His remarks came as part of a presentation on the AEA's reservations about
Brussels' 'open skies' policy. 'We need and want a single market. . . but
some things must be changed,' Mr Bisignani said after the presentation to
MEPs and in meetings with the Commission.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Haughey faces fresh row over phone tapping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government was thrown into crisis last night following allegations
by Mr Sean Doherty, a former justice minister, that Prime Minister Charles
Haughey was fully informed of a 1982 phone-tapping affair.
Mr Doherty, who is speaker of the Senate, the upper house, announced that he
would be presenting his resignation today, amid signs that it would be
accepted.
The affair, which involved the tapping of two journalists' telephones in an
effort to trace cabinet leaks, led to the sacking of Mr Doherty. Mr Haughey
said at the time he would not countenance such actions by his justice
minister and that it was an abuse of power.
The fresh charges have been denied by a spokesman for the prime minister,
who claimed they were at variance with the truth.
At a news conference in Dublin last night, Mr Doherty said he had taken the
blame 'to protect Mr Haughey' but he had decided to speak out now as a new
phone-tapping bill was about to be presented to parliament. He said if he
continued to protect Mr Haughey, 'I would have to lie to the Senate. I have
never lied to the Senate and I will not do so now.
'I wish to reiterate this in specific terms,' he added. 'Mr Haughey retained
all but one of the tapes I gave him, and at no stage indicated disapproval
of the action that had been taken.'
Mr Des O'Malley, leader of the Progressive Democrat party, the junior
partner in the coalition government, said last night that Mr Doherty's
claims raised serious concerns as they directly contradicted what Mr Haughey
had said on the incident.
Mr O'Malley said last year that if any further scandals were to shake the
government he would have to reconsider his party's future in the coalition.
The affair is likely to revive the leadership fight within Mr Haughey's
Fianna Fail party. He narrowly survived a vote of no confidence in the
parliament last November following a series of scandals involving state-run
companies.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Crash rekindles Airbus doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Airbus A320's comput-erised controls and the delayed rescue effort were
yesterday at the centre of a controversy surrounding the crash of a French
airliner near Strasbourg on Monday.
The cause of the crash, which killed 87, is still a mystery, though rescue
workers have found the aircraft's two flight recorders, or 'black boxes'.
They were handed to the accident inquiry team, which has been asked by the
French government to produce a preliminary report in a month and a final
public report a few months later.
Mr Paul Quiles, the French transport minister, warned against drawing
premature conclusions about the crash, which occurred when an Air Inter A320
flight from Lyons hit a snowbound mountain ridge in thick fog on its
approach to Strasbourg airport.
One of the nine survivors said the crash happened just after passengers had
been asked to fasten their seatbelts for landing.
'There was no warning, no sign of trouble. We simply broke up in trees,' he
said.
The aircraft appeared to be flying below its normal altitude when it hit the
mountain-side. The pilot gave no warning and the aircraft's emergency radio
beacon did not function. This delayed the search for the wreckage, which
took nearly five hours to find. Survivors said some passengers who were
still alive after the crash later froze to death.
The crash rekindled controversy over the state-of-the-art control system of
the Airbus. Airbus Industrie, the four-nation European consortium which
manufactures the A320, argues that the advanced fly-by-wire avionics make
the aircraft safer. Critics say the controls are too sophisticated.
This is the third crash since the A320 came into service four years ago.
Pilot error was blamed for the previous two accidents.
The main French navigators' union, USPNT, said the crash underlined the need
for a three-man rather than a two-man cockpit crew in the A320. But the main
French pilots' organisation, SNPL, said the pilots of Air Inter, the
domestic carrier owned by Air France, had adapted to A320 technology and 'no
longer had any real problems.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / Plea to help Russia stabilise currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA faces a disastrous wage-price spiral unless the west helps it set up
a stabilisation fund as soon as possible, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the country's
deputy prime minister and finance minister, warns.
In the Financial Times today, Mr Gaidar appeals to finance ministers from
the G7 group of industrial countries 'to give some indication of what might
be available and on what conditions' at their meeting in Long Island at the
weekend.
A Russian stabilisation fund, similar to that provided for Poland to back
the zloty in January 1990, is needed 'to peg the rouble at a reasonable rate
. . . and must be announced as soon as possible', Mr Gaidar says. Unless
people can see that inflation is to be capped, 'wages will increase again
and we shall then be into a disastrous wage-price spiral', he adds.
The government of Russian president Boris Yeltsin 'is pledged to radical
economic reform' and has already put in place many key elements of its
strategy, Mr Gaidar says. These include the freeing of markets for most
goods and services and foreign exchange.
But, Mr Gaidar argues, stabilising prices 'is the most difficult thing'. It
involves balancing the budget, effective limits on lending to enterprises
and stabilisation of the rouble.
This last objective requires foreign exchange, which Russia no longer has.
Thus, he pleads: 'Foreign assistance is urgently required in preparing a
fund to stabilise the rouble.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / Major favours April 9 poll: Prime minister sees Budget tax
cuts as launch pad for election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has told colleagues he wants to call the general election for
April 9 after a tax-cutting Budget early in March.
Senior ministers said last night that the prime minister hoped to use a
planned speech to a conference of Conservative party activists in Torquay on
March 14 to launch the election campaign.
As Mr Major clashed with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, during another
heated Commons exchange over the economy, there was clear evidence the Civil
Service machine was clearing the decks for an early election.
The Conservatives stepped up their attack on Labour's tax and spending
plans, claiming that figures showed the opposition's public spending pledges
would eventually cost Pounds 37bn a year.
The ministers cautioned that an unexpected reversal of Conservative fortunes
in the opinion polls could yet force Mr Major to delay calling the election
until May 7.
He could hold out until late June.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is said to favour May 7 to give more time
for the promised economic recovery to materialise. Mr Chris Patten, the
party chairman, has also suggested that there are advantages in going to the
country on the same day as the local elections.
It is understood, however, that the prime minister's sights are now firmly
set on an earlier poll, with tax reductions in the Budget designed to form a
central plank of the Conservative manifesto. Mr Kenneth Baker, the home
secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, are among cabinet
ministers backing that strategy.
The growing consensus among ministers is that Mr Major can no longer rely on
a consistent run of opinion polls before calling the election nor on
anything more than a promise of economic recovery. In such circumstances,
they see little advantage in delay.
After some wrangling between the Treasury and the prime minister's office,
Mr Lamont will announce the date of the Budget today.
Treasury officials had wanted to delay it until March 17, but the
expectation at Westminster is that Mr Major has insisted on March 10 or,
possibly, March 3.
Either of these two dates would allow time for an April 9 election, though
March 10 would mean an extremely tight schedule.
The atmosphere of electioneering engulfing Whitehall and Westminster was
further reinforced by reports that civil servants have stepped up their
analysis of Labour's policy proposals in case Mr Kinnock becomes prime
minister.
Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, is updating long-standing
guidelines which define the role of civil servants during an election
campaign.
Treasury officials have drawn up a detailed plan to rush through the Commons
a short post-Budget finance bill which would extend the government's powers
to raise taxes into the new financial year.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Maxwell company linked to share deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS have dis-covered that funds paid to the US investment bank
Goldman Sachs to buy shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation came from a
company controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The order to buy the
shares, however, came from Swiss companies said to be unconnected to Mr
Maxwell.
This new evidence has been uncovered by accountants from Arthur Andersen,
which is investigating an alleged illegal attempt to support the MCC share
price.
Arthur Andersen has found a facsimile from Mr Eric Sheinberg, a Goldman
partner, to Dr Werner Rechsteiner, a Zurich-based lawyer, detailing a
transaction in 25m MCC shares.
Goldman acted as broker in the sale for Pounds 56m of 25m MCC shares to two
secretive Swiss companies, Servex and Yakosa, on April 26 1991. Dr
Rechsteiner is a director of Yakosa and is also a director of other Swiss
companies linked to Servex.
The authorisation for the transaction came from Zurich. However, the money
to pay for the shares is understood to have come from Bishopsgate Investment
Trust, an investment company controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell. Investigators
believe that after the purchase, BIT held the shares in trust for the Swiss
vehicles.
If Mr Maxwell funded the transaction, he should under company law have
disclosed his interest in the 25m shares. Arthur Andersen is also concerned
that some of the funds used in the alleged share support operation may have
been channeled from Mr Maxwell's public company, MCC.
It is illegal for a public company to assist in the purchase of its own
shares without obtaining shareholder approval. Investigators will therefore
press Goldman for answers to these questions:
Did Goldman suspect that there were links between Mr Maxwell and the Swiss
companies, Yakosa and Servex?
Did Goldman suspect that BIT provided the funds to settle the transaction?
Did Goldman suspect that the MCC shares might have been subsequently held in
trust by a Maxwell private company?
Goldman refused to comment for fear of breaching client confidentiality
rules. There is evidence that Goldman had been concerned that some of the
investors which bought MCC shares from it in 1991 might be connected to Mr
Maxwell. Goldman obtained oral confirmation from these clients - most of
them introduced to it by Mr Maxwell - that they were not connected to Mr
Maxwell. It subsequently obtained further confirmation in writing from all
but one of the clients.
Dr Rechsteiner has said that Servex and Yakosa held MCC shares at one point,
but has added that he believes they have nothing to hide.
Goldman may have been ignorant that BIT held the MCC shares, since the
shares may have been passed to another temporary holder before reaching BIT.
It is also likely to argue that the source of the funds would have been
known only to its settlements department, which takes no part in the broking
of deals.

As one of the few growth businesses left in the City, derivatives (futures
and options) trading and broking seems to be spawning a host of boutiques to
specialise in explaining this arcane corner of the financial world.
One of these, the 12-month-old Derivative Securities Ltd, whose corporate
logo reads delta sigma lambda, has hired two research experts from a
competitor in order to bolster its private client service.
Ian Rankine, 50, and Martin Price, 41, come from Anglo Pierson Options
(APO), part of the ABN Amro group; APO's move towards an execution-only
service is understood to have left Rankine and Price less than fully
stretched.
DSL was set up by Quentin Burrows, 39, who had headed the traded options
desk at NatWest stockbrokers; Oliver Gillie, 51, who came from the metals
business via a spell running his own estate agency concern; and Patrick
Thompson, 30, who had worked for the London Traded Options Market.
They reckon wealthy private clients are more interested in options and
futures than the exchanges often give them credit for in their marketing
strategies. They also think private clients are given a raw deal by big city
firms; all the DSL team has to do is to show they can make money where their
big competitors cannot.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Miller, a 42-year-old chartered surveyor, has become director of
commercial developments at Grosvenor Developments, a division of Grosvenor
Estate Holdings, one of the largest private estates in the country.
Miller's task is to manage the developments which are already under way and
to seek new opportunities within and outside the estate's holdings. 'In a
recession there are some enormous opportunities . . . my challenge is to
find those for Grosvenor Estate,' he says.
Grosvenor Estate is not immune from the property recession but it is still
prepared to undertake new developments. By contrast, MEPC, Miller's former
employer, is thought unlikely to get involved in any during the current
slump.
Established private companies may offer more opportunities than the quoted
sector at present, in Miller's view. 'A public company always has to keep an
eye on the shareholder issues. You cannot ignore the issues in a responsible
private company, but such companies are able to take a longer view.'
While a director of MEPC, Miller was involved in its Finsbury Circus, St
James's Square and Chilworth developments.

FT  22 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Stockbrokers see blue skies in Hong
Kong - The driving forces behind the colony's equity market gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was hard to find people willing to talk down the Hong Kong stock market
yesterday. After six consecutive days of rises in the Hang Seng index - the
barometer of market sentiment - all brokers could talk about was blue skies,
as far as the eye could see.
And they have a point. The Hang Seng finished yesterday 11.75 higher at
4,522.21 - another all-time peak for the index - and more than 5 per cent
better than the closing level for 1991 just three weeks ago. Property
developers and banks have led the way, but the whole market is on a rising
trend.
Last year, Hong Kong was second only to Mexico among top performers in the
FT-Actuaries World Indices. It put on more than 44 per cent in local
currency terms in 1991, against gains of 27.4 per cent for the US, 15.4 per
cent for the UK and just 0.3 per cent for Japan. In 1990, too, it did well,
rising by 3.9 per cent against a World Index fall of 23.6 per cent.
So what is the driving force in Hong Kong? First, it had a long way to
recover, following the global stock market crash of 1987, and the aftermath
of the Chinese student uprising in 1989. In general, the answer would appear
to be a combination of economics and politics.
At the economic level there are three powerful forces at work: negative real
interest rates in Hong Kong of the order of 8 per cent; the continuing boom
in the southern Chinese economy (industrial production there grew by more
than 20 per cent last year and much of it is owned by Hong Kong companies);
and buoyant economic activity in the colony itself. Real GDP growth in Hong
Kong is expected to top 5 per cent this year.
The last two factors underpin some fairly bullish predictions for corporate
earnings growth in the colony of anywhere from 16 per cent to 20 per cent
depending on whether you are an optimist or a pessimist.
With the market currently trading on an historic price/earnings ratio of
around 12.5, 20 per cent growth in earnings puts it at a prospective p/e of
just over 10 and, at that level, undervalued.
The cost of money in the colony is also cheap and likely to get cheaper in
the short term, as the money markets follow US interest rates lower. In Hong
Kong cheap money has only two places to go: the property market or the stock
market. But, with the government and banks ganging up against property
developers through tighter lending controls on home buyers (a prospective
purchaser now has to stump up 30 per cent of the valuation of the property
to obtain a mortgage) the stock market has been the main beneficiary.
The main political influence upon the market was last week's settlement
between the US and China over America's 'Special 301' claim against the
Chinese for the infringement of intellectual property rights.
Hong Kong had a whiff of the deal in the air all last week - the market
improved 62 points before it became public on Friday - and once it happened,
share prices rose sharply.
Foreign fund managers, who had preferred to wait last week, piled into the
market on Monday and continued their buying spree yesterday when the market
weakened; some local fund managers, heard to mumble 'toppish' after the
market broke through 2,500 on Monday, are sitting back counting profits.
Looking further ahead, US-China trade rows still have the potential to upset
sentiment. President George Bush has to approve China's most favoured nation
status by June and there are further 301 disputes in the pipeline over US
access to China's market.
Inflation in southern China is also seen as a potential problem for Hong
Kong.
If inflation were to get out of control in the south, as it did in 1989, the
Beijing authorities - who favour the sledgehammer approach to economic fine
tuning - will seek to dampen economic expansion. That would hurt growth
prospects for the colony.
So, where will the equity market go from here? 'We are entering volatile
times,' says Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie.
'But the market has got a head of steam up and is still trying to go
higher.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls for the
fourth consecutive day
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices fell on light selling, and the Nikkei average closed lower for
the fourth consecutive trading day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei, which closed below 21,000 for the first time in 15 months on
Monday, lost a further 55.52 to 20,858.30. The index rallied during the
morning session, setting a day's high of 21,241.31, but later retreated to
the day's low of 20,638.04 in the afternoon.
Volume remained thin, totalling 230m shares, as institutional investors
stayed on the sidelines. Declines led advances by 607 to 358, with 178
issues unchanged. An estimated 211 stocks fell to their lowest levels since
the beginning of 1991. The Topix index of all first section issues shed 5.48
to 1,569.43, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 6.25 to
1,214.26.
The Nikkei average gained momentum in the morning on hopes that the Big Four
brokerages - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - would announce a support
plan for the market.
However, a fall in futures prices triggered arbitrage-related unwinding, and
disappointment that no concrete measures were announced by the brokerages
sent the index lower.
Comments by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, disconcerted some market
participants. While Mr Hata expressed concern over the sluggish state of the
stock market, he pointed out that the Japanese economy had underlying
strength, and added that if economic fundamentals were assessed correctly,
stock prices should go up.
Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities said the market lacked energy, and
would move sideways in the near term. 'The index could briefly fall below
20,000,' he added.
Some high-technology issues rose on bargain hunting by foreign investors.
Hitachi put on Y16 to Y920 and Toshiba Y16 to Y640. Foreign investors were
sellers of Mitsubishi Estate, which weakened Y60 to Y1,160.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries fell Y14 to Y640 on small-lot selling.
Projections of favourable earnings for the current year had prompted buying
late last year, and foreigners were seen supporting the issue yesterday. But
domestic investors, discouraged by the recent decline in the share price,
were seen liquidating their holdings.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 78.93 down at 22,194.93 in volume of 130.6m
shares. Selling by individuals to meet margin calls depressed the index.
Business centred on large-lot cross trading by financial institutions. Osaka
Gas, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y10 to Y539.
Roundup
TOKYO'S weakness continued to weigh on markets in the Pacific Rim.
AUSTRALIA fell 1.3 per cent on comments by Mr Paul Keating, the country's
treasurer, that there would be no further easing of interest rates for the
moment. The All Ordinaries index finished 21.9 lower at 1,646.6. Turnover
increased to ADollars 243m from ADollars 183m.
Leading shares were worst hit, with market leader BHP receding 20 cents to
ADollars 13.88. CRA lost 12 cents to ADollars 12.78. Adelaide Brighton
relieved the gloomy picture, rising 9 cents to ADollars 1.90 amid rumours
that Pioneer International will launch a takeover bid. Pioneer was down 4
cents at ADollars 3.08.
NEW ZEALAND followed Australia lower. Weakness in Fletcher Challenge, which
closed 8 cents down at NZDollars 3.43 on volume of 1.4m shares, weighed on
the market. The NZSE-40 index slipped 10.61 to 1,484.43 in turnover of
NZDollars 23.5m, against NZDollars 13.9m on Monday.
Robt Jones Investments was the most heavily traded issue with 3.7m shares
changing hands amid continued heavy selling from Wellington broker Doyle
Paterson Brown. The stock, however, ended steady at 30 cents.
MANILA finished mixed in moderate trading. The composite index eased 2.0 to
1,301.0 as turnover rose to 163m pesos from 140m.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone fell 25 pesos to 975 pesos, following its
overnight decline in New York of Dollars 1.12 to Dollars 37.5. Meralco 'B'
advanced 12 pesos to 160 pesos.
BANGKOK lost ground as investors began taking profits, boosting turnover to
a record. The SET index ended 3.81 off at 776.01 in turnover of Bt12.5bn,
breaking last Friday's record of Bt12.34bn.
SINGAPORE turned higher as dealers reported institutional interest coming
from the UK through Hong Kong, and some from Japan. The Straits Times
Industrial index added 10.46 at 1,535.85 but turnover eased to SDollars 164m
from SDollars 177.3m.
KUALA LUMPUR was in easier vein as profit-taking set in after the recent
series of gains. The composite index slipped back 1.66 to 570.57.
Gaming and resorts issues strengthened after company officials denied
reports of an increase in the gaming tax. Resorts World rose 25 cents to
MDollars 10.10 while Genting gained 40 cents to MDollars 12.10.
SEOUL's composite index weakened 3.87 to 630.00. Turnover was active at
Won416.4bn, up from Won397.7bn.
The decline was mainly due to a fall in financial and large manufacturing
shares, which represent the heaviest portion of the index.
TAIWAN continued to rise, the weighted index adding 32.71 at 5,135.35 in
turnover of TDollars 62.84bn, after TDollars 53.36bn, the highest since May
1991.
BOMBAY registered an all-time high of 2,157.87 before retreating on heavy
selling by state-owned investment institutions. The BSE index closed at
2,115.71, up a net 8.64.
KARACHI fell for the fifth straight session because of political unrest in
the southern province of Sind. The 100-share index lost 47.94 to 1,572.80.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash shortage holds up Ivorian
coffee deliveries
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE START of the Ivory Coast's 1991-92 coffee season is being delayed while
the commodities marketing board, the Caisse de Stabilisation, tries to find
cash to subsidise the crop, trades said, reports Reuter from Abidjan.
The government has not yet announced the start of the buying season -
normally December - although farmers say they have finished most of their
picking and are having to store the berries themselves.
'Everyone's ready for the coffee, but the banks are refusing to start until
they're sure they'll get money from the caisse,' one up-country buyer said.
The Ivory Coast, Africa's biggest coffee grower, produced between 250,000
and 270,000 tonnes in 1990-91, according to trade and government sources.
Low world coffee prices mean the Caistab must subsidise this year's crop by
some CFA Fr23bn (Pounds 47m) after keeping prices to farmers at an
artificially high CFA Fr100 a kilogram to support production.
But farmers say they cannot make ends meet even at this price. They have cut
back on hired labour and farm chemicals, leaving more and more coffee
unpicked and lowering Ivory Coast's total output.
Traders said some Fr12bn to Fr13bn francs of the coffee subsidy was already
accounted for, to be recouped from levies on exports of the profitable cocoa
crop. Exporters had to pay the Caistab an explicit coffee subsidy of 17 CFA
francs on each kilogram of cocoa this year, they said.
'The caisse has to prove it can find the Fr10bn difference,' one Abidjan
trader said, adding: 'The banks are refusing to finance and, until the banks
finance, there will be no buying.'
Banks and shippers have been hit badly in the past by huge Caistab debts.
According to the traders the Caistab's partial subsidy of coffee through
cocoa shippers went against pressure from the World Bank, which is
overseeing liberalisation of Ivory Coast's commodity marketing system.
'The World Bank said Ivory Coast should finance coffee itself,' one said.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Klondikers' depress fish
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACTORY SHIPS from the former Soviet Union are being accused by Scottish
fishermen of depressing the markets for pelagic fish such as herring and
mackerel in the North Sea by selling fish at below market prices to obtain
foreign currency.
The factory ships, known as klondikers because of the cash which they
normally pay out for fish to Western European fishermen, are having to sell
off part of their cargoes of herring and mackerel to buy fuel and provisions
in North Sea ports.
Following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the introduction of a market
economy, the factory ships, although setting off from home with enough
foreign currency to buy fish, are having to fend for themselves in meeting
other needs.
Mr Jim Slater, chairman of the Scottish Pelagic Fishermens Association, says
that the problem is emerging in Germany, the main market for pelagic fish
(which are free-swimming as opposed to bottom-feeding).
'It is not yet happening on a massive scale but the consequences for our
industry could be frightening,' he says.
Scottish fishermen alone sold about 150,000 tonnes of pelagic fish to Soviet
and other eastern European factory ships in 1990. About 40 klondikers were
in Scottish waters before last Christmas and about 25 are there now, he
said.
'The Russian people are not getting all the fish they need and our market is
being depressed,' he said.
Mr Slater wants fish supplies to be included in the European Community's
programme of food aid to the former Soviet Union or to be covered by export
guarantees.
If fish were part of the food aid programme the agents who handle fish sales
would be able to accept roubles with the certainty of being paid back and
the factory ships would need less foreign currency. At present the agents
refuse to accept roubles.
Scottish fishermen claim that one ex-Soviet ship at present in Denmark is in
the process of selling off its entire cargo of 2,000 tonnes of frozen fish.

Nickel rallied from earlier lows on the LME yesterday. Cash prices closed
ahead, while three-month metal ended Dollars 65 down at Dollars 7,747.50 a
tonne. Dealers said the lower trend reflected a technical downside
correction to an overbought market. News that LME warehouse stocks rose by
432 tonnes to 15,252 tonnes, the highest since September 1984, and
expectations that ample Russian metal is being stored off-warrant in Europe,
indicate that little has changed in fundamentals. LME copper stocks fell
sharply because of Chinese shipments. Expectations of further short-term
inventory declines helped to cushion the pressure on the market, which has
also been overbought, dealers said. Dollar prices closed little changed.
Lead prices generally remained under pressure from the effect of the
presence of trade selling orders overhanging the market on any move towards
Dollars 530 a tonne for three-month metal. London cocoa prices retreated in
thin trade, mostly on currency factors, dealers said. Stronger sterling
against the dollar, coupled with trade selling, put the market under
pressure, despite talk that Ivorian arrivals were between 23,000 and 28,000
tonnes this week and starting to taper off as expected.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian smelting target 'out of
reach' - A look at an overstretched aluminium industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA AIMS to export 1m tonnes of aluminium this year, the same amount as
in 1991, when the sudden flood of Soviet metal created turmoil in the
western industry, caused it to make extensive production cuts and sent
prices spiralling down to their lowest-ever level in real terms.
But the newly-independent republic has virtually no hope of achieving that
ambitious target, says Mr Karl Wobbe, who has just returned after leading
the first western delegation to the Russian aluminium industry this year.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, worried about his collapsing economy,
has decreed that aluminium smelters in the first quarter of 1992 must supply
domestic fabricators with at least 70 per cent of the tonnage supplied in
the same months last year.
Mr Wobbe suggests, however, that there is little chance of smelter managers
obeying this instruction.
The Russians also recognise that most of their aluminium smelters are big
polluters and fall far short of acceptable standards. Two have closed but
there are no indications that any more are in line for imminent closure.
In all areas Russia's political objectives for its aluminium industry are
being undermined by what Mr Wobbe calls 'the human factor'.
Smelter managers can hardly enjoy their new-found freedom of action when
they cannot provide enough food for hungry workers and their families (most
smelters are supposed to be self-sufficient and provide cradle-to-grave
facilities for the workforce.)
In one extreme case, a smelter is swapping products with a northern Italian
food producer - bartering 1 kg of aluminium for 1 kg of powdered milk.
Care of the environment must also take second place in these dire
circumstances. Smelters at Krasnoyarsk, which produced 800,000 tonnes of
aluminium a year, and at Bratsk, 1m tonnes a year, have been closed because
each emitted 6,000 tonnes of fluorine, about 20 times the level permitted
even by Soviet standards. 'But if people are hungry, smelters will continue
to produce, even if it has to be at a reduced rate,' Mr Wobbe points out.
Smelters are also extremely short of spare parts. So aluminium is being
bartered for spares.
Mr Wobbe, who is on the management board of VAW of Germany and is
responsible for the group's aluminium production, says Moscow officials want
to reduce the number of barter deals because they cut foreign currency
imports.
For, like the smelter managers, Russia itself is fighting for survival and
gives top priority to its desperate quest for foreign currencies to pay for
its debts.
The Russian aluminium industry's senior management seems well aware of the
problems Soviet exports caused last year. They confirm that 1m tonnes of the
metal was exported, three times the net exports of about 300,000 tonnes in
1990. This helped to push aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange down
to about 50 cents a lb - at which level 75 per cent of western world
smelters are operating at or below their cash costs.
'The Russians are not happy about the price on the LME and asked what they
could do. But they need foreign currencies so they have set themselves the
political objective of exporting another 1m tonnes this year,' says Mr
Wobbe.
His team found that most of the former Soviet Union's aluminium production
had been taken over by Concernalumini (Aluminium Company), set up recently
in the Russian Republic. At first it was to be called the Aluminium Company
of Russia but some of the assets are outside the republic: there are a
smelter and alumina plants in Tadzhikistan while the biggest aluminium
converting operations are in Samara near Tubichev and at Uralski Kamensk.
Mr Igor Vladimirovits Prokopof, a former minister of non-ferrous metals and
chairman of Sovalum, the Soviet aluminium organisation, heads Concernalumini
with another former prominent figure from Sovalum, Mr Vladimir Kaltschenko
as his second-in-command. 'The same people are managing the industry but I
feel there is not the same power at the centre. Directors of individual
plants have much more freedom of decision,' says Mr Wobbe.
At the time of his previous visit, in May last year, smelters were charging
converters 4,000 roubles a tonne for aluminium. Smelters are charging 30,000
roubles a tonne in the first quarter this year which, at the official rate
of exchange, is about Dollars 300 a tonne. Apart from inflationary pressures
(Mr Wobbe estimates inflation is 2 to 3 per cent a week at present) smelters
also face substantially increased costs. Imports of alumina, the essential
raw material for aluminium production, are costing Dollars 180 to Dollars
200 a tonne. 'I did not feel prices are covering costs, particularly of
alumina, both domestically-produced and imported alumina,' says Mr Wobbe.
Shortages abound - and not just of spare parts for obsolete and worn-out
equipment. Russia's alumina industry is short of caustic soda, a vital raw
material, and is having difficulty paying for bauxite imports, the ore from
which alumina is made. There are shortages of coal products such as coke,
coal tar and coal pitch.
At one aluminium plant he visited, at Tadshic, Mr Wobbe found only one
production line was working, reducing the annual rate of output from 500,000
to 200,000 tonnes. 'My personal impression from plant visits is that
Russia's aluminium production will go down by 20 per cent this year,' he
says.
Russia's annual aluminium production capacity is between 3.5m and 3.6m
tonnes. VAW estimates that from this the former Soviet Union produced about
3.2m tonnes last year. 'We expect this to be down to 2.5m to 2.8m tonnes
this year.'
Transporting raw materials and finished metal is also difficult in Russia.
Transport problems seem particularly acute at the moment because some ports
are clogged with large grain shipments with which their bureaucratic
administrative systems simply cannot cope.
'So,' says Mr Wobbe, 'although in theory 1m tonnes of aluminium exports
could be realised, we have considerable doubts that it will.'
Nevertheless, even a reduced rate of Russian aluminium exports seem likely
to force the closure of more capacity in the west, particularly in Europe.
Mr Wobbe points out: 'It is likely that Europe will close modernised and
environmentally-friendly smelters to permit polluting and unprofitable
smelters in Russia to continue.'
The European Aluminium Association and some governments are attempting to
find a formula to prevent this happening - but not simply by putting up
barriers against the Russian industry.
The European Aluminium Association's search for a compromise solution will
be the subject of a second article on Friday.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: New guidelines aim to enhance
use of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOMMENDATIONS for the reporting of financial futures and options in
investment portfolios, published yesterday, will provide UK pension fund
managers with professionally-agreed standards of performance measurement of
derivatives for the first time.
The standards, designed to suit the needs of pension fund trustees, should
encourage greater use of derivative products by UK pension fund managers.
Since the tax treatment of derivatives was clarified in the 1990 finance
act, the main barrier to the use of derivatives by pension funds has been a
negative perception of these instruments as speculative, particularly by
trustees.
The new guidelines will allow trustees to assess more easily whether fund
managers are using futures and options for investment or hedging purposes,
or whether they are taking more speculative positions.
'I am confident that these recommendations will greatly enhance
institutional investors' use of derivatives, particularly equity products
such as the FT-SE 100 index futures and options,' said Mr Michael Jenkins,
chief executive of the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
Based on a consultative document issued by Liffe and the London Traded
Options Market in May 1990, the recommendations were reached after
consultation with trustees, investment managers and performance measurers,
and are endorsed by the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF).
The recommendations will be followed by the UK's two largest independent
performance measurement organisations, Combined Actuarial Performance
Services (CAPS) and the World Markets Company (WM).
'(These recommendations) will lead to a better understanding of the uses of
these instruments, higher standards of reporting and more consistent
performance calculations,' said Mr Tim Gardener, head of planning services
at Mercer Fraser, the actuarial consultancy firm commissioned to write the
report.
In the past, pension funds have tended to report futures and options as a
separate asset class. While this system is relevant for certain types of
funds, such as futures funds, the overall picture can easily be distorted
since derivatives are frequently used as part of a broader investment
strategy. In addition, such an approach ignores the gearing inherent in
derivative instruments.
Futures are typically used by fund managers to increase or decrease exposure
to underlying assets.
Increasing exposure. If a fund manager buys futures on the FT-SE 100 stock
index and holds a cash deposit, he is creating a synthetic equity asset. It
is usually cheaper and quicker to gain exposure to the market by this method
than by buying a portfolio of stocks in the cash market.
Decreasing exposure. If a fund manager buys equities in the cash market and
sells the future, he is hedging against a fall in the stock market, (since
the futures position will gain if the market falls). Thus, under the
recommendations, positions in the futures market - and relevant cash
deposits held against futures positions - are incorporated into, in this
case, equity assets.
Options, on the other hand, are generally used to modify exposure. The
effect of options on portfolio performance is asymmetrical - for example, a
fund manager can by a put option on a stock to protect against potential
losses in the stock, without losing any potential gains.
The report recommends reporting options at their market value, under the
relevant asset class. Given the complexity of option products, a written
explanation of strategies (for example that puts have been purchased as
insurance against downward risk) is recommended.
In addition, when there is a substantial position in options, there needs to
be an analysis of exposure to market movements. Because of the asymmetrical
movement of options, the price does not indicate how the option would react
to changes in the underlying market. Consequently, the recommendations
suggest showing how the portfolio would react to, for example, a 50 per cent
rise or fall in the market.
The method is suitable for pension fund reporting, because trustees are
generally not interested in short-term fluctuations in the fund's value, but
in the general thrust of the investment strategy.
Other investment institutions may need a different approach, including Delta
analysis - a mathematical calculation of the sensitivity of positions to
market movements.
The pressure to conform to the recommendations is likely to be quite strong,
even though there are no formal rules. 'We will ask (the pension funds) to
provide data to us so we can report in line with the recommendations,' said
Mr Alan Wilcock of CAPS.
The recommendations encompass derivative products sold by banks, known as
over-the-counter products, such as swaps and OTC options, and
exchange-traded contracts. While they help clarify the reporting of
derivative products, the fund management industry has some way to go in
setting other important performance measurement goals.
The next issue which the industry is preparing to address is risk-adjusted
performance measurement, since there is as yet no standardised way of
assessing the returns offered by funds in conjunction with the level of
exposure. Although other issues, such as credit, will need to be assessed in
that debate, the ground rules on futures and options will be a useful step
forward in that process.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Raised voices on the
Frankfurt exchange - Plans to run the open-outcry system and electronic
trading in tandem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the largest in Germany, has decided it will
not immediately abolish floor trading in Germany's most liquid stocks when
it moves to a computerised trading - at an as yet indefinite date in the
mid-1990s. Instead, the existing open-outcry system will be able to continue
in tandem with the new electronic system.
This decision, taken at a meeting of the board of the exchange earlier this
week, goes against one of the main recommendations of an unpublished report
into electronic trading, prepared for the exchange by the McKinsey
consulting firm. Despite the decision not to follow McKinsey's advice on
this point, the implications for the German securities market, and those who
prosper under present arrangements, are profound.
At present, approximately 80 per cent of domestic business in the shares in
the Dax 30 index is handled by Freie Makler - official brokers who derive
commission, or courtage - from matching bargains on the open outcry Amtliche
Handel - official market - which is open from 10.30am to 1.30pm on weekdays.
Commission currently stands at 0.06 per cent of transaction value.
The remaining 20 per cent of DAX 30 business is handled on Ibis, an
electronic system which started in December 1989 as an information exchange,
but in April last year was upgraded to handle trading in DAX 30 shares and
some leading bond issues.
While Ibis has increasingly gained acceptance among financial institutions
executing business in Germany, it is seen by the Frankfurt exchange as
limited in terms of the restricted number of securities which can be traded,
and its user base. Hence the determination to entertain a move to a fully
electronic market.
McKinsey will present an updated draft of its report to the exchange in
March. The following month, the exchange will take a final decision on how
to proceed.
According to the draft report, the new system will be organised on the
auction principle - with buy and sell orders collected together and prices
fixed at intervals. This is in contrast to the London Stock Exchange's
price-driven system Seaq (Stock Exchange Automated Quotation). The plan is
to start with the top 30 shares and the top 30 bond issues at some stage in
the next two years, before moving on to handle all 650 stocks and 15,000
bond issues.
Prices for the most highly-traded shares will be set as often as every
minute; for the two less liquid tiers, prices will be fixed once or twice a
day. include the Deutsche TerminBorse - Germany's electronic futures and
options market which opened in January 1990 - and the systems used by the
Stockholm and Vancouver exchanges.
The Frankfurt exchange claims the three main benefits of a move to full
electronic trading are lower transaction costs, greater transparency of the
market and greater liquidity. These aims accord well with the statements of
principle advanced last week by Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister,
and Chancellor Kohl when he visited Frankfurt on Monday. The politicians are
keen to strengthen Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre -
and full electronic trading is deemed by Frankfurt to be a step in this
direction.
The Maklers - who number around 400, including those who make prices on the
secondary Geregelter Markt for less liquid stocks - protested loudly last
week when the first hints of the McKinsey proposals appeared in the local
press.
They have won a victory of sorts in that their role is not going to
abolished overnight, as McKinsey proposed. But in the long term they will
have to prove themselves highly adaptable when competing with the electronic
system - or they will disappear altogether.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Asfinag issue considered tightly priced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the deluge of new dollar bonds in recent weeks, the Eurobond market
yesterday was ill-prepared for more. The result was a poor showing for a
Dollars 200m 10-year issue for Asfinag, the Austrian road financing agency,
brought by Merrill Lynch.
At a yield of 30 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury bond, the pricing
was widely considered too tight for the market conditions. A further 3 to 5
basis points on the spread was generally considered necessary to shift the
paper. But that did not stop a range of leading underwriters from joining
the deal. The deal was priced with an eye on the 30 basis point spread in
current trading of last week's well-received 12-year deal for the Republic
of Austria, which had been scaled up from Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m.
The shorter maturity of the Asfinag issue, together with the backing of a
Republic of Austria guarantee, help explain yesterday's pricing. But the
market had no appetite for any more dollar paper.
By contrast, the Kingdom of Norway's appearance with a Y100bn five-year
issue left investors asking for more. The prospect of a large, liquid issue
from a highly-regarded name found demand particularly in Europe and the Far
East.
The 5.48 per cent yield - 18 basis points over the World Bank's five-year
issue - was seen as fair, and in later trading the bonds were being bid at
their reoffered price of 99.55.
Commerzbank brought an aggressively-priced DM500m 10-year issue for the
Kingdom of Belgium. The issue, with a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent was said to
be slow getting underway. Demand is expected from retail investors on the
continent.
British Land, the UK property developer, launched an offer through Warburg
Soditic to buy back SFr25m of its outstanding SFr75m 6 1/2 per cent bonds
due 1994 at 87.5 per cent.
Credit Foncier de France may issue French franc bonds in the Euromarket this
week, finance director Mr Olivier Hassler said, Reuter reports. The mortgage
lender had meant to issue domestic bonds with a special tranche set aside
for foreign investors. But, under French rules, such a tranche must be
fungible with an outstanding bond - and a legal snag has put all fungible
issues on ice.

THE African National Congress (ANC) has attacked European banks for
arranging a significant new loan to South Africa, repeating warnings that a
future government could review inherited debt dues, Reuter reports.
It called the five-year Ecu250m Eurobond unveiled on Monday a gross
violation of anti-apartheid sanctions.
'The ANC must once again remind foreign banks and investors of the
continuing validity of the economic, and in particular financial, sanctions,
against South Africa,' it said.
'We are bound to declare, once again, that a democratic government will
carefully assess its obligations to service and take responsibility for
debts contracted by the South African government and its various agencies
prior to the formation of an interim government and the formal request for
the lifting of economic sanctions by such a government.'
The latest loan was lead managed by France's Banque Paribas and co-managed
by Swiss Bank Corporation.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Securities house posts record
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, joined the Wall Street profits
bandwagon yesterday when it reported record fourth-quarter net earnings of
Dollars 46.9m.
The result was a big improvement on the Dollars 92.3m loss incurred at the
same stage a year ago, when the firm took a big restructuring charge.
In common with other US brokers, PaineWebber has benefited from falling
domestic interest rates, buoyant stock and bond markets and heavy demand for
equities from individual and institutional investors.
The strong final quarter took 1991 after-tax earnings to Dollars 150.7m, the
highest in PaineWebber's history and well above the Dollars 38.1m
after-charge operating profit earned in 1990.
Earnings rose sharply across all leading business divisions in the last
quarter. Revenues from commissions were up 27 per cent at Dollars 190m, from
principal transactions up 65 per cent at Dollars 171.9m, from investment
banking up 88 per cent at Dollars 98.2m - due partly to a big rise in new
securities issues - and from asset management up 28 per cent to Dollars
58.5m.
PaineWebber's strategy of concentrating on building up its fee-based
revenues as a protection against the volatility of earnings from
market-related businesses continued to pay off.
During 1991 the firm attracted Dollars 1bn of new assets every month from
individual investors, and by the end of the year a total of Dollars 93bn in
customer assets was under PaineWebber's control.
Cost-containment measures contributed to improved profit margins, and the
move of the firm's back office operations and its financial management
division from Manhattan to New Jersey, which was completed last year, helped
to reduce fixed overheads.
Overall, in the last quarter operating expenses of Dollars 513.1m were up on
a year ago because of a sharp rise in performance-related compensation
payouts.

FT  22 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Jersey company must pay liquidator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RE SHOE LACE LTD Chancery Division: Mr Justice Hoffmann: December 20 1992
A DEBENTURE creating an all-monies floating charge, executed by a company
two months before presentation of an insolvency petition in consideration of
advances already made to it by its parent in anticipation of the debenture,
is invalid in that the charge was not created before or 'at the same time
as' the payments were made, having regard to the ordinary meaning of those
words in a commercial and regulatory context.
Mr Justice Hoffmann so held when granting an application under RSC Order 29
rule 10 by Mr Dermot Justin Power, liquidator of Shoe Lace Ltd, for an
interim payment in respect of his claim for return of company funds paid to
the first respondent, Sharp Investments Ltd, a company allegedly controlled
by the second respondent, Mr Chandru Mahtani.
Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides: '(2) . . . a floating
charge on the company's undertaking or property created at the relevant time
is invalid except to the extent of . . . (a) the value . . . of the
consideration for the creation of the charge . . . paid . . . to the company
at the same time as, or after the creation of the charge . . .
(3) . . . the time . . . is a relevant time . . . if the charge is created -
(a) . . . in favour of a person who is connected with the company . . .
within . . . two years ending with the onset of insolvency . . .'
HIS LORDSHIP said Sharp was a Jersey company which held 80 per cent of Shoe
Lace's issued share capital. Mr Mahtani was a business man who lived in
Ratigen in Germany. He was alleged to control Sharp through a Jersey trust,
and to have acted as a shadow director of Shoe Lace.
Shoe Lace operated a number of shops in Lancashire and Yorkshire which sold
cheap footwear.
The original directors were Mr Sam Nolan, a Jersey accountant who was also a
director of Sharp, and Mr Barry Fox who was alloted 20 per cent of the share
capital.
A copy of an accountant's report commissioned by Mr Nolan in August 1990
showed that Shoe Lace was hopelessly insolvent in April 1990 and that its
position became steadily worse.
Minutes of directors' meetings showed that in February 1990 Shoe Lace had
exhausted its banking facilities and decided to apply to its parent company,
Sharp, for support.
On March 20 the directors resolved to grant Sharp a debenture to secure past
and future advances, in consideration of further short-term finance.
According to the evidence of Sharp's solicitor, it advanced Pounds 300,000
to Shoe Lace on April 3, Pounds 50,000 in May, Pounds 75,000 in June, and a
final payment of Pounds 11,500 on July 16.
The debenture was not executed until July 24.
It created a charge to secure the payment of 'all monies . . . hereby
covenanted to be paid'. The document contained no covenant to pay anything,
but the registered particulars described it as an all-monies charge and the
court would assume that it could be rectified to correspond with that
description.
There was a fixed charge over immoveable assets and goodwill, and a floating
charge over the whole of the assets and undertaking.
A petition for compulsory winding-up was presented on September 4 and served
at the trading address the same day. It was served at the registered office
on September 11.
On September 13 Shoe Lace entered into a sale of business agreement by which
it sold all its assets to a company called Shoe Hut Ltd, another Channel
Island company, for Pounds 211,000.
By direction of Shoe Lace, Pounds 180,710 of the purchase price was paid by
Shoe Hut direct to Sharp as debenture-holder. The rest was retained against
the outcome of a claim of retained title to stock made by a supplier.
Shoe Lace was compulsorily wound up on November 20. The Pounds 180,710 was
frozen in Sharp's bank account by court order on February 15 1991.
The liquidator said Sharp was not entitled to that money. He said that
Sharp, Shoe Lace and Shoe Hut were all controlled by Mr Mahtani.
There was a high probability that Shoe Hut was a phoenix company, but the
present court did not need to decide the question, because the principal
ground on which the liquidator founded his application was that the floating
charge created by the debenture was invalidated by section 245 of the
Insolvency Act 1986.
Section 245 provided that a floating charge created within two years before
the onset of insolvency in favour of a person connected with the company,
was invalid, except to the extent of consideration paid for creation of the
charge 'at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge'.
By subsection (5) the onset of insolvency was the date of presentation of
the petition.
The floating charge was created within two months before the onset of
insolvency. Also, Sharp controlled Shoe Lace and so was a connected person.
The charge was therefore void except to the extent that Sharp paid money to
Shoe Lace 'at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge'.
There was no authority on the meaning of 'at the same time as' in section
245.
The degree of contemporaneity which such words connoted must depend on the
context.
It might not be unreasonable to say that two species of dinosaur became
extinct 'at the same time' when millions of years separated their last known
representatives. On the other hand, one would not say the winner of a race
crossed the tape at the same time as the runner-up, though separated by less
than a tenth of second.
In section 245 the context was commercial and regulatory.
For example, it formed part of a scheme which included the requirement that
particulars of a floating charge must be delivered to the Registrar of
Companies within 21 days of its creation.
The question was whether a businessman having knowledge of the kind of time
limits imposed by the Insolvency and Companies Acts, and using ordinary
language, would say that the payments had been made at the same time as
execution of the debenture.
No businessman would use such language of the payments made in the present
case.
He would say that the parties had agreed in March that a debenture should be
granted, that a number of payments were made in consideration of that
promise, but that they did not get around to executing the debenture until
afterwards.
The respondents' solicitor said it was not executed because Mr Nolan was
dilatory. He thought that as Shoe Lace had agreed to grant the debenture
there was no urgency about execution.
The court was referred to authorities on earlier sections invalidating
floating charges, which resembled section 245. None was binding because the
language of the current section was different.
No principle was derived from them for present purposes except that stated
by the Court of Appeal in Columbian Fireproofing (1910) 1 Ch 758, that
contemporaneity was a question of fact. In section 245 the words 'at the
same time as' only emphasised that contemporaneity was an objective matter.
If that was wrong and it was necessary to look at the reasons for the delay,
it seemed that Sharp, through Mr Nolan, acquiesced in the delay of Shoe
Lace, through Mr Nolan, in executing the debenture.
To obtain an interim payment under RSC Order 29 rule 10, the liquidator must
show a case of such strength as would justify judgment under RSC Order 14.
That was subject to Order 14A, which enabled the court to decide a question
of law if it appeared suitable for determination without full trial and if
such determination would finally dispose of an issue in the cause.
Construction of section 245 could be decided without full trial of the
liquidator's summons, and the determination would finally dispose of the
question of validity of the floating charge, because it meant that even on
the respondents' own evidence, the charge must be invalid.
Of the Pounds 180,710 paid under the sale agreement, Pounds 41,000 was
allocated to immoveable property and Pounds 5,000 to goodwill. Both were
subject to fixed charges which, although possibly voidable on other grounds,
did not fall within section 245.
That meant that for the purposes of an interim payment, it would be just to
order that Pounds 134,710 be paid out of the frozen funds to the liquidator.
For the liquidator: Daniel Serota QC and Paul Lowenstein (Fruhman, Davies &amp;
Co).
For the respondents: John Briggs (McKenna &amp; Co).

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD FIELDS of South Africa (GFSA), one of the country's largest mining
houses, recorded roughly unchanged results in the six months to December.
The result came against a background of continuing weakness in world
commodity markets.
Attributable profits fell to R133m (Dollars 47.6m) from R134m in 1990. The
1990 figure, however, was a low base, as it was 30 per cent down on the
R190m earned in the equivalent period in 1989.
Revenue was R231m, down from R339m. Of this, R123m came from investments,
compared with R136m, and R108m from fees, interest and other sources,
against R103m. Expenditure was virtually unchanged at R77m, leaving pre-tax
profits of R154m, down from R163m.
Mr Alan Wright, executive director, blamed the drop in investment income on
lower commodity prices, particularly for lead and copper, which contributed
to a decline in income from GFSA's unlisted investments, Black Mountain and
O'Okiep. Income from gold was flat.
Mr Wright said about 65 per cent of GFSA's income came from gold, with 65
per cent of this figure coming from dividend income and the balance from
fees obtained for services rendered to the mines in the group. GFSA is the
most gold-oriented of South Africa's mining houses.
Driefontein and Kloof, which GFSA manages, are two of the richest mines in
the world, with market capitalisations of R8.8bn and R4.3bn respectively.
Mr Wright said GFSA's activities outside of South Africa had 'gone a lot
faster than we anticipated. We have been well received around the world as
joint venture partners'.
He said prospects in the second half depended upon how quickly world
economic growth picked up, with commodity prices normally following an
upturn by six months. Even in the best circumstances, any such upturn would
be too late to affect results in this financial year.
The dividend was maintained at 70 cents per share, on earnings of 138 cents
per share compared with 140 cents.

BURLINGTON Industries, the North Carolina-based textiles group, is to return
to the stock market almost five years after being taken private through a
leveraged buy-out, via a Dollars 800m-plus flotation.
The company plans a public offering of 57m shares, and said it expected
these to be priced in the Dollars 14 to Dollars 16 range. The money raised
from the issue would be used to pay down existing debt and recapitalise the
company.
Burlington Industries is the latest in a long line of highly-leveraged
companies - including the likes of RJR Nabisco and Duracell - to take
advantage of record stock market levels to pay down debt via equity issues.
Interest charges on the heavy debts resulting from the Morgan Stanley-led
buy-out have compounded operating losses at the textile company for much of
the LBO period, although the operational side has improved recently.
In the year to end-September, earnings before interest and tax were Dollars
156.8m, but were offset by a Dollars 251.7m interest charge.

ALCAN ALUMINIUM, under pressure from weak metal prices, posted a net loss of
USDollars 41m, or 18 cents a share, after preferred dividends for the final
quarter of 1991, against a profit of Dollars 184m, or 83 cents, a year
earlier.
Sales declined to Dollars 1.8bn from Dollars 2.24bn in the same period of
1990.
For all 1991, the loss was Dollars 56m, or 25 cents a share, against profit
of Dollars 521m, or Dollars 2.33, in 1990. Revenues amounted to Dollars
7.7bn, compared with Dollars 8.7bn for 1990.
The figures were struck after restructuring charges and other special items
in both periods.
Alcan said average prices realised for primary aluminium in 1991 were 25 per
cent lower than in 1990.
Total shipments of ingot and fabricated products were lower, while year-end
inventory was 463,000 tonnes against 447,000 tonnes.
Mr David Morton, chairman, said that Alcan's results reflected lower prices
due primarily to big increases in exports from the former Soviet Union on
top of existing over-supply in the West.
'We responded by reducing our annual operating costs by well over the target
Dollars 200m in 1991, with a further improvement of Dollars 275m targeted
for 1992.'
He said the near-term outlook for aluminium prices is not encouraging,
'given continuing over-supply and few signs of an early recovery in demand.
We need an appreciable pick-up in demand or a further curtailment of
supply'.

won the auction for Cessna Aircraft Company, which manufactures business
jets and cargo planes and is currently owned by General Dynamics.
General Dynamics, the second largest US defence group, has been shrinking
its operations recently and concentrating on core businesses. It put Cessna
up for sale last October, and only last week Dassault Aviation, the French
maker of business and military jets, announced that it would be making an
offer for the General Dynamics subsidiary.
Textron has agreed to pay Dollars 600m in cash for Cessna, whichGeneral
Dynamics bought for Dollars 660m in 1985.
Cessna, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, had sales last year of around
Dollars 820m. It has produced general aviation aircraft for much of its
history but, in the early 1980s, refocused operations on its Citation
business jet and Caravan utility turboprop aircraft. The latter is used for
both cargo and passenger services, finding customers among the express
package delivery companies, such as Federal Express.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Parretti dismisses 'pyrrhic'
victory

<TEXT>
Mr GIANCARLO Parretti, the controversial Italian financier trying to regain
control of MGM-Pathe Communications, the financially-troubled Hollywood
studio, yesterday claimed his opponents had won 'only a pyrrhic victory',
writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, the Dutch subsidiary of the big French bank
which financed his November 1990 takeover of MGM Pathe, last year won
control of the company after a lengthy legal battle.
The bank's position was reinforced last month by a Delaware court, which
removed Mr Parretti and his family from the company's board and gave the
bank the right to vote the 98.5 per cent stake owned by a
Parretti-controlled concern.
Making his first public appearance since being released from a Sicilian jail
on January 10, Mr Parretti, (pictured right), criticised journalists at a
packed Rome press conference for continuing to call him 'the ex-owner of
MGM. All Credit Lyonnais has done is take away my voting rights, but the
shares are still mine', he said.
Sitting between his wife and three children, he said he was now 'at war'
with the bank. Credit Lyonnais only had the right to sell 51 per cent of
MGM-Pathe, and he would certainly exercise his option to buy the shares.
Ironically, losing the court case had given him 'more time, and finding the
necessary finance was 'the least important thing'.
Mr Parretti was arrested by Italian police on a string of charges of tax
fraud and illegal money transfer as he was boarding a private jet on
December 27. He declined to answer questions relating to his arrest and
subsequent release, as the affair was still sub-judice.
He claimed his source of finance was still available, while the Japanese
Toshiba electronics group had also offered 'very much money', he said.

KROGER, the large US supermarket chain which took on a hefty debt load as
part of a defensive restructuring in 1988, warned yesterday that operating
cash flow in the final quarter had slipped by between 5 and 7 per cent
year-on-year. The full-year figures are due in early February, writes Nikki
Tait.
Kroger said that retail inflation had been negative in the final quarter as
falling grocery and perishable prices were only partly offset by higher
prices for health and beauty care items, pharmaceuticals and tobacco
products.

Dollars 370m charge

<TEXT>
DOW Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, says it will take a
one-time pre-tax charge of Dollars 370m against fourth-quarter earnings.
The charge, which will cover write-downs and write-offs, will push the
company into the red for the period.
It will include a previously-announced shutdown of Dow Canada Sarnia's
chlor-alkali and derivatives facilities. Dow said the charge also covered
lower forecast values for oil and gas in Canada which have decreased the
asset value of these properties.
It said the move was consistent with its strategy to diversify into
specialities.
Mr Enrique Falla, chief financial officer, said Dow expected fourth-quarter
earnings from continuing operations to 'exceed 35 cents per share, in line
with financial analysts' expectations'. Dow is due to post its
fourth-quarter results on January 30.
Concern about possible litigation over silicone gel breast implants made by
Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, the
glass products manufacturer, prompted Moody's Investors Service to downgrade
Dow Corning and Corning senior debt ratings.
Dow Corning's senior debt rating was cut to A2 from Aa2. The company's
long-term debt and commercial paper ratings were placed under review for
possible downgrade.
Although the implants bring in only 1 per cent of Dow Corning's annual
sales, there is increasing concern the company may be flooded with lawsuits
amid the growing controversy over the long-term safety of the devices.
While Moody's downgraded Corning's long-term senior debt rating to single-A2
from single-A1, the rating agency left Dow Chemical's rating unchanged.

<TEXT>
ARTHUR TAYLOR Colliery, a R480m (Dollars 172.7m) joint venture between
subsidiaries of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) and Total, was
yesterday opened at Witbank, about 130km east of Johannesburg.
The mine represents a significant further investment in the country by the
French Total oil group, already the fourth largest foreign investor in the
country with an annual turnover of about R3bn. Total's stake was wholly
funded by its local coal subsidiary, Tesa, while JCI is involved through
wholly-owned subsidiary Tavistock Collieries.
Although there is an embargo preventing France from buying South African
coal, the opening was attended by representatives of Electricite de France
(EDF), the French electricity utility, Atic, the state coal importer, and
Lafarge, the cement producer. They indicated privately they would lobby the
French government to lift the embargo.
The open-cast mine will produce 2.4m saleable tonnes of export coal at full
capacity. It will be exported through the Richards Bay export terminal on
the east coast.

Hastings Deering said in a letter to the Australian Stock Exchange that Sime
Darby had completed a due-diligence review of the businesses and the
companies had entered into a non-binding sales agreement.
The agreement provides for the assets to be sold at Hastings Deering's book
value plus a premium of ADollars 35m (USDollars 25.7m), the statement said.
It did not disclose the book value.
The companies expect to enter a binding agreement within four weeks, with
settlement on April 30.
The sale is subject to approval from Hastings Deering shareholders.

<TEXT>
PROTON, Malaysia's only car-maker, yesterday opened its offer for the
flotation of 30 per cent of the company with a forecast that pre-tax profits
for the 12 months to March 1993 may drop by 24 per cent to MDollars 308.6m
(USDollars 114m) from MDollars 406.6m a year earlier.
The company intends, however, to maintain its dividend of 16.25 cents a
share, although earnings are expected to drop from 81 cents a share in March
1992 to 62 cents the following year.
The flotation offer at MDollars 5 a share is intended to raise MDollars 750m
from 120m existing and 30m new shares. It values the company at MDollars
2.5bn.
The offer, the first this year under Malaysia's privatisation programme,
marks a partial retreat by Japan's Mitsubishi from the company. Mitsubishi,
which has a 30 per cent shareholding in Proton, has provided it with
technology.
Holdings by Mitsubishi and Kuala Pura, its Malaysian associate, will fall to
20 per cent on completion of the capital restructuring and listing.
The Malaysian government, principally through Heavy Industries Corporation,
will retain 50 per cent equity control.
Only 20 per cent of the offer proceeds will be accrued to the company, while
the MDollars 600m balance will be returned to government agencies,
Mitsubishi and Kuala Pura.
Proton has forecast that pre-tax profit to March 1992 will be 55 per cent up
on the previous year's MDollars 262m.
The group, helped by the growth of disposable personal incomes and tariff
concessions, has helped Proton gain 62 per cent of last year's 130,000 car
market.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sansui loss estimate almost
doubled

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SANSUI Electric, the Japanese audio specialist caught up in the collapse of
the Polly Peck group, has nearly doubled its estimate of losses for last
year. The group has also announced a voluntary redundancy programme aimed at
cutting its workforce by one-third, to about 300 employees.
Redundancy programmes of any kind are extremely unusual for any established
Japanese company, where employment is usually a lifetime obligation on both
sides. Iwatsu Electric, a traditional supplier of telephone equipment to
Nippon Telephone and Telegraph, also this week said it would cut its
workforce of 2,361 employees by 640.
The redundancies at the two electronics companies are symptomatic of broader
troubles facing the industry. The last wave of similar redundancies was
about five years ago, when the steep appreciation of the yen prompted many
manufacturing companies to relocate facilities overseas.
Sansui said it expected little growth in the mature market for audio
equipment, while price competition would be intense. As a result, it needed
to cut fixed costs sharply by reducing the size of the workforce. It would
not say what its plans were, should sufficient employees fail to volunteer
for the programme by the deadline of February 28.
Sansui last year said it expected to move into the red because of a decision
to take provisions on part of the Y67.8bn (Dollars 533.85m) in loans to
Capetronic, a Taiwanese subsidiary which Sansui acquired when it was
purchased by Polly Peck.
However, the company has now increased its estimates of after-tax losses,
from Y18.6bn to Y36bn, because of the continuing weak demand for audio
equipment and video tape recorders in Europe and the US. Sales are expected
to decline to Y20.5bn, amounting to only 57 per cent of losses expected.
Sansui, which is in the process of being sold to Grande Holdings of Hong
Kong, expected a modest recovery this year, with sales climbing to Y24,000
and net profits reaching Y500.
Iwatsu said it was forced to reduce its workforce after revised estimates
suggested it would incur a Y3bn after-tax loss on sales of Y59.4bn, down
from Y63.2bn last year.
The redundancies are part of a broader restructuring programme aimed at
integrating or liquidating affiliated companies while concentrating on sales
of digital private branch exchanges and measuring instruments for
telecommunications. Iwatsu also plans to raise money through the sale of
property.
Iwatsu has been struggling to stay in the black following the privatisation
of NTT in 1985. NTT's own performance has been under pressure because of
increased competition.

6.2%
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Motors, the Japanese car-maker, moved sharply ahead in Japan's
domestic vehicle market last year, increasing sales by 6.2 per cent in a
market that declined by 3.2 per cent. It grabbed market share at the expense
of big producers such as Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda.
Mitsubishi is now firmly in third place behind Toyota and Nissan, with 10
per cent of the market, while Honda is trailing in fourth place with 8.8 per
cent.
Mitsubishi's success is particularly bad news for Toyota, the largest
producer and one which has dominated the luxury end of the market, where
profits are highest. Mitsubishi's success is due largely to is popular
Diamante luxury model.
Toyota saw its domestic market share fall by nearly 1 percentage point to
31.3 per cent, while sales, measured by registrations, declined by 5.9 per
cent.
Nissan held up somewhat better, with sales off by 4.2 per cent, giving it a
market share of 17.9 per cent. Mazda saw its sales fall by 7 per cent, in
spite of the introduction of a new luxury model, giving it a share of 7.3
per cent.
Toyota's vehicle production last year declined by 3 per cent to 4.08m units,
with passenger car production off by 5 per cent to 3.12m. With domestic
sales declining, exports posted a 1.6 per cent gain to 1.7m vehicles.
Overseas production was off by 1.2 per cent to 669,741 vehicles.
Nissan posted a 3.6 per cent decline in domestic production, at 2.33m units,
while overseas production climbed sharply by 13.6 per cent to 751,528
vehicles. Nissan said the increase was due to the expansion of production of
its Primera model in the UK, which has proved popular throughout Europe.
Nissan's exports rose by half a per cent to 960,960. Worldwide production
for the company rose marginally to 3.08m vehicles.

<TEXT>
A LEADING Japanese home builder, Misawa Homes, is negotiating with an ailing
contractor, Ishihara Construction, over a rehabilitation plan. The scheme is
likely to include the taking of a 20 per cent stake in Ishihara which has
been weakened by links to failed property developers.
The negotiations reflect the reluctance of Japanese banks to allow leading
clients to fail. Ishihara is listed on the second section of the Tokyo
exchange, and its bankers, including Mitsubishi Trust and Mitsubishi Bank,
had apparently been seeking a partner to assist in its restructuring.
Misawa Homes has remained strong in spite of the downturn in Japan's
property market over the past year. Mr Fumichika Ishihara, the president of
Ishihara Construction, said the Misawa group was the most likely of four
candidates that have sought a capital tie-up with his company, which has
debts estimated at Y110bn (Dollars 863m).
Ishihara Construction was closely linked to Kyowa Corporation, a bankrupt
steel frame builder and property developer which was at the centre of a
political scandal last week for its large donations to the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
Mr Fumio Abe, a former Japanese cabinet minister, was arrested for allegedly
taking bribes from Kyowa, which had collapsed owing more than Y200bn in late
1990.
Ishihara had guaranteed Y21bn of Kyowa's outstanding debt and has been
obliged to put up three Japanese properties and another in Malaysia as
collateral for the debt. The contractor had also guaranteed loans totalling
Y4.6bn for Ohira Sangyo, another failed property developer,
Tokyo-based Ishihara incurred increased debt through its dealings in
property development just before the Japanese property market weakened two
years ago.
It plans to allot new shares to its creditors, who, aware that Ishihara is
backed by its banks, are likely to agree to postpone repayment deadlines.

COCA-COLA Enterprises (CCE), the leading US bottler of Coca-Cola, expects to
report a 1991 loss of Dollars 91m as a result of a wide-ranging
restructuring of its distribution network, writes Alan Friedman.
The loss - which compares with a Dollars 93.4m net profit for 1990 - will be
struck after Dollars 152m in 1991 restructuring charges, which were taken in
the fourth quarter.
The restructuring is part of a broader effort by Coca-Cola - which owns 44
per cent of CCE - and its bottling affiliates to consolidate the overblown
US bottling system in order to achieve economies of scale.
CCE, chaired by Mr Donald Keough, the president of Coca-Cola, controls about
55 per cent of the US soft drink maker's bottling system.
The restructuring includes a reconfiguration of its sales and distribution
centres, changes in its information systems and severance and relocation
costs.
CCE was merged with Johnston Coca-Cola Enterprises last year, in a deal
which resulted in an after-tax gain of Dollars 18m for Coca-Cola on CCE
shares.
Hellenic Bottling Company (HBC), the Cypriot-controlled company which holds
the Coca-Cola franchise for Greece and Ireland, has signed a joint venture
agreement to produce Coca-Cola in Bulgaria, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
HBC is taking a 53 per cent stake in the venture with Texim 90, a bottling
plant belonging to a union of co-operatives in Plovdiv which already
produces Coca-Cola in small quantities.
Similar agreements are being negotiated with four other soft drinks bottlers
around Bulgaria.
A company official said HBC would provide an injection of capital and would
manage the plants. Its total investment is estimated at Dollars 25m over the
next three years.
HBC, which was listed on the Athens Stock Exchange last year, is forecasting
earnings of Dr10bn (Dollars 55m) for 1991, a 30 per cent improvement on the
previous year.

PEUGEOT, the French car group, yesterday provided the latest evidence of
continuing sluggish demand in the European car industry by indicating that
sales last year were stagnant or slightly down on the FFr159.9bn (Dollars
29.61bn) recorded in 1990.
Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot, which also embraces Citroen, said
the full-year net profits should be more than double the FFr2.27bn recorded
in the first half, which was 54 per cent down on the same period of 1991.
Peugeot officials said they did not want to make a more precise estimate at
this stage. However, this implies full-year profits of at least FFr4.54bn
net, well down on FFr9.2bn in 1990. This is within most analysts'
expectations.
'I believe there is no reason not to be confident that the profit for the
year will be more than double that of the first half,' said Mr Calvet.
Demand continued to flag in the UK and France, while the German market began
to decline last year, said a Peugeot official.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Shadow of guilt falls across
derivatives - The weakness of the Japanese market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SEARCH by the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) for the culprits behind the
chronic weakness of Japanese share prices has led back to one of the usual
suspects, derivatives, and to the foreign brokerages most adept in dealing
in derivative markets.
Inspired by share prices at their lowest since October 1990, the TSE has
announced that a task force will examine tighter controls over stock index
futures and options trading. Exchange officials say new controls are
necessary because the futures market is primarily used for speculation and
is the source of violent price movements in the cash market.
But the liberalisation of financial markets which brought large-scale stock
futures trading from 1988 has also diversified the vested interests within
Japan. The TSE said the task force would be established jointly with the
Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE), but Osaka authorities said yesterday that
they will conduct their own review.
The bulk of Japan's stock futures trading is done on the Osaka exchange,
although its index is based on Tokyo cash prices. Having been more
successful than Tokyo in derivative trading, officials at the OSE, the
second largest exchange, argue that trading there is not to blame for
Tokyo's problems.
Friction between the two exchanges is in addition to the conflicting
interests of large and small Japanese brokers - the latter are dependent on
individual investors for commissions and tend not to play the derivative
markets. Then there are the differences between the TSE and the Ministry of
Finance, which, in the wake of the securities scandals last year, is under
pressure to be seen to be regulating the industry.
And there is the sometimes testy relationship between Japanese brokers and
the foreign securities houses. The Big Four Japanese brokers reported profit
falls of more than 64 per cent in the first half to end-September, while a
few foreign brokers booked large increases in Tokyo profits partly because
of their skill in playing the derivative markets.
Trading in the Osaka-based Nikkei 225 futures index rose 2.7 times last
year, and accounted for 56.2 per cent of the trading revenue earned by the
OSE. At the same time, futures trading in Tokyo on the TSE's own Topix index
accounted for only 2.6 per cent of the exchange's trading revenue.
While Tokyo officials have pointed the finger at foreign brokers for having
led the 'abnormal' surge in derivative trading, larger Japanese brokers are
developing their expertise in the area. Mr Atsushi Saito, the executive
managing director of Nomura Securities, is critical of 'speculation' in the
futures markets, but urged authorities to refrain from introducing new
restrictions.
'Restrictions will increase the inefficiency of the futures market,' he
said, adding that 80 per cent of Nomura's futures deals are done on
customers' accounts, suggesting that it is not a 'speculator' - about 56 per
cent of Osaka futures dealing is done on brokers' own accounts. But Mr Saito
said that the securities industry's priority must be to restore investor
confidence in the cash market.
Investor confidence is an important issue in the debate over derivatives.
The TSE and smaller brokers are determined to lure individual investors back
to the cash market, but Mr Minoru Nagaoka, the TSE president, argues that
they are intimidated by the sharp price movements generated by arbitrage
trading - the profiting from price differences between the cash and futures
markets.
But Japanese investors have other, very sound, reasons to be wary of the
Tokyo market. A speculative swirl in the cash market took the Nikkei index
to 38,915.87 in late 1989, but the index was below 21,000 yesterday, with
some signs that the market may get worse as stocks are sold off before the
close of the financial year in March.
Individuals were also shaken by the stock market scandals of the past year
which showed that Japanese brokerages favoured larger corporate clients by
compensating them for trading losses. Meanwhile, Japan's meagre dividend
levels are no incentive to buy stocks, and investors have realised that
stock prices can no longer defy gravity.
Mr Jason James, a stock strategist at James Capel Pacific, said that the
Osaka exchange scored a victory by backing the Nikkei 225 index, which is
more vulnerable to price movements than Tokyo's Topix and is thus more
attractive to investors. But he said the targeting of arbitrage as the cause
of the Tokyo cash market's problems is an attempt to 'find a scapegoat'.
The TSE's frustration has been heightened by low trading volumes on the cash
market, down 22.9 per cent last year, with the daily average at 372.8m
shares, below 400m for the first time in seven years. Mr Nagaoka complained
that the value of turnover for stock index futures in Tokyo and Osaka last
year was more than five times that of the Tokyo cash market's first section.
So far the OSE and TSE have compromised on measures to 'reform' the
derivative markets. The OSE has argued against dramatic changes, but agreed
to the lifting of margin requirements three times last year, increasing the
amount of money deposited at the exchange when a trade is made.
An OSE official said the cash market's weakness is not necessarily linked to
futures trading: 'If we find there is a problem, we will do something, but
it will not be easy to change the nature of the index.' The OSE says that it
will study trading hours, brokers' trading on their own accounts,
information disclosure, and the fixing of futures settlement prices.
The TSE said it will consider long and short-term reforms of futures
trading, and a US broker suggested that the Tokyo task force could recommend
various changes in the calculation of the Nikkei index. He said the
enthusiasm for reform will be linked to the market's strength when the
review is completed - if the Nikkei index has risen, the pressure for change
will have eased.
Tokyo could impose a ceiling on brokers' dealing in futures on their own
account - foreign brokers would be disadvantaged if that ceiling were
calculated on the basis of the asset value of operations in Japan.
The review panel could also recommend that tighter limits be placed on the
price movements of illiquid stocks within the Nikkei 225.
The composition of the Nikkei 225 lends itself to sudden price fluctuations.
A surge of trading in thinly-traded stocks moves the price-based Nikkei
index more sharply than the capital-weighted Topix index, a difference that
has encouraged futures trading on the Osaka market.
Some of the more illiquid stocks have been already removed from the Nikkei
225, but the task force may recommend that a larger number of illiquid
stocks are replaced on a regular basis. And the exchanges could again
increase the margin deposit requirements in an attempt to curb trading
volume.
But another UK broker suggested that if the TSE task force is objective in
its assessment of the derivative markets, it will come to the conclusion
that to clamp down would be merely to 'shoot the messenger'.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BP pulls out of Egypt with Dollars 125m oil
disposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM said it will pull out of Egypt with the sale, announced
yesterday, of its oil production assets to Repsol Exploracion, a subsidiary
of the Spanish state oil company, for Dollars 125m (Pounds 69.8m).
The sale is part of the company's drive to focus on its core exploration
areas and to withdraw from countries where it has failed to reach a critical
mass.
It follows BP's departure from the Qatar gas project last week.
The assets sold include its 33.33 per cent stakes in two oil concessions
containing the Ras Budran, Ras Fanar and Zeit Bay fields where BP's share of
production is 15,000 barrels a day.
BP has been exploring in Egypt for 15 years, but the company was not a
significant presence in the country's oil industry. The company has retained
its 25 per cent stake in the El Qar'a gas project which is still under
development.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading as Cantors dives to
Pounds 206,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In common with many other high street retailers, Cantors, the
Sheffield-based furniture group, is suffering from 'extremely difficult'
trading conditions.
Announcing sharply reduced profits for the six months to October 26, Mr
Harold Cantor, chairman, said trading had improved during the third quarter
but customers were still showing a reluctance to spend.
The outcome for the full year would show a 'marked reduction' on last year's
Pounds 2.53m, he added.
Despite turnover ahead 22 per cent to Pounds 30.2m, the pre-tax line at the
interim stage amounted to just Pounds 206,000, down from Pounds 1.45m in the
corresponding half of 1990. Interest charges of Pounds 142,000 were incurred
against receivable of Pounds 79,000.
Earnings per share dived to 0.98p (6.89p) but the interim dividend is held
at 1p.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Matthew Clark slips 27% as margins suffer
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATTHEW CLARK, the wine and sherry producer which has carried out
substantial restructuring during the past 18 months, reported a 27 per cent
decline in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.22m.
Operating profits fell 24 per cent to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 2.67m) on
turnover, net of duty, 19 per cent lower at Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 23.7m)
during the six months to October 31.
Turnover on continuing businesses was some 11 per cent higher, reflecting
'significant gains' in market share by the group's British wines, but
operating margins were squeezed, falling from 14.6 per cent to 11.2 per cent
under pressure particularly from multiple grocers.
Earnings per share increased by 27 per cent to 16.4p (12.9p), reflecting the
acquisition of the minority interest in JE Mather, the Stone's ginger wine
maker. The interim dividend goes up from 5.75p to 6.5p.
'But for the restructuring, the group would not have been able to withstand
the recession in such good shape,' said Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive.
Disposal last October of IH Baker, the Australian distribution subsidiary,
completed the reorganisation which has included the sale of the Sealark
transport arm and a stake in Macallan-Glenlivet.
Mr Aikens said that the group was now 'poised to move forward' by seeking to
acquire other drinks brands - particularly cider or mineral water - in the
UK.
Since the period end, the group has formed a joint venture with Inver House
Distillers to market and sell its Scotch whiskies, gin and vodka.
However, Mr Aikens added that Christmas trading had been difficult with
volumes just ahead of the previous year. Margins were still under pressure
and there was no indication that the recession was nearing its end.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: London and Man writes off Pounds 17m bad
debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON AND Manchester Group, the life assurance company, is writing off
Pounds 17m before tax relief in bad debts on commercial property loans. As a
result the final dividend is frozen at last year's 9.144p for a 2 per cent
rise in the total.
The shares fell 22p to 263p on the news.
Mr Tom Pyne, group chief executive, said that the group had withdrawn from
the commercial property lending market last year. 'It's very much a one-off,
and the losses have been struck off after a very rigorous examination of the
portfolio. We've made sure that we now make adequate provision to make
absolutely certain that our liabilities are now fully covered.'
Mr Roger Harvey, analyst with Kleinwort Benson, welcomed the news, saying:
'I'm quite pleased to see them take this action, rather than let it depress
dividend cover.
Analysts agreed that 1991 sales figures in the mainstream life and pensions
business were more encouraging. New annual premiums were up 3 per cent to
Pounds 50.4m, while new single premiums rose66 per cent to Pounds 115m.
This reflects an industry-wide trend, which has shown consumers being wary
of taking out regular commitments in a recessionary environment, but much
more willing to shelter any spare cash they have in single premium products.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Record result for Principality BS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Principality Building Society achieved record results last year despite
the downturn in the economy and the malaise in the housing market.
The society reported pre-tax profits up 4.6 per cent to Pounds 15.1m. Total
assets topped Pounds 1bn for the first time, reaching Pounds 1.03bn by the
year end.
Mortgage lending at Pounds 175.1m was only Pounds 5.1m below the peak
achieved in 1990, said Mr John Mitchell, chairman. The society was helped by
a good result from Peter Alan, its wholly-owned estate agency, which lifted
sales by 13 per cent.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: First half deficit at John D Wood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John D Wood, the USM-quoted estate agent, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
194,000 in the six months to October 31 1991.
That followed the deficit of Pounds 186,000 in the second half of last year,
and compared with a profit of Pounds 201,000 in the corresponding first
half.
Losses per share were 1.9p (earnings 1.5p) and the interim dividend is
omitted. Last year 1.5p was paid but there was no final.
Mr George Pope and Mr Ian Homersham, joint chairmen, said the nine central
London sales offices and lettings and management department continued to
trade profitably.
They pointed out that the recession caused greater problems within the
country department, where values had fallen dramatically from the peak of
1988. Increasingly difficult trading conditions in agriculture led to a
reduction in the size of the agricultural department.
Turnover fell nearly 6 per cent to Pounds 2.56m and expenditure increased
slightly because of the new office in Wimbledon, expansion of the
development department, unlet space within the head office, and redundancy
costs. Recurring controllable expenditure, however, was reduced.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reduced loss at Appld Holographics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved control of overheads and other costs enabled Applied Holographics
to cut interim losses from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 681,000 pre-tax.
Within the results of this USM-quoted designer and producer of holograms,
the UK holographic activities were profitable while the foil activities of
TAPF suffered a loss as did the US operations.
For the rest of the year the company said that holographic turnover and
gross contributions would be significantly higher but added that it would be
foolish to predict higher levels of trading across the group.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 was static at Pounds 2.46m
(Pounds 2.47m). The pre-tax figure was struck after net interest charges of
Pounds 34,000, compared with income of Pounds 75,000. Losses per share came
out at 4.5p (8.7p).

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Small tickets can lead to big headaches - A
look at the OFT's Eurocopy decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR GORDON Borrie fired a warning shot across the bows of office equipment
leasing houses earlier this week, when he said that unclear documentation
would be sufficient cause for swift action from the Office of Fair Trading.
The decision not to revoke the consumer credit licences of Eurocopy, the
photocopier distributor, was accompanied by a no-nonsense warning that both
finance houses and distributors would have to meet 'acceptable standards of
behaviour'. Those included providing documentation which was not 'open to
abuse in ways similar to those which led to complaints against Eurocopy',
Sir Gordon said. Eurocopy, which came under OFT scrutiny following
complaints about the sales practices of some of its subsidiaries, has
promised it will only deal with leasing houses which provide clear
contracts.
But there is some scepticism as to how effective Sir Gordon's comments will
be within the complex world of small ticket leasing. The fact that suppliers
approach customers and then arrange financing through a third party - often
unbeknown to the customer - means that misunderstandings are almost
inevitable.
Some analysts suggest cynically that perhaps the government only took an
interest in the practices of small ticket leasing in the run-up to the
General Election.
'The CBI has asked the government to consider re-introducing capital
allowances,' said Ms Karen Bennett of BZW. 'And Labour has already said that
it will re-introduce capital allowances if it gets elected . . . That's
bonanza time for leasing companies.'
Furthermore, Sir Gordon's comments citing the Consumer Credit Act do not
apply to the vast majority of contracts negotiated in the small ticket
industry. The CCA covers only those agreements worth less than Pounds 15,000
and with non-corporate clients. This represents less than 7 per cent of
Eurocopy's business, for example.
Mr Andrew Yeo, analyst with Hoare Govett, said the only real effect would be
to put rather weak pressure on leasing companies to clean up their
contracts. 'They won't be able to get away with the small print as they have
in the past . . . But at the end of the day, it won't make a great amount of
difference.'
So where does that leave the vast majority of customers? Those with
complaints about documentation, like Mr Robin Huttenbach, a director of
Nelson Design, an environmental design group, have little comeback. Mr
Huttenbach is now faced with a writ of summons from System Rentals Sales
Aid, a subsidiary of Sabre Leasing, Union Discount's leasing arm, for
non-payment.
Sabre, where bad debts were largely responsible for losses of Pounds 7.29m
at Union Discount, said yesterday that it had disputes - excluding bad debts
 -with less than 5 per cent of its 38,000 contracts.
Mr Tony Simkin, who came to Sabre as managing director in a management
shake-up last year, said the proportion of those disputes which arose from
actual documentation was small. He welcomed Sir Gordon's comments, and said
Sabre planned to introduce new contracts on April 1, which 'set out clearly
what is expected of us and the lessee'.
Yet Sabre's new contract is not the result of the OFT inquiry. Instead, it
stems from the industry's own attempts to salvage its image after almost two
years of bad press, beginning with Eurocopy.
'All leasing has tended to be tarred with the same brush,' said Mr Harry
Hyman, finance director of Baltic Leasing, which operates in the big ticket
sector for items such as jumbo jets and property. 'Customers are not making
the distinction between the types of equipment leased.'
The Finance &amp; Leasing Association, which represents more than 80 per cent of
the leasing industry, last week issued its own guidelines and was more than
a little upset that the OFT had failed to mention them.
Mr Brian Hassell, joint chairman of the FLA, said he was disappointed at the
OFT statement. 'The association has been aware of the problems in the office
equipment sector for some time and has taken action to deal with them,' he
said.
Mr Andrew Thompson, secretary of the FLA, said that the association's
guidelines - which applied to all agreements with members - could be seen to
fill the gap left by the Credit Consumer Act. However, the FLA's only
sanction would be a bar on membership.
Whether this is sufficient to protect customers is debatable. Perhaps the
biggest deterrent to the existence of misleading documentation will be the
painful repercussions to Eurocopy of the four-month OFT investigation.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BT partly-paid shares close below 110p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partly-paid shares in British Telecommunications closed yesterday for the
first time below the price at which the government sold them to small
investors.
In last month's Pounds 5.4bn sale, the Treasury sold shares to 2.7m small
investors at 110p and to institutional investors at 125p. Yesterday, the
shares closed at 109 1/2 p after touching 108 3/4 p at one stage.
The government had made it clear that it wanted to avoid the shares going
for a large premium, as this could have left it open to accusations that it
had sold public assets on the cheap.
But ministers may now face the embarrassment of voters finding that their
investments have fallen in value.
Nonetheless, small shareholders have not actually lost money because they
received a 5.7p dividend last week.
The share price has been undermined by fears that Oftel, the industry
regulator, would control BT's prices more strictly when it starts to review
them at the end of this month.

venture

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a sharp exchange of words yesterday between Steetley and Redland,
which has made a hostile Pounds 630m bid for the building materials group.
A circular posted by Steetley to its shareholders prompted Mr Robert Napier,
Redland's chief executive, to say that the document contained nothing new.
Steetley had appealed to shareholders to support its plan to merge its UK
brick, clay roof tile and concrete products businesses with those of Tarmac,
Britain's biggest construction and building materials group.
The document included a letter from Sir Eric Pountain, Tarmac's chairman,
endorsing the formation of Allied Building Materials, a joint venture
company.
Mr Napier said: 'It is surprising that they should believe that it would
enhance Steetley's case to include a letter from Tarmac. Of course Tarmac is
in favour of the joint venture.' Mr David Donne, chairman of Steetley,
retorted that Mr Napier's reply was a 'predictably lame response.'

<TEXT>
THE FIRST sales of subsidiaries in Maxwell Communication Corporation could
come as soon as the beginning of next month, the administrators said
yesterday.
Advertisements appeared yesterday for Maxwell Business Communications Group
(MBC) and Macdonald, two publishing companies, and negotiations with
potential buyers for several other companies are also well advanced.
Mr Jonathan Phillips, a partner in Price Waterhouse and one of the joint
administrators of MCC, said the priority was to sell the publishing
companies first, since secure ownership was needed to continue to produce
titles.
The administrators hope to have all offers in by the end of January for MBC,
the three divisions of which may be sold separately. More than 70 potential
buyers have already expressed interest.
Discussions are progressing towards the sale of a number of companies
including QED Technology, a systems integrator and software supplier for the
publishing industry which announced plans for a management buy out last week
and Panini, the Italian-based sticker printer.
Other companies involved are Nimbus, a compact disk manufacturer based in
Wales in which MCC held a 76 per cent stake, ICDD, a printing company based
in France and Maxwell Consumer Publishing and Communications, a contract
publishing house.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Birse dives 62% as recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS of Birse Group fell by 62 per cent, from Pounds 4.7m to
Pounds 1.8m for the six months to end-October, as the recession finally
caught up with the UK construction group.
Bilfinger and Berger, the German contractor, owns 15 per cent of Birse. It
acquired the shares at 120p in autumn 1989 when the British group was
floated.
Yesterday, Birse shares closed 3p up at 83p - 31 per cent less than
Bilfinger paid two years ago. The German group was currently tendering in
joint venture with Birse for at least three large UK tunneling contracts.
These include an Pounds 80m section of the proposed Jubilee underground line
extension in London.
The UK construction market has fallen sharply since Bilfinger acquired its
stake. Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said yesterday that contracting margins
made by the British group had fallen to half their normal level. It had
however, decided to hold its interim dividend at 1.65p, only just covered by
earnings of 1.8p (4.7p) per share.
The first-half figures have been adjusted to take account of the decision to
write off interest charges on development loans rather than capitalise
interest as previously.
The effect has been to reduce reduce shareholders' funds at the end of April
last year from Pounds 50m to Pounds 45m.
Mr Birse said that trading conditions had continued to deteriorate.
Increased competition for construction contracts meant that profits had
fallen sharply, despite a 16 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 189.3m.
The commercial property and housing businesses remained deeply depressed and
were expected to incur a further loss this year.
Demands on cash balances to fund working capital and dividend payments had
meant that gearing had increased from 8 per cent at the end of April to 48
per cent. This was despite a decline in borrowings from Pounds 42m to Pounds
38m.
COMMENT
The rapid deterioration in the trading performance has severely dented
Birse's reputation. Last April the group's share price reached a peak of
186p since when its has been downhill virtually all the way. The fall in
contracting margins has occurred more rapidly than expected given that
profits are being taken on work won which is likely to have been won at
least 12 to 18 months earlier, when construction was still a relatively
strong market. The rise in the group's gearing, which was not anticipated
when preliminary results were announced last July, has not helped the share
price. Pre-tax profits for the year may be less than Pounds 5m compared with
a restated Pounds 9.99m last time. The fall in the share price may have gone
too far but there is unlikely to be a substantial recovery while recent
disappointments are fresh in the memory and while UK construction remains
deeply depressed.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Starting with a clean sheet - A look at
Budgens' recovery plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of Budgens, the food retailer, does not believe in
hard-sell techniques - certainly when it comes to persuading the City.
Since being installed by institutional shareholders last May, Mr John von
Spreckelsen has been 'practically invisible', according to analysts who
follow the lively retail sector.
Mr Spreckelsen said: 'We decided to concentrate on improving the business,
and that we would talk when the results had improved sufficiently for us to
have a story to tell.'
Yesterday's figures from the group are only an interim chapter of a tale
which took a dramatic twist when institutional shareholders forced the
resignation of Mr John Fletcher as chairman, recruited Mr von Spreckelsen
and injected Pounds 21.7m into the business.
In July the new management team reported a loss of Pounds 14.7m for the year
to April 27, after heavy exceptional costs and and write-offs. Mr von
Spreckelsen said yesterday's interim profits figure of Pounds 2.2m was
'completely clean - we cleaned out the balance sheet in April.'
Although he described the results as 'a significant first step on the road
to recovery', he accepts that he has still to demonstrate that Budgens has a
future in a world of increasingly large and competitive food retailers.
An initial priority was to sort out problems at the group's distribution
centre at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, which is far too large for a
chain of only 95 stores.
Mr von Spreckelsen said security and productivity had been increased, and
distribution costs were now down from 6.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent of sales.
Availability of stock in some lines was down to 70 per cent but has now
improved to 98 per cent.
Wellingborough was still too big, he said, but bricks and mortar only
accounted for about 25 per cent of costs - the main outlays were on
transport and staff.
Budgens is already distributing food from Wellingborough for Betta Stores,
and is working to develop a billing system, which would allow it do other
third-party work - probably for small independents.
Stock losses had been substantially reduced, but Mr von Spreckelsen said it
was difficult to estimate by how much: 'There was such a poor information
base that there could have been a numbers graveyard.'
The group suffered from very high wastage levels in fresh foods.
A large adhesive coding label being stuck on top of every open tray of
yoghurt tubs meant that as many as eight cartons were being wasted every
time. A smaller label is now attached to the side of each tray.
Milk was being kept in the warehouse for 48 hours, giving it a less
attractive sell-by date. The minimum size of carton was 24 units; some
stores could sell only 12 items, so the rest was wastage.
Mr von Spreckelsen, a very methodical man, said: 'Business is all about
attention to detail.'
Budgens is currently testing electronic point of sale (Epos) equipment in
three stores and aims to have it installed across the group within three
years, which should substantially improve stock management.
Having identified competitive disadvantages such as costly distribution, the
new management team has also been asking more fundamental questions - such
as whether the Budgens type of small neighbourhood store is viable.
Mr von Spreckelsen said: 'Demographics suggests this type of store has a
future. The average age of the population is growing. They are not going are
going to be basket shoppers. We are not competing with hypermarkets - we are
well positioned in city centres or small towns.'
Budgens is placing more emphasis on product and price flexibility, according
to location. Mr von Spreckelsen insists: 'Business is local.'
The group has completed its market research and now has a business plan for
each store. In some, there will be no change. Others have had pizzerias
installed or have taken in franchises such as post offices.
The chief executive said: 'A lot of pensioners collect their pension, and
then may do their shopping. The trick is to convert the extra traffic into
extra shoppers. This sometimes means you have to change your stock -
pensioners buying whisky want half-bottles, not full bottles.'
Mr von Spreckelsen, who turned round Kafu Wasmund, the Bremen-based
supermarket chain, said Budgens' recovery plan was still was still on
course, although competition had increased since the summer. He has
identified a significant number of projects, but is keeping his cards close
to his chest.
Analysts acknowledge progress has been made, but say the group's retail
formula for the future is still not clear.
Until it is, the jury will remain out on whether there is a future for
Budgens.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reject first-half losses deepen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anthony Hawser, joint chairman of the Reject Shop, yesterday strongly
condemned government policies which he said had helped deepen his company's
first half losses from Pounds 301,000 to Pounds 587,000.
The costs of the higher uniform business rate had offset virtually all
savings on job cuts in the period, while raised VAT charges had been 'a
terrible piece of timing. He said that despite drawbacks, the group had
performed in line with expectations. This was achieved through strict
attention to costs, and tighter control of working capital.
Sales on a like-for-like basis fell by 16 per cent excluding VAT, and 14 per
cent inclusive, for the 28 weeks to September 29. Total group sales were
Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 9.2m), excluding VAT.
Losses per share were 3.97p (2.1p) and the interim dividend again 1.05p.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Perrier vows to fight Nestle bid

<TEXT>
SOURCE Perrier, the French mineral water and cheese company, yesterday vowed
to fight against the FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.38bn) bid launched by Nestle, the
Swiss food group, and Indosuez, the French bank.
At the same time, BSN, another force in the French food industry, threw down
the gauntlet to the Agnellis, the Italian industrialists who have mounted a
FFr5.6bn bid for Exor, Perrier's biggest single shareholder. BSN declared
that it would not allow the Agnellis to further increase their investment in
BSN.
Perrier and BSN are embroiled in the battle that is brewing between Nestle,
a traditional ally of BSN, and the Agnellis in the European food industry, a
sector long considered ripe for consolidation.
Mr Jacques Vincent, president of both Perrier and Exor, issued a statement
condemning the bid by Nestle and Indosuez saying that it threatened to
'dismantle Perrier' by dispersing its brands between Nestle and BSN.
He affirmed his support for the Agnelli bid for Exor and for the investment
in Perrier by Saint Louis, the French paper and packaging company associated
with the Agnellis. Both the Exor bid and the Saint Louis investment are
being investigated by the French stock market authorities. Nestle yesterday
said it had obtained court orders to freeze Exor's voting stock in Perrier
and to freeze Saint Louis' voting rights on its 13.8 per cent stake.
The Agnellis have made no secret of their hopes of raising their
indirectly-held 5.8 per cent stake in BSN.
Mr Antoine Riboud, president of BSN, was yesterday quoted in Liberation, the
French newspaper, as saying that he would block any attempt to increase the
Agnelli's investment. Under the terms of an agreement, the Agnellis are
unable to directly or indirectly buy BSN shares without Mr Riboud's consent.
In Paris, BSN's shares slipped by FFr43 to FFr1,111 yesterday after Mr
Riboud's rebuff. Shares in companies linked to the Agnelli family fell
sharply in Milan, depressing prices on the market as a whole.

FT  22 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Borland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The computer industry has had more than its share of glamour stocks. So when
a group such as Borland International, the California-based software
company, pauses for breath, the inevitable question is whether it might be
about to fall from grace. Given that its shares have risen more than
eight-fold in the last two years, Borland has a long way to fall. Whereas a
year ago its third quarter results sent the shares up by more than 10 per
cent, yesterday they fell 6 per cent on confirmation that earnings were flat
thanks only to a one-off tax credit.
The slowdown can be blamed on the Dollars 430m friendly acquisition last
summer of Ashton-Tate, a rival which was falling apart in such classic
fashion that some observers doubted it was worth rescuing. Ashton-Tate's
strength in the market for databases gave Borland a full range of products
with which to tackle competitors such as Lotus. But in the short term, the
effect has been to load the group with restructuring costs totalling Dollars
116m. Although Borland has set about integrating Ashton-Tate with impressive
speed, the real test will come in its next financial year when it expects to
start growing again.
In the meantime, shareholders face a dilemma. Borland's determination to
compete with the biggest in the business has caused its shares to lag the
recent rise in software stocks both in the US and the UK. Micro Focus, for
example, has risen 40 per cent since early December. But if it pulls it off,
the really big returns may yet lie ahead. Perhaps investors should hedge
their bets like some of Borland's own directors and sell part of their
holdings.

FT  22 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: US bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the big fears in the US Treasury bond market after the Salomon
Brothers' debacle was that the authorities would become over-zealous in
their approach to regulation. Instead, the Treasury appears to have decided
to let market forces mete out their own punishment on any dealer rash enough
to try a bit of manipulation. Its mere threat to counter any squeeze by
un-scheduled sales of additional paper should render attempts by big
operators to corner a particular issue too risky. The Treasury's almost
insatiable demand for funds gives it the muscle to intervene massively in
the bond market if it wishes.
Once the new plan is up and running, traders should become less worried
about being caught in a squeeze after selling short. The result should be a
more liquid market and one where deals are done at genuine prices.
Admittedly, this assumes that the authorities are now better placed to
detect a squeeze; they were dilatory in latching on to last May's effort,
which eventually proved Salomon's undoing. The downside is the likelihood of
greater short-term price fluctuation, while government bond dealing could
become less profitable for the bigger houses. Nor can the Treasury expect to
raise much money through its intervention issues. At first sight, the new
plan looks as though it could be the first step down a road towards UK-style
tap issues which would give the Treasury flexibility to borrow cheaply at
times of strong investor demand. But the US Treasury's requirements are too
large for this, and regular but unpredictable issuance outside the auctions
could undermine the futures market which investors use to hedge a whole
spectrum of issues. The new weapon will have to be used sparingly and
essentially punitively. But that, after all, is the purpose for which it is
intended.

Trafalgar may have won the battle, but the war is not over. Yesterday's
court judgment confirming that the company keeps the title to Davy's
ill-fated Ocean Emerald drilling rig until MSR comes up with the cash is
good news as far as it goes. But there is still no guarantee that Trafalgar

happens is the buoyancy of the second hand market for oil rigs, which can
hardly be counted on. The shares, though, are hardly vulnerable given that
the likely halved dividend would still make them among the highest yielders
in the FT-SE.

FT  22 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: The true worth of dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2543.4 (-1.5)
Some anniversaries are best forgotten - but it is worth recalling that it
was just a year ago when M &amp; G's controversial strictures on UK dividend
policy were thudding on to boardroom desks. Mr Paddy Linaker, M &amp; G's boss,
insists it would have been tedious to repeat the message in his most recent
12 monthly missive to chairmen of companies in which his unit trust group
holds a significant stake. But it is perhaps appropriate that he has not. M
&amp; G's views may not have changed, but the fact that the only mention of
dividends this time round is to thank those who have maintained or increased
payouts in difficult times seems symbolic of a wider realism which has crept
into institutional thinking.
It would be wrong to conclude that the City is always more forgiving.
Trafalgar House and British Steel, whose share prices both fell 30 per cent
in the immediate wake of dividend warnings late last year, would presumably
testify to that. Companies, moreover, will no doubt do their damndest to
avoid an action which inevitably gets interpreted by investors as a lack of
confidence in the future and tends to invite the interest of unwanted
predators. Having said that, those boards now forced by recession and the
slowness of recovery to contemplate the previously unthinkable are more
likely to get a sympathetic reaction than they were a year ago.
This is long overdue. US academic research suggests the market value of a
company is not normally increased by a generous distribution policy.
Businesses, moreover, ought to be able to take advantage of the flexibility
of equity capital in a downturn and to adapt payouts to a new level which
looks sustainable over the medium term. Lonrho's results tomorrow may
provide an indication of boardroom thinking, but a clearer picture will not
emerge until the Spring when the likes of, say, Wimpey and Tarmac will be
sure to give a lead to the distressed contracting sector. There are bound to
be some nasty surprises - but with only seven FT-SE stocks yielding more
than 10 per cent the worst shocks could be among the second liners.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Bush plans freeze on new regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT George Bush plans a three-month freeze on new federal
regulations and a review of existing rules as part of an economic recovery
programme to be unveiled in his State of the Union address next week.
The proposed moratorium, a policy U-turn for Mr Bush, follows business
complaints at the growth of federal regulation during his presidency. The
freeze would cover most government agencies, including those responsible for
food, transport, the environment and communications.
During his three years in office, Mr Bush has presided over the broadest
extension of the federal government's regulatory reach since the second
Nixon administration of the early 1970s.
Working with the Democratic majority in Congress, Mr Bush signed the
800-page Clean Air Act in 1990, imposing a regulatory burden with an
estimated cost of up to Dollars 30bn (Pounds 16.7bn) a year for business.
The Americans with Disabilities Act, estimated to cost business up to
Dollars 2bn a year, also passed in 1990.
Mr Bush, who vowed in the 1988 presidential campaign to become the
'Environmental President', often promotes this domestic legislation to
counter criticism that he has spent too much energy on foreign policy.
But in recent months, as the US economy has failed to pull out of recession,
business leaders have lobbied the White House to scrap unnecessary rules and
lift the burden on business.
This has encouraged Vice-President Dan Quayle, who chairs the Council on
Competitiveness, to become more active in scrutinising regulations.
In addition, existing regulations - including those developed by the present
administration - would be looked at with a view to avoiding unnecessary
bureaucracy. However, major legislation such as the Clean Air Act was not
expected to be attacked, one administration official said yesterday.

Sir, Observer's suggestion ('Outside job', January 16) that the new British
Alcan Aluminium can recycling plant at Warrington is facing liquidation
because it cannot get enough cans is ludicrous.
This Pounds 28m investment is designed to meet Britain's aluminium can
recycling needs into the next century. It is certainly no secret that we
have always planned to import used drinks cans to feed the plant during its
first years while the collection infrastructure develops in the UK.
Every week we handle a greater volume of used drinks cans from the UK, as
more and more people learn that they can not only help the environment, but
also make money.
The only 'liquidator' at the Warrington plant is the man who operates the
melting furnaces.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Letter: Wilful limitation of expenditure hits a compelling
spending concept
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN STOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his excellent 'Economics Notebook' (January 20), Peter Norman
discusses the idea of boosting the economy via local authority spending. The
concept is compelling and yet, he tells us, a Treasury spokesman dismissed
the idea on the grounds that 'local authorities do little infrastructure
spending apart from housing'.
If that Treasury spokesman sent his children to a local school he would be
only too aware of an area of local authority infrastructure crying out for
more spending. As long ago as 1987, the Audit Commission estimated that
Pounds 2bn needed to be spent on school maintenance; a recent Labour Party
survey reckons that schools now need Pounds 3.3bn to put their buildings in
order.
In my children's school, the Victorian building has outdoor lavatories, no
damp-proof course and a heating system that needs constant attention. The
other half of the school has been housed in 'temporary buildings' for the
last 30 years. The local authority has no money to pay for the upgrading
that is needed and would no doubt welcome the release of some of the cash
that is 'slumbering in the banks'. A similar story could probably be told
for every education authority in the country. Will another generation of
schoolchildren have to make do, while the Treasury continues to limit
expenditure so wilfully?

FT  22 JAN 92 / Foreign Affairs: Democracy, not expediency - The reaction to
the Algiers coup could affect the west's credibility with developing
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Governments, like individuals, are frequently guilty of inconsistency and
double standards in their behaviour and moral attitudes. But today, when the
triumph of democracy over communist authoritarianism is being trumpeted
almost daily, the discreet official western reaction to recent developments
in Algeria is unfortunate.
The sigh of relief which went up from Washington and European capitals when,
following the resignation of President Chadli Bendjedid, the second round of
the Algerian elections was postponed indefinitely, was almost audible. The
fact that the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was thus deprived
of an almost certain victory, was clearly considered to be of much greater
importance than the unconstitutional manner in which the deed was done.
To deplore the absence of western condemnation of what was essentially a
military coup, does not mean that the fears of seeing an Islamic regime rule
a country on the threshold of Europe were unjustified. Judging by some of
the statements made by FIS leaders, it was entirely possible that, once in
government, the fundamentalists would have dispensed altogether with the
democratic system which had allowed them to come to power.
That, however, could not be considered a foregone conclusion. Algeria has a
strong presidential system, under which the directly elected head of state
has considerable leeway to thwart the designs of any government, unless
prevented from doing so by illegal means.
Infinitely more important as a reason for condemning the Algiers coup is
that the outcome of any genuinely democratic election should be accepted,
however unpalatable it might appear to those in power or interested third
parties. The failure on the part of western governments to take a clear
stand on the subject is not only a denial of their own oft-proclaimed
principles, but could have unfortunate consequences for the credibility of
their policies and relations with developing countries.
During the past two or three years, western donors have increasingly linked
their aid to political reform, in addition to economic adjustment programmes
in the recipient countries. In the past, strategic and ideological factors
such as the desire to halt the spread of communist influence in Africa, Asia
and the Middle East were the main political considerations in the use of
aid. But following the collapse of communism and the break-up of the Soviet
Union, the emphasis has switched to the promotion of 'good government',
including notably democratic political systems and the respect of human
rights.
These policies have been set out with commendable clarity by the main donor
governments. In a speech in June 1990, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, spelled out his government's policy in the following unambiguous
terms: 'Countries which tend towards pluralism, public accountability,
respect for the rule of law, human rights, market principles should be
encouraged. Governments which persist with repressive policies, corrupt
management, wasteful and discredited economic systems should not expect us
to support their folly with scarce aid resources which could be better used
elsewhere.'
French President Francois Mitterrand was equally outspoken when he addressed
a summit of francophone African heads of state at about the same time.
France would be less generous towards regimes which acted in an
authoritarian manner 'without accepting evolution towards democracy'.
Similar criteria for aid were laid down by both the US and Germany, while
Japan, the world's biggest aid donor, last year expressed its intention to
reduce foreign aid to those countries which spent too much on defence.
There are obvious economic motives: countries with democratic and free
market regimes are generally considered to manage their economies more
efficiently than centralised socialist systems, although the transition from
command and one-party systems is often long and painful.
But this has by no means been the only consideration. The new world order,
to the extent that it has been defined at all, assumes that international
co-operation will take place between free and open societies. If the
(English-speaking) Commonwealth made anything clear at its last heads of
government meeting in Harare in October last year, it was this essential
principle.
Moreover, aid recipients have been left in no doubt that western donors are
not just posturing. The linkage of aid to political reform in the former
Soviet Union and eastern Europe has been mirrored in policies concerning the
developing world, sub-Saharan Africa in particular. With some exceptions,
the donors have been prepared to 'punish' those that have failed to
liberalise their political regimes.
The US and the Scandinavian countries led the way in the case of Kenya by
adopting a tough position on human rights violations in that country and by
making it clear that they would suspend their aid in the absence of progress
towards more open and democratic government. The UK, for long a strong
supporter of Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi, followed suit somewhat
belatedly and, together with other donors, last November suspended all new
aid commitments. It had already cut off aid to the Sudan, Somalia and Burma
and suspended new aid to Ethiopia and Sri Lanka for similar reasons.
The French, too, have modified their traditional policy of providing
financial and military aid to their former colonies, regardless of the
iniquities perpetrated by their dictatorial regimes. Thus, France, as well
as Belgium, suspended their aid to Zaire following persistent human rights
abuses and the refusal of President Mobutu Sese Seko to introduce meaningful
political reforms. French troops are still sent periodically 'to protect'
French nationals during riots in countries such as Gabon and Zaire. But
'Paristroika', as it has been dubbed, has gone as far as depriving even
France's closest friend and ally in Africa, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny
of the Ivory Coast, of French military assistance when his position was
threatened by an army mutiny in May 1990.
The 'good government' policies adopted by the donor countries since the
beginning of 1990 would doubtless have remained a dead letter during the
Cold War, when recipients could play off the west against the Soviet Union.
But in the new international climate they have proved remarkably effective,
in spite of the persistent objections of countries such as India and
Malaysia that they are tantamount to an infringement of national
sovereignty. Deprived of alternative patrons and faced with the bankruptcy
of a communist system which served as the model for many regimes, an
increasing number of developing countries have begun to apply the new
political and economic norms.
The trend has been particularly marked in sub-Saharan Africa. Although many
authoritarian regimes remain in place, single-party systems are no longer in
favour. Long-standing African democracies such as Botswana, the Gambia,
Mauritius and Senegal have been joined by newly independent Namibia, Cape
Verde, Benin and Zambia, where the 'father of the nation', Mr Kenneth
Kaunda, was voted out of the presidential office he had held since the
country's independence. Even Mr arap Moi has finally committed himself to
multi-party elections, although no date has been set.
The west, which has enthusiastically supported these developments in
sub-Saharan Africa, should be equally firm in backing democratic change in
North Africa. As in Algeria, there is always a risk that the result of
democratic elections will be viewed as undesirable. But if political
expediency rather than democratic principle is to become the main criterion
for judging such polls, western nations will forfeit the growing support for
their 'good government' policies in the developing world.

<TEXT>
Sir, We welcome your support for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation into the electricity industry in your leading article,
'Competition in the electricity industry' (January 20). The recent critical
report by Offer following its investigation into prices in the pool
emphasised their 'artificiality' and confirmed that 'the dominant market
position of the two major generators gives them the ability to influence and
control pool prices'.
Although most consumers are on contracts, these are related to pool prices.
Contract price increases now having to be renegotiated indicate unacceptable
and unjustified rises, damaging to industrial consumers.
The regulator must now enforce changes in the price regulation formulae for
use of system charges. The pool rules for capacity payments must be
reviewed. Price discrimination which prevents large users from negotiating
appropriate prices to reflect large regular demand must be removed. Economic
justification for plant closures by the duopoly should be tested in the
market, by offering them for sale at site value to other interested
operators. Offer must be granted explicit powers to take action within the
pool, to regulate uncompetitive bidding behaviour by generators.
Unless these reforms and tougher regulation produce a more competitive
market, a recommendation by the MMC for a break-up of the duopoly becomes
inevitable.

The service's head Brigadier Eugenie Pollak says the weapons are purely for
self-defence. And although she knows of no occasion when one has been used
against an attacker, she can quote statistics to show that the pistols are
at least not proving a danger to the women soldiers themselves.
They have fired 81,000 shots in practice, without a single accident.

In the public relations trade, it is important to be seen to have access to
the people who matter. Hence the increasingly desperate backstage jostling
among the Tory party's rival image-makers.
Will Sir Tim Bell, Mrs Thatcher's favourite PR man, be brought in from the
cold and given a plum job on Prime Minister Major's team? How important is
it for Peter Gummer, brother of agriculture minister Selwyn, that the Tories
are re-elected with his own firm, Shandwick, visibly playing a key role? Can
Alan Parker, Sir Peter Parker's son, repeat his recent success in financial
PR, by helping Shaun Woodward, the Tory's young communications chief, win
the coming battle of the headlines? What role will Sir Gordon Reece, another
old faithful, play? There are some big reputations, even if not-so-big
businesses, at stake.
Imagine the panic in competing firms when The Mail on Sunday, normally well
plugged into Tory politics, reported that Bell will act as the prime
minister's personal public relations officer during the election campaign. A
short burst from Tory party Central Office shot down that idea . . . for the
moment.
John Major prefers a more collegiate approach than his predecessor took, say
his advisers. Hence the old connections no longer hold good. If true, this
is bad news for the influence-pedlars.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has been better at donating money, rather than its brightest civil
servants, to international organisations. So Kumiharu Shigehara's career as
the OECD's next chief economist will be watched with more than usual
interest.
The 52-year-old Bank of Japan official takes over from David Henderson, who
has been doing the job since 1984. Until now, heads of economics at the
Paris-based group have been either British, like Henderson, or north
Americans. But the Japanese now contribute 24 per cent of the organisation's
budget - a fraction less than the Americans  - and already one of the three
deputy secretary generals is Japanese.
Currently head of a BoJ think-tank called the Institute for Monetary and
Economic Studies, Shigehara has completed three tours of OECD duty, most
recently in 1987-89, when he was director of the policy studies branch.
A tall, donnish man, he is noted abroad for espousing a tough, autonomous
and not excessively pro-American monetary policy at the Bank of Japan. He
has frequently advocated greater deregulation for the Japanese economy and
insists that he will not change his tune in his new post - even on the
sensitive issue of liberalising the rice market.
Fluent in English, he is said to be typical of the new breed of assertive
and international-minded Japanese who are not afraid to speak their mind. In
which case, his appointment will be welcome.

What could be more important than listening to Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
governor of the Bank of England? Tonight's annual dinner of the Manchester
Merchant and International Bankers' Association, it seems.
I hear that there is an embarrassing clash between the timing of the
bankers' booze-up at the Midland Hotel, and the governor's speech at
Manchester Business School's celebrity seminar, a quarter of a mile away.
ABN-Amro Bank's Howard Middleton, chairman for the dinner, assures me that
his keener banker colleagues will be able to squeeze in both events.
However, the figures speak for themselves. There will be almost twice as
many people sitting down to dinner as listening to the governor.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Observer: Midnight in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Could it have been just in fun that a Russian late-night newscast heralded
the 68th anniversary of Lenin's death by announcing his body was to be
shifted from Moscow's Red Square mausoleum and buried, along with his
family, in St Petersburg?
If so, the joke was lost on about 100 old believers, who turned out at
midnight to guard the sarcophagus in temperatures of 25 below. Since
everything else had been taken from them, one sobbed, they would fight for
Lenin's right to lie in state forever.
Came the day, and a crowd of 2,000 in the Lenin Museum heard a succession of
neo-revolutionaries lambast falling living-standards, and moral decay. 'Not
hundreds, not thousands, but tens of thousands are demonstrating once more
under the red flag,' said Igor Malerov, who's reviving the Young Communist
League.
Up at the tomb, its two white-faced guards looked on frigidly as a few
hundred milled about with red banners proclaiming 'the ideas of Lenin will
revive'. But it was an old woman who somewhat stole the show before the TV
cameras.
Asked by the interviewer for her opinion of the historic leader, she
replied: 'Lenin? Who cares about Lenin? I'm not getting my pension.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Window of opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING WON a decisive victory in the cold war, the western powers seem
determined to lose the peace. Instead of co-operating, they indulge in
bitter conflicts over trade policy. Instead of exploiting a once in a
generation opportunity for reconstruction of the erstwhile Soviet Union,
they procrastinate. The west can, and should, do better. Today's meeting in
Washington on humanitarian aid for the states of the former Soviet Union and
this weekend's meeting of the group of seven leading industrial countries in
New York are where to start.
Mr Mikhail Gorbachev left behind a country reduced to social, political and
economic rubble. This may have been necessary if reform were ever to be
attempted. But the long-predicted hyperinflationary collapse is now under
way. The resultant crisis has given democratic reformers an opportunity, but
no more than a brief one. Should they fail, far uglier forces lie in wait.
This thought alone should goad the west into action. It is not merely that a
stable, democratic and market-oriented Commonwealth of Independent States is
devoutly to be wished. It is that the alternative is horrible. The west must
help give both the citizens and the armed forces a stake in the future.
Otherwise, it might find itself confronting nuclear-armed conflict within
and uncontrolled nuclear proliferation without.
Freeing prices
True, the government installed by Mr Boris Yeltsin is open to criticism for
its headlong rush to price liberalisation, especially when it controlled
neither the Russian central bank nor the budget. But it had to start
somewhere. Price liberalisation has at least broken the log jam, just as it
did in Poland in the summer of 1989. But, unlike in Poland, there is no
Solidarity government waiting in the wings. The reforming government is the
one now in office. The west should help make its reform work rather than
carp at its incompleteness.
Set against that objective, the agenda of the conference in Washington is
too limited. Humanitarian assistance is necessary, but is not sufficient.
Experience in eastern Europe shows that stabilisation and price
liberalisation can fill the shops with food. But pouring food aid onto a
hyperinflation is like emptying a bucket of water onto a desert.
Radical reform
What is needed is a sufficiently radical reform to shift the economy from a
collapsed centrally planned economy into a market economy, however halting
and infirm. The main elements of such a minimum bang are price
liberalisation, monetary and fiscal stabilisation and privatisation.
The request for western aid to help stabilise the rouble must be granted not
several months from now, when membership of the International Monetary Fund
has been agreed, but now. Equally important will be technical assistance for
the energy sector, food distribution and the creation of workable fiscal and
monetary systems. Meanwhile, Russia and the other leading successor states
must move to privatise retail and wholesale trade, transport and agriculture
as quickly as possible.
None of this is fundamentally different from what has been needed in eastern
and central Europe. But in the case of the former Soviet Union, its huge,
impoverished and embittered armed forces justify an exceptional form of
assistance: direct budgetary support. While the economy is being stabilised
and a new fiscal system put in place, the west should meet a substantial
part of the budgetary costs of the armed forces. It can kill two birds with
one stone by demanding radical nuclear disarmament in return.
The most powerful criticism of generous government-to-government aid is that
it strengthens the state against the people. For once that is its
justification. The reforming governments need to be strengthened above all
against a reactionary bureaucratic and military class.
At last the west has real reformers to help. So if the G7 does not decide
this weekend to substitute decisive action for vague words of support, it
will deserve to be renamed the seven dwarfs.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Sir, your plan will not work: Advice for the French
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The following letter has come into our possession. It is addressed to Mr
Jean Syrota, the man charged with merging the civil electronics and nuclear
activities of Thomson, the French state-owned electronics group, with
CEA-Industrie, the state-owned nuclear plant and fuel business. The sender
appears to be an executive in a large investment bank and the letter
concerns the new group, to be called Thomson-CEA-Industrie (TCI).
Dear Mr Syrota, I was honoured to receive your request to seek private
corporate investors in the government's latest industrial policy initiative.
My bank has never been asked to advise on a proposal of such international
importance.
So it is with great reluctance that my directors have decided that we are
unable to attach the bank's name to the project on the ground that we could
not, in honesty, advise private-sector contacts to invest in it.
Sadly, the plan as presented to us falls down on just about every count we
can think of.
First, financial. Our analysts are disturbed by the many years of losses
they see at Thomson's consumer electronics and semiconductor units.
They believe Thomson Consumer Electronics faces continuing huge investments
in a high-definition television, based on a technical standard that is by no
means guaranteed to win wide acceptance. Then there is the disadvantage of
being a high-cost producer in an industry dominated by low-cost suppliers.
As for the semiconductor unit - SGS-Thomson - we accept that your Italian
government partner in the project might help bail it out temporarily. But we
cannot easily measure the unit's continuing huge needs for cash in this
fast-moving and capital-intensive business; nor do we see any guarantee that
SGS-Thomson will achieve the market share needed to ensure long-term
survival.
The upshot of all this is that the cash earners in TCI - nuclear plant and
fuel, and the sale of nuclear-related technology - could at worst see their
resources eaten away by the parts of Thomson they are destined to inherit.
We hear that there might be some limit or even a ban on Thomson's use of the
nuclear business' cash reserves. Even so, we could more easily attract
investment for them if they had no connection with Thomson's civil
electronics activities.
In other words, reshuffling the cards in this way does not improve the
public sector's nuclear and electronics hand, and might even make it worse.
Second, management. We liked the parts of the original version of the plan,
promoted by Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the industry minister, whereby
Thomson would take over CEA-Industrie. Thomson has professional, dynamic
managers, who might be able to teach the academics at CEA-Industry a trick
or two.
Yet the final version of the plan is the other way round, with parts of
Thomson to become subsidiaries of CEA-Industrie. Where is the sense?
Third, political risk. We are unsure that future French governments will
continue to support this idea. We admire the courage of Mrs Edith Cresson,
the prime minister, but fear she could lose her job at any moment, possibly
leaving investors high and dry.
Fourth, feasibility. Perhaps cynically, some of our analysts argue that no
sane private investor in charge of these same state-owned businesses would
ever come up with a plan quite like this. Neither would they invest more
money in it, as I believe the French government is planning to do.
We remind you that the question of whether the state is behaving like a
rational private investor is the test used by the European Commission to
decide whether or not a government industrial investment contravenes EC
state aid rules.
Let us assume, however, that we can persuade a private investor to accept
the risks. This might encourage the Commission to clear the project on the
grounds that it had attracted private money.
Yet that leads to a wider problem. The plan appears to be based on a
Colbertist idea of the state's responsibility to direct important
industries. If this worked in the 18th century, it was because the companies
created were supported by guaranteed state orders and protected from
international competition by high import tariffs. Our legal advisers fear
that current international trade law makes it nearly impossible to achieve
either of those conditions.
That concludes our view of the project. May I be so bold as to suggest an
alternative?
Your government's interests as a shareholder in these companies would be
best served by starving Thomson's consumer electronics and chip businesses
of capital - not by investing in them. We suggest you employ us to sell some
of Thomson's best consumer brand names, like Telefunken and Ferguson,
ideally to Japanese groups which would welcome a European identity and could
make them profitable.
In your position, we would use the funds from these asset sales to invest in
the profitable businesses remaining, such as Thomson-CSF in defence
electronics and Cogema in nuclear fuel. Forget the reshuffle and leave them
as they are, as separate holdings in your government's portfolio, so that
they can go on concentrating on what they do best.
We look forward to hearing from you . . .
At this point the text has been torn.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Master fixer: Egon Klepsch, the European Parliament's newly
elected president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Parliament today is far in distance, time and nature from
Chicago of the 1960s. But it has just gained in Mr Egon Klepsch, an
avuncular German Christian Democrat, a president whose skill in political
fixing rivals that of the late Richard Daley, legendary boss of the mid-west
city. A Daleyesque talent for exercising power may be just what the European
Community's chaotic transnational parliament now needs.
This nomadic circus of a legislature - rotating between Strasbourg (plenary
sessions), Brussels (committee meetings) and Luxembourg (staff base) - has
barely organised itself properly to use the powers awarded to it by the 1986
Single European Act, let alone what it will get once the Maastricht
agreement is ratified and implemented.
The keynote of Mr Klepsch's inaugural appeal to fellow MEPs last week was,
therefore, no surprise. 'Let us do our utmost, acting resolutely,
responsibly and effectively and in a way which is comprehensible to the
people of Europe, to make use of the powers which the Parliament has just
acquired (at Maastricht),' he said.
These powers, bestowed from above rather than earned from below, now give
the Parliament a chance to disprove the quip so often made of it - that
powerlessness corrupts, and absolute powerlessness corrupts absolutely.
Once the Parliament gets its act together, 'then we will be able to address
directly to the citizens of Europe, who will no longer accuse us of
gobbledygook,' says Mr Klepsch.
For all their whispering in the Strasbourg corridors about underhand methods
and tainted tactics used by Mr Klepsch in his climb to the top, most MEPs
heartily welcome his interest in internal reform. It is better, the majority
say, to have a parliamentary professional, warts and all, at the rostrum
than an inefficient amateur like his Spanish socialist predecessor, Mr
Enrique Baron.
It is also appropriate that the Parliament's new president should have a
direct line to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who strove mightily last year to get
his fellow EC leaders to accept more powers for the Strasbourg assembly. Mr
Klepsch and Mr Kohl go back to the mid-1950s when they both cut their
political teeth in the Rhineland-Palatinate.
It will certainly do the Parliament no harm for it to be led into budgetary
or legislative battle with the other EC institutions by a close ally of
Europe's most powerful leader.
Mr Klepsch has won himself brownie points in Bonn by taking the lead in
proposing 18 extra MEPs for the newly enlarged Germany. The Maastricht
summit only agreed to study extra representation for Germany, because France
bridled at the notion of losing its treasured political parity with Germany.
'But I am sure we will get the extra MEPs,' he says.
Winning extra seats for Germany is a natural goal for Mr Klepsch, who
escaped from East Germany as a 20-year-old in 1950. He came up the hard way,
supporting himself through the university of Marburg as a part-time packer
of washing machines and carpenter.
And he has been nailing deals together ever since, first in the Bundestag
and since 1973 in the European Parliament.
Amid MEPs' mutterings about sharp practice, only one firm charge has ever
been made, and admitted. This was when in 1981 he was spotted pushing the
voting button of a fellow Christian Democrat as well as his own. Mr Klepsch
says he was only doing what was common at the time, and that he has never
done it since. When he was asked at his first presidential press conference
about the 1981 incident, he told reporters: 'This exercises you more than I
intend to be exercised by it.'
Mr Klepsch has that fortunate combination for a politician - a thick skin
and sensitive political antennae, tuned to the first hint of revolt or
discontent.
There has always been some of that. It is an open secret that he does not
get on well with Mr Leo Tindemans, the former Belgian prime minister, who
last week succeeded Mr Klepsch as leader of the 128-strong Christian
Democrat group in Strasbourg.
His unrivalled knowledge of what transpires within the Parliament is due in
part to the fact that he knows everyone - even the doormen - and in part to
the fact that even his spare time is spent playing skat, a popular German
card game, with fellow Christian Democrat deputies, and discussing politics.
Consensus politics is far from being a dirty word for Mr Klepsch. 'We are in
fact condemned to practising consensus politics,' he says.
This is because of the requirement that the Parliament muster 260 votes, or
an absolute majority of its 518 members, to exercise any of the important
law-amending or treaty-approving powers that it got under the Single
European Act or will get under the Maastricht treaty.
No EC country imposes such a voting threshold on its legislature (except in
revising constitutions). But EC governments have imposed it on Strasbourg to
test the seriousness of a Parliament that none of them totally trust.
Mr Klepsch does not quarrel with this. Indeed he says it is essential
'because we are legislating for 12 different countries' with very different
political strands in them. We need to find solutions to fit the bill for the
whole Community,' he says.
What Strasbourg-style consensus means in practice is constant deal-making
between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the largest group with
180 MEPs. This worked smoothly through much of the 1980s when there was
another German, Mr Rudi Arndt, in charge of the Socialists.
It is less smooth-running now, with the more acerbic Mr Jean-Pierre Cot
leading a Socialist group that now contains as its largest national
contingent 45 UK Labour MEPs, for whom there is something unholy about
cosying up to a Christian Democrat group that is considering taking in the
British Tories.
But as their price for backing - or at least not opposing - Mr Klepsch for
the presidency, the Socialists last week secured most of the key committee
chairmanships. This includes a new foreign affairs committee to be presided
over, rather aptly, by Mr Baron, who was criticised widely during his
presidential term for spending too much time posturing on the international
stage.
Another fruit of this Christian Democrat-Socialist compact was last week's
rule changes. These were essentially aimed at preventing plenary sessions
being cluttered up with endless amendments. Up to now, during the weekly
plenary session each month MEPs have spent some seven to eight hours merely
voting on - not even debating - about 1,000 amendments. The main change
makes it harder for an amendment, lost in committee, to be re-presented in
the plenary.
'We must deal with technicalities in committee, and keep the plenaries for
debating the big issues that people care about,' Mr Klepsch says.
Once Maastricht comes into effect, the Parliament will have a real say on
almost all of the big issues confronting the EC. Mr Klepsch particularly
prizes the expanded treaty-vetting power of the Parliament, which goes
beyond the rights of most national EC legislatures and matches that of the
US Senate.
Will that make the European Parliament the difficult international partner
that the US Senate has often been? (MEPs, for instance, last week voted down
aid packages for Morocco and Syria, on human rights grounds.)
No, says Mr Klepsch. 'If the Council and Commission take us seriously and
provide full information, we will behave seriously.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / Arts: Hamlet - Oxford Playhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Theatr Clwyd's colourful, energetic and uneven Hamlet is the company's first
British touring production of this scale and scope (Glasgow, Blackpool,
Oxford, Chichester, Brighton), and one of its five shows now on tour. It is
worth seeing for Geraint Wyn Davies' Hamlet, but the rest of Toby
Robertson's production drains one's patience.
The plain set, bronze panels bearing latin inscriptions and funeral/marriage
flowers, opens onto a glass that holds the mirror up to nature; for the most
part, the action is uncluttered. However, the costumes are a visual
distraction. They turn the Danish court into an apres-ski theme party, all
lycra, leather and velvet in ocres and reds. The contrast with Hamlet's
black 'suits of woe' is the evening's best visual thrill. White masks are
painted on the faces of the courtiers, signifying complicity (Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern arrive barefaced, and end up white); when Hamlet feigns
madness, he opts for white stripes.
The acting is patchy. The tense opening scene so much praised by Coleridge
is dissipated by over-emphasis: intensity is not conveyed only by panic. The
Ghost (Robert Arnold) has strayed in from a Las Vegas revue trailing plumes,
shimmer and smoke; only when he speaks does the seriousness emerge. The same
actor plays Polonius as by turns silly and wise, flapping like a winged
plover. Horatio (Howard Antony) is dependable but ponderous, well short of
even having a philosophy, let alone one with dreams.
The King (David Keller) is a horror of jollity, both spiteful and vicious.
Martin Mckellan, successfully cast as Gertrude, maintains a chilly distance
from Hamlet, and adds a new strangeness to the play; but Ophelia (Sonia
Forbes Adam) seems slight. Perhaps an all-male casting policy would have
been more rigorous. The Cheek By Jowl Company's As You Like It recently
showed how good an all-male Shakespeare could be, if a director takes that
option.
The production's shortcomings are redeemed by Geraint Wyn Davies' Hamlet. He
plays him as a sane, intelligent, depressive overwhelmed by events and
facing difficulties as if for the first time: 'Oh what a rogue and peasant
slave am I' treads an exact line between the depressive's self-distraction
and the need to get things done. 'To be, or not to be' (spoken as Davies
bounds on stage) comes as a revelation, the discovery of a way out; and 'Get
thee to a nunnery' finds a cool, level hate for Ophelia. Elsewhere, Davies
is exact, losing the power of action in the energy of resolve.
This Hamlet, at just over three hours, has been cut for action; but the
point of Shakespeare's play (his longest) is in its digressions. Robertson's
cuts, particularly in Horatio's lines, make the play less lyrical, eschewing
the compensations of reflection: out go Horatio's haunting lines abut the
dawn together with his final catalogue of accidental murders and casual
slaughters; the tragedy earns these insights, and a traditional performance
like this one is incomplete without them. The ending lacks an ending.
(Oxford until January 25, then Chichester Festival Theatre, January 27 -
February 1; Brighton Theatre Royal, February 3 - 8.)

BBC2's series of programmes offering personal views of history, The Day The
World Changed (8.00), is presented today by Scottish poet Liz Lochead who
chooses February 8 1587, the day Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded. This,
according to Lochead, marked the start of a love-hate relationship between
England and Scotland. For an Englishman the odd thing about this is that
only the Scots seem to be aware of it ..or perhaps 'obsessed by' is better
than 'aware of'.
Western broadcasters have latched on rapidly to the fact they can now make
documentary programmes in the old Warsaw Pact countries and that recent
history is providing a visually dramatic underclass: prostitutes, black
marketeers, and in tonight's Dispatches, thousands of children living on the
streets of St Petersburg (9.00 C4). The second episode of BBC1's biography
of Churchill moves to the period for which he is most famous: World War 2
when, having apparently run his course as a politician, he suddenly turned
out to be the needed inspirational national leader (9.30 BBC1). If you
missed C4's sitcom about a TV newsroom, Drop The Dead Donkey, first time
round, watch now (11.00).

FT  22 JAN 92 / Jobs: Optimistic in spite of worst year on record - Sign
that recovery in UK demand for executives is already under way backstage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHEN I am dead and opened, you shall find ' Calais ' lying in my heart,'
lamented Queen Mary Tudor over a slip-up in her foreign policy. And the Jobs
column fully sympathises, having cause to feel in much the same way.
In my case, however, the phrase the autopsy will show engraved inside the
pericardium is 'July 1991' - the date when I ventured a rare prediction
about movements in the United Kingdom's executive-jobs market. In doing so,
I took exception to the forebodings of the MSL International consultancy's
market-watchers that last year would end as the worst ever known for
advertised demand, at least.
A pox on such jeremiads, quoth I. For one thing, they failed to recognise
that demand over the 12 months to June 30, although weak, had still been a
good deal better than over the corresponding months of the recession of
1980-81. For another, there were various signs that the market would turn up
in the later months of 1991.
How far I went astray may be seen from the table alongside, compiled as
always from MSL's quarterly counts of job-openings for managers and
upper-ranked specialists advertised in leading UK journals. Each opening, by
the way, is counted as one no matter how many times the ad for it appears.
The upper part of the table gives the calendar-year tallies from 1987 to
1991 for eight broad types of higher-ranked work. The last of them is a
catch-all 'others' category including such people as buyers, economists,
company legal staff and assorted consultants. Then comes the annual total
for all types of executives, followed by the quarterly counts making it up.
What they reveal of course is that far from turning up in the later months
of last year, the advertised demand went on falling. Moreover, while the
table doesn't show it, both July-September and October-December 1991
produced the lowest quarterly counts I have on record, with the result that
the year bore out MSL's forebodings. The total of 16,024 was 14.7 per cent
down on the previous lowest for a calendar year: 18,795 in 1981.
Which means that, for every 1,000 executive posts advertised a decade
before, 1991 had only 853. The following list shows which sorts of work, and
which quarters, account for the difference between those two figures.
So the overall loss, worst in the sales area, hides gains in general
management and 'others'. And the general decline accelerated sharply from
quarter to quarter.
That steepening of the drop is emphasised in the comparison because, whereas
last year the advertised demand kept on falling, in 1991 the final months
saw it starting the rebound that continued until late 1985. Which prompts
the question - important not least to Britain's politicians - whether a
similarly blessed upturn is likely before general election time.
Well, despite the fate of my forecast in July, I suspect that the answer is
yes. But my optimism is based less on the advertised market than on events
in other branches of executive-recruitment.
One is of course headhunting by the personal-approach methods of
executive-search where, according to the InterMex consultancy's soundings,
1991 produced a 4 per cent rise in demand over 1990. Even so, I am not
banking my hopes on search which, sensibly or otherwise, tends to be used to
fill the top paid posts and so to concentrate on the relatively small market
niche of general management.
The optimism springs rather from another branch. It consists of recruiters
who keep large databases of job-seekers in broad fields such as accounting
and sales, and put employers in touch with suitable candidates on their
register. While the database branch has been hit by the recession, it has
suffered less badly than advertised recruitment, which is inevitably more
costly.
It seems that, with redundancies throwing large numbers of upper rankers
onto the market, a good many employers have turned to the less expensive
alternative in the belief that the registers will contain enough good
candidates to meet their needs. In which case, it is reasonable to suppose
any upturn from the latest depths will make its first appearance backstage,
in the database branch.
The good news is that one of its members, the Michael Page Group, reports
that recovery is already evident in one field at least. It is sales and
marketing, in which group director David Bodmer says Page has more job
openings on its books than at any time since July 1990, and which
historically has tended to be a lead indicator of movements in demand as a
whole.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Advice to turn a director
green - Why companies are setting up panels to assess environmental
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Environmental advisory boards, sometimes called panels or councils, are
becoming an increasingly popular way for business to tap into environmental
expertise and keep up with trends. Advisory boards are designed to be
independent and are composed of company outsiders, such as academics and
luminaries.
Last year US-based multinational Dow Chemical set up what it calls a
Corporate Environmental Advisory Council which will eventually consist of up
to 14 members from around the world. It will meet three or four times a
year.
'We recognise that the public has a right to know what we are doing and a
right to contribute to our decisions-making process,' said Frank Popoff,
Dow's president and CEO at the council's launch.
Waste Management, another US-based company which operates in 14 countries,
is establishing a similar but smaller board of up to seven members. 'It's
going to make some folks in the company uneasy, but we have to look at
ourselves in the mirror. It would be arrogant to say that we have all the
answers. We have to listen to the panel,' says David Stringham, director of
government affairs for Waste Management Europe.
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the UK based waste-management and incinerator operator, has
been advised by an environmental board since 1989. The board is an integral
component of the group's environmental policy and acts, together with a
formal quality assurance scheme, as a check on the company's environmental
performance.
'An environmental policy is just a page of nonsense unless you have a
management structure that makes it work,' says Roger Hewitt, Shanks's chief
executive.
Financial institutions which offer environmentally-screened investments use
boards - usually called screening committees - to vet their investment
decisions and to lend credibility to the scheme. The TSB, for example, has a
committee chaired by David Bellamy, the botanist and TV celebrity.
Consumer panels are another variation on advisory boards. These are usually
groups of people representing a cross-section of a company's customers. BT,
the UK's main telephone company, runs three specialist panels, including one
on environmental issues.
'The panel enables us to look outwards - to test our policies against
outside views,' says Jan Walsh, manager of BT's corporate customer
relations.
Companies usually use consultants to help choose board members and then to
set up and sometimes run the advisory board's affairs. Shanks's board was
established with the help of Pamela Shimell, managing director of
London-based Industry and Environment Associates.
The cost of setting up the board and then servicing it is composed mainly of
the time and effort expended by management. To ensure independence board
members are usually paid only a small fee and sometimes just get expenses.
To guarantee their independence some experts, like Tim O'Riordan, professor
of environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia and a member of
Dow's council, refuse any form of payment.
Hewitt says the total cost of Shanks's board (including administration and
company time) is only about Pounds 100,000 a year, which he considers to be
good value. 'We pay each member a pretty poor fee compared with
non-executive directors.'
However, Stringham of Waste Management says top people should be properly
paid for their time. 'Top-notch people do not come cheap and we are talking
well into six figures to set up our environmental board.'
Shimell says paying board members does not necessarily lead to compromise.
'If you choose people of a high enough calibre then they would not be
compromised by being paid. They would prefer to resign.'
The effectiveness of boards appears to hinge on two factors. First, the
quality and independence of the people who serve on them. And second, the
willingness of the company to establish a structure which encourages frank
and timely discussion.
This is because the company is very much in charge of the board. It not only
chooses the members and sometimes pays them, but it also often sets the
agenda for meetings and controls the information needed by the board. It
usually acts as the board's secretariat too.
Unless the company is fully committed to its advisory board and is willing
to listen to unpalatable advice, the board's work can be obstructed easily.
This could be done by, say, being slow to produce information. Because there
is a long gap between board meetings - usually held quarterly - delays in
getting timely information can seriously reduce the board's effectiveness.
There might be some exceptions, but most companies see their advisory boards
neither as watchdogs nor as ombudsmen. The businesses want to be kept
abreast of environmental issues so that they can plan for shifts in the
market. And some companies, such as Shanks, want the board merely to comment
on main board decisions.
Although some companies say they use their boards to help formulate
strategy, they only mean this in the most abstract sense. Hewitt, for
example, sees no role for the advisory board in helping to decide company
strategy. When Shanks recently bought Rechem, the high-temperature
incinerator operator, the board was only told after the event.
'We cannot make an external body party to price-sensitive information. We
cannot discuss general or specific strategy with them because it would turn
outsiders into insiders,' says Hewitt.
Enhancing public image is another benefit of advisory boards - the company
is seen to be taking its environmental performance seriously. But this can
also work against the company if disgruntled board members choose to talk to
the press and analysts. Resignations, for example, can be viewed as a
symptom of problems within the company. This underlines the need for the
company to make the public understand the role of the board.
When Shanks took over Rechem some observers were surprised that the board
was not consulted on the move. 'There has been no difficulty in our
relationship with the company, although in the public perception there might
have been,' says Lord Cranbrook, who chairs the Shanks advisory board.
Companies also have to be seen to be taking their advisory boards seriously.
This involves giving the board the necessary resources, say to investigate
practices in other countries, rotating members to ensure freshness and
responding to advice.
Taking advice is particularly important. Besides the usual commercial
reasons, such as networking and ensuring that their own interests are
promoted, many environmentalists are keen to influence business decisions.
O'Riordan says there is a convergence of interest between governments, which
are trying to formulate policies to protect the environment, and companies
wanting to reduce their environmental impact. 'I see this as a significant
development. We have to move into an era where relationships between
government and big business is complementary. The secrecy has to go,' he
says.
Lord Cranbrook is pleased with the achievements of the Shanks's board. 'I
genuinely believe that some of the things we have suggested have caused a
change of view in the company.'
He says the board meetings also have to be fun. The Shanks board, for
example, meets every quarter, usually for two days. The members have dinner
and are then addressed on a 'waste-related topic'. The board also visits a
company site, such as a landfill operation.
'We have had an astonishing rate of attendance,' says Lord Cranbrook, who
obviously has the midas touch when it comes to making waste fun.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Management: Priestess of the black art - Ellen Hancock, the
most senior female executive at IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not be lulled by the open, pleasant manner and quiet tone of voice.
Nobody reaches the upper echelons of management within International
Business Machines without both talent and determination and Ellen Hancock,
IBM's most senior woman executive seems to have both.
She listens to questions with intense concentration and replies with short
bursts of information, reminiscent of the data communications systems in
which she is an expert.
She has a technician's attention to detail. She laughs easily but without
frivolity; her staff have a healthy respect for the acid side of her tongue:
'A confrontation with Ellen on a bad day is like running into a bandsaw', a
former colleague winced.
Hancock, still on the right side of 50, is now a corporate vice-president
and general manager of IBM's networking systems division, an area which
remains a black art to outsiders - even to those in the computer business.
But it is a position that puts her, theoretically at least, within reach of
the top job in the corporation.
That makes her one of most senior women in world business, perhaps the most
senior. How much higher can she go? These days, the question is given added
pique by the commercial pressures with which IBM is struggling. All IBM's
top managers have been warned by chairman John Akers that their progress
depends on the performance of their divisions.
Hancock's progress through IBM's multi-layered, overweight bureaucracy of
the 1970s and 1980s was swift by any measure. She has both technical ability
 -unusual among IBM's top executives, most of whom are promoted from the
sales side - coupled with sound managerial ability. She has had powerful
sponsors throughout her career, including Jack Kuehler, IBM president and
the company's most senior technical specialist.
Michael Killen, author of a controversial book on IBM's software strategy
concludes that Hancock is 'no paper-pushing, know-nothing administrator. On
the contrary, she is a technical giant in what is still a highly technical,
male world.
Whether she can reach the pinnacle of management achievement at IBM,
chairmanship of the Dollars 69bn (Pounds 38.5bn) revenues, 350,000 people
company, depends on a complex set of factors which go beyond compecommon to
success in most companies, but also age. IBM's top brass retires by
convention at 60; potential chairmen have to be in pole position by their
early 50s.
Is it a pinnacle to which, in any case, she aspires? 'That is a job I have
an ambition to do. Whether or not that is a reasonable ambition is a
different discussion,' she says lightly.
If realised, it would score two remarkable firsts - she would be the first
technologist to lead IBM and the first woman head of a leading multinational
corporation. To be realistic, there are other candidates among IBM's top
managers whose claims to succeed John Akers are as good and better than
Ellen Hancock's; but as one observer pointed out, if any large company were
to appoint a woman chairman, it would be IBM in pursuit of its commitment to
equal opportunities.
Hancock pays tribute to IBM's endeavours on behalf of its women employees:
'For years IBM very deliberately worked to make sure that women can get
ahead in the business and have encouraged it. As I moved through my career,
there were times when I felt I was ready for the next move and other times
when the company said 'Why don't we push her a bit'. The company worked very
hard to get several of us into that position. Now there are women first and
second line managers and divisional presidents and vice-presidents ready to
move into senior'.
Ellen Hancock joined IBM in 1966 with a master's degree in mathematics, but
no computer knowledge, and learned programming in the company's Armonk, New
York, headquarters.
Unconventionally, for somebody destined for the fast track, she spent the
next decade in a variety of technically-orientated jobs, including systems
engineer looking after customers in the brokerage industry. She felt at the
time that she was not ready for management and was happier with technical
issues.
In 1977, however, Hancock accepted a job as a first line manager - the
lowest form of managerial life within IBM - in the company's Kingston, New
York offices. She moved swiftly to third line manager in Charlotte, North
Carolina, to extend her experience of IBM's financial hardware.
A series of increasingly senior appointments followed and she became a
corporate vice-president in 1985; from first line manager to vice-president
in eight years more than compensated for her slow start.
She was named general manager, communications systems, in 1988, the first
woman to head an IBM 'line of business (LOB)' - LOB is IBM-speak for a
product division covering everything from product design to manufacturing.
In another first, the LOB was relocated from New York to Staines, just
outside London, in the middle of last year, the first time a product
division has been run from outside the US.
One aim is to bring IBM and its networking customers in closer contact, but
location does not actually matter all that much because Hancock travels and
works incessantly. Her staff are used to receiving electronic mail messages
at all hours from wherever she happens to have laid hands on a computer
terminal.
She accepts that her technical expertise lies in a little understood area -
but argues that executives should understand the importance of networking to
their business. 'If they have a business, the odds are their business needs
some form of networking - most businesses need to communicate in some way
with other businesses and with their employees.
'I would not expect a business executive to be interested in some of the
things I like working on - like the question of TCP/IP versus OSI. But I
would expect, if they intend to keep their company in a leadership position,
that they should understand how they are utilising networking to get
information, to keep their employees up to speed and to understand what is
happening in the market'.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Pouring salt on wounded roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Snow and ice are only part of the nuisance of a northern winter. Equally
annoying are the vast quantities of salt spread on roads, pavements and
driveways after every fresh snowfall.
Local authorities in the northern US alone apply about 10m tonnes of rock
salt to roads each winter. The Canadian province of Ontario uses 1.2m tonnes
a year.
But keeping the arteries of commerce open comes with a heavy price. The
smell and taste of salt hangs in the air for days after it has been applied.
It penetrates coats and gloves. Salt even spoils a dog's winter walks by
getting into its paw pads.
More serious are the enormous financial costs caused by salt corrosion.
Ontario's ministry of transportation estimates that environmental damage
caused by salt adds up to between 10 and 20 times the cost of the salt
itself.
A committee of the US Transportation Research Board (a division of the
Washington-based National Research Coun-cil) concluded in a report published
last week that the motor industry spends Dollars 1.9bn-Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds
1bn-Pounds 1.6bn) a year on corrosion-resistant materials and coatings for
trucks and cars.
Repairs to rusted bridges and parking garages in the US Northeast and
Midwest are estimated at Dollars 200m-Dollars 500m a year. The study notes
that over the past 30 years 'road salt has caused more premature bridge deck
deterioration than any other factor'.
Much of the damage caused by salt is not easily quantifiable. Road
maintenance agencies blame salt for stunted growth, falling leaves and
needles and sometimes dying limbs in about 5-10 per cent of roadside trees.
Local governments in the US spend about Dollars 10m a year to keep salt out
of drinking water. Despite the damage, no acceptable alternative to salt has
yet been found.
Many airports, concerned about the corrosive effects of chloride-based
de-icers on aircraft fuselages, use urea to keep their runways clear. But
urea costs about 10 times as much as salt, leaves a slippery film and is not
effective in very cold temperatures.
Many municipalities have tried sand, which is an abrasive rather than a
de-icer. According to Max Perchanok, a scientist with the Ontario ministry
of transportation: 'Sand is OK - if you're prepared to drive at 50 km per
hour over a bumpy surface.'
Salt's most recent challenger is calcium magnesium acetate (CMA), a compound
produced by a reaction between dolomitic lime and acetic acid. Less
corrosive and less damaging than salt to the environment, CMA comes closer
than most materials to matching salt's de-icing power. But it costs 20 times
more than salt, and needs to be applied in greater quantities to be
effective.
The National Research Council study concludes that: 'The use of CMA as a
more general replacement for sale is unlikely and unwarranted . . . In all
likelihood, sodium chloride, or common salt, will continue to be the
predominant highway de-icer for many years.'
The best hope for those worried about the damage caused by salt may be the
current squeeze on local authorities' budgets. Several cities are cutting
back on the quantity of salt spread on roads after a snowfall.
Toronto's public works department has cut its salt use by more than half so
far this winter, even though the city has had 12 cm more snow than last
year.
Public works commissioner Nick Vardin says that instead of ordering salting
trucks to go out when the snow starts, he now makes more use of snow
ploughs.
Furthermore, the trucks now leave many stretches of road unsalted,
concentrating on the parts where salt is most needed, such as highways, busy
intersections and the streets outside schools. 'I haven't had any
complaints,' Vardin says.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM scorns agreement call over N
Ireland - Electoral Pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major fuelled speculation yesterday that he was contemplating a deal
with Ulster Unionist MPs in a hung parliament when he scorned calls for a
pact among the main parties on not changing the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
Labour and Liberal Democrats expressed fears that the prime minister was
prepared to jeopardise progress the government had made towards a political
settlement in the province.
Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said the prime
minister was 'undermining' the work of Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland
secretary, over the past two years.
The prime minister was 'playing political football' with the lives of people
in the province, he said.
Nevertheless, Downing Street officials rejected such an interpretation of
the prime minister's comments, while Tories and the Unionist party have
denied that any discussions have taken place.
The row came a day after Mr Brooke offered his resignation for singing on an
Irish television show a few hours after an IRA bomb attack in Country Tyrone
last Friday. The death yesterday of another man injured in the blast brought
total fatalities to eight.
Mr Gay Byrne, the show's host, expressed regret for the trouble he caused Mr
Brooke.
Mr Major was asked by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, if he would
support a 'a cross-party approach to Northern Ireland affairs during the
election and unequivocally reject any partisan trading with the Anglo-Irish
Agreement'.
Liberal Democrats, many of whom believe a hung parliament the most likely
outcome of the contest, want to force the other main parties to set out more
clearly what post-election deals they might contemplate.
Mr Major's reply did not mention the agreement and said only: 'This party
stands four-square against terrorism and we have set out our policies
clearly . . . on many occasions. I do not see any imminent change.'
Replacing the 1985 agreement, which gives the Irish government a say in
Northern Ireland, would be a central demand of Unionist MPs if they held the
balance of power after a general election. Mr Major spent two hours late on
Monday night discussing security in the province with members of the
Democratic Unionist and Ulster Unionist parties. But the meeting appears to
have been more about exchanging views and restoring confidence in Mr Brooke
than in sounding out possible post-election demands.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Nationwide group of clubs planned to meet needs of small
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a nationwide network of small-business clubs were announced in
London yesterday.
Durham Small Business Club, which is promoting the idea, hopes the new
network, named Small Business Clubs Nationwide, will start to operate with
20 member clubs on April 1. It is intended for small established businesses,
many of which find chambers of commerce are too expensive or too formal.
According to Mr Tom Moffat, chairman of the Durham Business Club, member
clubs of the new organisation would have to be professionally managed with
full-time staff and a range of activities making them self-supporting -
unlike many existing business clubs which were run on a part-time, voluntary
basis.
Clubs would pay Pounds 2,500 to join the national organisation plus Pounds 5
of their annual Pounds 35 members' subscription to maintain the central
organisation. Mr Moffat said the new network needed at least 20 members to
raise the Pounds 50,000 required for public limited company status but could
start on an unincorporated basis with 10 to 12 members.
At a conference to launch the plan in London yesterday 10 representatives of
existing business clubs, training and enterprise councils and local
authorities said they were interested. A second conference is to be held in
Durham tomorrow.
Mr Moffat said chambers of commerce had reacted cautiously to the plan and
were watching developments. He believed business clubs would complement
rather than compete with the chambers. They might eventually form part of a
three-tier business support network with start-ups helped by enterprise
agencies, smaller established businesses belonging to a club and larger
businesses belonging to a chamber.
Few businesses take steps to reduce the risk of bad debts or to encourage
their customers to pay on time, according to a survey by Barclays Commercial
Services (BCS), the bank's factoring subsidiary.
Four out of five businesses polled said they had no form of credit
protection cover for their invoices even though late payment and non-payment
were significant causes of business failure. Only one in four said they
offered a discount for early settlement.
BCS surveyed 298 businesses, of which 29 per cent were engaged in
manufacturing, 26 per cent in retailing and 21 per cent in services. Just
over half had sales of less than Pounds 2.5m and 10 per cent sales of Pounds
2.5m to Pounds 10m.

THE LATEST report of the Advertising Standards Authority, published
yesterday, found particular cause for complaint with the motor industry.
The authority upheld complaints received in November against Citroen UK for
inaccurately suggesting the superiority of some aspects of a Citroen
1.4-litre Avantage to a Ford Escort 1.4LX.
Complaints were upheld against Peugeot Talbot for a claim concerning the
environmentally 'clean' nature of diesel engines against conventional petrol
engines fitted with catalytic converters, and against Seat UK for a
newspaper advertisement that combined a slogan featuring a car costing
Pounds 5,444 with a photograph showing a model costing Pounds 8,099.
Complaints against BT, Thomas Cook/P&amp;O European Ferries, the Royal Mint and
Cardiff Development Corporation - which ran a poster campaign featuring
architectural improvements to the Cardiff Bay area that had not yet been
built - were also upheld.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Belfast gets centre for stray letters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POST OFFICE is creating 300 jobs in Belfast with the opening of a
national processing centre to handle badly addressed mail from all over
Britain, it was announced yesterday.
The new handling centre for undeliverable letters will be opened in May at
Donegall Quay, part of the Laganside inner-city redevelopment area.
Mr Bill Cockburn, managing director of the Royal Mail, said: 'We are setting
up a new national centre with state-of-the-art computer technology in place
of numerous manually operated offices to make our return-letter service
faster, more efficient and cost-effective. We are one of the few postal
administrations in the world which offers a return-letter service - and
which does not make any additional charge to the customer for this service
above the normal postage rate.'
The sender of an undeliver-able letter will get it back within two weeks
with an explanation.
The Royal Mail spends Pounds 8m a year dealing with mail that cannot be
delivered, accounting for 120m of the 15bn items handled each year.
The new centre is a timely stimulus for Ulster's economy after factory
closures in the manufacturing sector in the past year. The government's
policy of decentralising jobs to the regions has created about 1,500 jobs in
the province in the past 18 months.
There will be two national centres for stray mail. Belfast will deal with
letters only and Portsmouth will handle packets.
The siting of the service in Belfast will mean higher volumes of traffic
from Northern Ireland to the mainland and will result in the Royal Mail's
introducing additional direct routes to destinations throughout Britain,
making deliveries faster and more efficient.
The European Community awarded a Pounds 900,000 grant to the centre because
Northern Ireland is designated a special development area.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Power meters offer breakdown of costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEHOLDERS in Newcastle upon Tyne can now measure how much it costs to
have a bath, thanks to electricity meters which could be in 20m homes by
1998.
The meters, which can tell customers exactly how much electricity domestic
appliances consume and give them an instant electricity bill, are being
tested and promoted by Offer, the electricity industry watchdog. Yesterday
it issued a paper urging electricity suppliers to install modern meters as
soon as possible.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer's director-general, said sophisticated
meters would be essential in 1998, when the electricity market would be
fully deregulated, allowing customers to choose an electricity supplier
rather than just buying from their local company.
He said: 'I look forward to the day when customers can take out the Yellow
Pages and pick an electricity supplier.'
Because the new meters monitor exactly when electricity is used, any
supplier could easily settle up with the customer's local company.
Offer said the regional electricity companies would probably pay for most of
the new metering system, which might cost Pounds 1bn nationwide. That would
be taken into consideration when regulations governing how much they could
charge customers were reviewed in 1994. The meters would also benefit the
companies because they would improve cashflows and efficiency.
Customer groups, electricity suppliers and other interested bodies have
until July to respond to the report.

Dr Gwyn Jones, agency chairman, said in Cardiff yesterday that the core
programme, including the highly successful drive for inward investment,
which produced Pounds 860m of new investment last year, would continue.
'The focus now, however, is moving to the established companies,' he said.
'Many of the successful start-ups of the 1980s are facing new and difficult
challenges. We shall pay more attention to their needs in future.'
In particular, the WDA through its consultancy services intends to help to
overcome the skill shortages that many inward investors see as a grave
shortcoming in the British economy.
Mr Philip Head, chief executive of the WDA, commenting on the decision to
reduce the emphasis on start-ups, said: 'Much of the work in this area is
now being done by other bodies such as Tecs, local enterprise agencies and
private-sector operations.
'If we are to help Welsh businesses be profitable and well run, we can best
do it by offering more assistance in helping companies plan their strategy,
exploiting technology, improving skills and doing business with Europe.'

FT  22 JAN 92 / Asylum plea for Haitians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMNESTY International, the British-based human rights group, urged the US
yesterday to reconsider its policy towards Haitian asylum seekers, saying it
was concerned over the fate of 500 Haitians who have been forcibly returned
to the island, writes Stephen Fidler.
It called on the US to make sure that the 7,000 Haitians who have sought
refuge in the US get a fair asylum hearing. The US holds that Haitians -
unlike Cubans - are economic refugees rather than political refugees, and
therefore have no right of asylum.
Amnesty said people attempting to leave the island had been severely beaten
and arrested.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Brazil launches drive to boost tourist industry
</HEADLINE>

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is launching an aggressive marketing campaign to recuperate its
flagging tourist industry.
Mr Ronaldo de Monte Rosa, head of Embratur, the state tourist authority,
plans to double the number of tourists and increase income from Dollars
1.4bn to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) over the next five years. 'I want to
seize the opportunity of the Earth Summit (to be hosted by Rio in June) to
relaunch Brazil as a tourist destination,' he says.
To encourage investment, credit lines have been made available by the
National Development Bank. Tourism is to be declared an industry, giving
investors incentives in terms of reduced import tariffs and energy rates.
Brazil might seem to be the ideal tourist location: 4,600 miles of beaches,
the world's largest rainforest. But in the past five years, the number of
tourists has fallen from 2m to 1.08m, as potential visitors are deterred by
social problems caused by economic crisis.
Embratur has decided to fight back against the wave of bad publicity
focusing on Rio's violence by setting up offices overseas to inform the
world about the Indian reserves and Brazilian food and music. Mr Monte
Rosa's aims are to rescue Rio and show the world what else Brazil has to
offer, 'focusing on the north east and Amazonia'.
Despite Brazil's many natural advantages, this is no easy task. Mr Monte
Rosa has finally persuaded Rio's state government to invest in a 'security
for tourists' programme, by showing that it has lost Dollars 400m a year for
the past five years in tourism revenue. But he would like to divert tourists
to Amazonia and the north-east, Brazil's poorest but most scenic and
culturally rich area.

FRANCE'S Matra Defense has won a FFr1bn (Pounds 100m) contract to supply
Mistral light anti-aircraft missiles to the South Korean government, in a
deal that will also involve industrial co-operation with Goldstar, the South
Korean electronics giant, Matra said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Paris.
Mr Jean-Paul Gut, head of the Matra subsidiary's international operations,
said the Korean contract is the first stage of a multi-phase procurement
programme for the Korean armed forces over the next four to five years.
The Korean order marks the entry of Matra as a defence supplier in Asia and
is the first of five to be announced from the region.
Matra has targeted Korea, Singapore and Malaysia as priority areas for its
defence activity and has opened sales offices in New Delhi, Hong Kong,
Seoul, Singapore, and Beijing.
Mr Gut said Goldstar and other South Korean partners will carry out roughly
25 per cent of the work on the Mistral missiles. The contract also includes
a more general transfer of technology to the Koreans.

AMOCO Trinidad Oil Co, a subsidiary of Amoco of the US, is to spend Dollars
300m (Pounds 167.5m) to exploit new gas wells and increase supplies to its
clients in the Caribbean state, Canute James reports from Kingston.
Amoco Trinidad will boost delivery to Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas
Company from the current level of 200m cu ft of natural gas per day to 350m
cu ft per day by 1996.
The new supply contract replaces an earlier agreement signed by Amoco and
NGC, and will expire in the year 2000. It is one of two contracts for gas
sale which Amoco has in Trinidad and Tobago. The other is to supply 80m cu
ft of natural gas daily to the Trinidad and Tobago Electric Commission until
1994.
Amoco Trinidad is the main producer of natural gas in that country,
accounting for 80 per cent of national production. It is also a major player
in Trinidad and Tobago's oil industry, producing an average of 72,000
barrels of crude a day.
Trinidad and Tobago has proven gas reserves of 10.3 trillion (million
million) cu ft. According to the government, extractable reserves amount to
about 7.6 trillion cu ft. Gas production in 1990, the latest year for which
figures are available, was 1.97bn cu ft, 7.7 per cent less than 1989.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Daley eyes Dollars 10bn regional airport project: A look at
the competition for the siting of a 200,000-job public works bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Daley, the mayor of Chicago, is fighting to win the public works
project of a lifetime - a huge new international airport.
The mayor is using Chicago's considerable political clout to gain approval
for his preferred site for the project, which is competing with four others.
Mr Daley's choice of Lake Calumet, an area on the city's largely delapidated
south-east side, would carry a price tag of more than Dollars 10bn and
generate as many as 200,000 jobs. With the city's tradition of patronage,
this is a politician's public works bonanza.
This week a bi-state policy committee, composed of four officials from the
state of Illinois, four from Indiana and three from Chicago, is expected to
decide on the site of the new airport. It is aimed at supplementing O'Hare,
the world's busiest airport, and Midway, the city's oldest airfield, to
absorb air traffic growth over the next three decades.
The other contenders are: an expansion of an existing airport in Gary,
Indiana; or three greenfield sites - Kankakee and Peotone in Illinois and
Beecher, on the border of the two states.
Six votes are needed for selection of the site, which means that Mr Daley is
expected to try to cut some sort of deal with the delegations of either
Illinois or Indiana.
All the other sites would be cheaper to build, but Chicago has argued that
none offers the proximity to as large a number of potential passengers as
Lake Calumet. In a recent report on its proposal, Chicago points out that
Dulles International Airport, located 26 miles outside Washington DC has
failed to perform well as a public investment because of its distance from
the centre of the city.
Those who oppose the Lake Calumet site say that it will be too costly - the
official consulting report of the committee puts the price at Dollars
17.7bn, rather higher than Chicago's estimate - and that it will cause the
most dislocation of residents.
According to the official study, some 10,200 residences with 27,400 people
are directly in the development area of Lake Calumet.
Development at Gary, the other urban site, would affect 9,200 residences and
24,700 people. Any of the other sites affect fewer than 1,500 people.
For Lake Calumet it would be an opportunity to clean up Chicago's most
heavily-polluted area. It has 13 hazardous waste sites, 15 landfills and
some 27 random dumps.
Despite the fact that pollution tops the concerns of local residents about
their neighbourhoods, there are some groups organised to fight the location
of the airport there.
Many are loath to move from homes they have lived in all their lives. Some
of those who will not have to be relocated object because of the expected
noise and air pollution.
Mayor Daley is already being pressured by residents near O'Hare who are
resisting plans to build an additional runway there. O'Hare operates at
capacity, handling over 60m passengers annually.
Chicago is keen to retain its historical role as the main US transportation
hub. Since the days of riverboat and railroad travel during the 19th
century, Chicago has been America's premier transportation nexus. It fears
that it will lose some of its economic edge if it cannot accommodate the
growth in air traffic demand.
Aviation demand in the region is forecast to rise to 73.8m in originating
and connecting passengers by the year 2010 and to 90m by 2020.
A regional study in the summer of 1989 showed additional air carrier
capacity would be needed or the area would begin to lose significant amounts
of traffic to other major metropolitan hubs.
Denver is the only American city to undertake construction of a big airport
since the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport was built in the early 1970s.
O'Hare has brought prosperity to the northern area of the city, as
businesses related to air transport, those that service it or are in need of
it cluster there.
Mayor Daley hopes that the same could occur in Chicago's depressed
south-eastern corner. But he clearly also has his eye on the political
dividends such a project will pay.

FT  22 JAN 92 / UK rebuffs Argentine military overtures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCREET attempts by Argentina to resume normal military ties with the UK
appear to have been rebuffed in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the
Falklands war.
It emerged yesterday that the Ministry of Defence has turned down a request
from Argentina to allow a limited supply of UK-manufactured spare parts to
the Argentine navy, begun during the Gulf war, to continue.
Whitehall has also vetoed a plan for an Argentine military transport
aircraft to fly to Britain next month to collect some cargo assembled by the
naval attache's office at the Argentine embassy in London.
Argentine officials insist the cargo would have involved nothing more than a
few boxes filled with books and military research periodicals, as well as
brochures of British defence companies, normally sent via the diplomatic
bag.
But the planned trip by an aircraft which is normally used by the Argentine
navy to transport military equipment would have almost certainly fuelled
stiff opposition from the Falkland islanders and from MPs opposed to any
suggestion of a 'sell-out' over the islands.
Military ties between the two countries have been governed officially by an
arms embargo imposed by Britain on Argentina following the outbreak of the
Falklands war in 1982.
During the Gulf war, however, London agreed to the supply of Rolls-Royce
spare parts to the Argentine navy which operated with the allied forces.
The parts were for Argentina's German-built destroyer Almirante Brown, which
is powered by Rolls-Royce Olympus and Tyne gas turbines. They were drawn
from Royal Navy stocks.
Argentine officials had hoped the waiving of the arms embargo would pave the
way for a more open policy on military relations.
The Argentine navy is believed to be cutting the operational hours of
vessels to minimise the use of equipment for which replacement parts are
needed.

venture

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NYNEX, the US telecommunications group, is in the final stages of concluding
a joint venture to build and run a network with 2m lines for Bangkok,
Thailand.
The total investment in the venture, in which the US company will take a 10
per cent stake, is estimated at Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.39bn)-Dollars 3bn.
At one stage, it seemed as though the foreign partner in this venture, which
has a controversial history, would be BT, the UK telecommunications
operator. But the nature of the concession from the Thai government was
altered after last year's political upheaval in the country.
The intention is that Nynex will join forces with the Charoen Pokphand
Group, the Thai agro-industrial conglomerate, to build a modern network for
Bangkok. The agreement is expected to be finalised in the next few weeks.
CP Group will own 90 per cent of the joint venture, TelecomAsia. As well as
owning the remaining 10 per cent, Nynex will appoint senior executives and
offer its experience in operating networks in densely-populated cities such
as New York.
Mr Fred Salerno, Nynex's vice-chairman, said Thailand was a growth area in
telecommunications. In Bangkok alone, there was a waiting list of more than
1m lines, meaning an instant market opportunity.
The network will be financed by means of a mix of equity, financing from
equipment suppliers and income from customers. Nynex refused to divulge the
size of its equity investment.
Mr Salerno said Nynex hopes to do more business in Thailand, where
concessions are due to be awarded for providing networks in other parts of
the country.
His company was also 'keeping an ear to the ground', looking for
opportunities in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Malaysia.
Nynex already has projects to expand telecommunications networks in
Indonesia and the Philippines.

The six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) yesterday welcomed an EC
offer to let in more petrochemical imports under a planned free trade deal,
Reuter reports from Brussels.
The European Commission revised its proposals last year after the GCC
demanded better access to EC markets for certain industrially-sensitive
petrochemicals, subject to special tariffs and quotas. GCC members are Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the UAE.
Diplomats said the EC, which wants greater access to expanding Gulf markets
and to cement relations with this strategic region, was encouraged to
liberalise its position following the 1991 Gulf War. EC officials said the
offer included shorter time limits on raising quotas and cutting import
duties, with special arrangements to liberalise trade in sensitive
petrochemicals.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday agreed to review a highly restrictive
Pennsylvania abortion law, paving the way for an inflammatory debate over
the constitutionality of abortion during this year's presidential campaign.
As the court announced the review, dozens of demonstrators were being
arrested for trying to bar pregnant women from entering two Washington
abortion clinics. Pro-choice advocates were 'running the blockades' to
escort pregnant women into the clinics.
Ms Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defence Fund, yesterday
said she expected the court to use the Pennsylvania case as a vehicle to
reconsider Roe vs Wade, the 1973 decision which legalised abortion in the
US. Today is the 19th anniversary of the Roe decision.
President George Bush has replaced two liberal judges on the supreme court
with two conservatives, and 'the risk is high' that Roe will be overturned,
Ms Lichtman said.
A Pennsylvania appeals court struck down a provision in the Pennsylvania law
which said a wife's spouse must be notified before an abortion can be
performed, but it let stand other restrictions, including compulsory a
24-hour waiting period before the abortion. Both the state and women's
rights groups then appealed to the Supreme Court.
Women's groups are blaming Mr Bush for the threatened loss of abortion
rights along with the Senate, which approved his court nominees.

The Palestine Liberation Organisation has demanded representation of the

Andoni writes from Amman.
Syria and Lebanon have already declared that they will not attend the
multilateral talks, citing lack of progress in two rounds of bilateral
Israeli Arab talks held in Washington in December and January. Jordan
insists on attending the talks which it argues will build up international
pressure on Israel to make concession over its bilateral disputes with Arab
countries.
Foreign ministers of Arab countries are expected to meet in Morocco on
Friday to decide whether the Arabs will take part in the talks that will
tackle such issues as water, disarmament and the environment.
The US, according to a senior PLO official, has insisted that representation

FT  22 JAN 92 / More troops sent to West Bank and Gaza: Move follows strong
pressure from settlers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL said yesterday it had sharply increased the strength of its armed
forces in the occupied territories, a move which followed strong pressure
from Jewish settlers for more aggressive army action against the Palestinian
uprising, or intifada.
The army's statement that it was stepping up troop numbers in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip by 20 per cent kept the focus of political debate in the wake
of Sunday's collapse of Mr Yitzhak Shamir's coalition government fixed
firmly on the occupied territories.
Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, denied the reinforcement was prompted
by the demands of the settlers, who have mounted angry demonstrations
against him and Mr Shamir over a series of shootings in which five Israelis,
including fours settlers, have died. He said the extra troops were needed to
help track down the killers.
But both Mr Arens and Mr Shamir have been quick to affirm their support for
the 100,000-strong settlers - an important constituency for their Likud
party - since the loss of the government's parliamentary majority heralded a
likely general election by mid-summer.
The issue is a tricky one for Mr Shamir because his dogged commitment to
expanding Jewish settlements may jeopardise his request for Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.5bn) in loan guarantees from the US, which strongly opposes the
settlements. Israel, needing to raise more than Dollars 20bn overseas to
help cope with mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union, can
ill-afford to forego the assistance.
Mr Ronni Milo, the police minister and close associate of Mr Shamir,
suggested in a newspaper interview that Mr Shamir could reach a 'quiet
agreement' with Washington to freeze settlements, although it would be
difficult for him to announce this publicly.
This was interpreted as meaning Mr Shamir might tell the Bush administration
that no further commitments to new house building in the settlements would
be made. But, as settler leaders were happy to point out, the large numbers
of housing starts already under way or in the pipeline would mean such an
assurance would have little meaning.
Latest figures show housing starts in Jewish settlements - almost all
government funded - numbered 6,435 in the first nine months of last year,
compared with 1,820 in all of 1990. The government is committed to more than
5,000 this year.
Mr Shamir's apparent lack of concern about voter reaction to the economic
consequences of his settlement policies is partly explained by the disarray
in the main opposition Labour party.
At a meeting of Labour MPs yesterday attended by reporters, Mr Shimon Peres,
the party leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who will challenge his leadership
before the election, traded angry accusations and insults.
Mr Chaim Ramon, leader of the Labour parliamentary party, warned that if the
two did not stop squabbling 'it will cause irreversible damage to Labour's
position which will be very difficult to overcome'.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Japan's trade surplus up 50 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus rose to Dollars 78.2bn in 1991, up 50 per cent on
1990. The increase ends four years of decline and highlights renewed
international attempts to strengthen the yen.
The Ministry of Finance said exports rose 9.6 per cent to Dollars 314.6bn,
while imports increased only 0.7 per cent to Dollars 236.4bn. On a yen
basis, exports rose 2.2 per cent to Y42,370bn and imports fell 5.9 per cent
to Y31,850bn.
Figures for December, in which the surplus was up 84 per cent from a year
earlier to Dollars 10bn, suggest that the 1992 surplus could surpass the
previous record of Dollars 82.74bn in 1986. The seasonally adjusted surplus
in December was Dollars 7.26bn, down from Dollars 7.43bn in November.
Japan's 1991 exports to the EC rose 10.5 per cent and imports from the EC
fell 9.3 per cent, resulting in a surplus of Dollars 27.37bn, a 48 per cent
increase, though the rate of growth has slowed in recent months. The surplus
with the US rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 38.45bn, the first increase since
1987.
With Washington focusing on the bilateral surplus this year, the December
figures indicated that trade friction could intensify in coming months.
Japan's surplus for the month in trade with the US was Dollars 4.46bn, with
exports to the US rising 1.8 per cent to Dollars 8.39bn and imports from the
US falling 17.4 per cent to Dollars 3.93bn.
The turnaround in the Japanese surplus last year reflected the slowing of
domestic economic growth, a continued increase in demand from Asian trading
partners, and a contraction in sales of luxury imports that had surged
before the collapse of Japan's financial 'bubble'.
The Bank of Japan estimates that about 75 per cent of the increase is due to
'special factors', including currency fluctuations and lower oil prices. The
central bank argues that these will be less important this year and that the
growth in the surplus will soon peak.
Mr Russell Jones, chief economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expects the
surplus to continue to grow in the first quarter of this year before
levelling off. However, he is surprised by the strength of Japanese exports
to the US in recent months.
'When you look at the struggle for recovery in the US, five consecutive
months of higher surpluses with the US is a bit surprising. Part of the
problem is that US exports to Japan include a lot of commodity items, and
lower commodity prices mean a higher bilateral surplus,' Mr Jones said.
The December figures reflected the growing importance of Japan's trade with
south-east Asian nations, with exports to the region 5.6 per cent higher at
Dollars 10bn, and imports from the region down 4.7 per cent to Dollars
6.1bn. While Japan's trade volume with that region totalled Dollars 16.1bn,
the volume with the US was Dollars 12.3bn, and that with the EC was Dollars
7.9bn.
In December, Japan's exports of electrical machinery rose 11 per cent and
precision instrument exports increased 11 per cent, while machinery imports
fell 14.8 per cent on the same month in 1990 and materials imports were down
7.6 per cent, partly due to a sharp fall in new construction orders late
last year.

Militant workers ended their occupation of South Korea's largest car plant
yesterday after police threatened to storm the factory at dawn with
helicopters, armoured vehicles and thousands of officers, AP reports from
Ulsan.
The workers took over the plant after it was closed by the company following
a union strike vote. The workers were demanding special bonus payments,
better working conditions and reinstatement of workers dismissed for union
activity.
Early yesterday, helicopters flew over the plant dropping leaflets informing
workers of the dawn evacuation deadline and threatening an assault after
12,000 riot police massed around the factory compound.
Some 3,000 to 4,000 car workers had been reinforcing towering barricades of
trucks, cars dragged off assembly lines, vehicle parts, tyres and hijacked
fire engines.
Clusters of workers pounded the ground with steel pipes, keeping time with
rousing pro-labour songs blasting out across a compound littered with lumps
of metal and twisted parts of what had been brand new cars.
At nightfall, dozens of masked and hooded workers carrying steel pipes could
be seen guarding plant barricades.
Hyundai officials had expressed concern about the several thousand gallons
of paint thinner and other inflammable liquid kept in the plant. They said
more than 20,000 cars also were on the site. The plant normally has 30,000
workers and can produce 1.1 million vehicles a year.
Hyundai car workers earn an average Dollars 1,600 (Pounds 893) a month.
South Korea's average wages have more than doubled in the past four years
because of union pressure. The government has asked companies to keep salary
increases down this year, contending high labour costs have made South
Korean products less competitive internationally.

FT  22 JAN 92 / India seeks new trade pact with Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is expected to visit New Delhi in
March or April to sign a new friendship treaty to replace the 1971 agreement
between India and the Soviet Union.
A draft agreement was discussed with Russian officials when Mr J N Dixit,
India's foreign minister, visited Moscow last week.
It was recognised during the talks that India's old relationship with the
Soviet Union, in which it gained preferential treatment as its main ally in
Asia, no longer held good and that a new arrangement would have to be worked
out.
The draft omits the references to security in the 1971 treaty, although it
does provide for regular consultations on peace and security. Russian
support for India's stand on Kashmir is said to have been reaffirmed.
The transition to a new pattern of bilateral trading is proving more
difficult. It has been decided to give up 'rupee' transactions, under which
an annual trade protocol was signed listing imports and exports of the two
countries on a balanced basis. However, an immediate changeover to using
convertible currencies is not contemplated.
For the present, the goods exchanged will be valued in dollars but paid in
rupees. This will continue for two years while the difficult question of the
rupee-rouble exchange rate is worked out. Trade in convertible currency is
to follow after that.
This presumably means that Russia will cease exporting to India cheap crude
oil, fertilisers, newsprint and metals and that trade will be based on world
prices.
This will harm India since it has been receiving sophisticated defence
equipment from the Soviet Union cheaply and on easy credit terms. While the
Russians are reported to have agreed to provide spares and components which
the Indian armed forces need urgently, the terms for future defence supplies
have still to be worked out.
The Indians are satisfied that Russian will honour credits for several power
projects promised by the Soviet Union. This includes assistance for a
nuclear power plant in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.
A similar treaty is being negotiated with Ukraine.

LEADERS of Tanzania's ruling Revolutionary Party have backed a proposal to
introduce a multi-party system, according to the state-owned Daily News,
Reuter reports from Dar es Salaam.
The party would officially endorse the switch to pluralism at a special
conference on February 18, said a statement issued by the 117-strong
executive committee in the inland capital of Dodoma late on Monday. 'We
agree with one voice to present to the national conference the proposal
 .that a multi-party system should be established in Tanzania.'
The announcement came at the end of a four-day party meeting to discuss a
report ordered by President Ali Hassan Mwinyi 10 months ago on whether to
end 30 years of one-party rule.
Mr Mwinyi is thought likely to call elections later this year after
pluralism was officially approved by early March.

<TEXT>
SERBIA has drawn up a draft law for the creation of a new, reduced Yugoslav
state following international recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, writes
Laura Silber in Belgrade.
A commission set up by the Serb-controlled federal parliament has proposed
'the basis for the historic reconstruction of Yugoslavia', the
Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug said yesterday.
The law, which is expected to be adopted in mid-February, is the first
concrete step towards the creation of a rump Yugoslav state whose borders
have not yet been defined.
'The borders would be democratically agreed by the nations which wish to
remain in Yugoslavia,' Tanjug said.
The draft law calls for the formation of a provisional constitutional
assembly comprising 30 representatives from each republic. It says elections
in the constituent republics could be held by autumn.
However, the plans are likely to face opposition both from within the
republic and beyond.
On Friday the parliament of Bosnia-Hercegovina is expected to approve a
referendum on independence for the republic's 4.4m Slavic Moslems, Serbs and
Croats. Ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo, controlled by
the Serbian police, also oppose the attempt to create a rump, Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia.
Representatives from Croatia and the federal army met EC monitors in Pecs,
southern Hungary, yesterday to discuss ways to bolster the ceasefire.

FT  22 JAN 92 / European air traffic control could buckle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S fragmented air traffic control system could start buckling by this
spring, leading to long delays and cancellations, according to Mr Giovanni
Bisignani, managing director of Alitalia.
Mr Bisignani, who has just taken over as chairman of the Association of
European Airlines (AEA), which groups 23 flag carriers, said the failure to
establish a unified air traffic control system had not been exposed last
year because of the exceptional downturn in traffic, caused by recession and
the Gulf war. Even so, AEA members clocked up 50,000 hours in flight delays
in 1991.
'We can not go on with 22 different operational systems and 33 different
software systems,' he said. 'We need action and quick: it is not a lack of
physical space; the system is inadequate.'
He called on the European Commission to press for a unified control system
as the precondition for a single market in civil aviation. Brussels' hands
have been tied because air traffic control falls under national jurisdiction
largely for reasons of national security.
Mr Bisignani underlined that fragmentation imposed unacceptable costs on
airlines at a time of crisis in the industry. of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds
1.22bn) a year in Europe, whereas the unified US control system dealt with
three times the volume of traffic and cost airlines Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Bisignani's remarks on air traffic control came as part of a presentation
on the AEA's reservations about Brussels' 'open skies' policy.
'We need and want a single market ..but some things must be changed,' he
said after the presentation to the European Parliament and in meetings with
the Commission.
The AEA accepts the thrust of Commission deregulation, but wants to blunt
its sharper edges.
Under the 'third aviation package' adopted by Brussels last July, and now
working its way through the Council of Ministers of the 12, access to EC
routes will be opened up; established carriers' hold on landing and take-off
'slots' at hub airports will be loosened; national licensing rules will be
replaced by common rules detailing capital adequacy and technical fitness;
and fare-setting will be liberalised.
Mr Bisignani said yesterday the AEA rejected growing Brussels supervision of
access to routes and level of fares.
On cabotage - allowing airlines from one member state to offer domestic
services in another - he proposed a transitional period of three years
beyond the 1993 target date.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Soviet archives coup for UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE task of microfilming and publishing the archives of the Communist party
of the Soviet Union is to be started by a British company, it was announced
yesterday.
Sir Charles Chadwyck-Healey, head of Chadwyck-Healey, the Cambridge academic
publishers, said hundreds of millions of documents, letters, tapes and books
had been locked away in the CPSU headquarters in Moscow, 'either top secret
or forgotten' until the party was banned last August.
Records date from before the revolution up until last year. The documents
then passed into the control of the Russian government's council for
archives, which has granted access to only a handful of historians.
Chadwyck-Healey paid a fee of 'several thousand pounds' to the council for
archives to receive a first batch of negatives of documents being
microfilmed by Russian experts. It has exclusive rights to make copies and
market these in the west.
'These archives are perhaps the most important single untapped resource for
understanding the history of the 20th century,' according to Mr James
Billington, the US librarian of congress, one of the few westerners who has
seen them.
The company is beginning with the personal and official papers of nine
revolutionaries and early Soviet politicians including Trotsky, Kirov,
Molotov, Zhdanov and Kalinin.
'These files are of extraordinary interest,' Sir Charles said. 'They are
full of not only official documents but personal letters to family and
friends which show what the individuals were thinking at the time and will
provide insights never before available to historians.'
A set of the first batch of documents is expected to sell for around Pounds
5,000, and 25 per cent royalties will be paid to the Russian government.
Chadwyck-Healey expects to sell several hundred copies to academic libraries
and historians.
If the first project is a success, the company plans to publish many more
documents.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Georgian forces 'agree to ceasefire': Ousted president is
reported to have again fled the republic
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of ousted Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia yesterday agreed
a truce with representatives of the new military government, according to
the mayor of the Black Sea port of Poti, a pro-Gamsakhurdia stronghold.
Mr Tengiz Baramidze said negotiations yesterday evening succeeded in
agreeing a ceasefire between the two sides, thus averting the threat of an
all-engulfing civil war in the 5m-strong republic.
'We decided we must stop this war. It is enough. On the other side of the
barricades are Georgians. They are our sons,' Mr Baramidze said.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, who fled to neighbouring Armenia after the collapse of
resistance to a siege by rebel militia, returned to western Georgia last
week. He is now said to have again left the republic.
The ceasefire agreement followed a breakthrough by government forces at a
key bridge that opened the way to Poti from the east. Four government
soldiers were killed in the battle, outside the rail centre of Samtredia,
and six were wounded.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, who won a landslide election victory last May, was accused
by the opposition of governing like a dictator. He was forced from office on
January 6 after the siege in the now-gutted Georgian parliament in Tbilisi.
The release of an SS19 intercontinental ballistic missile from a base in the
republic of Kazakhstan on December 20 was carried out on orders of the
central nuclear command, without the knowledge of the Kazakhstan government,
General Yuri Gusev, commander of central space weapons, said.
Although the Kazakh government was not informed of the launch, Washington
was, he told the daily newspaper Izvestia. The launch, revealed over the
weekend by the Washington Post newspaper, had been scheduled for two months.
It calls into question both the control of nuclear weapons in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, and the strength of agreements between
them on nuclear issues.
General Gusev said the launch programme had been approved in July 1991 by
the Union's military-industrial commission, now disbanded.
The states of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, all possessing
strategic as well as tactical nuclear weaponry, had agreed to a central
control over nuclear weapons, but with close consultation between them on
the use and deployment of missiles.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh president, told Mr Douglas Hurd, the British
foreign secretary, during his visit to Alma Ata on Saturday that nuclear
weapons presented no threat. Mr Hurd later said he was 'reasonably
satisfied' with these and other assurances.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 12 men charged with conspiracy to seize power in the failed Soviet coup
last August will be spared the death sentence, Mr Valentin Stepankov,
Russian prosecutor-general, said yesterday.
The trial would start this summer at the earliest, he added.
Mr Yevgeny Lisov, chief investigator in the case, said a core of six Soviet
leaders had long been planning to 'turn the clock back' on all reforms
initiated by President Mikhail Gorbachev since he came to power in 1985. But
they were spurred into action on August 19 by the threat of the Union
treaty's signing, which would have dismantled most central authority.
Mr Lisov said the putsch foundered on a failure to follow up a plan to storm
the Russian parliament - which would have required 'killing several thousand
people'. The plans emerged in about 100 documents found on some of the
defendants.
The coup plotters allegedly aimed to intern the Russian leadership, and
execute thieves and other petty criminals as part of a law and order
campaign. They also planned to abolish all local government councils.
Mr Stepankov said the state would call for jail sentences of 10 to 15 years
for the plotters, rather than the death penalty. 'The position of the
accused is that they were acting for the good of the people,' Mr Lisov said.
'They consider themselves as not guilty.'
Although some of the defendants had reason to believe Mr Gorbachev would
support their bid to seize power, Mr Lisov said the former Soviet president
was innocent of any wrongdoing.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE European airlines start this week regular scheduled services to
Vilnius, the capital of the newly independent republic of Lithuania which is
seeking to expand economic ties with the west, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace
Correspondent.
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Swissair and Austrian Airlines have for
the first time co-ordinated services to the same city, operating a joint
office and station and jointly recruiting staff.
The move marks a strengthening of the so-called European Quality Alliance
airline partnership which is designed to enhance the competitive position of
the three medium-sized airlines against larger European rivals like British
Airways, Lufthansa and Air France.
The flights - from Copenhagen, Zurich and Vienna - will allow a daily
service to Vilnius from one of the three cities, except on Wednesday.
Lithuania is anxious to attract western investment to modernise and expand
the Vilnius airport. A big problem facing western carriers setting up
operations in the Baltic region is the lack of adequate ground and
telecommunications infrastructure.
Yesterday's launch of the first SAS flight from Copenhagen to Vilnius also
marks a further expansion of the Scandinavian carrier's operations in the
Baltics.

<TEXT>
THE French government has launched a trade promotion campaign targeted at
the Japanese market with the aim of reducing the ballooning French trade
deficit with Japan.
The campaign follows a five day visit to Japan by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the
finance minister, which is being interpreted in France as a direct riposte
to the trade promotion visit by President George Bush.
Mr Beregovoy sought from the Japanese government, and believed he had
secured, undertakings that there would be no discrimination in favour of the
US at the expense of Europeans.
Mr Beregovoy attempted to distinguish himself from the insistent demands of
President Bush, by emphasising his aim of closer co-operation with Japan,
and France's openness to direct investment.
The French export campaign, spread over three years, will aim to improve the
image of French goods, and in particular will promote 12 specific sectors,
including aeronautics, food and agriculture, pharmaceutics, environmental
and car components.
The French trade deficit with Japan currently runs at around FFr30bn (Pounds
3.09bn) a year. 'This is a difficult market, but not impenetrable', Mr
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French foreign trade minister said yesterday.
'Japanese imports are growing each year by 20 per cent, and we must get our
share.'
A consortium of ABB Power Plants and Japan's Marubeni Corporation has signed
a letter of intent with the Indonesian Electricity Board to build a Dollars
700m power station at Tanjung Priok, near Jakarta.

<TEXT>
ALCAN ALUMINIUM, under pressure from weak metal prices, posted a net loss of
USDollars 41m, or 18 cents a share, after preferred dividends for the final
quarter of 1991, against a profit of Dollars 184m, or 83 cents, a year
earlier.
Sales declined to Dollars 1.8bn from Dollars 2.24bn in the same period of
1990.
For all 1991, the loss was Dollars 56m, or 25 cents a share, against profit
of Dollars 521m, or Dollars 2.33, in 1990. Revenues amounted to Dollars
7.7bn, compared with Dollars 8.7bn for 1990.
The figures were struck after restructuring charges and other special items
in both periods.
Alcan said average prices realised for primary aluminium in 1991 were 25 per
cent lower than in 1990.
Total shipments of ingot and fabricated products were lower, while year-end
inventory was 463,000 tonnes against 447,000 tonnes.
Mr David Morton, chairman, said that Alcan's results reflected lower prices
due primarily to big increases in exports from the former Soviet Union on
top of existing over-supply in the West.
'We responded by reducing our annual operating costs by well over the target
Dollars 200m in 1991, with a further improvement of Dollars 275m targeted
for 1992.'
He said the near-term outlook for aluminium prices is not encouraging,
'given continuing over-supply and few signs of an early recovery in demand.
We need an appreciable pick-up in demand or a further curtailment of
supply'.

JAPAN took an important political step towards the opening of the rice
market yesterday when Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa suggested it could
allow rice imports without seriously damaging farm incomes, Robert Thomson
reports from Tokyo.
Mr Miyazawa did not clearly state the rice market would be opened, but
indicated that tariffication, the replacement of the present ban with a
tariff regime, seemed necessary to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round
trade talks. Tokyo would consider ways to protect farmers' livelihoods if
tariffication were accepted, he added, suggesting some farmers could switch
to other crops.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Recovery hopes hit by drop in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTEDLY sharp drop in retail sales volumes last month has made the
chances of a consumer-led recovery ahead of the general election less
likely.
Figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office showed that
retail sales volumes in December fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 per cent,
compared with the previous month, giving a 0.4 per cent year-on-year
decline. The drop followed a rise in November of 1.3 per cent.
Heavy price discounting by shops failed to revive consumer spending before
Christmas, increasing pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to
provide a stimulus to consumer confidence in the March Budget.
Over the fourth quarter of 1991, sales were 0.25 per cent up on the same
period of 1990. Sales in the second half of 1991 were 0.2 per cent up on the
first half of the year, but unchanged on the second half of 1990.
The CSO said the December figure was 'particularly uncertain' and may have
been artificially depressed because of a statistical quirk which inflated
the November figure by up to half a percentage point.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist for Midland Montagu, said the figures were
awful and 'a clear sign that the recession is continuing.'
The Treasury said it was disappointed that sales had not recovered as it had
hoped, but said the broader picture was one of flat retail sales.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the figures
exposed the government's incompetence.
'Despite the repeated promises of recovery and the constant claims of
resurgent economic confidence by the prime minister and his chancellor, it
is quite clear the government is still in the grip of a paralysis which
prevents it taking the action necessary to bring us out of recession,' he
said.
The figures from the CSO confirmed the findings of a Confederation of
British Industry distributive trades survey, published yesterday, which
showed that while high street stores thought this Christmas was more active
than in 1990, the increase was still below expectations.

FT  21 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: BAe falls after twin setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace (BAe) fell heavily early in the session on weekend press
reports, later confirmed by the company, that the finance director was to
resign and that BAe faced an Pounds 80m claim from Asda over an agreement
concerning Burwood House, a 50 per cent jointly owned property operation.
BAe said it expected to reach an agreement over the claim very soon and had
made provisions for the losses.
Mr Sandy Morris of County NatWest said: 'Problems on the property side are
not a surprise, but it is disappointing that further problems have emerged.'
The market took the view that the finance director's departure was further
fall-out from last year's Pounds 432m disastrous rights issue at the
company. An analyst commented: 'The market has been demanding that further
heads must roll and they have now got one.' Mr Chris Avery at Smith New
Court simply called today's news 'another couple of disappointments for this
accident-prone company'.
Bargain hunters, however, ensured that the shares recovered from the day's
worst, eventually ending 12 off at 302p on turnover of 4.6m. At their worst
the stock touched 288p. Asda had an unexceptional day. The stock firmed a
penny to 36 1/2 p on volume of 12m.
British Gas busy
Shares in British Gas improved 3 to 246p on heavy turnover of 7m, with much
of the buying coming from Smith New Court. There was a story that Gas may be
considering the spin-off of a large part of its industrial gas marketing
operation in a move that would allow it to meet the gas regulator's market
objectives without undue damage to shareholder value.
Mr Steve Turner, energy specialist at Smith, said that after the creation of
such independent companies they would be given to Gas's existing holders,
perhaps on a one-for-one basis, or alternatively floated on the stock
market.
Vodafone active
A big placing of Vodafone shares, said to have been carried out by James
Capel, left the stock as the most heavily traded in the market. The Seaq
ticker revealed a block of 4.9m shares dealt at 352p and another similar
sized block traded at 355p.
The deals, carried out at substantial discounts to the ruling market price,
left Vodafone 8 lower at 363p. Volume was a heavy 12m.
The placing underlines a cautious tone on the shares, which had brightened
in the last quarter of 1991 as signs emerged that the cellular market was
picking up. However, the recovery has failed to materialise and analysts
have again been bearish. This month both BZW and Phillips &amp; Drew have turned
cautious on the shares.
Kingfisher falters
Government statistics showing poor retail sales for December, as well as a
forecast cut by one securities house, affected Kingfisher, which fell 10
before rallying with the market to close a net 3 off at 494p in a depressed
stores sector.
County Natwest lowered its profits prediction for 1991 to Pounds 207.3m from
Pounds 214m, mainly in reaction to competitive pressures in the
do-it-yourself market and its Comet electrical goods chain.
The whole sector was weak after the government announced that UK retail
sales fell a provisional seasonally-adjusted 1 per cent in December, giving
a year-on-year decline of 0.4 per cent.
Recent Footsie constituent WH Smith 'A' lost 12 to 461p ahead of interim
results on January 29, while Marks and Spencer declined 6 to 296p.
Publisher Reed International was weak at the expense of Pearson after
securities house SG Warburg published a hefty re-evaluation of the media
sector yesterday. Reed receded 5 to 523p while Pearson improved 10 to 765p.
The 20-page document will be the basis of a series of meetings with
institutional clients over the coming weeks. Warburg reduced its 1992
forecast for Reed by Pounds 10m to Pounds 220m and that for next year by
Pounds 15m to Pounds 258m on consideration of currency factors.
It argues that although Reed's outperformance was justified, there is a case
for 'near-term profit-taking'. On the other hand, it reasons that: 'The
strength of Pearson's balance sheet will continue to underpin the price (of
the shares).'
Pharmaceuticals company Glaxo rose 26 to 864p on a reassessment of the
sector following heavy selling last week and good news on one of its
products. The company reported that it had been granted a licence to market
its Serevent anti-asthma drug in Italy.
There was a further announcement that the company had sold 30 of its
pharmaceuticals brands to drugs company Medeva, which moved up 12 to 228p on
the news.
Fisons rallied 19 to 353p, with the shares receiving added encouragement
ahead of its research and development meeting.
Securities houses SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson were also said to be
discussing the company with clients. Warburg refused to comment but Mr Ian
White of Kleinwort said he had been repeating his recent buy stance on the
stock.
Wellcome, up 16 at 1050p, was helped by a forecast upgrade from Smith New
Court, which has raised its estimate for the year ending in August by Pounds
10m to Pounds 500m.
A sharp rise in Abbey National last week was reversed after securities house
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew cut its forecast for the bank's profits. The shares lost
8 1/2 to 290p.
UBS reduced its 1992 figure by Pounds 60m to Pounds 635m and its dividend
forecast to 11.15p from 11.75p. It changed its stance from hold to trading
sell. The house believes the recent cut in the mortgage rate will squeeze
margins and the bank will suffer more than previously thought from high
mortgage arrears. UBS was an aggressive seller of Abbey and a buyer of TSB
following well-received results last week. TSB gained 3 to 132 1/2 p.
Conglomerate Lonrho regained lost ground on hopes that the group will hold
its annual dividend at 16p in spite of an expected drop in profits when it
announces full-year results on Thursday. The shares rose 14 to 164p with
7.6m traded.
James Wilkes jumped 30 to 189p after the company confirmed market
speculation that it had received a bid approach.
Rank Organisation moved ahead 19 to 635p as unconfirmed reports said that
the leisure group had sold its Royal Garden Hotel for between Pounds 60m to
Pounds 70m.
Overseas investors, particularly Japanese, were sellers of electricity
issues. National Power lost 2 1/2 to 138 1/2 p but PowerGen ended 2 firmer
at 149p following brisk turnover of 9.2m and 7.6m shares respectively.
Activity in the building and construction sector was again dominated by the
Steetley bid for Redland, with the former losing gains made on Friday.
Positive sentiment had been prompted by market talk of other parties
entering the fray, with ECC interest in Steetley favourite. However, a
weekend statement by ECC denying the speculation left Steetley 4 cheaper at
377p.
Redland gained 4 to 477p, while ECC put on 9 to 494p.
Buy notes from BZW, among others, helped Blue Circle add 9 at 259p.
Profit-taking in Meyer International left the builders supplier down 12 at
411p.
From today, the Financial Times will publish the gross dividend yield on the
FT-SE 100 index. It will appear each day in the panel at the bottom of the
left-hand columns of the front page. The yield on the FT Ordinary index will
continue to appear on this page as before.
The yield calculation is the same as that used in the FT-Actuaries All-Share
index. It is obtained by multiplying total gross dividends payable of the
index constitutents by their number of shares in issue, and dividing the
result by the total market capitalisation of the companies in the index. The
resulting figure is multiplied by 100 to give a percentage rate.
'Running gross dividends' are used: last final dividend plus latest interim
dividend, or vice versa, with the tax credit added. The approach differs
from that used in the London Share Service pages, where the yield is based
on the last annual gross dividend.

FT  21 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally to close at day's
highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market battled gamely throughout a tense but generally thin
trading session to close with overall small gains, having recovered from
widespread and often double-figure losses registered earlier in the day.
Triggering a late and determined rally by blue-chip shares was a whisper of
an imminent sizeable corporate deal, possibly involving a Footsie stock, and
a remarkable turnround in the futures market.
The FT-SE 100-share index ended at the day's best level, up 8.2 at 2,544.9,
having been down 16.4 to 2,520.3 within two hours of the opening.
The market opened in a rather fragile mood, with marketmakers clipping
prices across the board, to head off some attempted early selling caused by
the latest opinion polls published over the weekend which showed the
Conservatives and Labour running virtually neck and neck. Adding to the
generally uneasy mood at the outset was a sizeable fall by the Tokyo market.
More gloom came in the shape of an undeniably bearish review of retail sales
over the Christmas period published by the Confederation of British
Industry. This bearish picture for retailers was confirmed in mid-morning by
official government statistics on retail sales for December which were a
provisional 1 per cent lower during the period. Rather optimistically, the
market had been expecting retail sales to have been at worst only marginally
down in December.
After the statistics were known, store shares were among the market's
unhappiest areas, reacting to the figures and also to a broker downgrade of
Kingfisher, one of the most important store counters. Marks and Spencer and
Great Universal Stores also came in for a flurry of selling, but most store
issues rallied as the day wore on.
There was no shortage of bearish stories in other areas of the market.
Dealers went gunning for British Aerospace as the group confirmed the
departure of its finance director and a claim for Pounds 80m from Asda, the
supermarket group, in the wake of a property joint venture between the two
groups.
Water and electricity shares stumbled as institutions looked hard at opinion
polls and awaited news this week of the date of the UK Budget.
Vodafone topped the active stocks list as a leading agency broker placed a
near 5m block of shares ahead of a series of presentations to stockbrokers
and institutions. Abbey National shares retreated after UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
lowered its profits expectations.
An early slide by the Footsie future kept the cash market on the defensive,
but the whole picture changed during the afternoon.
Wall Street opened lower but then started a slow recovery, and the Footsie
future began to accelerate, boosted by a late spate of institutional buying
orders. An opening 16 points premium was turned into a 33 points premium by
the close.
Senior marketmakers in the stock market were more than happy with the
market's performance. 'There was very little selling, quite the reverse,'
said one dealer, who pointed out that there had been a persistent supply of
buying orders into the market even when the Footsie was 16 points down. Seaq
turnover amounted to a rather disappointing 418.2m shares, compared with
last Friday's 687.2m.

FT  21 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE burst of activity in the stock index futures market enlivened what
had otherwise been reported to be a dull session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract opened at a premium of 33 and buyers were seen. The
upward direction of the contract did not last and there was a wave of
mid-morning selling, further encouraged by the release of disappointing
retail sales figures for the Christmas period.
A poor opening on Wall Street reinforced the dull market mood and a weak
finish was expected. However, minutes before the close a recovering Wall
Street and an order for 50 contracts triggered heavy buying. That was
followed by another large buying order. Independent traders were left short,
generating a large squeeze in the last half-hour of trading and pushing the
underlying cash market higher. March closed at 2,593 for a premium of 49 to
the cash market and around 27 points above its estimated fair value premium
to cash, but turnover was a meagre 4,432.
In traded options, volume reached 28,343. The FT-SE Index had 4,285
contracts dealt. Storehouse was the busiest stock option with 2,305 lots
traded. Asda was the second most active on 2,185 contracts transacted.

FT  21 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities ease in light trade
after last week's gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER LAST week's strong gains, US stock markets were in subdued form
yesterday with share prices tending to ease. Trading was relatively light
because of the semi-official Martin Luther King Day holiday, which closed
federal offices, banks and the bond markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.95 at 3,254.03.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.50 to 416.36, while the Nasdaq composite
of over-the-counter stocks ran into heavy profit-taking and fell 7.47 to
619.38. New York SE turnover came to 181m shares, while declines outpaced
rises by 943 to 743.
The market often opens lower on the first day after the monthly expiration
of stock futures and options contracts. Last Friday the Dow had been boosted
to a new high by trading linked to the expirations on derivative markets,
and so some downward correction yesterday had been anticipated.
Moreover, in the absence of fresh economic and big corporate news, those
investors not away for the one-day holiday chose to take it easy, only
occasionally dipping into the market to take some profits earned during the
recent sharp advance.
Upjohn fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 1/2 amid a deepening row over
alleged side effects of its best selling sleeping drug, Halcion. It issued
strong condemnations of researchers who claim to have found that Halcion
causes serious psychiatric side effects among some users.
In the same sector, Pfizer rose initially on the news that researchers in
Boston have reported on their preliminary human tests with an experimental
drug for adult-onset diabetes, but eventually succumbed to market-wide
selling and ended down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 76 1/4 . The drug is licensed
to Pfizer and another company.
Other drug stocks, which were heavily sold last week on rotational trading
by investors switching between sectors, were mixed. Glaxo put on Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 31 5/8 but Schering-Plough declined Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 60
7/8 .
UAL dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 152 in the wake of last Friday's warning
that it expected to report the largest three-month loss in its history for
the fourth quarter.
Raytheon, which shot to fame during the Gulf war as the maker of the Patriot
anti-missile weapon, weakened Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 87 1/4 on reports
that it has submitted a bid for General Dynamics' Cessna aircraft unit.
Dynamics retreated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 59 1/2 .
On the over-the-counter market, Landmark Graphics tumbled Dollars 4 1/2 to
Dollars 20 3/4 after reporting fiscal second-quarter income of 30 cents a
share, up from a year earlier but still below market estimates.
Canada
TORONTO failed to establish a clear trend although trading was fairly heavy.
The composite index eased 2.6 to close at 3,655.7, but rises narrowly
outnumbered falls by 329 to 280 after a volume of 30.5m shares, down from
Friday's 34.9m.
The gold group had the day's biggest gain among the sub-indices, a rise of
1.5 per cent.
Canadian Pacific Forest fell CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 26 1/4 . The company
said it will issue 8.5m common shares at CDollars 26.50 apiece. It currently
has about 44m shares outstanding.
Bombardier 'A' rose CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 31 1/2 and the 'B' added
CDollars  7/8 at CDollars 31 1/2 . The company's president said he is
confident that negotiations will be successfully completed for Bombardier to
buy a stake in Boeing's de Havilland unit.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates close level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK money rates eased slightly in the face of a substantial liquidity
shortage yesterday, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.55bn in early morning,
later revised up to Pounds 1.7bn. The main factor was maturing treasury
bills and earlier assistance totalling Pounds 1.38bn.
However, following the volatility of short rates last week which saw
overnight money trade as high as 30 per cent, market participants were keen
to take assistance
In early assistance, the Bank of England injected a hefty Pounds 1.251bn.
The main component was the purchase of Pounds 679m paper for resale to the
market at 10 7/16 per cent in equal instalments on February 5 and 6. The
balance was mostly in the form of band 1 bank bills, purchased at 10 3/8 per
cent.
In late morning an additional Pounds 200m was injected, again through the
purchase of short-dated band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Afternoon
assistance comprised the buying of Pounds 248m band 1 bills, with a late
injection of Pounds 90m.
This was sufficient to drive short rates down to well below Friday's closing
levels. Overnight unsecured funds traded down to 8 per cent in
mid-afternoon, from 11-10 3/4 per cent late on Friday. However, later in the
day short rates firmed and finished at 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange traded up to 89.77, from 89.70 on Friday. This implies base
rates of 10.33 per cent by the spring from a current rate of 10.5 per cent.
In Frankfurt, call money continued to trade around 9.40/50 per cent,
unchanged from the levels seen last week. Tax payments continued to drain
funds from the market, but there is sufficient liquidity to keep rates
comfortably below the Lombard rate.
The Bank of Japan injected more liquidity than expected yesterday, leading
analysts to comment that the authorities were ensuring an ample supply of
funds against the background of a weak stock market. The Nikkei stock market
index fell 407.5 points to close at 20,913.8, the lowest level since October
1990.
In its regular operations, the Bank of Japan injected Y1,600bn funds, more
than the forecast shortage of Y1,430bn. This ensured easier short money
rates. Call money traded down to 5 9/16 per cent, from 5 5/8 per cent on
Friday.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen holds gains against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN remained strong against other currencies on the foreign exchange
market yesterday but trading stayed cautious following intervention by the
US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan late on Friday in favour of the
Japanese currency, writes Simon London.
While the scale of intervention on Friday was limited, with both central
banks selling dollars against the yen, the effect was dramatic.
From a close in London at Y127.45, the dollar stood at Y124.45 by the end of
trading in New York on Friday.
The move was interpreted by analysts as a clear sign that the US authorities
do not want the dollar to appreciate from current levels. A stronger
currency in general could stifle domestic economic recovery and inflate the
already huge US trade deficit with Japan.
The yen gained further ground on the US currency in Tokyo trading as dealers
digested the consequences of intervention. By the close in Tokyo the dollar
stood at Y123.95.
Against the D-Mark the US currency was also weaker, closing at DM1.5863,
from DM1.5920 in New York.
In European trading a cautious tone prevailed, with few dealers willing to
take on new positions ahead of the weekend's G7 meeting of finance ministers
and central bankers.
Against the D-Mark, the dollar rallied to DM1.5985 during the day but was
unable to break through resistance at the DM1.60 level. The US unit ended at
DM1.5970, from DM1.6070 in London on Friday. In New York the dollar slipped
back to end at DM1.5905.
The yen maintained its position as finance ministers spoke out in favour of
a strong Japanese currency. By the close in London the dollar stood at
Y123.65, having traded in a tight Y123.35 to Y124.50 range through the day.
In New York the US unit eased to Y123.25.
However, many analysts are still expecting the dollar to appreciate over the
longer term, whatever the wishes of the US Administration.
For example, analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd suggest that the US currency
could fall to around Y120 over the next few days but is set to appreciate to
Y140 by the end of the year.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark continued to soften.
The peseta remained the strongest currency in the system and rose to
Pta63.21 against the German unit during the afternoon, from Pta63.37 at the
opening.
This lifted the floor for sterling, the weakest currency in the system, to
around DM2.8540 from DM2.8475 at the end of last week. The UK currency
responded by strengthening and remaining just above the floor, underlining
that the sterling/D-Mark exchange rate is linked to expectations that
central banks would intervene with some force if the lower limit was
breached. The pound strengthened from DM2.8550, Friday's London close, to
stand at DM2.86 by yesterday's finish.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Riyad Bank seeks to raise
SR3.8bn in new equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIYAD BANK, the largest in Saudi Arabia, is seeking nearly to double its
capital base in a move which could herald the start of a wider
recapitalisation of the Saudi banking system.
If successful, the offer to Saudi investors would raise SR3.8bn in new
equity for the bank, which had shareholders' funds of SR4.6bn at the end of
1990. The bank said the new equity, plus retained earnings from last year,
would double the bank's capital-to-assets ratio to about 10 per cent. This
would give it the best ratio of any bank in the kingdom. The bank does not

The move aims to provide extra capacity to meet new loan demand in the
kingdom in the aftermath of the Gulf war, the bank said. The 8m shares on
offer, at SR475 each, are restricted to Saudi investors. Riyad Bank is also
adding to its equity base through a five-for-one capitalisation issue.

BLOCKBUSTER Entertain-ment, the fast-growing but sometimes controversial US
video rental group, lifted 1991 after-tax profits by 36 per cent to Dollars
93.7m, but saw only modest growth in same-store rental revenue.
In the fourth quarter alone, net profits were up by 37 per cent, at Dollars
29m, while earnings per share were 17 cents, against 13 cents. This was
roughly in line with brokers' estimates although the shares eased  1/4 to
Dollars 13 3/4 yesterday.
Blockbuster, which is attempting to acquire Britain's Citivision and in
which Philips Electronics of the Netherlands has a small investment, has
expanded rapidly during the year.
It has added 446 stores, taking the total to over 2,000. About half of these
are company-owned and the rest run on a franchise basis.
This was reflected in the substantial overall revenue growth, up by 34 per
cent to Dollars 1.52bn for the year. But same-store revenue for
company-owned stores which have been open for over a year, rose by only 7.7
per cent. Within this figure, same-store rental revenues rose by 4.9 per
cent.
Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster's chairman and also a founding partner in
Waste Management, the waste disposal business, claimed the company was
pleased with the figures, 'given the generally difficult economic
conditionswhich affected retailing during the year'.

TEXTRON, the Rhode Island-based aerospace and financial services group,
announced last night that it had won the auction for Cessna Aircraft
Company, which manufactures business jets and cargo planes and is currently
owned by General Dynamics.
General Dynamics, the second largest US defence group, has been shrinking
its operations recently and concentrating on core businesses. It put Cessna
up for sale last October, and only last week Dassault Aviation, the French
maker of business and military jets, announced that it would be making an
offer for the General Dynamics subsidiary.
Textron has agreed to pay Dollars 600m in cash for Cessna, whichGeneral
Dynamics bought for Dollars 660m 1985.
Cessna, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, had sales last year of around
Dollars 820m. It has produced general aviation aircraft for much of its
history but, in the early 1980s, refocused operations on its Citation
business jet and Caravan utility turboprop aircraft. The latter is used for
both cargo and passenger service, finding customers amongst the express
package delivery companies, such as Federal Express.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors' Canadian subsidiary is indefinitely laying off 9 per cent of
the workforce at an engine plant in St Catharines, Ontario, as a result of
the continuing weakness in the North American car and truck market.
A GM official said yesterday that the lay-offs, affecting 750 workers, are
not directly related to the long-term belt-tightening programme announced by
Mr Robert Stempel, GM chairman, last month.
He said they reflected declining production volumes at the plant, which is
located 50 miles south-west of Toronto.
The St Catharines facility, which employs a total of 8,000 people, produces
V6 and V8 engines as well as transmission components, castings and other
parts. About 75 to 80 per cent of its production is exported to the US.
As many as 1,700 workers at St Catharines have been affected by temporary
lay-offs in recent weeks. The lay-offs will take effect on March 1.
A GM assembly plant at Oshawa, east of Toronto, employing over 3,000
workers, is among those threatened with closure under the restructuring
announced by Mr Stempel. A decision on the plant's fate is expected within
the next month or two.

UNITED Technologies, the US aerospace, automotive and building products
group, is expected to announce details today of a major restructuring,
designed to cut Dollars 1bn from the group's costs.
UTC, which has been hard hit by the US recession and the Pentagon's
declining defence equipment budget, will also announce losses for the fourth
quarter and full 1991 year.
UTC announced last November that it would have to take a large restructuring
charge in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a programme to cut Dollars 1bn
from annual costs by the end of 1993, and that this would push into losses
both for the quarter and the year.
Analysts are speculating that the move could involve major reorganisation at
its Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine business, which has already introduced a
voluntary severance and retirement programme.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Upjohn hits back at critical
report on Halcion sleeping pill
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company that manufactures
Halcion, the world's most widely prescribed sleeping pill, yesterday denied
a report that for several years it concealed data from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) showing it caused serious psychiatric side effects.
The debate over Halcion, underway for the past two years, has been ignited
in recent months following the decision last October by UK health
authorities to ban sales in Britain.
Consumer activists in the US have been campaigning for the FDA to ban
Halcion in the US, but the FDA at present is merely reviewing the safety of
the drug. Halcion is sold in 89 countries.
Since the UK ban last October, Upjohn's share price has declined by more
than 11 per cent. Yesterday, trading in Upjohn stock was delayed after a
report in the New York Times quoted critics of the company claiming the
drug's side-effects had been concealed by the company. Upjohn's share price
closed yesterday down by Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 41 1/2 .
Halcion is Upjohn's second largest selling product, with estimated 1991
sales of Dollars 260m worldwide.
The company has taken an aggressive stance with its critics, an example of
which was its announcement yesterday that it planned to bring a lawsuit
against Dr Ian Oswald, a Scottish psychiatrist who alleged Upjohn failed to
adequately report all the side-effects it found with Halcion.
Dr Theodore Cooper, chairman of Upjohn, yesterday issued an angry statement,
saying: 'These repeated false and reckless charges of fraudulent concealment
by Dr Oswald cannot and will not be condoned.' The Upjohn chief claimed the
New York Times had been misled about Halcion, and said regulatory agencies
around the world had also been misled.
Apart from suing critics, Upjohn has lodged an appeal against the UK
decision to suspend sales.
Last November, the company tried to defuse criticism of Halcion by saying it
would package the drug in smaller quantities and include inserts advising
patients of side-effects. This was deemed insufficient by the Public Citizen
Health Research Group, which was founded by Mr Ralph Nader, America's most
prominent consumer rights advocate.
In December, French authorities suspended sales of the high-dose form of
Halcion, a decision Upjohn said it would appeal.
Earlier this month, Spain also suspended high dose sales of the drug.
Late last year, the European Community's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal
Products (CPMP) supported the Halcion labelling and packaging changes and
stressed the 'absolute importance' of short-term use of the drug.
In New York, Mr Viren Mehta, a drug industry analyst, said the Halcion
debate underscored the case of 'those who feel the FDA tends to take too
long to respond to possible health threats'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBUT of Nasdaq International, the early-morning market for US-listed
stocks run by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), got off
to a shaky start yesterday when two US broking firms withdrew from making
markets in New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks because of regulatory
restrictions on short sales.
First Boston and Castle Securities had planned to make markets in 17 leading
NYSE stocks - including IBM and AT&amp;T - during the system's first
early-morning session of 3.30am to 9.30am New York time. The two firms
pulled out at the last minute, however, when they realised that the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had not changed its ruling banning
short sales of Big Board stocks that did not trade above their prior-day
NYSE closing price.
Short selling is a standard trading strategy which involves dealers or
investors selling borrowed stock in the hope of profiting from a fall in the
stock by buying it back later at a lower price.
Dealing firms are uncomfortable with the SEC's strict ruling on short
selling of NYSE stocks on Nasdaq International because they regularly use
short sales as a hedge against a falling market.
The two firms, however, did join a handful of other London and New York
dealers in making markets in over-the-counter stocks on Nasdaq
International. When the session closed, 106,000 shares had changed hands, a
figure which did not disappoint NASD officials, who had expected a light
trading start.

CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products is raising CDollars 225m (USDollars
193.90m) with an equity issue sold partly to the public and partly to its
parent, Canadian Pacific.
CPFP, one of Canada's top three pulp and paper groups, is issuing a total
8.5m new shares at CDollars 26.50 each. About 6.8m will be sold to the
public and 1.7m to CP Enterprises, a CP financing subsidiary.
Analysts expected a receptive market. CPFP stock closed Friday at CDollars
27.50, against a 52-week low of CDollars 22.25 and a high of CDollars 35.
Last week, the company said it was shutting down a loss-making paper mill
near Montreal and also two older machines at its big New Brunswick newsprint
mill.
Although it will post a heavy loss for the final quarter of 1991, its
fortunes should improve in 1992 and a return to profitability is expected in
1993.
The CDollars 225m will make up an expected shortfall in 1992 cashflow.
CPFP is spending CDollars 300m on completing modernisation at its other
mills in north America and on two newsprint de-inking plants in Quebec and
Ontario.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Industry shake-up opens airways
over new Europe - Modernisation and western alliances are transforming
airlines east of the Elbe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE emergence of Air France as leader of a consortium to buy a 40 per cent
stake in Ceskeslovenske Aerolinie (CSA), the Czechoslovak national airline,
has heated up the competition to restructure the air transport industry from
the Elbe River to the Pacific Ocean.
With an eye on the potential for rapid business and tourist traffic growth
in central Europe, western airlines and aircraft makers are seeking new
partners and new customers.
Significantly, the CSA announcement coincided with confirmation from Polskie
Linie Lotnicze (LOT), the Polish state airline, that it had disposed of the
bulk of its Soviet-built aircraft fleet to Air Ukraine, one of a number of
new national airlines emerging from the parallel dissolution of Aeroflot and
the Soviet Union.
Mr Bronislaw Klimaszewski, LOT president, has consistently made clear his
belief that the Polish company, the largest of the central European
airlines, would have to dispose of its fleet of Soviet-built aircraft before
being able to attract a foreign partner. Warsaw, with its
soon-to-be-completed air terminal, is competing with Prague and Budapest to
become the leading hub airport for east and central Europe. One, or a
series, of new hub airports in the centre of the continent will be needed to
relieve pressure on overcrowded west European air space. Which location
emerges as the most important hub will depend largely on the choice of
foreign partner and the sort of traffic volumes it can generate.
LOT's success in selling its seven long-range Ilyushin-62s and 10 virtually
obsolete Antonov-24 short-haul turbo-jets to the fledgling Ukrainian airline
has gone a long way toward improving LOT's chances of finding a western
partner. It is left with 14 medium-range Tupolev-154s and a handful of
smaller Tu-134s still to sell.
The emergence of new national airlines in the former Soviet Union provides a
unique chance to off-load thirsty, obsolescent and sometimes dangerous
Soviet-built aircraft. The only alternative market is China, which also
flies large numbers of Soviet aircraft and is used to the problem of
obtaining, and often re-working, ill-fitting spare parts for engines and
airframes.
LOT has held preliminary talks with a number of western airlines, including
Air France, Lufthansa and El Al, and has also partially re-equipped with
leased western aircraft. It flies two Boeing 767s on its transatlantic route
with another to be delivered soon.
After cancelling a deal to acquire aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, LOT
recently signed a Dollars 300m deal for nine Boeing 737s to renew its fleet
for European routes. It is also taking delivery of eight Franco-Italian
ATR-72 turboprops to complete its fleet of all-western aircraft.
LOT's search for a western partner is mirrored by Malev, the Hungarian
national airline which already operates out of a smart new airport in
Budapest. Malev, which reported a Dollars 15m profit last year, already
leases three Boeing 737-200s and one BA-146. It also recently re-painted and
re-furbished to western standards the interiors of its current fleet of 12
Tu-154s and six Tu-134s. Malev's search for a foreign partner is being
orchestrated by Credit Suisse First Boston.
But it is in the former Soviet Union itself that some of the biggest changes
are happening, both in the airline and the aircraft industries. Aeroflot,
which has a fleet of over 3,000 fixed-wing passenger and transport aircraft,
flies more than 132m passengers annually. But growing shortages of aviation
fuel and a rapidly-ageing fleet are now causing havoc.
Although perceived as a highly-centralised operation, Aeroflot has actually
long operated as a series of linked operating companies. It is now splitting
into a plethora of independent national airlines, and faces the prospect of
competition on internal routes for the first time.
Last year, British Airways took a 31 per cent stake in a joint venture with
the international division of Aeroflot to create Air Russia.
It will lease extended-range Boeing 767 aircraft and build a new
international terminal at Moscow's Domodedovo airport.
Hitherto a domestic terminal of legendary overcrowding and inefficiency,
Domodedovo will become a new hub for inter-continental traffic between
Europe and North America and destinations in south-east and east Asia.
Typically, aircraft would leave London, Paris, Frankfurt and other European
cities for the relatively short flight to Domodedovo. The flights would all
arrive within minutes. Passengers would then board ongoing flights to Seoul,
Singapore, Tokyo or Bangkok. Later in the day, passengers arriving on the
long-haul leg from Asian capitals would transfer to the same European
destinations.
British Airways is investing a modest Pounds 20m in the scheme. All the
aircraft will be leased, but maintained by BA. Most of the airline's income
will be in hard currency, its main attraction for the Russian shareholder.
Shortage of foreign currency, and the looming foreign debt crisis, places a
big question mark over Aeroflot's ability to buy more western aircraft or
allow domestic aircraft producers to re-equip with more fuel-efficient
engines they so desperately need.
The slowdown in the Soviet economy, where production fell by an estimated 15
to 20 per cent last year, has been reflected in further delays in the
production of the planned new generation of Soviet passenger aircraft. The
main aircraft needed by Aeroflot is the Tupolev 204, to replace the ageing
medium-range Tu-154s, and the Ilyushin 96, meant to be the replacement for
the Ilyushin-62, which came into service in the early 1960s.
Abolition of the former central ministry, which dealt with aircraft
procurement, has lead to transformation of the major design bureaux -
Tupolev, Ilyushin, Mikoyan (Mig), Antonov and Yak - into production
companies. Hitherto, the design bureaux competed to produce plans for
military or civilian aircraft. But actual production was contracted out to
the several hundred aircraft component and assembly plants which frequently
assembled different models at the same plant.
In theory, there is enormous potential for joint ventures between western
engine and airframe manufacturers and their Soviet counterparts, whose often
brilliant design teams have been handicapped up until now by Cocom
restrictions on the transfer of western technology.
But without western financing on a heroic scale, many of the agreements and
joint ventures discussed in recent years seem destined to tread water until
broader agreement is reached.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GWR Dollars 24m in loss and cost-cut plan
launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT Western Resources, the troubled US-based oil, gas and coal company
with a USM quote in London, yesterday announced a swingeing cost-cutting
programme and suspended the dividend as it revealed pre-tax losses of
Dollars 24m (Pounds 13.4m) for the year to September 30.
The loss, which compared to previous profits of Dollars 4.7m, was struck on
revenue down 13 per cent to Dollars 134.7m.
The disproportionate decline in profits partly stems from GWR's legal
dispute with its largest customer, the South Carolina Public Services
Authority. SCPSA, which disputes the validity of the GWR contract, has
withheld Dollars 33m in payments for coal shipments.
Mr Howard Wolf, who replaced Mr Dan Pena as chairman in December, said the
group had recovered between 25 and 30 per cent of the SCPSA business through
new customers. 'We are doing everything we can to ensure the long-term
survival of the company,' he said.
Overheads would be cut by up to 40 per cent this year, he added, and a
compensation committee would review executive salaries and fees.
Exploration and development programmes in the oil and gas division were also
being curtailed after talks with banks. These had agreed to defer debt
payments totalling Dollars 10m until October 31 1992. GWR carries total debt
of about Dollars 75m.
During the year, the group increased remaining proven oil reserves, after
accounting for production, by 41 per cent. Remaining proven gas reserves
rose 16 per cent.
Losses worked through at 26 cents (earnings 6 cents). Dividends for the
previous year totalled 5.5p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After allowing for exceptional reorganisation costs, RPS Group is expected
to incur a significant loss for 1991, and the dividend is to be cut.
The final will be 0.6p for a total of 2p, against 3.2p in 1990 when the
group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.74m.
RPS, engaged in environmental consultancy work, is reorganising its
operations in England from 10 local offices into four regional centres. The
Scottish and Irish operations already have regional centres.
It will cost Pounds 800,000, principally relating to disposal of leases and
staff relocation, which will be phased over 18 months.
Management accounts showed the group traded at about break-even in
July-November, after producing a pre-tax profit of Pounds 302,000 (Pounds
907,000) in the first half. The reorganisation will produce immediate and
sustainable operating cost savings, the company said.
The proposed dividend reflected the group's future prospects.

has continued.' Order books all round were up on last time. A return to
profitability and the dividend list remained the company's aim.
Losses per share were reduced to 1.24p (5.51p).

Resort Hotels expanded in the half year to October 31, with turnover
increasing 25 per cent and pre-tax profits 27 per cent.
A tight control on costs limited the impact on profits of revenue falling

Turnover amounted to Pounds 7.62m (Pounds 6.09m) and profit to Pounds 2.92m

received rose to Pounds 954,000 (Pounds 652,000). The group raised Pounds
12m via a rights issue a year ago and issued a Pounds 20m debenture last
November to replace short term borrowings.
Earnings per share fell to 3.82p (4.41p) allowing for the new shares in
issue, and the interim dividend is again 1.2p - a 10.7 per cent increase
after the bonus element, the company claimed.
Three hotels were added to the network by way of management contracts; that
brought the total to 44. Agreements had also been entered into with Country
Resort Hotels and County Resort Hotels to purchase them by the end of 1992
and 1993 respectively.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Intercare trebles to more than Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Intercare Group, a supplier of healthcare products, more than doubled
turnover and trebled pre-tax profit in the year to end-October.
There was strong organic growth and all divisions - including dental,
optical, mobility and specialist pharmaceutical - continued to trade
profitably. The result included a six months' contribution from Booster
Electric Vehicles and two months' from Montis Medical.
Turnover rose to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 6.78m) and profit to Pounds 1.52m
(Pounds 504,000). Earnings per share worked through at 7.5p on significantly
higher capital (4.1p) and a final divided of 1.5p makes the total of 2p
(1.25p).
Mr Peter Cowan, chairman, said the most significant event of the year was
the acquisition of Booster and 75 per cent of Montis, which distributes
healthcare products - including the electric vehicles assembled by Booster -
primarily in the Netherlands.
'We have been very pleased with their performance since joining the group',
Mr Cowan told shareholders.
The group had entered the current year in 'a very positive manner'. The UK
side was showing good organic growth and there were 'exciting' European
operations through Montis. Net cash at October 31 was Pounds 2.23m, against
an overdraft of Pounds 750,000 the year before.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BT to sell alarms offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications plans to sell Telecom Security, its alarm systems
offshoot, as part of a programme of getting back to its basic business of
running telephone networks.
The company has been in discussions with several possible buyers for its 90
per cent stake during the past few weeks. There is speculation that BT has
been talking to other leading suppliers of alarm systems, such as Chubb and
Group 4 Security as well as Mr Pedar Kolind, the Norwegian businessman who
established Telecom Security and still owns 10 per cent.
The business, which has 40,000 residential and business customers, is
estimated to be worth about Pounds 20m. BT expects to complete a sale within
three to six months.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Early fears of Maxwell pension misuse -
Mirror fund threatened with liquidation after employee demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER employees of companies owned by Mr Robert Maxwell said yesterday
there were 'warning lights' about the possible misuse of pension fund monies
as long as two years ago.
Mr Glyn Evans, a former shopfloor worker at Floform, the Welsh automotive
components company owned briefly by Maxwell Communication Corporation in the
late 1980s, told the House of Commons social security committee that he had
taken early retirement in February 1990 and applied to receive his full
entitlement from the pension scheme. He was told there were no funds
available.
Mr Maxwell had sold Floform to the James Wilkes group in December 1989, but
retained control of the pension fund. Mr Evans said he was not paid in full
until 14 months later. No explanation was given.
Other past and present employees of Floform and Mirror Group Newspapers
warned Members of Parliament that thousands of people faced great
uncertainty over whether pensions would continue to be paid and about the
fate of contributions still being paid into Maxwell funds.
Evidence from the Graphical, Paper and Media Union showed Mr Maxwell
threatened to liquidate the Mirror Group fund when faced in May 1985 by
demands to allow pension scheme members to nominate half the trustees and
have an independent chairman.
'Mr Maxwell said that he would not be dictated to as to who would be
trustees, he was the owner of the fund, and had full control of it,' the
union's report said.
'If union rights to appoint trustees were insisted upon, he would liquidate
the fund.'
A catalogue of other complaints from the union included constant erosion of
the representation of employees on the board of trustees, and difficulties
obtaining information about the fund.
When the union made a request for an actuarial valuation in September 1989,
it was given one dated 1985. The 1988 valuation was made available only in
March 1990, days before a court application was due to be heard.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BAe faces setback in Saudi arms deal -
Timing of finance director's departure adds to embarrassment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace faces further delays in its efforts to complete
negotiations on a Pounds 10bn arms contract with Saudi Arabia.
The company was hoping to complete soon the second phase of its Al Yamamah
defence deal involving construction of a new airbase and orders for new
Tornado and Hawk aircraft.
But there are growing signs in the UK and Saudi Arabia that the Saudis are
unlikely to make a decision in the government-to-government negotiations
before a British election in April or May.
The contract would give BAe a much-needed boost at a time when the company
is still struggling to regain the confidence of the City after its
unsuccessful rights issue and the resignation of Professor Sir Roland Smith,
its chairman, last September.
The setback in the delicate negotiations came as the company officially
confirmed yesterday that Mr Dudley Eustace, its finance director, would
leave the board 'by mutual agreement' after its annual meeting this spring.
Although the departure of Mr Eustace was not altogether unexpected after the
rights issue, the timing of the announcement was clearly embarrassing for
BAe.
The company, which was planning to announce Mr Eustace's resignation after a
successor had been found at about the time of the annual meeting, has been
desperately trying to portray a picture of corporate stability after last
year's top management crisis.
The announcement of Mr Eustace's resignation, coupled with disclosures that
the company faced an Pounds 80m property claim from Asda, the supermarket
group, hit BAe shares yesterday. They fell sharply in early trading from
314p to 288p, subsequently recovering to close at 302p.
BAe said in its statement yesterday that Mr Eustace's departure had no
connection with its discussions with Asda over the supermarket group's claim
against BAe's Arlington property company.
The statement said: 'The board of BAe announces with regret and by mutual
agreement that Dudley Eustace, in whom the board has the fullest confidence,
intends to stand down as a director of the company following the annual
general meeting.'
BAe insiders also confirmed that Mr Eustace was leaving amicably and that
there had been no 'bust-up'.
'After Professor Smith's resignation we always felt there would have to be
more scalps. We would have been surprised if it had not happened,' one City
analyst said yesterday. 'Mr Eustace was well liked in the City but had to
pay for the rights issue flop,' another analyst added.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons moves to restructure
management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks,food and retailing group, yesterday announced a
management restructuring designed to sharpen the focus on its international
development.
Four regional councils are to be set up to promote overall strategies and
operating efficiencies in the group's main markets.
Mr John Giffen, 52, will give up his operational posts as chairman and chief
executive of the wines and spirits division to which he was appointed last
year, to join the group's headquarters team as chairman of the Americas
council.
Mr Michael Jackaman, chairman, will head the council for western Europe; Mr
Tony Hales, chief executive, will oversee the Far East and Africa; and Mr
Roy Moss, chairman and chief executive of the brewing division, will head
the UK council.
'Each regional chairman will have the clear objective of making sure that we
miss no opportunity for growth and synergy in our priority markets,' said Mr
Jackaman.
The group is also reorganising its business into four operational sectors,
including for the first time, a separate retailing arm.
Mr David Jarvis, 44, who was last year appointed chairman and chief
executive of J Lyons, will become chief executive of the spirits and wines
operations which contribute about half of group profits. Mr Hales will be
chairman, and Mr Giffen, deputy chairman.
Mr Tony Trigg, 51, will become chief executive of the retailing sector which
will include Allied's 6,000 pubs, the 1,000 Victoria Wine shops and the
Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts franchise stores operating in the US and
internationally.
Mr Moss, who will be chairman of the retailing sector, and Mr Trigg will
continue to run the brewing and wholesaling operations.
The two men will be Allied's representatives on the board of the proposed
Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture.
Mr Hales will head the food manufacturing sector, consisting of the J Lyons
beverages, bakery and ingredients businesses, with Mr David Beatty, 59, the
present corporate development director of Hiram Walker, as deputy chairman.
Mr Peter Macfarlane, group finance director, will join the boards of spirits
and wines, retailing, and food manufacture.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Private hearing for Berlitz dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN APPLICATION by Macmillan, the main publishing subsidiary of Maxwell
Communication Corporation, in connection with the disputed ownership of a
55.6 per cent stake in Berlitz was heard in private in the High Court
yesterday after a judge was told it was a matter of 'extreme commercial
sensitivity', writes Raymond Hughes.
Five banks have claimed ownership of most of the stake, which is also
claimed by Macmillan, as collateral for loans extended to companies within
the Maxwell empire.
Asking for the application to be heard in camera, Mr David Oliver QC, for
Macmillan, told Mr Justice Ferris that last month Swiss Volksbank and Credit
Suisse had undertaken not to dispose of certain shares without prior notice
to Macmillan. Last week both banks had given such notice.
Mr Oliver said the shares were in a company in which Macmillan held a very
substantial stake, the balance being quoted on the New York Stock Exchange.
Four more private companies in the Maxwell empire were put into
administration by a High Court judge yesterday. Mr Justice Mummery made
administration orders on Media Expenditure Analysis, PHA Investments,
Multiphase Systems and The Media Register. The judge also appointed interim
managers of Questel Qualitative Studies and Maxwell Legal Services, pending
applications next Monday for those companies also to be put into
administration.
The orders were made on applications by Mr John Talbot, of accountants
Arthur Andersen, now the administrator of 44 Maxwell private companies.

<TEXT>
A Tenerife judge is considering whether to reopen the investigation into Mr
Robert Maxwell's death having received the video of a second autopsy from
Paris Match, the magazine. However, the prosecutor in Santa Cruz thought it
unlikely the video would reveal anything which would lead to a new
investigation.
Paris Match last week alleged that the autopsy, carried out in Israel
shortly before Mr Maxwell was buried, found signs of beating on the body.
The edition was later removed from sale amid claims of inaccuracies.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Strange alliances in the water wars: Players from France,
Italy and Switzerland are drawn to the drama over Perrier's ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Even by French standards, where the intricate webs of corporate holdings and
cross-holdings recall the incestuous sub-plots and shifting alliances of Les
Liaisons Dangereuses, the machinations over the ownership of Source Perrier,
the world's biggest mineral water group, are unusually tortuous.
Yesterday the saga took a turn when Nestle of Switzerland, the world's
largest food manufacturer, joined forces with Banque Indosuez, a powerful
Parisian bank, to mount a FFr13.24bn (Pounds 1.36bn) bid for Perrier.
The bid comes only a few weeks after Ifint, an investment vehicle of the
Italian Agnelli family, made a FFr5.6bn offer for Exor, the wine and
property group which controls 35 per cent of Perrier.
On the face of it, the latest turn of events has pitted two of Europe's most
powerful business empires into head-to-head confrontation and split the
French financial establishment down the middle.
However, the relationships linking the different parties are so complex  -
and the ultimate motives of most of them so murky - that stock market
analysts were yesterday unsure whether the skirmishing would develop into
all-out war or be settled amicably by behind-the-scenes negotiation.
Among the French protagonists, the Suez group, owner of Banque Indosuez,
holds 10 per cent of Exor. Meanwhile, Saint Louis, a French sugar, paper and
packaging company in which the Agnellis own a stake, recently paid FFr1.5bn
for 13.8 per cent of Perrier. Saint Louis also owns 3 per cent of BSN, the
French food group.
The Agnellis indirectly own 5.8 per cent of BSN and have made no secret that
their aim is to raise the stake further.
However, BSN is also linked with Nestle. The two groups recently teamed up
to bid for Cokoladovny, a Czech confectionery company, and yesterday BSN
agreed to buy Perrier's Volvic mineral water business for an undisclosed sum
if Nestle's bid succeeds.
The agreement appears designed to smooth the path of the European Commission
approving an eventual takeover of Perrier by the Swiss group. A deal would
almost certainly fall within the scope of the EC's 15-month-old merger
regulation, which has not yet been applied to a large acquisition in the
food and drink industry.
The Perrier saga started early last year when Ifint began buying shares in
Exor. In November Ifint launched a partial bid for Exor which, after
protests from the minority shareholders, not least from the Suez group, was
turned into a full bid.
Last summer, Ifil, another Agnelli vehicle, acquired 6.4 per cent of Saint
Louis, which it has since controlled with Worms et Cie, the French
family-owned holding company. Earlier this month Saint Louis bought its
stake in Perrier.
However the whole issue of Ifint's bid for Exor and Saint Louis' purchase of
Perrier stock has gone on ice while the French regulatory authorities
scrutinise the deals and decide whether to sanction the Saint Louis
investment.
Enter Nestle and Indosuez with their offer for Perrier, amid frenzied
speculation in the French and Italian press about the Agnellis' long-term
intentions towards BSN.
Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's 73-year-old chairman, has long been friendly with
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, head of the Italian group, and has named no heir
apparent. BSN's shares rose sharply on the Paris bourse yesterday.
Whether the significance of the recent convolutions lies chiefly in what
they say about capitalism French-style, or whether they are a portent of the
kinds of problems which may lie ahead for other, future, moves to
restructure the European food industry, is quite another matter.
Some French analysts suspect the Nestle offer is too low to be more than a
sighting shot.
'It may be that Nestle wants to flush out a counter-bidder,' said Mr John
Cousins, head of BZW-Puget Mahe, the Paris broker.
'If so who would the counter bidder be? The Agnellis? I certainly can't
imagine anyone else wanting to get involved in this mess.'
Although the Agnellis's business empire already includes foods, their
involvement is as investors rather than as hands-on managers with a deep
knowledge of the industry.
Many analysts view their recent expansion in France mainly as a form of
portfolio diversification.
In contrast, both the industrial logic of Nestle's bid, and the seriousness
of its interest in Perrier, seem clear: a spokesman for the Swiss company
said it viewed mineral water as 'a strategic axis' of its future
development, offering good long-term growth prospects.
Nestle, which seeks to cultivate a public image of wholesomeness, does not
normally indulge in hostile bids - particularly if, like that for Perrier,
they involve it in high-profile political manoeuvring.
Its successful bid for Rowntree three years ago was an exception and appears
to have been partly an attempt to pre-empt a takeover of the UK chocolate
maker by Suchard, Nestle's Swiss arch-rival in confectionery.
Similar considerations seem to have influenced yesterday's bid. Nestle said
only last week that it had been considering bidding for Perrier, before it
was thwarted by the Agnellis.
Nestle, which is a world leader in instant coffee, confectionery and dairy
products, is already the world's third largest mineral water supplier.
Its interests include Vittel in France - the still water market leader of
which it recently acquired full control - Ashbourne in Britain and several
smaller companies in Germany and the US.
However, it still trails a distant third in the business behind Perrier and
BSN, which had 1990 mineral water sales of FFr8.7bn and FFr5.2bn
respectively. Vittel, Nestle's biggest mineral water subsidiary by far, had
sales of only FFr1.9bn.
Acquisition of Perrier, even without Volvic, would leapfrog Nestle into a
commanding lead in the business, with best-selling brands including
Contrexeville and Vichy in France and Arrowhead, Great Bear and Poland
Spring in the US.
Though sales of Perrier's best-known brand were hurt by a benzene scare in
1990, the mineral water market has continued to expand strongly, because of
consumers' increasing concern with health and fitness.
It is also a highly profitable business: in the first half of this year, BSN
earned an operating margin of 21 per cent on its mineral water activities.
It is less clear, however, whether Nestle would want to keep Perrier's other
main business, Caves de Roquefort, which distributes the famous blue cheese.
Nestle, which shed most of its cheese interests some years ago, should have
no difficulty finding bidders for the business, which controls 80 per cent
of the French roquefort market.
Obviously, the saga still has a way to run and any number of further
surprises is possible.
Some analysts were suggesting yesterday that, if the Agnellis are serious
about building up their European food interests, they may wish to avoid a
showdown at this stage with a player as powerful as Nestle and may seek a
face-saving way out of their involvement with Perrier.
As things stand, a successful Nestle bid may not leave the other parties
involved too unhappy.
Saint Louis, regulators willing, would stand to make a FFr600m paper profit
on its brief investment in Perrier, notwithstanding Nestle's threat
yesterday to take legal action to freeze Saint Louis's voting rights. BSN
would walk away with Volvic, while the longer-term prospect of taking
control of BSN would remain open to the Agnellis.
However, whatever direction developments take, it seems increasingly
unlikely that Perrier will retain either its independence or its full range
of existing business.
As one London stockbroker put it bluntly yesterday: 'Perrier is a goner. It
is part of history.'

FT  21 JAN 92 / US Treasury ready to sell more bonds without notice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury will sell more government securities without notice if it
detects attempts by investors to corner the market in new issues.
The plan for unscheduled sales of new government debt is part of a reform
study drawn up by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). The study was drawn up in the wake of an
investigation into attempts in 1990 and 1991 by Wall Street firm Salomon
Brothers to rig the market for new Treasury securities.
The reforms, which will be officially unveiled this week, are aimed at
opening up the US bond auction system, which until the Salomon scandal broke
last summer was effectively closed to all but a few big institutions and
which escaped close scrutiny from regulatory authorities.
The plan to stop 'squeezes' is the most radical part of the reform package,
and represents a significant policy change. Squeezes occur when a few
investors corner the market in a new issue and then force other investors
who need the new securities to pay inflated prices.
In the past the Treasury has refused to interfere with the workings of the
bond market, but the seriousness of the Salomon squeeze last May (when the
firm ended up controlling more than 90 per cent of a two-year note issue)
and the need to prevent further manipulations prompted the reversal.
The Treasury/Fed/SEC study recommends a complicated new system which allows
bidders to view the progress of the auction and which ultimately distributes
securities more evenly among bidders.
Any changes to the auction process, however, will not be introduced until
opinions in the market have been canvassed and the current automation of
bidding procedures has been completed.
Other reforms that the study will recommend include:
Asking Congress to grant the authorities power to force firms to disclose
large holdings of government securities, and to legislate tougher
enforcement of auction rules
Lessening the importance of primary dealers, and allowing other institutions
direct access to the auction
Improving the dissemination of market prices and data, and allowing the
public to see the pre-auction information that is normally available only on
brokers' screens
A new system to verify large customer bids.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Bankers face new loan for WPP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS are braced to receive a demand for a new loan of up to Pounds 100m
from WPP less than a year after the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 555m) debt of the
world's biggest advertising group was rescheduled.
Bankers said they expected a formal request for new money from WPP in the
next few weeks and admitted that some of the group's 40 banks may be
outraged at having to provide the additional credit so soon.
But the biggest lenders are adopting a philosophical approach: 'It is
disappointing that the business appears to need new money,' said one of the
group's leading bankers. 'But we are not pushing the panic button.'
Another banker said the banks are only likely to provide the funds if WPP
gives a commitment on a timetable for disposing of 'non-core businesses'.
But they are not expected to insist that WPP sells one of its two worldwide
networks of advertising agencies, the JWT Group and Ogilvy Group.
'There is no doubt that WPP took on too much debt when it bought JWT and
Ogilvy,' said a banker. 'But it would be disastrous to sell them, since they
are its only businesses capable of generating significant earnings.'
The bank lenders to WPP - led by the US banks JP Morgan and Bankers Trust,
Barclays of the UK and Germany's Deutsche Bank - have been kept closely
informed of the advertising group's progress since the rescheduling was
completed in April. Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, has been
reviewing WPP's monthly management accounts on behalf of the banks.
The banks are aware that WPP's businesses have performed below budget since
the refinancing. But one banker said: 'It is encouraging that WPP has not
breached its banking covenants (or conditions of the loan).'
Nonetheless he expected that the company would make a formal request to its
banks for a short-term facility of more than Pounds 50m later this month or
in early February.
Advertising industry analysts highlighted a number of possible disposals for
WPP:
They said the company's preferred option was likely to be the flotation on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange of a minority stake in its Far Eastern advertising
interests, which could raise up to Pounds 40m. Daiwa, the Japanese
investment bank, is believed to have done preliminary work for a possible
flotation.
Analysts also expected WPP to accelerate negotiations on the sale of its US
advertising agency, Scali McCabe Sloves. WPP is believed to have received an
offer from Interpublic, the US advertising group.
Disposal of all or part of its successful market research subsidiaries -
Millward Brown International, MRG Group and Research International - is
probably a last option.
At the end of 1990, WPP became concerned that it was likely to breach
covenants on its medium-term loans, so it renegotiated its borrowings with a
co-ordinating committee of lenders, led by JP Morgan.
It put in place a new medium-term facility of Dollars 400m, which is to be
repaid or refinanced by June 1993. In addition, a Dollars 604.5m term loan
is to be repaid in semi-annual instalments over four years from June 1993.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Ratners suspends dividends on its preference shares

<TEXT>
RATNERS GROUP, the struggling jewellery company, has suspended payments of
all its preference dividends prompting a share price fall in London and a
further credit downgrading in New York.
The move was foreshadowed nine days ago when Ratners said it was keeping
preference dividend payments 'under review' after it announced that it was
likely to incur annual losses of Pounds 72m.
Ratners will conserve more than Pounds 25m by not paying the preference
dividends but will have to roll up the payments and satisfy them before it
can pay out any dividends on its ordinary shares.
Mr Quintin Price, retailing analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, said: 'It
is a defensive move to demonstrate that they are limiting the cash outflow
and is inevitable in the context.'
After recovering last week, Ratners shares fell back 2 1/2 p yesterday to
close in London at 24 1/2 p.
In the US, both the Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit agencies
reacted to the news by slicing their credit ratings. Moody's cut its rating
on Ratners' Dollars 250m (Pounds 139.6m) Auction Market Preferred Stock
(Amps) from BA3 to CAA - one of its lowest grades, which indicates that the
issue may be in danger of default. Standard &amp; Poor's gave the preferred
stock a C rating, 'almost our lowest rating on preferred stock'.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Press picks over Maxwell's lair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Maxwell would have absolutely loathed the invasion of his private
sanctum. But hordes of journalists were taken on conducted tours of his
London apartment yesterday in preparation for an auction of its contents
next month.
Everything must go, from duvet covers to pots and pans which were once used
to produce delicacies for Mr Maxwell 24 hours a day.
Tangible remains of the Maxwell lifestyle will be sold on February 14, by
Sotheby's, the auction house, on behalf of Price Waterhouse, administrators
of Maxwell Communication Corporation.
The sale is expected to raise about Pounds 400,000. It will include items
such as a 16ft Regency three-pillar dining table which is estimated to be
worth between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 35,000.
Journalists inspected every room leading off the octagonal hall of the
apartment designed and decorated by Mr Jon Bannenberg, who also designed the
Lady Ghislaine, the yacht on which Mr Maxwell was last seen alive.
A television cameraman lined up a close shot of the open door of Mr
Maxwell's drinks fridge to reveal Russian vodka, Czechoslovakian pilsner
beer and champagne of 1983 vintage.
In the drawing room, photographers used a well-thumbed copy of Joe Haines'
authorised biography of Maxwell as a convenient prop. There were three lines
of obvious approval in the margin of the book against a quote from Prof MMR
Williams.
'One thing Maxwell does not do is interfere in editorial decisions; in that
respect, he is the ideal person to act as a publisher of scientific
journals,' the quote said.
In the kitchen, lists of telephone numbers pinned to the walls excited
reporters. They were the mobile numbers of all the Maxwell family and of the
suppliers of basic foods such as caviar to the Maxwell household.
Security men were quickly dispatched to take the numbers down. They are now
of no more than historic interest. All the mobile phones have long since
been disconnected.
There was every sign that the apartment, on the ninth floor of Maxwell House
in New Fetter Lane, had been completely untouched since its master went on
his last cruise.
In his bedroom, dominated by a large television set and hi-fi equipment at
the foot of his double bed, there are half-empty boxes of tissues. A
well-used loofah lies in a white circular jacuzzi of ample proportions.
Off the bathroom is Mr Maxwell's personal sauna complete with television
set. As well as conventional equipment such as a fax machine, his study has
its own shredder - Gelia Top Secret - in perfect working order.
The impromptu tour was conducted by Mr Leslie Weller, who described himself
as 'Sotheby's furniture man'. He praised the Regency table in the hall,
estimated to be worth about Pounds 10,000, and the Baltic-Russian coza-oil
burning chandelier in the dining room which may be worth between Pounds
15,000 and Pounds 20,000.
In the drawing room, with more than a touch of understatement, Mr Weller
said: 'Here you have got slightly flamboyant taste in settees.'
The only thing apparently missing was Mr Maxwell's chess set, perhaps a
personal rather than an MCC possession.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Pressure on Gillette over razor deal: Brussels likely to
rule against company's involvement in buy-out of Wilkinson Sword
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is likely to rule against the involvement of
Gillette, the razor company, in the buy-out of its main competitor,
Wilkinson Sword.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) ruled against the deal last
year.
It demanded that Gillette sell the stake in Wilkinson Sword's holding group
which it acquired through the buy-out in 1989.
The EC formally launched an inquiry last June when it sent Gillette a
lengthy statement of objection detailing criticisms of the deal.
The Commission was responding to complaints from two of Gillette's main
competitors - Bic, the French manufacturer of disposable razors, and
Warner-Lambert, the US group which makes Schick razors.
The companies gave evidence to competition officials in Brussels last month.
A final decision could be months away, but officials in Brussels now
indicate that the Commission will almost certainly force Gillette either to
amend the terms of its involvement or unwind the transaction altogether.
This would be a severe blow to the company. It has spent the past two years
trying to persuade regulators around the world that its involvement in
Wilkinson Sword would not work against competition in a market it already
dominates.
An EC ruling against the deal would leave Wilkinson Sword, one of the most
famous names in British metal working, increasingly beleaguered. Unwinding
the deal would be extremely complicated and may mean the management buy-out
team would have to seek refinancing.
The deal at the heart of inquiries is the controversial Dollars 630m (Pounds
352m) buy-out of Wilkinson Sword from Stora, the Swedish paper and forestry
group. Gillette initiated, organised and helped to finance the deal with the
aim of avoiding objections from competition authorities.
Gillette is the leading razor supplier in large parts of Europe. Its share
of the wet shave market ranges from about 45 per cent in most European
countries to 60 per cent in the UK. In France it has 70 per cent of the
market and in some non-EC countries, such as Norway and Denmark, it has more
than 85 per cent.
The group's efforts to clear the complex deal has involved more than 120
Wilkinson Sword companies in 40 countries. It has turned into an epic
struggle between the company's lawyers and competition authorities from
Brazil to Ireland, Switzerland and Canada.
Authorities in Germany and France are also inquiring into the deal.
Gillette, which would not comment on the EC investigation, said yesterday it
was still in talks with the Office of Fair Trading on how it could comply
with the MMC ruling.
The group owns 22 per cent of the non-voting stock of Swedish Match, the
vehicle used to acquire Stora's consumer products division which included
Wilkinson Sword. Gillette also provided the buy-out team with a Dollars 69m
loan.
Gillette says it does not influence Wilkinson Sword's policies.
However, Gillette has the right to prevent shareholders selling stakes to
other companies, to block a flotation of Swedish Match and to turn its stake
into ordinary voting shares which could give it management control.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Lloyd's chief might have quit if governance had changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON chief executive Mr Alan Lord said yesterday that he might
have had to quit last week if a proposal to change the way the insurance
market is governed had been accepted.
Although the Council, Lloyd's governing body, agreed the bulk of a series of
reforms put forward by a 14-strong task force, it rejected the proposed
separation of its regulatory and business development functions.
The change is regarded by the chairman of the task force, Mr David Rowland,
as being among the most important of 65 suggestions.
Last week the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than
9,000 Lloyds Names, also criticised the decision to reject it.
Mr Lord said acceptance would have delayed implementation of other reforms
suggested by the task force. These include a modification of the principle
of unlimited liability for Names, the individuals whose capital supports
underwriting at Lloyd's.
But yesterday, hinting that Lloyd's had understated its case last week, Mr
Lord said: 'If we'd gone along this route I wouldn't have felt able to go
along with it. Its the mystery of the month why they came out with it.'
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, added fuel to the fire by
describing some of the task force's thinking on governance as 'codswallop'.
The task force advocated the creation of a market board, made up mainly of
representatives of underwriting businesses, which should have responsibility
for developing the market's business strategy. The Council - on which
outside Names and nominees already have a majority - would retain its
regulatory responsibilities, although it would be strengthened by the
appointment of an independent chairman.
Mr Lord said the creation of the market board would be 'retrogressive'
because it would have reduced the effectiveness of the regulatory structure
introduced by the Lloyd's Act of 1982. At the Council meeting the proposals
had been rejected because 'in structural terms they made no sense at all.'
Mr Lord said: 'To divide the thing into two with a market board which
instituted market changes and a regulatory body snapping round its heels
trying to regulate what has already been done doesn't work.'
He also said Lloyd's would have been deprived of a 'sovereign body'. 'You
can't run an outfit with two heads,' he added.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Russian miners to demand price cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S economic reform programme came under severe pressure yesterday as
militant miners said they would demand lower prices and parliament sought to
regain some control over the government.
Meanwhile, government officials and advisers accused the Russian Central
Bank of sabotaging the reforms.
Leaders of the Kuzbass miners, who have gone on strike twice in the past
four years, are to meet the Russian president and government ministers today
or tomorrow to demand lower prices - with some of them predicting strike
action if the talks fail.
The government is already changing some policies as it becomes evident that
they are not working. Moscow Radio announced that Russia was auctioning
licences allowing the export of Dollars 90m (Pounds 50.2m) of oil and other
resources - with the money going to the import of badly needed foodstuffs.
Officials said later that the system of licence auctioning would probably
replace the requirement on exporters to change hard currency earned at half
of the market rate - a system which has been heavily criticised and widely
evaded.
Also, the new value added tax of 28 per cent is likely to be cut or even
abolished in the face of spiralling prices. This follows comments by Mr
Nikolai Ryabov, chairman of the Council of the Republic, one of the two
houses of the Russian parliament.
He said at the weekend that parliament would propose that the tax be
'reconsidered' because monopolistic state enterprises had caused prices to
'rise very steeply, not four to five times as was predicted but eight, 10 or
more times. It is clear that this is a prelude to a monopolistic price rise
rather than a prelude to the market'.
The government lays much of the blame on a huge credit expansion undertaken
last year by the Russian Central Bank whose chairman, Mr Georgy Matiukhin,
they accuse of irresponsibility. Officials say Rbs600bn of credits were
advanced last year, at an annual 6 per cent rate of interest during a period
of accelerating inflation.
Ministers see the availability of virtually no-cost credit as the largest
threat to their programme. The credit allows enterprises to push up product
prices and wait for buyers, with little incentive to increase output.
The parliamentary praesidium yesterday considered draft legislation which
would win back the right of parliament to approve the composition of the
government - a right given away last year when Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, demanded emergency powers.
Mr Yeltsin has accepted an invitation to visit Britain and is expected to
make the trip in the near future. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary,
extended the invitation for a full-scale visit during more than two hours of
talks in Moscow with the Russian leader.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: UK industry's use of languages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I sympathise with Mr James Calvert's cri de coeur about languages in
British industry (Letters, January 15).
As a languages graduate I spent 28 years working as an export and overseas
manager for three major British companies. In two cases I was succeeded by
someone who had no foreign languages and in the third case my successor
spoke no relevant language (in all other respects he was, and is, an
excellent person).
I would never have got off the ground in industry had my first managing
director not kindly sent me to a technical college to learn chemistry (of
which I had done none at school or university).
My advice to young people contemplating a career in British industry is to
study formally a technical subject or accountancy, and then learn languages
on the job, preferably abroad. Few British companies are really interested
in exports, and you will invariably be paid less than your UK counterparts.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Arts: Alban Berg - Barbican Hall/Radio 3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the BBC's mini-festival of Berg, 'An Affair with Numbers', ended on
Sunday evening, a great many listeners must have felt they had a new
familiarity with the contours and secrets of his style. Hearing virtually
all of Berg's music in one weekend brought home how often he re-deployed
elements which had a special significance for him - certain phrases,
patterns, cadences - over 30 years' worth of composing. While his musical
forms grew ever more ingenious and intricate, those expressive fingerprints
constantly recurred; they are vital clues to the sense of each new piece.
His Lyric Suite (1927) for string quartet is full of them, both backward-
and forward-looking. A few years ago, George Perle's brilliant detective
work established that it is also crammed with coded references to Berg's
secret love affair with Franz Werfel's sister; and that the code is partly
numerological, and that even the musical proportions of whole movements are
aligned to it.
Hence, obviously, the title chosen for the BBC series - though it might
mislead. Berg didn't generate his music from numbers (as some dull Darmstadt
epigones did later) but from his own feeling-laden idiom, within his ever
more obsessively calculated ground-plans, as these successive concerts made
crystal clear.
The Lindsay Quartet's account of the Lyric Suite crowned the afternoon
concert, with an awkward skew. Perle's decoding of the work has shown that
Berg's finale conceals an impassioned song-setting (of Baudelaire), a secret
between him and his inamorata. Of course it is irresistible to try it out,
now, with the words actually sung; but as broadcast, at least, Sarah
Walker's fervent, full-cry entry amid the strings sounded wildly out of
scale and unintegrated. Most of the Lindsay's playing earlier had been up to
their best standard, creatively alert and dramatic, and their account of
Berg's precocious, inspired op. 3 quartet (1910) teemed with sharp insights.
In his piano sonata, in this same programme, Peter Donohoe matched their
incisive attack and drew a high profile of Berg's moody, restless extremes.
The evening concert by the BBC Symphony brought Donohoe back to join Gyorgy
Pauk in the Chamber Concerto for piano, violin and 13 winds, which used to
sound forbidding but has somehow become 'accessible'. Excellent performance,
proportions confidently fixed by the conductor Andrew Davis; the stamp of
authentic character in Pauk's playing, however, was the outstanding feature.
That was what one missed in Der Wein, the soprano cantata that Berg wrote to
a commission while he was already at work on Lulu. Though Judith Howarth
delivered it with careful attention and attractive tone, no great conviction
about what the music means was transmitted. The result was civilised but
mild, where this piece can - on a rare occasion - take on a rapt, silvery
intensity. As in the Violin Concerto on Saturday, the BBC violins fell a
degree short of the exacerbated radiance Berg wants from them in the upper
regions.
Nor did the performance of the three Lyric Suite movements he arranged for
orchestral strings rise much above sensitive sincerity, in contrast to the
Lindsay's searing attack on the original version. (It was unwise to employ
all eight of the BBC double basses: sometimes the music sounded bottom-heavy
and sluggish, which the quartet-score never does. Oozy, yes; but not
sluggish.) With the Lulu Suite, however, Davis, the orchestra and Miss
Howarth excelled themselves.
The soprano sailed into Lulu's high-flying 'Lied' like someone with keen
ideas about what it has to say, and with the tone and technique to make
seductive sense of Berg's fearsomely difficult roulades. In other movements,
the BBC strings opened up at last; the aching beauty of Berg's most
inconsolable paragraphs must have penetrated all but the dullest ears. The
alto saxophone - a sexy major role here - was faultless.
Davis has distinguished himself in this festival, even when his meticulous
tenderness with the music has stifled a little of its energy. It was
satisfying to hear his lively operatic instincts energised by this Lulu
music at the close. The sinews of the musical action were taut and
resilient, the dramatic range imposing, Berg's subversively lovely surfaces
polished softly until they glowed with their own light. When Davis conducts
Lulu in the opera-house, I should go to a lot of trouble to hear it.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Diesel cleans up its act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently I had not driven a diesel car in earnest since the launch of
Peugeot's 405 diesel range in the late 1980s. In the past few weeks,
however, acquaintance has been renewed with several diesels - prompting the
immediate question, when it comes to the workhorse saloon and estate car
sector at least, of why most people would ever want to drive anything else?
And why, if governments are as committed to reducing urban pollution as they
claim, are there not greater financial incentives to promote the use of cars
which are more economical and environmentally 'cleaner' than their
petrol-powered counterparts?
Diesel-powered engines seem to run forever on a tankful - on last week's 405
Peugeot turbodiesel (the same engine as fitted to Citroens and Rover 400
cars) the gauge was still trying to cling to the half-full mark after nearly
400 miles. Performance of all the latest generation of high-speed car
diesels is broadly similar.
Performance-wise, the Peugeot was substantially perkier than the family
two-litre petrol Montego. The old perception that diesels are necessarily
slow, dirty and smelly is obsolete (but nevertheless still widespread).
Best of all, in precisely those areas where petrol cars' consumption is at
its worst, and emissions of exhaust pollutants most concentrated - in
congested urban areas - the diesel is at its most effective. Petrol cars
scraping 25 miles per gallon around town have diesel equivalents travelling
half as far again in such conditions, while in terms of exhaust emissions
the diesel is cleaner than even catalyst-equipped petrol cars.
To manufacturers' disappointment, the Gulf war and the sight of all those
burning oil wells did not give diesel vehicles a fierce kick-start. But
judging by a rise in UK sales throughout the post-Gulf war period, awareness
that the diesel has a lot going for it seems to be taking root.
Joe Gormezano, partner with consultants Knibb Gormezano, which recently
completed a substantial study of the European industry and prospects,
suggests that the revival now being witnessed will continue to strengthen.
The study concludes that it will be based mainly upon:
Increasing concern about exhaust emissions from petrol engines.
EC legislation aimed at harmonising fuel prices.
Technical advances which are rapidly increasing its acceptability to
consumers previously deterred by lack of performance.
Starting in October, all new petrol-engined cars in the EC will have to be
fitted with catalytic converters. This will encourage more diesel sales,
particularly in the small car sector, predicts Gormezano, because 'the
introduction of three-way catalysts will have a proportionately greater
adverse effect on the cost of small petrol-powered cars. It will also
adversely affect the fuel economy of petrol-engined cars in general'.
Perhaps most significantly, the diesel is also seen as the main beneficiary
of the harmonisation of fuel prices within the EC single market. Under the
latest EC proposals for the taxation of vehicle fuels from 1993, leaded fuel
would be subject to a recommended minimum tax of Ecu 0.49 (28p) per litre,
compared with Ecu 0.44 for unleaded and only Ecu 0.27 for diesel.
In the end, however, the future fate of diesel cars will depend on the
extent of the research effort which continues to be applied to it. On that
basis, things looks ever brighter. Germany, the EC's motor industry power
house, is making intensive efforts to develop new generations of more
powerful, quieter and 'smokeless' diesels.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Allies and opponents rally to
defend Brooke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL opponents as well as allies rallied to the support of Mr Peter
Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, in the Commons last night.
Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Brooke's main
adversary, was the first to argue that Mr Brooke's offer of resignation -
later rejected by Mr John Major, the prime minister - should not be
accepted.
Many Conservative MPs nodded in agreement when Mr McNamara insisted that Mr
Brooke's reluctant appearance as a vocalist on a Dublin television programme
only hours after the murders of seven construction workers by the IRA should
not be the cause of his departure from office.
Mr McNamara said: 'In my humble opinion it never was - and should never be -
regarded as a resigning matter.' He stressed that those who knew Mr Brooke
admired his hard work and courage, and regarded his offer to resign as
'characteristically honest and courageous'.
Another political opponent, Mr John Hume (SDLP Foyle), paid tribute to Mr
Brooke's efforts to promote a settlement, and appealed to the prime minister
to ensure that Mr Brooke continued to hold the Northern Ireland portfolio.
Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North), former leader of the Commons, said Mr
Brooke's offer was 'entirely characteristic'. He said the House recognised
the formidable qualities Mr Brooke brought to one of the most taxing
government positions.
Mr Merlyn Rees (Lab Morley and south Leeds), a former Northern Ireland
secretary, insisted that Mr Brooke's resignation offer should 'not be
considered'.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): TGWU and GMB initiative fuels talk of
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MERGER between the TGWU and GMB general worker unions was the subject of
heightened speculation yesterday as the two unions, Britain's largest,
launched an initiative to improve employer training for their members.
The campaign, to secure the right of their 2m members to at least five days'
training a year, is the first significant initiative in recent years between
the two unions alone.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary and Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general
secretary-elect, would not be drawn yesterday about prospects for a merger
but nor did they rule it out. Just a few months ago it would have seemed
virtually impossible that the two unions, traditional rivals for recruits
throughout industry, would contemplate amalgamation.
However, a growing number of officials and activists are considering the
possibilities.
Mr Edmonds said yesterday that he and Mr Morris were aware of the symbolism
of the joint initiative. 'We cover a lot of the same areas; where we see
areas for potential joint co-operation we will work together. If anything
comes of that in the longer term we will deal with that then.'
The possibility of a merger has gained credence in recent months as the two
leaders have established a strong working relationship and a decline in
membership, common to all unions in the recession, has strengthened
arguments for economies of scale.
The likely mergers of Nupe, Nalgo and Cohse public-service unions and of the
EETPU and AEU manufacturing industry unions mean that the GMB and TGWU's
positions as the largest unions are threatened.
Mr Morris said the unions needed to push training towards the top of the
bargaining agenda. 'While unions negotiate about pay in nine out of 10
workplaces where they have members, they only negotiate about training in
two out of every 10.'
Mr Edmonds said the aim was to ensure training as a right for every employee
and 'not just a raffle prize in a lottery'. It should be an benefit
alongside pay, pensions and holidays, he said.
'For too long training has been left to the discretion of employers and the
result has been a disaster. Only one in three companie have training budgets
and only one in four have training plans.'
Training For Britain's Economic Success, the unions' document, has been sent
to their negotiators, education institutes, MPs, and more than 2,200
personnel managers.

STAMP DUTY: Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury, dismissed
as 'nonsensical' suggestions that the abolition until August 19 of stamp
duty on properties valued up to Pounds 250,000 had failed to revive the
housing market.
Mr Maude, who moved the second reading of the Stamp Duty (Temporary
Provisions) Bill, estimated that during the eight months moratorium some 90
per cent of private house purchases - some 600,000 transactions - would not

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Councils face move to extend benefits
for part-timers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY rules on equal pay will almost certainly require UK
councils to introduce sick-pay schemes for their many part-time workers,
mostly women, who are paid less than Pounds 52 a week.
Mr Stephen Bubb, assistant secretary of the Labour-dominated Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, said yesterday the association felt that it might
not be treating part-time workers fairly and might be falling foul of EC
legislation.
Almost 70 per cent of the 800,000 manual workers in local government are
part-timers, and many of those are paid less than Pounds 52 a week. A
requirement to provide sick-pay for several hundred thousand workers
previously excluded could significantly increase pay bills.
Mr Bubb said it was difficult to determine how many workers would be
affected by an extension of sick-pay schemes, but the equality audit being
conducted by employers and unions would probably provide an answer.
The exclusion of part-time workers from sick-pay and other benefits is
likely to be a main theme of this year's pay bargaining on behalf of council
manual workers. A local-government employers' consultation paper, to be
issued this week, says the manual workers' interest is likely to shift to
equality issues in this year's negotiations.
'They can be expected in particular to pursue the position of part-timers'
conditions of service,' says the paper. It continues: 'Already there are
indications of concerted union efforts, through industrial tribunal
references, to have the national agreement's effective exclusion from
occupational sick-pay of part-time manual workers earning less than Pounds
52 a week declared illegal.'
Underlining that point, the National Union of Public Employees (Nupe)
yesterday launched a test case at Leeds Industrial Tribunal on behalf of
1,000 school-meals staff employed by North Yorkshire County Council.
Nupe said that following competitive tendering of the school meals service
the council dismissed all its staff and offered them back their jobs with
lower pay rates, reduced holidays and little or no sick-pay.
Nupe is challenging the action under British and European equal-pay laws.
The union said the women had been treated differently from groups of male
workers, such as those in highway maintenance, who were also subject to
competitive-tendering laws.
Union leaders at Ford New Holland, the tractor maker owned by Ford and Fiat,
will meet today to consider whether to order industrial action after the
company said it would not increase a three-year pay deal including a 4 per
cent rise in the first year from last November. Management was yesterday
warned of the possibility of one-day or two-day strikes.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lords urge end to row over blocked
EC funds - Regional Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was urged yesterday to settle a long-standing European
Community regional funding dispute in order to release cash for development
projects.
The Lords committee on the EC warned that important programmes were being
delayed by disagreement with the Commission over the concept of
'additionality'. The Brussels rule says any structural expenditure decided
by the EC must be additional to that which would be spent by national
authorities.
Britain's inability to satisfy the Commission that this principle was being
followed in all cases has slowed down the receipt of money for a number of
projects around the country.
In a report which generally backed the aims of Commission policies on
reducing regional disparities in the EC, the committee said the
additionality row was causing particular setbacks to a scheme to revitalise
former mining areas in South Yorkshire.
The committee recommended that by making local government finance procedures
more transparent, Britain could show that anticipated grants for UK spending
plans did, in fact, add to what would have been spent without the extra
money.
The report pointed out that Britain was the main country affected by an
'additionality' discord with the Commission.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash over polling
statistics - Pre-Election Campaigning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL war of words turned into a battle of statistics yesterday as
Labour issued the results of its private polling, which showed public
discontent with the Tory record.
The Conservatives, meanwhile, claimed that 'eight out of 10 voters think
Labour would put up their taxes'.
But the data on which these claims were based was called into question after
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Treasury minister, conceded that the Tories'
figures revealed merely that 85 per cent of those polled believed a Labour
government would raise taxes.
Despite a misleading headline on the news release, the form of words put by
Gallup to interviewees did not examine whether voters' thought their own tax
bills would go up.
Labour has repeatedly stressed that independent analysis shows 91 per cent
of British families would either gain or not be affected by their tax
changes.
In a letter to Tory chairman Mr Chris Patten, Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's
campaign co-ordinator, said Mrs Shephard's claims alongside a similarly
worded poster were fresh evidence of a 'deliberate campaign of premeditated
dishonesty'.
He went on to demand a public apology and the withdrawal of the poster
campaign.
Tory officials, however, rejected the charges and claimed that the press
notice distributed with the figures was a legitimate political
interpretation of their meaning.
'Whose taxes do you suppose the respondents to the surveywere thinking would
go up?' asked Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman. With election fever continuing
at a high pitch in Westminster yesterday, the row came as an indicator of
the high stakes being placed on voters' responses to the charges and
counter-charges levelled by the two main parties.
Under the Labour data, from a poll conducted by National Opinion Polls, a
sample of 865 voters showed 61 per cent believed the general state of
Britain was worse over the 13 years of Conservative government, while 21 per
cent said things were better.
Questioned on their attitude to six specific sectors - unemployment,
education, the economy in general, the National Health Service, crime and
the interviewee's personal financial situation - more voters perceived a
deterioration than an improvement.
However, on one question - that of Britain's standing in the world - the
Conservatives had the advantage, with 38 per cent of respondents saying this
was 'better', 33 per cent saying it was 'worse' and 29 per cent opting for a
neither or don't know response.
Labour released the finding because polling companies' codes of practice
require that all relevant questions are released if data is to be published.
Some of these codes also suggest that enquirers have the right to ask if any
other questions were asked that shed light on the findings.
In the case of the Conservatives' tax question, Gallup conceded yesterday
that a further question had been asked but declined to reveal its wording or
the responses of the interviewees.
Labour party officials speculated that it might have sought to gauge how
much voters' would prefer tax cuts against increases in public expenditure.
If the findings have been unfavourable to the Tories - showing a preference
for more public spending - this would explain the Conservatives' reluctance
for the evidence to be made public, the Labour officials said.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Traditional Tory lives to fight
another day - Searching for the true character of Northern Ireland secretary
Peter Brooke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Brooke, who offered to resign yesterday as Northern Ireland
secretary, is not a politician at ease with the late 20th century.
He is a traditional Tory, fascinated with history, who bumbles poetry and
witticisms to journalists and politicians. He is polite, honest - and
sometimes recklessly honourable.
For a time last year, as he announced the first 'round-table' talks in the
province for 15 years, he won praise from all sides - including those
Unionist MPs who this week triggered his offer.
It was a rare high point in 13 years of drift in Northern Ireland under Tory
rule.
His patience and courtesy have earned him the respect necessary to bring
Northern Ireland's recalcitrant political leaders back into the democratic
fold.
Such integrity lay behind yesterday's announcement.
Mr Brooke felt the remaining allegiances he could command among the
province's politicians had been undermined. But his offer also suggests a
pent-up frustration - over his failure in the six months to restart his
talks and, possibly, over his relationship with Mr Major.
Officials and colleagues on all sides of the Chamber were taken aback by his
announcement. Those Unionists who were there, and not at the funerals of
construction workers killed by the IRA on Friday, appeared taken aback by
the effect of their jibes.
'We could paper the offices with Unionist demands for the secretary of state
to resign,' one official said at the weekend. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of
the Democratic Unionist party, is not backward in calling for ministerial
scalps.
Frustration among Northern Ireland secretaries is hardly surprising. The
least-envied of all Cabinet posts brings oppressive round-the-clock
security, universal cynicism, and the prospect only of being immersed in the
province's agonisingly languid politics and endless security crises.
In spite of his achievements, Mr Brooke has never been immune to the
pressures.
He finds it difficult to knock heads together. During last summer's
'round-table' talks he was unable to force the pace when deliberations were
bogged down for seven weeks of procedural arrangements. Participants
complained of waiting for long periods as Mr Brooke pondered where to go
next.
He is not, colleagues say, a great thinker. He can be moody. There is no
'Brooke vision' on Northern Ireland.
He does not appear to get on automatically with Mr Major. Aristocratic
mannerisms - his ancestral home was in County Cavan, now in the Irish
Republic - jar with the prime minister's classless politics.
Mr Brooke, who supported Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, during the 1990
Conservative party leadership election, might well have been happier as a
Tory politician of the Victorian era.
He enjoys the cultural distractions of his job - taking an academic interest
in the events leading up the 1920s partition of Ireland - but not the
unrelenting pressure.
So far, Mr Major has had little input into Conservative policy on Northern
Ireland, perhaps adding to Mr Brooke's sense of discontent.
Mr Brooke has made serious mistakes before. Shortly after becoming secretary
of state, he gave an interview in which he appeared to envisage eventual
talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
Beforehand he had an unhappy period as Tory party chairman when he oversaw
the Conservative party's defeat in the 1989 European elections.
His posting to the Northern Ireland office by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the
former prime minister, was seen as a sideways step.
Mr Brooke has weathered past storms but last night his position appeared to
have been weakened considerably. It is difficult to see how he can last much
beyond the general election. But a ministerial resignation so close to a
general election would have been highly damaging. It appears evident that Mr
Major decided that, for now at least, he could not manage without him.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Training shunted to the slow track -
Gloomy predictions from the voluntary sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST February Mr Patrick Coldstream, a director of two charitable companies
providing training for the unemployed, met Mrs Sarah Hogg, head of the prime
minister's policy unit.
He predicted grave consequences for training providers from government
changes in funding arrangements, and warned that voluntary bodies such as
his would be hit particularly hard. To some extent his prophecy has been
fulfilled.
The voluntary sector's share of places is estimated by the National Council
for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) to have fallen from 25 per cent of the
places on Employment Training, the scheme for unemployed adults, in 1990-91
to 15 per cent in 1991-92. Its share of Youth Training, the scheme for
16-to-18-year-olds, has been less affected, from 7 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
Charities are thought to comprise 5 per cent of the 7,200 organisations
which train 16-to-18-year-olds on the two schemes. The remaining training
providers include local authorities and commercial organisations.
Debate has focused on the voluntary sector because of the announcement a
fortnight ago that Fullemploy, a 19-year-old voluntary-sector training
organisation catering mainly for ethnic minorities had gone into
liquidation. Mr Coldstream helped to set up Fullemploy, which is seeking a
purchaser.
This week administrators were called to Apex Trust, a leading
voluntary-sector provider, to see if liquidation could be averted. A
financial crisis was caused there by a demand from the Department of
Employment for repayment of Pounds 250,000. Apex trains mainly ex-offenders
as well as being a lobby group whose backers include Dr George Carey,
archbishop of Canterbury.
Mr Coldstream says: 'If organisations as powerfully supported as Apex Trust
and Fullemploy are collapsing, the whole network of voluntary-sector
providers, many of which are small and perhaps less well-managed, must be
vulnerable.'
He says that cuts in funding of training schemes and changes in payment
regimes over the past year were not always the immediate cause of problems
even though they left 'no margin for financial error' among organisations.
Unlike commercial training bodies, they have no capital.
'Fullemploy had a bad management patch in the late 1980s,' admits Mr
Coldstream. 'It now has an excellent new management, but the organisation
was never offered the chance to rebuild with confidence.'
Fullemploy had managed to salvage its financial position but was refused a
government grant because of Home Office fears about its solvency.
Grand Metropolitan Community Services, a large training provider set up by
the food and drink group, is considering the possibility of acquiring some
Fullemploy contracts. It is fortunate in having core funding from its parent
company, and has acquired several small training organisations over the past
few years.
But the next few months may see the demise of smaller training providers as
ministers set out to negotiate new contracts with Training and Enterprise
Councils (Tecs) for 1992-93.
The problems affecting training providers, particularly those training the
disadvantaged, began when the government gave responsibility for training to
the 82 employer-led Tecs in England and Wales.
The real value of government grants for Youth Training and Employment
Training has been eroded since the early 1980s. The value of grants to Youth
Training has been halved since 1983.
When Tecs started, the government took their arrival as an opportunity to
ask employers to shoulder even more of the financial burden of the two
training schemes. In addition, payment for Youth Training became
output-related, which meant that up to 25 per cent of payments to Tecs from
the government were related to people gaining qualifications. This provoked
problems among training providers, particularly those assisting
special-needs groups. Many had their training places reduced. Some places
were lost, but in some Tec areas contracts went to more general providers of
training which offered Tecs more competitive rates.
The NCVO claims those at special disadvantage have suffered
disproportionately from cuts in funding in 1991-92. In May it estimated
that, in the halving of adult training places in the voluntary sector, 75
per cent of the cuts involved people with special needs.
Mrs Anne Weinstock, chief executive of The Rathbone Society, a
Manchester-based voluntary organisation, says Tec directors, faced with
funding cuts, are tempted to take a tougher commercial line.
A second change that upset providers in the voluntary sector is the change
by Tecs to funding providers in arrears. Before the creation of Tecs the
government paid in advance.
Concern over this has been expressed by Bridge Group, which represents many
providers in the voluntary sector. It says many Tecs have been reluctant to
offer providers grants to tide them over the funding changes. Tecs retort
that providers would be financially liable if they defaulted. The response
of Tecs to the effect of the likely demise of specialist providers,
including Apex, is mixed. In part the argument includes division over
whether special groups need special training or should be integrated.
Some Tecs say that they foresee few practical difficulties in finding
alternative providers for training places. Apex, they claim, had always been
well-paid for its trainees, and other training providers would jump at their
contracts.
Others see problems. Mr Michael Hanson, the chief executive of South London
Tec, faces the task of finding about 100 new training places if Fullemploy
is not rescued.
More importantly, Mr Hanson believes that the expertise of specialist
providers is not readily bought.
He says: 'Fullemploy in particular has built up a particular skill in
training its client group, and it also built confident links with employers.
That is not easily replaced.'

FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine gives Budget pledge -
Poll Tax Bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, insisted yesterday that the
government would not 'fix' Budget proposals to delay the sending out of poll
tax bills until after a general election.
Any change to the poll tax would be made on its merits and not to hold up
bills, he said on BBC radio.
His remarks followed an attack by Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment
secretary, that in choosing the timing of the election the Tories faced the
'ticking timebomb' of bills being sent out during the campaign, whether the
election was on April 9 or May 7.
The level of the poll tax was likely to be nearer Pounds 300 than the
government's planned target of Pounds 257, Mr Gould said.
The government has wide powers to 'cap' local authority spending but it has
no powers to limit the increase to the local poll tax councils can make to
take account of non-payment in their area.
'I certainly would not be part of a process which sought to gerrymander the
arrangements for electoral advantage. What governments determine to do, they
determine to do, but not for those sort of reasons,' Mr Heseltine said.
Ministers have come under particular pressure to abolish the minimum 20 per
cent payment that people on low incomes must make, both because of the
collection costs and because the requirement would be abolished when the
council tax is introduced to replace the community charge from next April.
Mr Heseltine called on the Commons last night to overturn a government
defeat in the Lords over subjecting local authorities to compulsory
competitive tendering.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said the next Labour
government would reserve compulsory competitive tendering for circumstances
in which a local authority could be shown, over a period of time, to have
failed to reach acceptable standards.
The Local Government Bill was given a second reading by 276 votes to 221, a
government majority of 55.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Land deal clearance by Ofwat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Water Services (Ofwat), the economic regulator for the water
industry, has announced that land sales by water companies valued at less
than Pounds 500,000 will no longer have to be submitted for individual
approval.
The disposal of surplus land was a significant political issue in the run-up
to privatisation two years ago. It was then decided that certificates and
valuers' reports had to be submitted for all land sales to third parties
worth more than Pounds 250,000 in London, Pounds 200,000 in the rest of the
south-east and Pounds 150,000 elsewhere.
The stringent rules were set up to ensure that all surplus land was properly
accounted for, and sales were used to offset increases in water charges
required to fund the industry's Pounds 18bn capital investment programme.
Proceeds from any additional sales were to be divided equally between
customers and shareholders of the water companies.
Experience over the past two years has shown that in sales to independent
third parties companies have been under pressure to secure the best price,
and in these sales the interests of customers and shareholders have
coincided. Removal of the certification procedure for small disposals will
mean companies save on costs.
Companies will be required to submit an annual summary to Ofwat on all land
disposals, including transactions below the new Pounds 500,000 threshold.
Ofwat said yesterday that greater scrutiny was still needed of land
transfers made to associated companies within water companies. 'This is an
area where the customers' interests need protecting the most, and so Ofwat
will be redirecting its resources into examining these particular disposals
more thoroughly.'

FT  21 JAN 92 / Still life doubles its estimate: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STILL LIFE of flowers in a terracotta vase, painted by Jan van Huysum in
about 1730, sold for Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 1.95m) at Sotheby's in New York at
the weekend. It was an auction record for the Dutch artist. A New York
dealer paid almost double the estimate for the work, which had spent most of
its life in the Hope collection in England.
The sale was the highlight of an important auction of Old Master paintings,
which totalled Dollars 16.4m (Pounds 9.1m) with a reasonable 23 per cent
unsold. The sale suggested that buyers are prepared to pay good prices for
pictures that are fresh on the market. There was an important group of
French paintings on offer. A still life of walnuts, peaches and pears by
Chardin sold for Dollars 2.2m, at the bottom of its estimate. A pair of
landscapes by Chardin's 18th century contemporary Vernet did well at Dollars
1.54m.
There is renewed interest in early gold-ground paintings in spite of
problems of attribution and condition. A very early work, attributed to the
'Master of 1310' and depicting scenes from the life of a female saint,
perhaps Margaret of Antioch, sold above target at Dollars 814,000. Meanwhile
a panel showing scenes from the life of King David by the late 15th century
Italian artist Bernardo Rosselli made Dollars 473,000.
The main disappointments were failure to find a buyer for 'Coaches on the
Quai des Tuileries' by Boilly, and a work attributed to Rubens and his
studio.
A pair of paintings by Rubens, allegories of Prudence and Fortitude, were
also unsold at the Christie's sale of Old Masters in New York on Thursday.
This totalled Dollars 7.86m with 21 per cent unsold. A pair of 18th century
French paintings of hunters, commissioned from Charles-Joseph Natoire by
Louis XV to decorate Fontainebleau, sold for Dollars 737,000, way ahead of a
modest Dollars 150,000 upper estimate.
A coastal scene near Naples by Pietro Fabris also did well at Dollars
495,000, while a 17th century view of a Brazilian landscape by Frans Post
was on target at Dollars 473,000.

FT  21 JAN 92 / P&amp;O orders Pounds 200m liner from Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O, the shipping group, has ordered a Pounds 200m custom-built liner from a
German shipyard to operate cruises from the UK.
Lord Sterling, P&amp;O chairman, said he would like the 67,000-ton ship to have
been built in the UK, but no British company had felt able to tender.
P&amp;O hopes that the liner, due for delivery in April 1995, will enable it to
take advantage of the rapid growth in the UK cruise market, which has seen
passenger numbers double over the past five years to nearly 190,000 last
year.
The ship, which will carry up to 1,975 passengers and will have an outdoor
deck area of 2 1/2 -acres, will be built by Meyer Werft, a family-owned yard
based in Papenburg.
Lord Sterling said that 20 per cent of the purchase price would be paid in
four instalments between now and 1995. The remaining 80 per cent is to be
financed by an 8 per cent loan from German banks which will be paid off over
8 1/2 years beginning in 1995.
The ship, the name of which has not been announced, is expected to increase
the proportion of cruise passengers taking trips from the UK. According to
Mr Robert Duffett, chief executive of the Passenger Shipping Association,
the number of people beginning journeys in the UK has remained static at
about 50,000 a year over the past four years in spite of a big increase in
cruises by UK residents.
About 60,000 of the UK residents who take cruises annually begin their
journeys in the Caribbean, usually after flying to Florida. Some 45,000
start their cruises in the Mediterranean.
The UK cruise market is small compared to that in the US, where an estimated
3.5m people took cruises last year. The UK is the biggest European cruise
market, followed by Germany with an estimated 150,000 passengers a year and
Italy with about 100,000. P&amp;O is the leading UK cruise operator followed by
CTC Lines, which is owned by the Black Sea Shipping Company of Odessa.
The industry is trying to dispel the notion that cruising is not for the
young. The P&amp;O ship will be the first to be custom-built for the UK cruise
market. Mr Duffett said the tendency in the past had been to convert
passenger liners, but there are now fewer available.
Passenger liners also used to have segregated facilities for different
classes of passengers, whereas cruise ships have only one class, making
conversion of liners difficult.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Ford to cut discounts to rental companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is to cut back on deeply discounted sales to the big rental fleet
operators such as Hertz and Avis, whose combined new car purchases - not
just from Ford - approach 100,000 annually.
The rental and leasing industry has been getting cars 'on the cheap' and
Ford intends to 'get back to better margins', Mr Ian McAllister, chairman
and managing director, said yesterday.
Such a course should help Ford to return to profitability this year after
making heavy losses in each of the past two years, Mr McAllister said.
He gave no firm indication of the discounts such companies have received
from Ford. However, a study undertaken for the Retail Motor Industry
Federation, the franchised dealers' trade body, has concluded that discounts
of up to 40 per cent have been available from some manufacturers to some of
the biggest fleets.
A growing number of large fleet deals have also been concluded directly
between manufacturers and fleet operators, bypassing the dealer networks
through which all cars should theoretically be sold.
Such procedures are provoking bitter opposition from the federation, which
has warned that dealer networks could start to disintegrate if the practice
grows much beyond the 200,000 cars a year thought to be subject to such
deals.
Mr McAllister, acknowledging that direct sales could pose a long-term threat
to dealers, indicated that Ford would be less willing than in the past to
involve itself in such deals.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Salvoes fired to stop dock work running dry: Why failure to
win a frigate contract could mean death for a shipyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE next Ministry of Defence contract for frigates
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
expected by early next month - is likely to have a decisive effect on the
shape of Britain's warship building industry.
Whatever is decided will be extremely bad news for at least one of the four
designated warship yards, each of which is fighting for its existence in a
shrinking market.
Previous contracts have been fiercely competed for, but this is the first
since the government announced plans for scaling down the Royal Navy's
fleet.
The order for up to three frigates, worth about Pounds 400m in total, is
being contested by all four of the warship yards that have survived since
privatisation in 1985-86. They are VSEL at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria,
Yarrow Shipbuilders on Clydeside, Swan Hunter on the Tyne and Vosper
Thornycroft at Southampton.
VSEL's Merseyside subsidiary Cammell Laird, which is destined either to
close or be sold for other uses, has already in effect dropped out of the
race.
Overcapacity has reached a point where yards are fighting to squeeze each
other out. Mr Noel Davies, chief executive of VSEL, expects total employment
in UK warship building to fall from a 1990 figure of about 21,000 to about
8,000 by the middle of the decade.
Sir Robert Easton, chairman of Yarrow, which belongs to General Electric
Company (GEC), believes there are still too many shipyards. 'They won't all
survive,' he says. Mr Davies at VSEL goes further: 'We say only two will
survive.' And even that figure is based more on the MoD's keenness to avoid
a monopoly than on the volume of prospective orders for the Royal Navy.
The 10 orders placed so far for Type 23 anti-submarine frigates have been
split between Yarrow and Swan Hunter. Yarrow was appointed design authority
and won the first order when it was still part of state-owned British
Shipbuilders. It is still reeling from the loss of the last order for three
frigates, awarded to Swan Hunter just over two years ago.
Tenders for up to three more were invited last summer. The MoD, convinced of
the savings to be made by ordering in single-yard batches, is expected to
place a full three-ship contract. Neither of the current Type 23 builders
sees any sense in splitting the order. The prime contenders this time are
considered by insiders at the MoD to be Yarrow and VSEL, the losers in the
last tender.
Yarrow, which cut its workforce by 645 just before Christmas and now employs
2,750 people, is counting heavily on winning the order. It has delivered
three Type 23s, with three more due by the middle of next year. There its
order book ends. It is hoping for a Pounds 180m deal to build two corvettes
for Malaysia, but negotiations have proved difficult.
VSEL is also warning that without a Type 23 order it would 'in the long run
become less viable'. Its current business is submarines - a safe slot, as no
other yard could afford the investment needed to build nuclear-powered
submarines. But it is not enough for VSEL. The order for the fourth and last
Trident ballistic-missile submarine is expected by about June, but a Labour
election victory would call that into question. Even if it goes ahead, steel
work on the Trident programme will run out by 1996. There would then be a
gap before the start of work on a new version of the Trafalgar attack
submarine.
VSEL needs a frigate order not just to fill that gap but, says Mr Davies,
for 'long-term and fundamental' reasons. In order to make 'reasonable use'
of its assets it cannot afford to allow its workforce, already down from
12,500 to about 9,000, to fall below about 5,000. It reckons that the navy's
submarine programme after Trident will provide work for only about 2,200.
A share of the frigate programme would keep employment at 4,000 to 5,000 and
enable VSEL to provide value for money. The Trident programme, Mr Davies
says, will be 'several tens of millions' cheaper to the government if VSEL
gets back to making surface ships as well. It has not built any at Barrow
for a decade, and just one in that time at Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. That
yard was given an order for a Type 22 frigate in 1985 after workers had
defied pickets to continue working.
Vosper Thornycroft, employing 1,900, holds a niche making boats of
glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), including the navy's latest anti-mine
vessels. But orders for more minehunters have been suspended and the other
three warship yards all covet Vosper's preserve. Yarrow would use its own
GRP facility and the other two would buy GRP hulls from France.
Vosper hopes shortly to conclude a Pounds 150m contract for two corvettes
for Oman, bringing it back into the business of steel ships for the first
time since it built the destroyer Gloucester, launched in 1982.
'We would would need some investment to be 1992 state-of-the-art,' admits Mr
Martin Jay, Vosper's chief executive. Whether Vosper would have capacity for
both the Omani order and a complete batch of frigates is questionable.
Swan Hunter on Tyneside is dismissive of its rivals' 'whingeing', rejecting
'the myopic view that the whole future of the UK shipbuilding industry is
down to one order'.
The last of the Type 23s it is building is due for delivery by the end of
1994, but it sees 'exciting prospects' in the UK and overseas in both naval
and merchant ships.
The yard, employing about 3,800 including 1,000 on short-term contracts, is
also working on an auxiliary tanker, Fort George. If it loses the frigate
contest, it would bid for the navy's planned new helicopter-carrying
'aviation support ship', tenders for which are due to be invited soon. It
would also compete for two amphibious assault ships planned to replace the
ageing Fearless and Intrepid. These would all be larger vessels. VSEL, by
contrast, could not accommodate ships of this size in its dock hall.
Although now predominantly a warship yard, Swan Hunter says it will not
necessarily remain one. It claims to have the UK's only design team with the
experience and expertise to build both warships and merchant vessels, and
places high hopes on plans for a new category of container ship.
'No shipbuilding company can any longer rely on the MoD for the whole of its
order book,' says Mr Roger Vaughan, joint chief executive. He argues that
one batch of frigates is not enough to secure anybody's long-term future.
Politically, the frigate decision presents a balance of conflicting
considerations: the interests of Conservative MPs in Barrow and Southampton;
Tory difficulties in Scotland, where Yarrow's yard sits in Labour territory
on the north bank of the Clyde; and the fate of the Conservative-held
marginal seat at Tynemouth, next door to the bedrock Labour constituency of
Wallsend where Swan Hunter is located.
'The government needs to take a view of the capabilities it wants to see
retained in the UK,' says Mr Davies at VSEL. 'This is the first major
decision it has to make.'

   By PETER NORMAN

<TEXT>
THE Bank of England yesterday stepped up its campaign to make London the
home of the monetary institutions that will be set up as the European
Community moves towards economic and monetary union, Peter Norman writes.
Mr Eddie George, the Bank's deputy governor, said London was the 'logical
location' for future European monetary institutions because of its dominant
position in world foreign exchange markets.
Speaking at a conference organised by Telerate, the financial information
group, Mr George said it would be 'disappointing, though not fatally
damaging, for London' if the institutions went elsewhere.
Britain's commitment to the present parity of sterling in the European
exchange rate mechanism was underlined both by Mr George and by Mr John
Maples, the economic secretary to the Treasury.

FT  21 JAN 92 / GEC-Marconi wins Pounds 1.5bn warplane deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by GEC-Marconi has clinched a deal to make electronic
warfare equipment worth an estimated Pounds 1.5bn for the European Fighter
Aircraft if the jet goes into production.
The initial contract for a combination of systems to detect, jam and decoy
enemy missiles will be worth about Pounds 200m, with GEC-Marconi obtaining
about half.
The decision about the equipment for the warplane project, in which the UK
has a 33 per cent stake, was announced in the Commons yesterday. Mr Alan
Clark, defence procurement minister, said the work would lead to creation of
500 UK jobs. GEC-Marconi said only that the contract would lead to some
extra employment.
The work will be mainly at Stanmore, north London, and Portsmouth. Earlier
this month GEC said it would shed 750 jobs, including 150 at its defence
communications division at Chelmsford, Essex.
Mr Clark reaffirmed the UK's strong commitment to the four-nation fighter
project, due this year to complete its Pounds 8bn development phase.
A decision about numbers of aircraft and timing is due this year.
The electronic warfare system was the last main piece of equipment for the
aircraft still awaiting a decision.
The UK, Italy and Spain are going ahead with the system, while Germany
announced in October it would investigate options for cheaper equipment.
GEC-Marconi's partners in the consortium, known as Eurodass, are Elettronica
of Italy and Inisel of Spain. The decision on the electronic warfare system
has taken about three years, although the GEC-led consortium was the only
one to put forward a comprehensive proposal.

FT  21 JAN 92 / BT signs telecoms accord with cable group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT HAS SIGNED its first deal to provide a telecommunications service in
conjunction with a cable television company.
The agreement involves BT co-operating with Diamond Cable, which operates
five franchises in the Midlands, in carrying customers' long-distance calls,
but competing to provide telephone lines.
Others among the cable TV operators, which are increasingly emerging as
local rivals to BT, have signed deals with Mercury Communications, BT's only
long-distance competitor, to carry their long-distance calls and switch
their local calls - sending them to different routes.
The deal with Diamond follows BT's calculation that, if competition is
coming from the cable companies, it would be better to carry some of their
long-distance business rather than leave it all to Mercury by default. BT is
talking to other cable companies about similar deals.
From the cable companies' point of view, BT's willingness to sign deals
means they have a choice of operator. Mr Gary Davis, managing director of
Diamond Cable, said it was his company's aim eventually to interconnect with
Mercury and any other company which enters the long-distance market as well
as with BT in order to achieve the cheapest rates for its customers.
Diamond, whose main shareholder is Mr Allan McDonald, a US cable TV
investor, will be the first UK cable company to do its own switching -
others rely on Mercury. Diamond will install a System X exchange for
switching to cover its Nottingham franchise in March, and plans to extend
the service to its other franchises. System X is made by GPT, the UK
telecommunications manufacturer.
Mr Davis said that Diamond had been able to negotiate a better deal with BT
than other cable companies had been able to negotiate with Mercury because
it was doing its own switching.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Stores ring up a retail-sales riddle for analysts:
Patchiness of the sectors is reflected in figures for December
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL sales figures yesterday were not only gloomy but more than usually
puzzling.
Conflicting stories from different retail sectors combine with a distortion
in Central Statistical Office figures to obscure the detailed picture.
According to the CSO the volume of retail sales in December was 1 per cent
down on November. But the figures carry little weight with some retail
analysts who complain they are often revised upwards or downwards.
Many suggest that the weekly figures published in the staff gazette of John
Lewis Partnership, which owns department stores and the Waitrose supermarket
chain, provide a more useful indication of retail sales.
The John Lewis figures showed that there had been a 5.5 per cent increase in
total sales in the 24 weeks to January 11 compared with the previous year.
However, these figures also reflect the effects of the addition of new sales
space within stores and the increase in value added tax.
Mr Mark Husson, retail analyst at Warburg Securities, said: 'The John Lewis
figures have been saying that sales volumes have been flat or very slightly
down over Christmas but extremely strong in the sales period.'
The John Lewis figures may themselves have been 'distorted' because unlike
many other retailers it did not discount goods in the run-up to Christmas.
This may have had the net effect of depressing December sales and
accentuating those in January.
Part of the confusion over the apparently conflicting retail sales figures
may be explained by different sectors of the market performing in markedly
different ways.
Dixons, the electrical goods retailer, this month said it had produced a
year-on-year sales increase in the 'mid-teens' over the Christmas trading
period. And the bullish Mr Stanley Kalms, its chairman, said there was more
confidence in the high street - especially outside London - than many people
imagined.
In contrast Ratners Group, the jewellery chain, experienced a dismal
December with sales falling by 15 per cent in spite of a substantial
pre-Christmas discounting campaign. Jewellery has been one of the
hardest-hit retail sectors after recording rela-tively strong sales in 1990.
Sears, which runs the Selfridges department store, said there had been a
very good but disappointingly short spurt of sales in response to its winter
sales. And House of Fraser, which runs more than 60 department stores, tells
much the same story. It said sales were strongly ahead compared with last
year's abnormally depressed figures. But it added that there was a trading
'black hole' within the M25 orbital motorway.
There is also uncertainty about the election, which has particularly hit the
upper end of the market. 'Uncertainty is always bad for Joe Public,
resulting in a rise in the savings ratio and a drop in birth rates,' said Mr
Husson.
Another reason for the confusion surrounding the December figure stems from
a statistical quirk. The CSO measures its retail sales figures in periods of
four to five weeks. In order to keep them synchronised with the month being
measured, every five or six years it pushes the trading year six days ahead.
Thus January last year began with a five-week trading period.
This caused the period measuring November to spill over into December,
artificially inflating the November figure. While a seasonal adjustment is
made for this in December and January (when the effect is most significant)
in November no such adjustment was made. As a result the CSO said the
November figure of a 1.3 per cent rise on the month was probably inflated by
half a percentage point. Allowing for this the December drop on November
looks significantly less drastic.
There is the possibility of a further distortion in the failure of
December's figures to capture the true extent of pre-Christmas discounting.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland Montagu, said the recession
persuaded retailers to bring forward their January sales to December.
The retail sales volume figures come from the total amount of cash spending
in shops, deflated by the appropriate parts of the retail price index. Mr
Briscoe believes that the RPI does not fully capture this discounting, thus
leading to an understatement of sales and possibly masking a sense of 'feel
good' by those who have been able to benefit from the heavy discounting.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Franchise refusal was 'irrational', TSW tells court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION South West, the commercial TV company that lost its broadcasting
licence for south-west England in last October's auction of ITV franchises,
yesterday asked the Appeal Court to quash the decision to award the licence
to Westcountry TV.
Mr Gordon Pollock QC, for TSW, said the rejection of the company's business
plan by the Independent Television Commission was irrational.
The court heard that the ITC rejected the TSW plan after describing its
forecast of annual growth in national net advertising revenue (NAR) over the
10-year licence period as 'incredible, implausible and very optimistic'.
The decision was so irrational that it should be quashed and the licence
awarded to TSW, Mr Pollock said.
Westcountry bid Pounds 7.8m against TSW's bid of Pounds 16.1m.
The main issue concerned the variance between TSW's forecast of annual
growth in advertising revenue over the licence period and that of the ITC,
Mr Pollock added.
TSW had forecast 5.3 per cent growth in revenue. The ITC had taken a figure
of 4 per cent - an average of all the forecasts by all the applicants for
the 16 franchise areas.
For the ITC, Professor Alan Budd, an independent expert, had forecast 5.6
per cent. TSW's experts, NERA, the economic consultants, had forecast 5.5
per cent growth, and KPMG, the management consultants relied on by
Westcountry, said any forecast between 4 per cent and 6.2 per cent would be
acceptable.
Had TSW known in advance that the ITC would choose the average 4 per cent
forecast as the test then its bid and its business plan would have been
entirely different, Mr Pollock said. The 4 per cent test had the inevitable
effect of destroying the basis on which it had calculated its Pounds 16.1m
bid.
The ITC did not object to TSW's prediction of Channel 3's share of
advertising revenue, nor to its prediction of TSW's share of that. The ITC's
complaint related to TSW's assessment of national revenue. But in asking
applicants to look into the future it was inevitable that they would come up
with a range of forecasts. It was impossible to say that one forecast was
correct or even to say whether one forecast was more or less likely to be
reliable, Mr Pollock said.
All that could safely be said was that there was a 'credible, realistic
range'. TSW's forecasts were 'well-considered, consistent and credible'.
The ITC's approach was 'wholly unsustainable', he said. 'It is extraordinary
that our NAR figures were characterised as 'incredible' when their own
expert said annual growth in NAR would be 0.3 per cent higher.'
Mr Pollock said the evidence showed that the ITC had simply failed to read
TSW's application properly.
'It is not a very difficult application, but their approach was thoroughly
shoddy, incompetent and unprofessional,' he said.
The hearing continues today.

ROYAL BANK of Scotland is to offer a further 70,000 customers the
opportunity to have their photographs on their cheque-guarantee cards.
The scheme, which is free to customers during the pilot stage, was launched
in October for branch customers in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London and
Manchester.
So far more than 8,000 customers have applied for the photograph cards. The
bank says that some people have opened accounts with the bank in order to
obtain a card with their photograph on.
Other banks have held out against introducing photograph cards, saying they
would not be effective against card fraud, and that there would be practical
problems in photographing millions of customers and ensuring that the
picture was up to date.
Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, is due to meet clearing banks in March to
discuss combating card fraud, including the possible introduction of
photographs.

FT  21 JAN 92 / 30,000 job losses forecast in financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE COULD be up to 30,000 job losses by the end of the year in the
financial services sector, according to a Confederation of British Industry
survey published yesterday. This could include a decline in employment among
building societies for the first time since the quarterly survey started in
December 1989.
Companies in the financial services sector suffered a sharp decline in
business confidence and falling volumes in the final quarter of last year,
the survey found.
The survey, conducted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm,
shows little prospect of early recovery in the sector, with overall optimism
down by an average of 27 per cent over the previous three months.
Of the companies questioned, 21 per cent said they expected the volume of
business to rise over the next three months, while 33 per cent expected its
value to rise. Those that thought both volume and value would remain the
same made up 52 per cent.
Building societies showed the sharpest decline in confidence, with 80 per
cent predicting they would reduce staff numbers over the next three months,
and 5 per cent expecting to increase employment. Banks and fund managers
were also more pessimistic than in the previous quarter.
Mr Angus Hislop, a partner in Coopers responsible for financial services
consulting, said a perception that there would be no further decline of
interest rates and the belief that house prices would not rise until next
year had contributed to the negative attitude of building societies.
Mr Sudhir Janankar, deputy director of economic trends at the CBI, said:
'There is a downturn in employment at a pretty rapid rate. There is a
general restructuring in financial services now like the one that shook out
manufacturing industry 10 years ago.'
He stressed that there were positive signs. About 55 per cent of companies
said they would invest more in information technology over this year, than
in the previous 12 months. And average operating costs per transaction over
the next three months would decline for 26 per cent of companies, implying
efficiency was rising.
'It's a bit of light and shade,' he said. 'Companies will be in a good
position to take advantage when the economy turns round.'
First Data Resources, the credit-card processing offshoot of American
Express, is to shed 420 of the 2,900 employees at its Southend and Basildon
plants in Essex, David Barchard writes.
The move is part of a shake-up inside the operation - previously known as
Access, The Joint Credit Card Company - since it was bought by FDR from the
four member banks of the Access credit card consortium in July for Pounds
146m.
FDR cut 166 posts in October. Since then it has introduced new technology
requiring a smaller workforce and the recession has meant there are fewer
transactions.

FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: The trains that run on time in war-torn
Yugoslavia - An export-oriented joint venture that injects an element of
normality into chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINS still run on time in Yugoslavia, but they are not the ones carrying
passengers across the country's six republics. In these times of civil war,
almost the entire public transport system has been disrupted, except, that
is, for the trains running to and from Germany bearing Volkswagen cars and
parts.
Mr Bernd Leissner, general director of Tvornica Automobila Sarajevo (TAS), a
joint-venture set up 18 years ago between Volkswagen and Unis, a state-owned
Bosnian trading company, has for the past six months seen the company's Golf
cars and spare parts manufactured in Sarajevo reach their destination, on
time and every day.
On the wall of Mr Leissner's tidy office just outside Sarajevo, the lively,
bustling capital of the Bosnia-Hercegovina republic, are maps showing the
train routes to Germany. 'I know every route, every schedule, all the
logistics, and all the freight managers,' says Mr Leissner. 'Everything
works.' These trains transport 95 per cent of TAS production: 40 wagons wind
their way through Yugoslavia every day. Mr Leissner says his success is due
to 'communication and good relations. This plant has excellent relations
with all the republics. A lot of people are dependent on this plant. War or
no war, we keep working. In fact, production is rising.'
When Mr Leissner, a German, who joined Volkswagen in 1970, became manager of
TAS in October 1990, production was flagging. 'We were producing 120 cars a
day, with an annual turnover of about DM500m (Pounds 176m).' Today the
company produces 240 cars daily, depending on the availability of supplies,
with a post-devaluation turnover value of DM650m.
Mr Leissner said: 'In 1990, annual production of cars was 36,000. Last year,
production had increased to 38,600. This year, I reckon we will exceed
45,000 and I hope to reach 60,000 by the end of 1993.' In addition TAS
produces pick-up trucks. Profit was also increasing, he said, from between
DM5m-DM6m in 1990 to DM18m last year.
It is good management, Mr Leissner says: 'When I came to Sarajevo,
management tools were inadequate. I increased the ratio of German managers
to local managers. We now have 23 Germans among the 55 managers.
'Also, the old-style workers' self-management structure was falling apart. I
replaced it with a new trade union body. Through training and management
programmes, we have created a corporate spirit designed to show the work
force that what we had to produce was to be the best quality, fit for world
markets.'
That was also what he expected from suppliers. 'Despite the war and the
political upheaval, all my suppliers are working well. In fact, we have a
daughter company in Slovenia. We are now negotiating terms to set one up in
Croatia. We are very happy with our suppliers from Serbia.'
Mr Leissner admits that half his 3,500 Sarajevo staff are administrative and
could be reduced. He recalls the days of 'top-heavy communist bureaucracy'
and says remnants of the old nomenklatura still exist on the factory floor.
Volkswagen's decision last year to increase its original 49 per cent share
to 50 per cent has meant it can make more decisions about production levels
and strategy. Not that Unis was in a position to resist: its own financial
problems make it completely dependent on TAS for investments. In 1990, TAS
allocated DM200m for investments spread over five years, for the launch of
the new Golf model later this year, for restructuring, and for increasing
exports.
About 50 per cent of production is earmarked for the export market, mostly
Germany. But Mr Leissner has much greater ambitions: 'This country itself,
consisting of 23m people, is a vast market. This is the sixth largest
European market for cars. Imagine expanding southwards.'
He regards Bosnia-Hercegovina as the ideal bridge between west European
markets and Turkey and possibly on to the southern republics of the former
Soviet Union. 'We are talking about reaching a market of 200m people,' he
said. Meanwhile, Mr Leissner was already confident that, with the launch of
the new Golf, the plant could be producing about 150,000 cars a year in five
years' time.
'Of course,' he said, 'there are internal problems in the country. The
financial infrastructure and instruments, such as banking and auditing do
not exist. All the republics need economic laws as quickly as possible.'
Nevertheless, Mr Leissner remains the indefatigable optimist: 'Getting the
trains to run on time takes up about 20 per cent of my time. But it is worth
it.'

FINLAND and Russia signed trade and friendship pacts yesterday, replacing
those running from the late 1940s until last year, Robert Taylor reports
from Stockholm.
The old trade system gave Finnish companies the edge over western exporters
to the Soviet market. But in the first half of 1991, Finnish exports to the
Soviet Union fell 61 per cent to FM3.6bn (Pounds 467m), with imports falling
25 per cent. Now, two-way trade has almost vanished.
The two also signed a new political pact replacing the 43-year treaty
imposed after the second world war. In future, relations will be based on
international law under the UN charter and the final act of the Conference
on Security and Co-operation in Europe, ensuring existing frontiers between
Finland and Russia.
Neste, Finland's state-owned petrochemical company, has reached agreement
with the Russians to import 2m tonnes of crude oil for refining in Finland.

FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Bonn anguish at call to curb CIS export
backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government will be advised tomorrow to impose a DM5bn (Pounds
1.7bn) limit on all new export credit guarantees to the republics of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), constituting 7 per cent of
applications currently in the pipeline.
The decision, understood to be backed by the finance and economics
ministries, must be taken against a background of chronic trade payment
problems for the ex-Soviet republics, and rising German exposure there.
Bonn faces an agonising choice because an export credit guarantee curb would
hit east German exporters pressed by the upheaval of German unification.
The recommendation follows high-level talks between the two ministries,
confronted with statistics from Hermes, the German export credit guarantee
agency, showing a DM70bn backlog in applications for insurance to the former
Soviet republics.
Hermes' current exposure to the former Soviet republics is about DM29bn, the
finance ministry said yesterday. On top of that figure, untied German
government credits of some DM11bn are outstanding, bringing
government-backed credit exposure to over DM40bn.
These figures still represent only part of the full German exposure, showing
the urgency of a full cabinet decision on future Hermes cover. Approval has
been given in principle for contracts totalling another DM23bn, finance
ministry officials say, though they hope most will not take place.
On top of that potential exposure of DM63bn comes a backlog in applications
of over DM70bn, against an estimated backlog last December of DM25bn.
The finance ministry said yesterday: 'All applications will have to be
rigorously examined. The length of the queue shows why a decision is so
urgent.'
Another limit on granting export credits is the requirement that they all
earn a counterpart guarantee from the ex-Soviet side: it is uncertain if the
new republican external trade agencies will have the foreign exchange to
give such guarantees in the coming months.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, favours a strict limit on Hermes
credits for the coming year; his figure of DM5bn seems likely to be
approved. But it is uncertain if the special Hermes arrangements for eastern
German exporters will be continued. Customers in the former Soviet Union
were able to buy east German goods without 15-20 per cent downpayments, but
the scheme expired in January.

SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) plans to cancel firm orders for 10
McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airliners worth about Dollars 300m (Pounds 167.5m),
but could substitute these with the smaller MD-95 aircraft the US
manufacturer proposes building jointly with China, Paul Betts writes.
SAS said yesterday it was talking with McDonnell Douglas on cancelling 10 of
the 15 MD-80 airliners it had booked. SAS, which has suffered a passenger
traffic fall mainly in its home market because of the recession, says it no
longer needs the 10 MD-80 130-seat aircraft.
It wants smaller 90-100-seater aircraft to replace its fleet of 75-seat
McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliners by the mid-1990s. It hopes to expand its
operations in an increasingly deregulated European market, Mr Kjell
Fredheim, chief operating officer, said.
SAS is discussing with McDonnell Douglas the possible substitution for the
10 MD-80s of an order for 15 MD-95s, the 90-100 seat derivative of the MD-90
twin-jet airliners, making it a launch customer for the MD-95 McDonnell
Douglas plans to co-produce with China. The US manufacturer hopes to
finalise a deal with Beijing soon. Under this, McDonnell Douglas would
co-produce in China about 170 aircraft by the year 2007.
SAS said yesterday it was also considering other choices such as the Fokker
100 and BAe 146 for its 100-seat aircraft needs. It wants the new
100-seaters by 1995-96.

<TEXT>
GEC ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French power engineering group, yesterday underlined
its growing presence in the world market for large gas turbines by
announcing a Fl 1.75bn (Pounds 545m) contract to supply equipment for a new
Dutch power station.
The deal is GEC Alsthom's biggest turbine order, and forms the lion's share
of a Fl 2bn project planned by Electriciteits Produktiemaatschappij Oost en
Noord-Nederland (Epon), the biggest Dutch electricity supplier. Work begins
this spring on the project at Eems, in the north of the Netherlands. The
1,700MW station will be one of the world's two biggest outside Japan, using
the combined cycle process; waste heat from a gas turbine drives a steam
one, producing greater thermal efficiency and fewer emissions.
The deal is a blow to GEC Alsthom's two big European power generating
equipment rivals, Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri. It confirms the advantage
the Anglo-French group has with its Frame 9F gas turbine, developed jointly
by General Electric of the US and GEC Alsthom's European Gas Turbine Company
(EGT). The 9F is the world's biggest gas turbine, specifically designed for
high performance in combined cycle operation.
Mr Kelvin Bray, EGT chairman, said the latest order, after a recent contract
from National Power in the UK and one with Electricite de France, 'will
allow us to establish the 9F and its derivatives as the turbines for large
combined cycle stations'.
At Eems, EGT will supply five 335MW Vega 109F units, incorporating the gas
turbine, steam turbine and generator on a single shaft. Overall thermal
efficiency will be about 55 per cent, against an average 41 per cent in
existing Dutch power stations.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil issued a decree last night suspending a
court-ordered increase in pension payments that has been threatening the
country's chances of an accord with the International Monetary Fund.
The suspension of the 147 per cent increase was immediately denounced as
unconstitutional and the attorney general has already moved a court action
to challenge it. The head of the Sao Paulo Pensioners Federation called it a
'dictatorial act' and said he would mobilise his members against the
decision.
However Mr Collor insists the government does not have the Dollars 10bn for
the increased pensions. The rise would also have jeopardised the fiscal
adjustment that it is due to present to the IMF next Wednesday in order to
win approval for a Dollars 2bn loan.
Mr Collor warned yesterday that those who had already received the payments
might have to return the money.
The move came after the sacking of the two ministers responsible for
administration of the pension fund. The new appointees who took office
yesterday are congressional deputies whom Mr Collor hopes will strengthen
his fragile political base. He described their appointment as 'a clear
signal to Congress that the government is willing to negotiate'.

VENEZUELA is launching a selective immigration programme aimed at bringing
in 50,000 east Europeans over the next five years, according to Mr Miguel
Rodriguez, minister of planning.
The South American republic, with about 19m inhabitants, has a shortage of
experienced professionals and tradespeople in a number of sectors, including
agriculture and general industry, and services such as health.
Its economy grew by an estimated 9.2 per cent last year, the highest rate in
Latin America. Further growth - although at a slower pace - is expected over
the next two years, increasing demand for a wide variety of skills.
The immigration programme, the first of its kind to be implemented in
Venezuela since the 1950s, is being co-ordinated by the Ministry of
Planning.
The programme would be 'demand driven', Mr Rodriguez said, with private
companies drawing up lists of specific skills required. These lists are to
be used by a special government team which will visit east European
countries to assess the availability of skilled individuals willing to
emigrate.
The Venezuelan government is receiving assistance from a UN agency that
works with international migrants.
Selected immigrants will receive free airline passage to Venezuela and a
cash payment to help cover relocation costs.

<TEXT>
ARKANSAS Governor Bill Clinton has survived the second in a series of
televised debates among the Democratic presidential candidates with no
apparent damage to his front-runner status for next month's New Hampshire
primary.
The youthful governor turned in a smooth performance in the Sunday night
debate in the face of a fierce attack from Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. Mr
Harkin, an early favourite for the nomination among organised labour, has
been losing union support to Mr Clinton, and a new poll showed him running
fifth in New Hampshire.
Mr Clinton also brushed aside allegations of womanising by blaming the
rumors on Republican opponents and declaring: 'I can deal with the kind of
sleaze the Republicans put out.'
For most of the two-hour debate the candidates sparred genteelly over the
economy, taxes, crime and schools. Mr Harkin saved his most direct attack
until the closing stages of the debate, after Governor Clinton had finished,
criticising the governor's education and environmental records and accusing
him of having brought 'Reagonomics into Arkansas.'
The candidates, aware that most Americans still do not know them, took time
to emphasise their pet issues.
The moderator gave each candidate the opportunity to address his perceived
'negatives,' and she listed them.
Senator Bob Kerrey, said to lack a detailed programme except for his health
care plan, said nothing else could be done 'until we establish health care
as a fundamental right'.
Former California Governor Jerry Brown, accused of being 'way out', said: 'I
don't know why people don't believe me when I tell them the system is
corrupt.'
Mr Harkin, accused of being 'out of the mainstream of the American
electorate', said he had 'the longest record of running against Republicans
in Republican areas and whipping them'.
Former senator Paul Tsongas, accused of being a boring Greek from
Massachusetts, said he was proud to be a Greek and that President George
Bush had also been born in Massachusetts.
New Hampshire is a crucial testing ground because it holds the first
primary, in which party voters express preferences for candidates.
A poll of New Hampshire Democratic voters published by the Boston Globe on
Sunday found 79 per cent undecided over the February 18 race.
But voters asked to pick from a list of candidates gave Mr Clinton 29 per
cent, followed by Mr Tsongas with 17 per cent.
The five Democrats running for president have all urged President Bush to
send immediate aid to the former Soviet republics, and four out of the five
have agreed to the use of US troops to deliver food supplies already in
Europe, Nancy Dunne writes.

In a meeting with visiting Indian external affairs minister Madhavsinh

nuclear weapons, and Pakistan, which is frequently accused of trying to

ALGERIA'S new leaders warned individuals and organisations yesterday that

As troops and police hunted the soldier's killers, the gendarmerie command

mosque to 'incite citizens to revolt against institutions of the state'.
The five-man collective presidency reminded Algerians it was responsible for
preserving public order following the scrapping of the second round of the
country's first multi-party general election which Moslem fundamentalists
had been poised to win. 'The High Council of State ..solemnly reminds all
those, individuals and organisations, authors, provocators and their
accomplices, it will use all the state's means for strict and total
application of the law,'' it said in a statement.
The Islamic Salvation Front, which warns of an 'explosion', has reported
more than 500 arrests since last Tuesday. It says those detained include
members of its ruling council, the Majlis Echoura, and fundamentalists
elected in first-round voting.

<TEXT>
THE GLOOM in the Japanese financial markets deepened yesterday when equities
fell sharply and the Nikkei index of leading stocks dropped through the
psychologically important 21,000 level for the first time since October
1990.
The Nikkei closed down 407.55 at 20,913.82, or 1.9 per cent, after having
been down 636 at one stage.
The Nikkei is now perilously close to the bottom of the range in which it
has been trading since the collapse of the bull market in early 1990. At
these levels, some leading Japanese banks, which count a portion of their
unrealised stock gains as capital, will be unable to meet the capital
adequacy standards set by the Bank for International Settlements.
Even though the standards do not come into effect until after March 1993,
the sight of well-known banks falling below the BIS grade could further
undermine stock market confidence.
With trading volumes low, prices are swinging about widely, often in
response to computer-driven, futures-linked trading. So it would be wrong to
read too much into a single day's business, especially as prices closed well
off their lows. Nevertheless, there is no disguising the gloom. As one
foreign fund manager in Tokyo said: 'People think shares are cheap but they
don't want to take the risk of buying.'
Some investors are convinced the end of the bear market must be in sight,
now that it has lasted two years. They point out that even though the
Japanese economy is slowing, it is growing faster than other industrialised
economies. Sooner or later this growth must bring a recovery in share
prices, they argue.
But many others see scope for a further decline. Even those who consider the
Japanese economy will eventually inspire the stock market are not expecting
a rapid revival. 'People have given up hope,' said one Japanese salesman.
Certainly, there has been some depressing economic news recently. Yesterday
Tokyo Shoko Research, a leading credit research agency, announced that the
debts of companies which went bankrupt in 1991 totalled a record Y8,149bn
(Pounds 35.6bn) - four times more than for 1990. Property and stock market
investors accounted for most of the largest failures. Also, according to a
housing industry report, flat sales fell 44 per cent in 1991 to their lowest
level since 1977.
The economic outlook is not all bad. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the
Bank of Japan, insisted in a speech yesterday that although the economy was
slowing faster than before, it was still firm. Recent economic figures
reflected the fact that companies were adjusting their inventory levels and
their rates of capital investment, he said.
The power of the Japanese economy is reflected in, among other things, the
yen's recent strength. The Japanese currency soared yesterday against the US
dollar, with the dollar closing in Tokyo down Y4.15 at Y123.10, following a
sharp rise in New York in Friday in response to intervention by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and The Bank of Japan which bought yen in large
amounts.
However, most investors in the Japanese stock market now have more urgent
matters on their minds than the long-term competitiveness of the Japanese
economy. They are more concerned about the short-term outlook for the buying
and selling of shares.
There is little dispute that equities are now inexpensive in terms of their
value as measured by the ratio of prices to earnings. The first section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange now trades at around 40 times earnings for the year
to the end of March 1991. This is down to the levels of the early 1980s -
before the bull market of the second half of the decade sent P/E ratios
spiralling.
However, many Japanese companies are expected to sell stock in the weeks
before the end of their financial year in March. Some of these groups have
been nursing losses since 1989 and have decided they no longer wish to pay
interest and other carrying charges. Also, many non-financial companies have
money invested in special funds called tokkin, which have come under
increased regulatory control from the ministry of finance. Some tokkin
investors prefer to sell than to conform to the ministry's new rules.
Meanwhile, among financial institutions, banks have little money to spare to
invest in shares: under pressure from BIS rules, they are husbanding their
funds for lending to industry. Smaller financial institutions are often in a
particularly weak position. Some banks have to sell equity holdings to cover
losses suffered on bad debts. Some small life companies are in desperate
need of raising funds to cover payments to policy holders.
Japanese individuals have money to spare. But the severity of the bear
market has sapped their appetite for stock at the same time as scandals last
year involving securities companies have made many people wary of stock
market investment. People are also scared by the sharp swings in prices of
some stocks induced by futures trading. Investment trusts are being
liquidated - their total assets fell last year by Y4,520bn to Y41,473bn.
Foreign investors have figured prominently among the buyers in the last
year. But with just 5 per cent of the market in their hands, foreign fund
managers cannot lead a sustained rally on their own.
Mr Peter Morgan, chief economist at the Tokyo branch of BZW, the broker
owned by Barclays Bank, says there is 'fair value in the market and it will
eventually be recognised'. But he adds: 'Unfortunately there are still
plenty of sellers.'

the capital, Kinshasa, agencies report.
The conference was supposed to have brought to an end 27 years of autocratic
rule by President Mobutu Sese Seko, but this was not to be.
Mr Nguza said the conference, dominated by opponents of the president, was
contributing to violence in the central African country.
Street protests flared against the decision and opposition supporters
yesterday set up barricades in several districts of the capital Kinshasa.
The city remained tense.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Shamir stands by policy on settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, and his senior Likud party
colleagues yesterday proclaimed a determination to maintain Israeli rule
over the occupied territories, a stance likely to be the core issue in an
impending early general election.
With Washington expected to tie the issue of Jewish settlement in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in
US loan guarantees, opposition leaders say Likud's commitment to the
territories threatens distress for an economy already hard hit by mass
Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union.
But Mr Shamir brushed this aside when he visited the Jewish settlement of
Betar Illit a day after his coalition lost its parliamentary majority
following the withdrawal of two extreme rightwing parties, almost certainly
precipitating a general election in May or June.
'We see the new building of Betar - the building in all Judaea and Samaria
(the West Bank) and the Gaza Strip. No power on earth will prevent this
building,' Mr Shamir said.
The Likud leadership, drawing confidence from opinion polls indicating that
it is well ahead of the main opposition Labour party, has shown little sign
it is worried by claims that its stance on the occupied territories will
jeopardise relations with the US, damage the aid-reliant economy and prevent
hope of a peace settlement in the current Middle East negotiations.
Likud has promised to continue the peace process, making capital yesterday
out of an ill-judged call by Mr Shimon Peres, the Labour leader, to suspend
the talks until after the election. But Mr Moshe Arens, the defence
minister, said: 'This government wants to bring about peace to the people of
Israel, but not at the price of our rights to this land.'
Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, the finance minister, said he did not believe reports in
US newspapers, widely circulated in Israel, that President George Bush
planned to withhold the loan guarantees unless Israel promised to freeze
settlement building.
A report commissioned by Mr Moda'i to back Israel's loan guarantee request,
leaked to the Israeli media on Sunday, points out that Dollars 10bn is only
half of the country's external borrowing requirement if the expected 1m
immigrants arrive by mid-decade.
Reuter adds from Gaza: An Israeli military review panel yesterday upheld an
army order to expel seven Palestinians accused of fomenting violence,
Palestinian sources said. Israel had announced the expulsion of 12 Arabs on
charges of inciting violence early this month after the shooting of four
Israelis in ambushes in the occupied territories.
The other five Palestinian activists due to be expelled are from the
occupied West Bank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek government yesterday announced radical tax reforms, coupled with a
wage freeze for public sector workers aimed at substantially reducing the
public sector deficit this year, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The measures came as a shock to the public sector trade unions, which were
preparing to negotiate a 6-8 per cent increase in 1992, well below the
current inflation rate of 17.8 per cent. Private sector workers had already
settled for a 10 per cent minimum rise under a two-year wage pact agreed in
1991.
Mr Ioannis Paleocrassas, the finance minister, said the wage freeze would
result in budgetary savings of Dr35bn (Pounds 106m).
Greece wants to trim central government borrowing from 16 to 13 per cent of
gross domestic product this year and cut inflation to 13 per cent. These
targets are part of a medium-term stabilisation plan designed to ensure that
Greece can enter the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system
by the end of 1993.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Bundesbank spurns threat of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank rejected warnings of an imminent recession in the German
economy and defended its decision to raise interest rates in December.
It remains concerned by the possibility of excessive wage rises in the pay
round and the lack of spending restraint in the public sector.
Its latest monthly report spells out the continuing acceleration in German
money supply last November, which reached 5.1 per cent for the M3 measure
(including non-bank savings and deposit accounts). This is outside the 3-5
per cent target for the year.
The bank cites concern over the ongoing growth in money supply as a decisive
factor behind the interest rate rise.
At the same time the Bundesbank, clearly stung by international criticism of
the increase, insisted on its role in preserving the value of the D-Mark as
the 'anchor' of the European monetary system.
'The increase in the discount and Lombard rates presents no untenable risks
for economic growth and employment in Germany,' the monthly report
concludes.
Economic growth in the west of the country has slowed after the 'stormy
growth' up until early 1991. However, 'from today's viewpoint there is no
fear that the economic calming down will slip into lasting economic
weakness, or into a recession, provided there are no false developments in
the current wage negotiations, and the world economy does not bring new
risks.'
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, said in a simultaneous report that
the German economy was facing a turning point in the coming months, which
would decide 'whether the overall economic activity of west Germany will
find its dynamism after a short pause for breath, or whether we will have a
longer lasting economic downturn'.
The deciding factors would be a strong wage-cost push from current
negotiations, or the failure of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of trade
talks, he said.
The Bundesbank report cites the most recent development of demand, running
at higher levels than early 1991 in such areas as exports, and the
investment plans of enterprises.
The Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency, is adjusting its marketing
strategy in an attempt to sell the remaining companies in its portfolio by
the end of the year. The 6,000 former East German enterprises still held by
the agency will be sold in sectors starting this week with the wood and
furniture industry.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Sweden seeks support deal for krona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN is aiming to secure a special exchange rate support agreement with
other European countries to underpin the krona before negotiations for EC
membership begin, Mrs Anne Wibble, finance minister, said yesterday.
During a visit to London, Mrs Wibble said Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the
Swedish central bank, had already discussed some form of 'intervention
arrangement' with other EC central banks participating in the exchange rate
mechanism of the European monetary system (EMS).
No deal had yet been concluded. 'It will be up to the other countries,' she
said.
Although she gave no details, such an arrangement could include provision
for EC central banks to make short-term credit lines available to their
Swedish counterpart to shore up the krona in case of exchange market
tensions. Such mutual support facilities are an integral part of the EMS.
Mrs Wibble, who yesterday met Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, said she hoped an accord could be reached before negotiations on
accession to the EC began in the second half of this year, when Britain
takes over the EC presidency.
Mrs Wibble was confident Britain would support Sweden's aim to become a full
EC member by January 1 1995. She also voiced Sweden's wish to take part in
European monetary union from the earliest possible date.
According to treaty changes agreed at the Maastricht summit last month, Emu
could take place as soon as 1997.
Sweden's need for a more formal exchange rate stabilisation framework for
the krona arises from its decision last June to link the currency to the
Ecu.
Sweden has undertaken unilaterally to keep the krona within a 1.5 per cent
fluctuation band against the Ecu. In the event of pressure on the currency,
Sweden does not have the ability to fall back on support made available to
other EC members through the EMS's multilateral credit arrangements.
Last month the Swedish central bank was forced to raise its key lending rate
by 6 percentage points to 17.5 per cent, to counter massive capital outflows
sparked by speculation of a krona devaluation. The lending rate has since
come down to 12.5 per cent.
A total of SKr12bn (Pounds 1.1bn) of short-term capital had returned to the
country this year, following SKr25bn-SKr30bn last year after the December 5
interest rate rise, Mrs Wibble said.
Sweden's non-Socialist government appeared last night to be in disarray over
its economic policy after a senior figure in the cabinet, Liberal leader
Bengt Westerberg, cast doubt on the government's plan to cut taxes by
SKr10bn a year until the middle of the 1990s.
Mr Westerberg, who is social affairs minister, said in a television
interview he had changed his mind about the need to reduce Sweden's tax
burden. He did not think further government spending cuts were possible or
necessary.

THE Turkish government plans to sell its shares in five companies, raising

privatisation programme, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul.
Officials confirmed yesterday that the stakes would be sold in block shares

A decision by the Council of Ministers last week cleared the way for all
government minority shares in privately managed companies to be sold.
The five companies affected in the first stage are: Ray Insurance, which is
to sell a 40 per cent stake raising TL50bn (Pounds 5.3m); Seker Insurance,
which is to shed 13 per cent of its shares, worth TL7bn; Ipragas, a retail
gas distributor, which will raise Dollars 350m by selling a 51 per cent
stake; Caybank, the tea-planters' co-operative bank, which will shed 49 per
cent for TL315bn; and Tat, a canned fruit company belonging to Koc Holding,
which is expected to fetch TL41bn through its sale of a 17 per cent stake.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Kohl urges crackdown on insider trading: Chancellor pledges

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday called on the banks and traders
on the Frankfurt stock exchange to crack down on insider trading in an
effort to strengthen their claim to become the financial centre of Europe,
writes Quentin Peel.
At the same time he pledged the support of his government in drawing up the
new legislation needed to make the German capital markets more flexible and
more attractive to would-be investors.
He also promised a determined campaign to make Frankfurt the headquarters
for the future European central bank, the institution which will control the
single European currency.
His blunt appeal was launched at the annual opening of the Frankfurt stock
exchange and German futures and options market.
It was not enough for the government to pass enabling legislation allowing
the stock markets to co-ordinate their activities, launch a futures market
and introduce new technologies, he said. The markets must put their own
house in order.
'It is just as important for the supervision of stock exchanges and
securities transactions, above all in the area of insider trading, to meet
modern requirements.
'It will not do for a few individuals to jeopardise international trust in
the German financial market. The current insider regulations - based on
voluntary codes of conduct - are clearly not enough to prevent irresponsible
behaviour.'
He spelt out a series of measures planned or already undertaken by the
German government, including the package unveiled last week by Mr Theo
Waigel, the finance minister, to strengthen the German capital markets. They
included the amendment of the stock exchange law, enabling the establishment
of the futures and options market, and the introduction of new technology in
stock market transactions.
Mr Waigel's package also proposes making insider trading punishable with up
to two years in prison and calls for greater transparency in company share
registers.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the German Social Democrat leader, attempted yesterday to
end a damaging split in the opposition party by saying he was prepared to be
the SPD candidate to challenge Chancellor Kohl in Germany's 1994 election,
Reuter reports from Bonn.

FT  21 JAN 92 / At least eleven survive Airbus crash in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent, and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 11 people were believed to have survived after a French Airbus A320
airliner crashed last night in the Vosges mountains in eastern France.
Police said that a girl, aged about two, and a member of the crew were among
the survivors. Including the crew, 96 people were on board.
The wreckage of the Air Inter airliner, on a domestic flight from Lyons to
Strasbourg, was found four hours after it disappeared suddenly from radar
screens near the village of La Bloss, 50km south of Strasbourg. The aircraft
had left Lyons at 6.30pm. Air controllers said the aircraft vanished without
giving a distress signal a few minutes before it was due to land at
Strasbourg.
Officials said the search for the wreckage - eventually located at an
altitude of 500 metres south of Mount Saint Odile - was complicated by fog,
snow and high winds, dense pine forests and rugged terrain.
Airbus Industrie said in Toulouse that there were no immediate indications
as to the cause of the crash. 'We cannot speculate on the possible cause,'
said an official of a four-nation European consortium.
The Airbus A320 is regarded as the most advanced civil aircraft currently in
service operated by sophisticated computer systems known as 'fly by wire'.
Last night's crash is the third to involve the 150-seater A320 twin-engine
airliner, designed for short- or medium-range flights, and is bound to
rekindle the controversy over the possible hazards of aircraft operated by
highly computerised systems.
The A320 has been a best seller for the European consortium, which had
booked a total of 661 orders for the airliner and delivered 251 aircraft by
the end of last year. But the computer systems have regularly been the
subject of debate although Airbus's rivals have introduced similar systems.
Airbus emphasised last night that, in the two previous fatal crashes
involving A320 aircraft, the airliner, its systems and its engines had been
cleared and not implicated as a cause of the accidents. In both cases pilot
error was blamed. The accidents involved an Indian Airline A320 which
crashed in February 1990, killing 92 people, and an Air France A320 which
crashed during an air show, killing three people, in 1988.
Airbus said it was sending a team of experts today to join the
investigation. Investigators will try to recover the digital flight data
recorder and the cockpit voice recorder (the so-called black boxes).
Weather conditions in the Strasbourg area were reported to have been bad. An
SAS McDonnell Douglas MD-80 crashed earlier this month because of de-icing
problems.
The crash is a blow for Airbus at a time when aircraft manufacturers are
struggling for new orders from financially pressed airline customers. Airbus
saw a big drop in new orders last year - to 101 aircraft from 404 in 1990, a
record year for the commercial aircraft industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government has agreed to form a technical committee with experts
from its state holding company IRI and representatives of SGS-Thomson, the
debt-laden Franco-Italian microchip venture.
The group is to study ways in which Italy can participate in French plans to
boost technological development under French Prime Minister Mrs Edith
Cresson's high technology plan for French industry.
The agreement follows talks at a dinner in Rome last night between Mrs
Cresson, Mr Giulio Andreotti, the Italian prime minister, and Mr Franco
Nobili, head of IRI.
Mrs Cresson was appealing to a sceptical Italy to contribute up to Dollars
225m (Pounds 125m) towards SGS-Thomson's immediate needs, estimated at a
total of Dollars 500m.
Mr Andreotti was careful not to alienate Mrs Cresson's overtures. However,
he is understood to have pointed out the country was due to face elections
in April and that any financial commitments to SGS-Thomson's capital
increase could not come until later in the year.
In principle Italy is anxious to become involved in advanced technology.
However IRI is constrained by its high indebtedness and the increasingly
scarce resources of the Treasury. The technical committee agreed last night
was thus seen as a compromise between these two positions.
Refinancing for SGS-Thomson is an important part of the Paris government's
project to create a FFr75bn (Pounds 7.7bn) turnover nuclear
energy-to-electronics company by merging the civil nuclear and electronics
activities of Thomson, the state-owned electronics group, and CEA-Industrie,
a nuclear plant and fuel company.
Mrs Cresson yesterday began a two-day visit to the French and Italian plants
in the new group, which the government wants to get into operation by
mid-year under the name Thomson CEA Industrie.
IRI and its subsidiaries hold 45 per cent in SGS-Thomson.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Butter mountain in Moscow: A look at the west's humanitarian
aid on its murky passage to former Soviet shelves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCKED up in Moscow's Warehouse No. 9 last week were 59 tonnes of European
Community butter. The 25kg blocks are the first instalment of an EC food aid
programme to help Moscow and St Petersburg through a winter of harsh
economic reforms, but there was already too much butter in the shops because
aid is so far proving as out of step with supply and demand as ever the
centrally-planned economy was.
In Moscow, an old man, challenged by angry people in a bakery queue for
buying four loaves of bread, replied that he was going to be eating bread
and butter for the entire week.
In other republics, such as Ukraine, food supplies are plentiful but
medicine is in short supply (a third of patients in the former Soviet Union
are getting inadequate medical treatment because of a shortage of drugs).
As more than 50 foreign ministers assemble in Washington tomorrow to
consider co-ordinating humanitarian aid to the former Soviet Union, they
will be trying to answer two questions: what sort of aid is required, and
how can it be protected from theft, corruption, and poor distribution?
The first question is already partly answered by the conference's list of
areas where aid is needed: fuel, food, medicine, housing and technical
assistance - including ways of bolstering the commonwealth's capacity to
meet its needs in future (for instance in cutting energy waste, estimated at
a third of current consumption).
The trickiest question, however, is to do with where the aid should end up.
Mr Michael Emerson, head of the EC mission in Moscow, admits that the
emphasis on Moscow and St Petersburg was partly political.
'If there is social unrest in Moscow and St Petersburg, that is a big
problem. If it is in smaller areas, that is not such a threat to the
government,' he said in an interview. But conscious that shortages in cities
such as Perm in the Urals may be even worse than in Moscow, he expressed
hope that the conference would enable other countries to plug gaps
elsewhere.
Mr Emerson also put his finger on the fact that only a minority of the
population needs aid, with the rest able to cope despite considerable
hardship: the question is ensuring it gets to the right people.
Another problem - which the conference may help tackle but which must be
resolved primarily by the former Soviet republics - is the disappearance of
even a minimum of co-ordinating authority for aid distribution. Since the
union collapsed Ecu1.75bn (Pounds 1.25bn) of EC credits and credit
guarantees are lying idle because the republics have no mechanism for
sharing it out.
The answer to the second question - how to stop the losses - is that
observers believe a certain amount of aid is bound to go missing while the
corrupt old system is being dismantled. But ways of minimising those losses
are already being tried out.
Hired to monitor the fate of EC food aid in Moscow alone, Mr Manfred
Schneider uses statistical sampling methods to check for losses between the
warehouse and the state shops where the butter, and subsequent deliveries of
meat and milk powder, are to be sold. The proceeds of the sales are to go
into special bank accounts to support the needy.
'We are not in a position to post a guard next to every carcass of meat, nor
would we want to,' says Mr Schneider.
His first conclusions are encouraging: he is satisfied that none of the
butter has gone missing in the week since it was moved to the store rooms of
23 shops in the north and west of Moscow.
Mr Schneider's other task is to identify and prevent bottlenecks which may
appear in future as aid volumes grow from their present 'test' levels. One
such potential bottleneck was identified when it was discovered that the 59
tonnes of EC butter could not be delivered to shops already saturated with
older butter imported from other sources. The butter is being held back
until there is demand for it.
Mr Schneider is also exploring whether aid can help develop market
mechanisms, such as pricing which responds to supply and demand.
The biggest losses appear to be hitting small parcels sent by well-meaning
individuals in the west. They are more difficult to monitor than bulk
deliveries by known senders, with some parcels arriving at Moscow's
Sheremetyevo airport addressed simply to 'The Mayor of Moscow, Russia'.
What is the logic for aid at all if the distribution system is still as poor
and leaky as it was last year?
The difference is that aid this year coincides with reforms already under
way - for instance to privatise the distribution and trade networks as well
as agriculture - by a government seen by many in the west as meaning
business.
'This system is going to waste a good part of this (aid) but this is a
mistake which one would allow the country to make because it is part of a
process,' explained one western diplomat. 'One would trust the leadership's
good intentions and its capacity to correct the mistakes in the course of
reforms.'

<TEXT>
THREE French television stations - TFI, Canal Plus and M6 - are considering
launching a news channel to replace La Cinq, the French TV company which
filed for bankruptcy three weeks ago, Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris.
The proposed news channel, to be staffed by journalists from La Cinq, would
provide a French-language news service on international affairs to be
broadcast in France and other French-speaking countries.
The announcement comes at a critical time for the French government.
Ministers are anxious to avoid a confrontation with Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
the Italian media mogul who was one of the principal shareholders in La Cinq
and is now mooting plans for its rescue.

FT  21 JAN 92 / W European car sales at record in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN European new car sales rose by 0.4 per cent last year to a record
13.53m, from 13.47m a year earlier.
The increase was almost solely due to the 28 per cent jump in sales in
Germany in the wake of the country's reunification, however, and masked a
deep recession in several other key markets.
Excluding Germany, new car sales in the rest of Europe fell sharply by 8.4
per cent to 9.3m, industry estimates show.
Western European new car sales rose strongly in the first half of the year
under the impact of surging demand in Germany, but began to weaken in the
second half as German sales began to fall back from record levels.
Sales were lower than a year earlier in four of the last six months of 1991,
but the market staged a modest recovery in December, when sales rose by 4.1
per cent to an estimated 827,000.
The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, SEAT and Skoda, has
established a clear leadership of the western European new car market, not
least because of its dominant position in the German market.
It increased its market share last year to 16.5 per cent from 15.8 per cent
a year earlier, thanks to a 5 per cent increase in sales volume.
At the same time the challenge for market leadership from the Fiat group,
which includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti and Ferrari, has waned, as the
Italian car maker's share of the domestic Italian market has come under
concerted attack, in particular from Ford of the US.
Fiat and the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen, were the
losers among the big six volume car makers in Europe last year. Fiat's sales
dropped by 8.7 per cent, depressing its market share to 12.8 per cent from
14.1 per cent a year earlier.
The Peugeot group's sales fell by 6 per cent, which resulted in it being
ousted from third place in the western European car sales league by General
Motors of the US. Its sales recovered in the final months of the year,
however, allowing it to stay narrowly ahead of Ford.
The Japanese car makers made further inroads into the western European car
market, increasing their share to 12.3 per cent from 11.7 per cent, mainly
because of an 11.9 per cent jump in sales by Nissan, which is starting to
benefit strongly from rising supply from its UK car plant, the first
Japanese car plant in Europe.
Overall new car sales fell last year in 11 of 17 markets across western
Europe. The biggest decline among the big markets came in the UK, with a
fall of 20.7 per cent, while France sales fell 12 per cent.

FT  21 JAN 92 / At least 11 survive French Airbus crash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 11 survivors, including a child, were found in the wreckage of a
French Airbus A320 which crashed in thick fog in the Vosges mountains of
eastern France. At least one of the six crew members also survived. There
were 96 passengers and crew on board.
State-run Air Inter said it had no indication as to the cause of the crash.
Wreckage was found on a wooded ridge four hours after the jet, on a domestic
flight from Lyon to Strasbourg, disappeared from radar screens. The Air
Inter aircraft, flight IT-5148, gave no distress signal. However, a witness
in a village 30 miles south of Strasbourg heard an explosion at around
7.30pm, shortly after the jet was due to land.
Rescue workers were hampered by snow, high winds and freezing fog.
The A320, regarded as the most advanced civil aircraft in service, is
operated by sophisticated computer 'fly by wire' systems. Last night's
crash, the third involving the 150-seater twin-engine jet, will rekindle
controversy over the possible hazards of aircraft operated by such systems.
The A320 has been a best seller for its maker, Airbus Industrie, the
four-nation European consortium. Page 3

FT  21 JAN 92 / Rise in dollar halted after US-Japanese intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURPRISE US-Japanese action to brake the dollar's recent rise fuelled
speculation yesterday that international currency movements will play a more
prominent part than previously expected in Saturday's talks among Group of
Seven finance ministers and central bankers in the US.
However, with US government offices closed and trading in financial markets
thin because of Martin Luther King Day, foreign exchange traders and
analysts were unclear whether Friday night's dollar sales by the US Federal
Reserve and the Bank of Japan were intended to tackle bilateral US-Japanese
problems or part of a US-inspired plan to enhance the role of the G7 in
global economic management.
Not in doubt was the effect of the joint intervention on the dollar's value.
It halted the US currency's sharp rise that began on January 9.
The dollar closed at Y123.65 in London yesterday, down Y3.8 on Friday's
finish. It fell one pfennig to DM1.597, while sterling closed nearly 1 1/2
cents higher at Dollars 1.7910 compared with Dollars 1.7765 on Friday.
In New York, the dollar finished a foreshortened holiday session at Y123.25
and DM1.5905. The pound closed at Dollars 1.799. Early today in Tokyo the US
currency opened at Y123.55 and DM1.5863.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of capital markets research at Swiss Bank Corp in
London, said the US-Japanese decision to sell dollars at Y127.15 after
London trading on Friday was 'potentially more important than the occasional
Friday afternoon flurry'.
The US Treasury has rarely been keen on intervention in the past. Friday's
move may, therefore, have been intended to show that the recent US-Japanese
agreement to promote economic growth in the two countries and the world
meant action as well as words.
Mr O'Neill said the intervention may also have been designed to serve notice
on the other G7 countries - Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -
that the US would try to breathe more life into the group as an agent for
changing economic policies and priorities.
One senior G7 official admitted that the other G7 countries had been
surprised by the US-Japanese intervention, which was not taken in concert
with other members of the group. But the official, who asked not to be
identified, said both countries had reasons of their own for the
intervention.
If maintained, the recent sharp rise in the dollar could threaten the
increased international competitiveness of US exporters and US hopes of
export-led recovery.
Japan, which has come under mounting criticism in the US for its growing
bilateral trade surplus, would not welcome a stronger dollar because it
would threaten to raise trade friction between the two countries. The
interest of other G7 countries in intervention is small at present.
Bundesbank officials said current exchange rates among G7 countries caused
it no problems.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, believes that the G7 is a useful forum for
exchanging information. But he shows no enthusiasm for the close
co-ordination of G7 exchange rates and economic policies that existed in the
mid-1980s.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Nestle bid for Perrier may spark fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the most formidable forces in European industry have squared up to
fight for ownership of Perrier, the French mineral water.
Nestle, the Swiss food group, yesterday joined forces with Indosuez, the
French bank, to mount a FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.38bn) bid for Source Perrier,
in a move which could bring them into conflict with the Agnellis, the
Italian industrial dynasty.
The bid for Perrier takes place against a labyrinthine background of deals,
counter-deals and cross-shareholdings.
Analysts in Paris yesterday were furiously speculating about the chances of
a counter-bid for Perrier by the Agnellis and about their interest in BSN,
the giant French food group which is an old ally of Nestle.
Indosuez and Nestle pounced on Perrier only months after Ifint, one of the
Agnelli holding companies, launched a FFr5.6bn offer for Exor, the French
wine and property group which controls 35 per cent of Perrier.
The Agnellis have already crossed swords with Suez, the parent company of
Indosuez. The French group led a lobby of Exor's minority shareholders who
successfully insisted that the Italians convert their partial bid into a
full offer.
The prospect of a battle for Perrier is complicated by speculation over the
Agnellis' intentions towards BSN, whose Evian and Badoit brands make it a
major force in the mineral water market.
BSN has joined the Nestle camp by agreeing to buy Volvic, one of the Perrier
waters, if the bid succeeds.
The Agnellis already indirectly hold 5.8 per cent of BSN. They have an
interest in another 3 per cent through their investment in Saint-Louis, the
French paper group which recently bought 13.8 per cent of Perrier for
FFr1.5bn. BSN's shares yesterday rose by FFr14 to FFr1,154 on speculation
that the Agnellis might increase their stake.
Nestle, which already owns Vittel mineral water, is funding its Perrier bid
jointly with Indosuez through Demilac, a specially created holding company.
They are offering FFr1,475 a share for Perrier against the suspended market
price of FFr1,396.
Indosuez's involvement has been interpreted by analysts as an attempt to add
a French flavour to Nestle's offer following the chauvinistic uproar that
greeted the Agnellis' bid for Exor.
'It is obvious that the French establishment would rather Perrier went to
Indosuez and Nestle than to the Italians,' said Mr Adam Dickens, an analyst
in Paris for James Capel, the stockbroker.
So far the strategy seems to be working. Credit Agricole, the French bank
which owns 2.5 per cent of Perrier and 25 per cent of Roquefort, its famous
cheese company, yesterday waded into the battlezone by throwing its weight
behind the forces of Nestle and Indosuez.

FT  21 JAN 92 / PM avoids Brooke departure: Major says Northern Ireland
secretary 'has more work to do yet'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, TIM COONE and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday avoided a first resignation from his cabinet
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but may have weakened the government's hand in dealings with Northern
Ireland - when he refused to accept an offer to quit by Mr Peter Brooke.
The Northern Ireland secretary had been criticised for singing on an Irish
television chat show on Friday only hours after an IRA bomb killed seven
civilians in Tyrone.
The prime minister, speaking on a visit to Northern Ireland, expressed full
confidence in Mr Brooke. But the incident appeared last night to have
undermined efforts to start political talks on the future of the province.
Amid bizarre scenes at Westminster, Mr Brooke won warm and almost
unqualified support from Labour and Tory backbenchers for his honourable
stance, but he is believed at Westminster to be unlikely to survive in his
present post beyond the general election.
He created confusion with his resignation offer, which he made public at the
end of a Commons statement on the latest IRA bombing. Not until some hours
later did Downing Street announce that it had been rejected.
Mr Major described Mr Brooke as a 'very good friend of peace in Northern
Ireland. . . He has more work to do yet.'
Mr Major visited one of the workers injured in the blast during a Belfast
tour and promised that the killers would be 'hunted, hunted, and hunted for
the rest of their days'. Last night he and Mr Brooke spent two hours in
talks with Unionist MPs on security in the province and agreed to consider
some proposals, believed to include a citizens' militia and the cordoning of
Catholic areas.
Heading the Unionist delegation was the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the
Democratic Unionist Party - the most prominent among those who called for Mr
Brooke's resignation for appearing on the Late Late Show in Dublin.
Mr Paisley did not rule out meeting Mr Brooke again, but said Unionists
would 'consider very carefully' whether to take part in further 'talks about
talks' on the future of the province. Mr Paisley said confidence in Mr
Brooke had been 'irretrievably damaged', adding that the minister had, in
effect, 'danced on the graves' of the IRA's victims.
Among others, Mr Brooke is likely to have lost considerable respect for
appearing to cower to DUP demands by offering his resignation.
During the Irish television show, Mr Brooke expressed outrage at the attack
and sympathy for the victims' families. He declined a request to sing 'Danny
Boy', but bowed to the insistence of Mr Gay Byrne, the show's host, and sang
'Oh My Darling Clementine'.
Northern Ireland Office officials had argued that to change his programme on
Friday would have been to allow the IRA to set the agenda.
In the Commons, Mr Brooke apologised for his 'error', which he insisted was
'innocent in intent'. As he spoke, Tory MPs shouted 'no, no, no'. Mr Kevin
McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, praised Mr Brooke's
'characteristically honest and courageous statement'.
Mr Brooke offered his resignation during Mr Major's trip to Belfast but
urged the prime minister not to upset his itinerary to make a decision.
Downing Street stressed that Mr Brooke had acted 'entirely honourably' and
said the people of Northern Ireland would respect his stand, recognising
'the depth of his contrition'.
In Dublin, Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, backed Mr Brooke and
looked forward to seeing him 'very shortly'. An Anglo-Irish conference
meeting is expected next week.
RTE, the Irish state television station, made a public apology to Mr Brooke.
It said that: 'RTE would very much regret if the (interview) should damage
in any way Mr Brooke's work or cause his resignation . . . it was an error
to have invited Mr Brooke to sing and any offence which may have been caused
is very much regretted'.

<TEXT>
One might have thought that the former staff of British &amp; Commonwealth
Merchant Bank, which was dragged down by problems at Atlantic Computers, the
computer- leasing operation that also belonged to the B &amp; C group, would
wish to have nothing further to do with the subject of leasing.
However, David Milne, who was director of capital markets at the merchant
bank until its demise last August, has moved to Baltic, the Mayfair-based
leasing and finance house. Milne, who is 39, says Baltic is a
'conservatively-run leasing company that is at the same time very
entrepreneurial'.
Sounding predictably jaundiced about the Square Mile - 'a very
inward-looking place these days' - he says he has been hired by Baltic to
build up its structured finance side. He had been with B &amp; C MB from its
inception, 'a great opportunity that foundered due to a sick parent'. Not
afflicted with false modesty, he adds: 'The fact that 80 per cent of the
former employees of (B&amp;C merchant bank) have now got good jobs is a
reflection of the calibre of those people.'

FT  21 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Italian banks cannot be sued in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND v CASSA DI RISPARMIO DELLE PROVINCIE LOMBARD AND
OTHERS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Mustill, Lord Justice Butler-Sloss and
Sir John Megaw): December 19 1991
THE UNIFORM Customs and Practice, when incorporated into an agreement
between the issuing bank and the accepting bank under a letter of credit,
does not dominate over express terms. And accordingly, where the parties
expressly agree that reimbursement by the issuing bank should take place
through its agent in the US, that is the 'primary obligation in question' on
a reimbursement claim by the accepting bank, for the purpose of determining
jurisdiction under the 1968 Brussels Convention, irrespective of any
underlying obligation the issuing bank may have under the UCP to reimburse
in the UK on non-performance by the agent.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff,
Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS), from Mr Justice Phillips's decision (FT,
December 11 1990) setting aside service of proceedings in six actions by RBS
against the defendant Italian banks, Cassa Di Risparmio Delle Provincie
Lombard, Banco Populare di Bergamo SCaRL and others, on the ground that the
English court had no jurisdiction to hear the claims.
Article 2 of the Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention 1968, incorporated
into UK law by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, provides that
'persons domiciled in a contracting state shall, whatever their nationality,
be sued in the courts of that state'.
Article 5: 'A person sued in a contracting state may, in another contracting
state, be sued: (1) in matters relating to a contract, in the courts for the
place of performance of the obligation in question . . .'
that Italian importers purchased a consignment of pears, payment to be in
dollars in London via irrevocable letters of credit in favour of CIR Ltd.
A letter of credit to that effect was opened by Bergamo, available by RBS's
acceptance of drafts drawn on RBS.
RBS was asked to add its confirmation.
The message making that request included a provision that on receipt of
regular documents RBS should accept a beneficiary draft drawn on RBS 'and at
maturity you are authorised to reimburse yourselves with Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co - New York'.
The contract between Bergamo and RBS was subject to the Uniform Customs and
Practice for Documentary Credits, ICC No 400 1983 Revision.
Article 11d of the UCP provided that, by requesting a bank to add its
confirmation, the issuing bank authorised it to pay, accept or negotiate
against documents 'and undertakes to reimburse such bank in accordance with
the provisions of these articles'.
Article 16a provided that, if an authorised bank effected payment, or
negotiated against documents which appeared on their face to be accordance
with the credit, 'the party giving such authority shall be bound to
reimburse the bank which has effected payment . . . or negotiated . . .'
Article 21b provided that an issuing bank would not be relieved from any of
its obligations to reimburse if reimbursement was not effected by the
reimbursing bank.
On March 13 1990 RBS reported to Bergamo that it had forwarded the credit to
CIR, adding its own confirmation. On April 2 CIR presented the shipping
documents to RBS in London. On April 3 RBS, after obtaining Bergamo's
permission, took them up and accepted CIR's draft, expressed to mature on
May 23.
Immediately on taking up the documents RBS took back the draft from CIR and
discounted it, crediting the net amount to CIR's account.
While the bill was still current Bergamo received information giving grounds
to suspect that the underlying transaction was affected by fraud and that
the documents negotiated under the credit might be false.
On May 14 it telexed RBS suggesting it held back payment on the due date.
That was too late to prevent the discounting of the bill.
On May 22 Bergamo confirmed it was unable to pay RBS, and requested it to
refrain from claiming reimbursement from Manufacturers Hanover which, it
said, was no longer authorised to reimburse RBS.
RBS nevertheless did claim reimbursement when the bill matured.
Manufacturers Hanover declined, as it was bound to do in the light of the
changed instruction. It had no connection with the transaction save as
Bergamo's agent.
RBS sought what it called 'reimbursement' from Bergamo in the present
action, by issuing a writ.
What it was claiming was not indemnity against the amount paid to the holder
of its acceptance at maturity, but compensation equal to the amount for
which it had bought back its own acceptance from the holder-beneficiary.
Pursuant to the practice for service under the Jurisdiction and Judgments
Convention, the writ was issued without leave. It stated that the court had
power under the 1982 Act to hear and determine the claim.
It was pleaded that, on the maturity date of May 23, RBS became entitled to
be reimbursed Dollars 137,088 by Bergamo, and that Bergamo had failed to pay
in breach of its contract with RBS.
By article 5 of the Convention, a person sued in a contracting state might
be sued in contractual matters in another contracting state, in the 'place
of performance of the obligation in question'.
In Shenavai v Kreischer (1987) ECR 239 the European Court said that 'where
various obligations are at issue, it will be the principal obligation which
will determine jurisdiction'.
Italy and the UK were 'contracting states' for the purposes of the
Convention. The US was not.
Bergamo moved to set aside the writ, maintaining that the 'obligation in
question' for the purposes of article 5(1) did not fall for performance in
the UK and that, accordingly, under article 2 the proper place for service
was Italy.
RBS argued that the legal structure of the relationship between the parties
to a documentary credit transaction was created by the UCP, and that so far
as reimbursement of the accepting bank by the issuing bank was concerned,
the obligation was created and defined by article 11d and 16a of UCP.
It said failure to reimburse was merely failure of the contemplated
mechanism and it was the obligation of the issuing bank itself to pay
pursuant to article 21b which constituted the principal obligation forming
the basis of the proceedings.
Hence, it was said, in accordance with Shenavai it was to that obligation
that the court should look when ascertaining the place of performance of the
obligation in question for the purposes of article 5(1).
Neither the UCP nor the other terms of the contract stipulated the place
where that obligation was to be performed so, it was contended, under
English law place of performance was London where the RBS branch carried on
business.
Mr Justice Phillips did not accept those contentions.
The case was founded on the proposition that the contractual relationship
was dominated by the UCP and that the issuing bank's obligation to reimburse
RBS derived solely from articles 11 and 16.
That was not so.
The UCP had an important role in the conduct of international trade. It
expounded technical terms. It promoted consistency; and it enabled the
parties to express their intentions briefly, without the need to negotiate
and set out all the terms of the relationship at length.
Nevertheless, it did not constitute a statutory code.
It contained a formulation of customs and practices which the parties to a
letter of credit transaction could incorporate into their contract by
reference.
That being so, the obvious place to start when searching for a contractual
term material to a particular obligation, was the express agreement between
the parties.
Thus, when inquiring into the manner in which the issuing bank was to effect
reimbursement, the court must look first at what the parties had expressly
agreed.
It found the answer at once - reimbursement was to be made by Manufacturers
Hanover in New York.
The 'obligation in question' for the purposes of article 5 was the
obligation to effect reimbursement, and that was an obligation which was due
for performance outside the jurisdiction of the English court.
The appeals were dismissed.
Their Lordships agreed.
For RBS: Timothy Walker QC and Alan Griffiths (Slaughter and May)
For the first five defendants: Simon Tuckey QC and Jeremy Storey (Mackenzie
Mills)
For the sixth defendant: Richard Aikens QC and Jeremy Storey (Norton Rose)

FT  21 JAN 92 / Appointments: Commercial Union takes on optimist and critic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL UNION is expected to confirm this week the appointment of Chris
Pountain, Morgan Stanley's widely respected insurance analyst. Pountain, 38,
who will take over the deputy group planning and corporate finance position,
has a reputation for being very bearish about the prospects of the UK
composite insurers. CU, arguably the most successful of the UK composites,
is setting something of a trend with the appointment of another outsider to
a key management post.
Late last year Cees Schrauwers rejoined CU after a spell at Coopers and
Lybrand Deloitte, to take over as general manager for the com-pany's
non-life business. Like Pountain, Schrauwers has been a critic of the UK
insurance industry's sluggishness. CU has also appointed other insurance
analysts: Peter Rice and Alan Clifton having joined the company from County
NatWest and KitKat and Aitken respectively. Pountain, who joined Morgan
Stanley from County NatWest in 1989, started his career at Scottish Widows.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Appointments: Fraser leaves Whitbread for Shepherd Neame
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Angus Fraser, recently chairman of Whitbread's Thresher off-licence chain
and the group's hotels, is to join Shepherd Neame, the independent Kent
brewer, as a non-executive director and board consultant.
He will advise the company, which has been expanding rapidly and now has 315
pubs in the south-east, on the development of its retail activities and
staff training.
Fraser, 52, a former chairman of the Brewers' Society retail committee, is
leaving Whitbread in March after eight years with the brewing and retailing
group. He said yesterday that he would be pursuing a range of other
activities.
He joined Whitbread in 1984 as managing director of Whitbread Inns after 15
years with Watneys where he became deputy managing director of the Chef &amp;
Brewer.
Before entering brewing, Fraser was in the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars for
nine years; he is on the board of the Bedfordshire Tec.

FT  21 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris feasts on food and drink
as bidders emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC matters were more important than international influences in
continental trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS continued to focus on the food industry where, for once, takeover
speculation became reality. The CAC 40 index rose 5.90 to 1,865.85 in
turnover of FFr2.2bn after Friday's FFr2.9bn.
Shares in the mineral water company Perrier and the holding company Exor
were suspended at Friday's close of FFr1,396 and FFr1,320 respectively as
Nestle and Suez made aFFr1,475-per-share bid for Perrier, fanning
speculation of a counterbid from the Agnelli family and its allies. News
that Nestle and Suez had taken legal action to review the recent sale of
Perrier's treasury stock to the Agnelli camp indicated that the shares would
remain suspended for quite a while.
Meanwhile, BSN jumped FFr14 to FFr1,154 with a heavy 312,600 shares traded
on continued rumours that the Agnellis would make a bid for the food giant.
Among other gainers, Lyonnaise-Dumez added FFr16 or 3.5 per cent to FFr474
with 147,782 shares traded as the market acknowledged that it had misread
last week's results. Paribas, which fell 7.3 per cent on Friday on news of
big provisions for Maxwell loans, recouped FFr14 or 4.2 per cent to FFr344
with 84,550 shares traded.
One of the day's prominent losers was Euro Disney which fell FFr6.20 or 4
per cent to traded after several UK newspapers said that the shares were
overvalued.
MADRID continued to descend, the general index closing 1.28 lower at 252.64.
Fecsa rose Pta2 to Pta704 after a placing of 3.055m shares, about 1 1/2 per
cent of the equity in the electrical utility. Schroder Securities took the
block out of Spain and placed it with institutions in London at a price of
Pta718 a share against Friday's Pta702.
Mr Miguel Olabarri of Schroder said the placing represented about four
weeks' volume in Fecsa, and that the premium was partly due to the
availability of stock, Fecsa's above-average cash generation in a highly
leveraged sector and its dividend prospects between now and 1994.
MILAN eased as operators took the view that the recent rally had been
overdone. The Comit index fell 1.86 to 546.25. Problems with the
screen-based trading system restricted volume to around L100bn from Friday's
L140bn.
One of the day's big losers was Sip which fell L38 or 2.5 per cent to L1,458
in heavy trading of 2.1m shares. Analysts said that they had expected
profit-taking to emerge after the stock reached L1,500 last week.
Furthermore, the industry reform approved by parliament, also last week, is
expected to take the edge off Sip's performance.
Talk of a large buy order in Generali out of London lifted the share off the
day's low of L30,200 to an official close of L30,460, up L95 from Friday.
The stock then hit L30,600 on the kerb.
Among industrials, Pirelli fell L58 or 4.5 per cent to L1,222 ahead of an
extraordinary meeting later in the day to approve the tyre and cable's group
L526bn capital increase.
FRANKFURT had a late rise on a fall in west German wholesale prices of 0.7
per cent in December from November, renewing hopes of an interest rate cut
later this year. The DAX index rose 6.18 to 1,677.17, after a 1.58 fall to
677.06 in the FAZ at midsession.
Volume fell from DM8.2bn to DM6.2bn. Siemens and Deutsche Bank led the
intraday rally, rising DM4.50 to DM656.10 and DM6.50 to DM704.70
respectively. Siemens gained on news of large telecommunications orders from
Syria, Iran and Kuwait.
AMSTERDAM was depressed by the weaker dollar but most stocks recovered from
their day's lows on foreign buying interest. The CBS Tendency Index closed
0.7 lower at 119.8.
The truck manufacturer DAF gained 50 cents or 2.1 per cent to Fl 24.40 on
hopes of a recovery in UK truck sales later this year.
BRUSSELS saw preferred shares in the chemical group Gechem jump BFr35 or
10.3 per cent to BFr375 in speculative trading as 88,000 shares changed
hands. The Bel-20 index closed up 5.31 at 1,161.81 in turnover of BFr751m.
STOCKHOLM put banks up 3.2 per cent and the forestry sector by 1.4 per cent
as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 7.0, or 0.7 per cent higher at
989.2.
SE-Banken rose SKr2 to SKr50. Dealers said that banks had simply been
laggards, but that forestry stocks reflected speculation that pulp and paper
prices are on the way up.
ISTANBUL fell 3.7 per cent after the unveiling of a government economic plan
on Saturday that dealers said was in line with expectations but would take
time to implement. The 75-share index fell 183.14 to 4,817.02.

FT  21 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Savage contrast between US and Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a savage contrast last week between the US and Japan.
Having consolidated its Christmas and new year gains, the Dow showed new
strength last week with three all-time highs in five days. US shares are not
popular with many analysts, who think they are priced on a corporate
earnings recovery which will not materialise to the extent that will be
needed in 1992.
Tokyo, for which there is analytical support, saw the Nikkei average at its
lowest since October 1990. It was the main reason why the World index, in
spite of strength in Europe, shows a rise of only 0.1 per cent in local
currency terms.
James Capel said in a recent global seminar that Japan will enjoy a sharp
consumer-led recovery starting in the second quarter of this year. Nomura
followed with a recommendation of the market last Friday. However, Tokyo
cannot seem to escape from a combination of technical weakness and political
scandal. Last week, a senior politician was arrested for alleged bribe
taking.
The encouraging aspect of this situation is the way that neighbouring equity
markets have mostly refused to reflect Tokyo's depression, with Hong Kong,
in particular, scoring a succession of record highs.
The best European performances came from Finland and Norway, which seem to
have decided that there is life after the slow death of 1991.
Finland has now accumulated a sizeable recovery since its Hex index low of
December 23, but Kleinwort Benson's Scandinavian team, which has recommended
Helsinki as a long-term buy, noted recently that the market has three weak
years to improve upon.
Norway, emotionally flattened by the collapse of its banking sector, has
recovered mostly on North Sea oil price prospects. In a report just out,
Goldman Sachs says the Norwegian economy is close to bottoming out, and will
benefit from an international recovery led by the US. It adds that cyclical
stocks will benefit from the global upturn.

SHARE prices plunged on selling by investment trusts and financial
institutions, and the Nikkei average closed below 21,000 for the first time
since October 1990, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished 407.55 down at 20,913.82 as arbitrage-related trading
and selling by investment trusts continued to dampen sentiment. The index
hit a high of 21,381.00, but later fell to the day's low of 20,684.74 in the
afternoon.
Volume eased to 220m shares from Friday's 240m. Declines overwhelmed
advances by 853 to 128, with 142 issues unchanged. An estimated 263 stocks
dropped to their lowest levels since the beginning of last year. The Topix
index of all first section issues lost 25.35 to 1,574.91, although in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended just 0.48 off at 1,205.50.
In spite of foreign buying, many market participants fear that the index
could fall below 20,000. Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg commented: 'There is
evidence of further selling by domestic investors.'
However, some said the market was oversold. 'The difference between the
levels of the 200-day moving average and the daily index movements are
overstretched,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. However, he added that
a recovery depended on participation by domestic institutions.
Fund managers at domestic life insurers said they were ready to buy shares
once the Nikkei dropped below 20,000. Arbitrageurs, on the other hand, were
seen stepping up selling as the gap between futures prices and the cash
market narrowed.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y3,000 to a record low of Y698,000.
Leading high-technology shares were also weak, with Mitsubishi Electric down
Y4 to Y558 and Toshiba losing Y12 to Y624.
Akai Electric dropped Y45 to Y660 on reports that the company had projected
a 70 per cent fall in profits for the current year to November.
Banks were seen actively cross-trading to realise profits ahead of the March
book closing. Shares in regional banks were actively traded, with Chiba Bank
down Y63 to Y987.
Some automobile makers were higher on hopes that the US Big Three auto
companies' plans to increase production in the first quarter would alleviate
the pressure from the US on Japanese car makers. Toyota Motor advanced Y20
to Y1,420 and Honda Motor gained Y10 to Y1,430.
In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 506.74 to 22,273.10, its lowest level
since January 1988, on small-lot selling and margin liquidations. A total of
109.4m shares changed hands.
Roundup
TOKYO'S SLIDE took some Pacific Rim markets off their day's highs yesterday.
HONG KONG achieved its fifth consecutive record peak on growing optimism
about the improvement in Sino-US trade relations. The Hang Seng index
climbed 55.58 to 4,510.47 as turnover swelled to HKDollars 2.44bn from
HKDollars 2.30bn, its largest daily volume in two months.
SEOUL was boosted by signs that the labour dispute at Hyundai Motor was
being resolved. Hyundai Motor ended at Won26,400, up Won900. The composite
index added 12.66 at 633.87 in turnover of Won397.7bn, after Won272bn on
Saturday.
SINGAPORE lost ground on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index
finished 7.12 off at 1,525.39 and turnover dipped to SDollars 177.3m from
SDollars 215.3m.
Parkway Holdings, a property company with hospital interests, closed 8 cents
lower at SDollars 1.57, after touching SDollars 1.52, in the day's most
active volume of 5.1m shares on rumours connecting it with a court action in
the US.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index ended 2.58 up at 572.23 on last-minute buying
of Telekom, which put on 20 cents to MDollars 10.30 on 612,000 shares
traded. Gaming issues fell further on reports of changes to the gaming tax.
Resorts World shed 35 cents to MDollars 9.85 and Genting 30 cents to
MDollars 11.70.
AUSTRALIA was pulled back by the Tokyo weakness. The All Ordinaries index
was finally 5.9 down at 1,667.6 after rising 9.7 initially. Turnover dipped
to ADollars 183m (ADollars 241m).
Speculation that Mr Kerry Packer was about to spin off his local magazine
interests or that the government might sell more shares in Commonwealth Bank
of Australia kept investors on the sidelines.
Pacific Dunlop receded 11 cents to ADollars 5.38 on rumours of more profits
downgradings.
NEW ZEALAND was quiet due to the bank holiday in Wellington. The NZSE-40
index relinquished 9.90 to 1,495.03 in turnover of NZDollars 13.9m, well
down from Friday's NZDollars 23.8m.
Telecom weakened 7 cents to NZDollars 2.38 on volume of 2.1m shares,
depressed by profits downgradings and expectations of a second issue of
shares this year.
TAIWAN rebounded from a fall on Saturday on expectations of a cut in
domestic oil prices. The weighted index rallied 138.42 or 2.8 per cent to
5,102.64, after the loss of 81.72 on Saturday. Volume grew to TDollars
53.36bn from TDollars 33.76bn.
BANGKOK saw turnover rise above Bt10bn for the second day in the stock
market's 16-year history. The SET index ended 8.99 ahead at 779.82 on a
turnover of Bt10.14bn.
MANILA's composite index eased 0.30 to 1,303.00 in turnover of 140m pesos,
after 172m.
KARACHI fell again, the KSE 100 index losing 48 to 1,587 for a two-day drop
of 5 per cent, on unrest in southern Pakistan, including demonstrations and
bomb blasts, following the arrest of a secessionist politician last
Saturday.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet uranium sales target
'impossible'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URANIUM MARKET analysts yesterday said it was impossible for the former
Soviet Union's Atomic Energy Ministry to make good its objective of boosting
uranium exports this year from Dollars 500m to Dollars 1.5bn.
'They haven't a cat's chance in hell of doing that,' said Mr Phillip
Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation and chairman of the Uranium
Institute's committee studying supply and demand.
Other analysts pointed out that the west's requirement for uranium was 120m
to 130m lbs a year. Exports from the former Soviet Union had already sent
prices to 40-year lows. At present prices the ministry's target implied that
it aimed to sell more than 150m lbs of uranium oxide in the west in 1992.
Even if some of the material was highly-enriched uranium, commanding a
higher price because it required no further processing before use by power
stations, the target was unreachable.
Analysts said the ministry, which is still operating despite the break-up of
the Soviet Union, was 'sabre rattling' to retaliate against allegations in
the US and Europe that it was dumping uranium in those markets.
One suggested: 'This is shock therapy aimed at the US producers to
underscore the fact that the former Soviet Union is serious about selling
fuel to the west and won't be blocked by any anti-dumping case in the
States'.
The former Soviet Union had about 400m lbs of uranium in strategic stocks,
according to a paper presented by Nuexco, the US nuclear market consultancy
organisation, last year. Of the total, only about 40m lbs was of commercial
quality and available for sale. About 240m lbs was highly-enriched uranium
and the rest was held by domestic power plants.
Uranium has only one application - for nuclear energy. It is mined it four
Soviet republics: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Mr Albert
Shishkin, head of the Atomic Energy Ministry's export division, pointed out
last week that the republics accounted for 45 per cent of the world's known
uranium reserves and 25 to 30 per cent of the mining, processing and
enriching capacity. Yet they accounted for only 6 per cent of uranium world
production.
He issued a thinly-veiled threat that anti-trust action by the US and Europe
might drive the ministry to seek other markets 'where it is much harder to
carry out full control over the distribution of radioactive products'.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers seek stronger rubber
pact
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Natural Rubber Organisation convenes for a two-day special
council session in Kuala Lumpur today faced with producer demands for a more
effective defence of prices.
Producer members meeting last week in Hatyai, south Thailand, agreed a
common strategy aimed at preventing rubber prices falling below the
International Rubber Agreement's lower intervention, or 'must buy' level of
166 Malaysia/Singapore cents a lb.
Since the last Inro meeting, in October, producer members, led by Malaysia,
have been urging on consumer members the need for reform of the agreement to
enable it to keep prices within the agreed range through the operation of
its buffer stock system. But they have met with stiff resistance from
consumer members, especially the US. Some argue that market realities demand
lower support bands.
The present agreement, Inra II, has less than two years to run, and
producers are anxious for serious negotiations to begin on its successor,
especially in view of the recent slide in prices and what they see as an
inadequate response from the buffer stock manager. The buffer stock now
stands at about 100,000 tonnes, less than a fifth of the maximum level.
Late last year Inro's Kuala Lumpur-based secretariat promised that the
organisation would enter the market in a 'pretty aggressive' fashion after
the new year holidays. But a dip below the 'must buy' level earlier this
month resulted in only modest buffer stock purchases before prices bounced
by a couple of cents - to the surprise of some traders.
The agenda for this week's council meeting includes a review of the options
available to cope with the market's realities: for example by revising its
support prices - whether upwards or downwards would depend as much on
politics and the availability of financial backing as on the secretariat's
recommendations.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis reap bumper wheat
subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Mark Nicholson in Riyadh
SAUDI ARABIA'S wheat farmers will receive SR7.9bn (Dollars 2.1bn) in payment
for the 1991 harvest, which reached a record 4m tonnes, under the kingdom's
heavily subsidised agriculture programme.
King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, issued the directive last week for the payments,
which amount to farmers receiving up to Dollars 500 a tonne for their wheat,
a massive subsidy over world prices of just over Dollars 100 a tonne.
The subsidy programme was introduced during the early years of Saudi
Arabia's oil boom in the 1970s, and was designed to ensure the kingdom's
self-sufficiency. The programme was also intended to provide employment in
rural areas to the north-west of Riyadh, where there was no direct economic
spin-off from the growing earnings country's oil industry.
However, this year's bumper harvest has swollen the kingdom's already large
surplus of wheat. Saudi Arabia's grain stores, which have a capacity of 1.4m
tonnes, are already full, after 1990's 3.6m tonnes' harvest. Domestic
consumption is about 1m tonnes.
The kingdom, which has taken sixth place in the world's wheat export league
since its 152,000 farms responded to government incentives to cultivate
wheat, is expected to sell much of its surplus on international markets at
world prices. Diplomats say they also expect a large amount to be offered in
aid to poorer Moslem countries, and suggest that some may be sent to the
newly independent central Asian states of the former Soviet Union.
The kingdom became self-sufficient in wheat in 1984, following the generous
subsidy programme. However, the recent surpluses have led the government to
encourage farmers to switch to the production of barley, by insisting that
farmers gain licences to produce wheat. Saudi Arabia produces 400,000 tonnes
of barley every year, but needs to import up to 5m tonnes to feed sheep and
camel herds.
Wheat production still remains more attractive, however, to most farmers,
who cultivate the crop on huge pivot-irrigated circles in the desert. Some
critics of the programme argue that this is leading to a dangerous depletion
of Saudi Arabia's scarce water resources. Agriculture accounts for about 90
per cent of Saudi water consumption.

<TEXT>
NORWAY HAS overtaken Britain as Europe's biggest offshore producer of crude
oil and natural gas liquids, according to a report issued by Edinburgh-based
brokerage house County NatWest WoodMac, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Last year Norway's crude oil and gas liquids production climbed to a record
1.94m barrels a day, a 13 per cent rise over 1990's daily average production
of 1.72m barrels and confirming an earlier forecast by County.
According to the report, North Sea offshore oil/gas liquids production rose
4 per cent in 1991 to a record 3.89m barrels a day and average total North
Sea gas production reached a record 9.98bn cu ft a day. Norway's aggregate
level of oil/NGL and gas production advanced 12 per cent in 1991 to 876m
barrels of oil equivalent.
Exploration activity off the coast of Norway increased by 34 per cent, with
a total of 43 exploration and appraisal wells drilled. Nine discoveries were
made out of 28 exploration wells drilled, giving a success rate of 32 per
cent.
Some 23m barrels of oil equivalent per exploration well was discovered, on a
par with 1990's result, County's report said, adding: '1991 can be
considered to have been a reasonably successful year for exploration on the
Norwegian shelf with substantial new reserves of both oil and gas being
found.' The report concluded that discoveries and reserves' upgrades led to
a total increase in Norway's reserve base of about 920m barrels of oil
equivalent, closely matching aggregate production in 1991.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmer's Viewpoint: UK lamb
producers have to gird up their loins - Export demand is propping up prices
although the EC support system has been given the chop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAINDROPS were as big and cold as I ever remember. The sleet mixed with
them was travelling horizontally in the strong wind and the abominable
mixture invaded my eyes, my ears and the tiny gap between my coat and my
neck. At times it was even difficult to breathe.
As I continued setting the new fold (that is putting up electric fences on
fresh ground) for the 500 or so hungry lambs grazing turnips sown into
stubble last summer after cereals had been harvested, I cursed the day I had
agreed to allow my son, who usually looks after the sheep, to go skiing.
By the time I had finished the job I was soaked to the skin and very
uncomfortable. I had not taken waterproof leggings because it had been fine
when I set out. My corduroy trousers had therefore quickly become saturated
and acting as a wick had carried moisture upwards into my underpants and the
tail of my shirt. Gravity had meanwhile allowed a fair quantity of water
down into my Wellingtons so that I was squelching around with about half an
inch of cold water in my boots.
This all took place just a few days after the end of last year when the
European Community had finally removed the variable premium for lamb that
had provided a valuable safety net for sheep farmers since it had been
introduced in 1980. While it operated it made up the average ex-farm price
of eligible UK lambs of good quality to preset guide levels calculated each
week.
As I battled with the elements on that exposed field not knowing whether the
lambs I was trying to feed would make economic prices in the open
unsupported market, I seriously began to wonder if sheep farming would in
the future be worth all the trouble - and discomfort.
Last Saturday however the trade at Norwich livestock market made me pause
and think again. Lambs being auctioned on a per head basis and ungraded were
making almost as much as they would have grossed a few weeks ago with the
market price and the variable premium combined. The same has been true
across most of the auction markets in the country since the premium was
abolished.
There are, however, a number of reasons for this brisk trade, not least the
ending of the premium itself. The fact is that, because of the uncertainty
about what would happen when it finally disappeared, farmers who had lambs
that were anywhere near ready for slaughter by the end of last year fed them
extra rations to make them grow faster and ensure they would make the grade
and qualify for a premium payment while the scheme lasted.
This meant that the number of lambs offered for sale during the last week of
the scheme were up on normal. The Meat and Livestock Commission estimates
that the markets from which it collects data (probably accounting for about
60 per cent of all lambs sold at auction) handled 280,000 lambs during the
week ending January 3, the last week of the variable premium scheme, and
that the same markets sold only 46,000 the following week.
Further, the MLC estimates that about 15 per cent more lambs were sold
during the last few months of 1991 than in the same period the previous
year. Given that the number produced in both years was similar, this must
mean that there are many fewer to come to market by the end of the lamb
marketing year in a couple of months' time.
So there is now a shortage, and this is being exaggerated by a lively export
trade to France and beyond. Moreover, the 'clawback', the amount previously
reclaimed from exporters on all lambs sent abroad and which was equal to the
variable premium (which was unique to the UK and intended only to support
domestic trade while not distorting foreign markets) has also been
abolished.
For lambs intended for the export trade therefore the effect of the changes
has been to cancel out all artificial barriers to trade and enable the
animals concerned to be sold at their true market value. That is the reason
why the market has risen to cover virtually all of the lost premium.
But the good news for sheep farmers does not stop there. Coincidental with
all this activity in the EC's domestic markets supplies of all meats,
including lamb and mutton, from Poland and Hungary, which have been
overhanging and depressing EC markets since those countries were given
access to them, have suddenly dried up.
Much of this mainly low quality meat has been bought to satisfy Europe's
growing appetite for curries, kebabs and the like. But now the former
Eastern bloc countries seem to want to retain more food at home and the meat
traders of Europe are having to look elsewhere.
They have turned in part to British cull ewes, that is old ewes that have
lost their teeth and cannot forage efficiently or have been judged unfit for
further breeding. In recent weeks the value of such animals has almost
doubled.
To the sheep farmer it means that he can, for the moment anyway, dispose of
his spent stock at prices not far short of those he might have made for
young replacement ewes last autumn, when the market for such replacements
was depressed by the uncertainty surrounding the end of the variable
premium.
The one thing that may stop wholesale culling, which would reduce the
national flock significantly and do all us sheep farmers a favour, is the
need to keep the declared number of ewes on each holding until at least
March 9 in order to qualify for the increased headage payment of Pounds 15,
which is now the only government aid available to lowland sheep farmers.
Indeed come the long-promised reform of the EC's common agricultural policy
this will probably be the shape of the future for most farm commodities;
payments for simply being on the land and keeping it tidy and grazed, with
strict limits soon to be imposed on the number of animals or acres each
farmer can claim for, and the rest from the market.
Frankly it is not a system for which I have an instinctive liking. But all
in all the sheep version has got off to a reasonable start and flock owners
will not be too unhappy if it continues as it has begun.
The danger is of course that exports, on which the buoyant trade is
currently based, may not last at present levels. Then sheep farmers will
have to rely much more on domestic demand. This has held up well in recent
years in spite of competition from frozen New Zealand supplies retailed at
prices much lower than those for fresh English lamb. It is well known,
however, that this market premium for fresh English lamb is a fragile
flower. If the abattoir trade pushes it just a touch too far retailers will,
without compunction, switch to New Zealand supplies. That and another
experience like the one on the turnip field, may still make me reconsider
whether we really need the sheep enterprise on our farm.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Production cuts steady oil
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES edged up slightly yesterday as two more producers from the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced symbolic cuts in
output.
North Sea Brent crude for March delivery was 10 cents higher at Dollars
18.10 a barrel as Algeria and Iran said they would cut production. Algeria
will trim 20,000 barrels a day (b/d) from its output of 800,000 b/d and Iran
will cut 50,000 b/d from its production of 3.5m b/d in a bid to bolster
prices.
The moves follow cutbacks announced last week by Venezuela, Libya and
Nigeria, which between them cut 130,000 b/d. But the organisation's largest
producer, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to cut its own production in advance of
Opec's next meeting on February 12.
The small production cuts are unlikely to have a major effect on oil prices,
but have so far managed to stop them sliding. Dubai prices for March
delivery are still Dollars 6 a barrel below the Opec target price of Dollars
21 a barrel.
Nevertheless, the voluntary production cuts signal to the market that Opec
producers are ready to co-operate over more substantial cutbacks in February
rather than become embroiled in a row. Saudi Arabia has consistently
maintained that it will bear its part of output cuts as long as other
countries share the burden.

backed

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ODDS IN favour of the London Metal Exchange's proposed secondary (scrap)
aluminium contract have improved considerably after a special LME committee,
set up 16 months ago to consider the idea, recommended that the new contract
be introduced.
But the LME directors are procrastinating about the controversial project
and have neither rejected nor supported this recommendation.
Instead, members of the exchange have been given one more month to comment
on detailed proposals that have been circulated.
The type of secondary aluminium the LME has in mind for its contract is
mainly used in components for the motor industry. This use accounts for 70
to 80 per cent of the market, which totals about 4m tonnes a year.
The LME has told members it would not authorise any warehouse to hold the
secondary metal unless the warehouse temperature and humidity were
controlled. This is because secondary aluminium ingot oxidises and
deteriorates over time.
At present none of the LME authorised warehouses around the world provides
such controls. However, the exchange says many of them do have
temperature-controlled sheds.
Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, said yesterday that it
was likely that the members' comments would be considered at the exchange's
March board meeting. He said it would take at least six months from the
go-ahead being given for trading to start.

Gold closed more than Dollars 2 ahead in active trading in London after
European buying spilled over on to New York's Comex, pushing the metal
through key resistance at Dollars 358 a troy ounce. Gold peaked in early
afternoon business in New York at just below Dollars 361 as traders engaged
in active gold-silver ratio trading before producer selling capped gold's
rise. Silver recovered from a fall to 419 cents a troy ounce to close in
London just 2 cents down at 428, underpinned by US fund buying. On the LME
three-month nickel hit 3 1/2 -month highs before retreating on
profit-taking. Cash metal closed lower, but three-month metal ended higher,
supported by underlying investment fund buying interest. 'The market has
become overbought, but the charts still look good ..and there is concern
over Russian nickel,' one dealer said. Fears that Russian nickel plants
could be closed on either economic or environmental grounds might be
overdone, as the republics in the old Soviet Union need foreign exchange.
Aluminium prices moved sharply higher before profit taking and hedge selling
curbed the gains. Market talk of possible delays to Russian shipments
because of increased export tax bureaucracy aided the tone.

THE NET asset value of investment trust funds in Japan fell 9.8 per cent
last year, as the continuing weakness of the Tokyo stock market drove down
the asset value of equity investment trusts and slowed the flow of fresh
funds.
The Investment Trusts' Association reported net assets were down Y4,520.1bn
(Dollars 35.4bn) to Y41,473.8bn, with the net assets of stock funds down to
Y28,562.4bn from Y35,077.2bn at the end of 1990, and the value of new stock
funds launched down 45.3 per cent to Y8,640bn, which is the lowest level in
six years.
A sign of investor concern about the health of the stock market was a 2.4
times increase in stock fund redemptions. Japanese fund managers, worried by
the trend, have recently won approval from the Ministry of Finance to extend
the life of trust funds due for redemption.
At the end of November, about 49 per cent of the asset value of what are
officially called stock investment trusts in Japan was accounted for by
stocks, with around 32 per cent in call loans, and about 17 per cent in
bonds.
While the net asset value of these funds fell over the past year, the share
accounted for by stocks had risen from 44 per cent at the start of 1991.
The Investment Trusts' Association said yesterday that the enduring weakness
of the stock market had taught investors that they cannot take healthy
returns for granted.

issue

<TEXT>
GENCOR, South Africa's second largest mining house, yesterday confirmed its
intention to go ahead with a R2bn rights issue. Gencor's parent company,
Genbeheer, will be raising R1.1bn in order to follow its rights in the
Gencor offer.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's newly-appointed chairman, said yesterday: 'Our
major group companies are adequately funded for the present, but we found in
the past that having funds available at the centre when we needed them put
us in a powerful bargaining position. It is well known the group is
currently either engaged in or examining a number of large projects.'
These include the Columbus stainless steel project, the Alusaf expansion,
the development of the Oryx gold mine, and Phase 2 of the Genref refinery
expansion by energy arm, Engen.
Gencor's last rights issue was in July 1989, when the group raised R1.5bn.
This left the group cash rich at a time of high interest rates.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: South Africa in Ecu250m
landmark offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA's return to world capital markets yesterday received
considerable impetus with the announcement that the government was raising
Ecu250m (R890m).
The issue is the first by South Africa in the Ecu market since 1984, and
follows the country's re-entry last September into world capital markets
with a DM400m issue, after an absence of six years. The issue, which was
mostly pre-placed, is 'new money', unlike the D-Mark issue, half of which
was used to refinance a maturing issue.
The issue underlines the change in attitudes towards South Africa since the
dark days of mid-1985, when the refusal of foreign banks to roll over the
country's loans forced South Africa to declare a standstill on debt
repayment.
Since then, Pretoria has maintained what Mr Gerhard Croeser,
director-general of the department of finance, yesterday called a
'meticulous' record in meeting debt commitments and complying with the
conditions of the three Interim Debt Arrangements, to which South Africa's
foreign debt has been subjected since the 1985 standstill.
The South African authorities believe the launch also showed that
international investors felt the country's political and economic prospects
had been enhanced by the formation in December of the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for the country's constitutional
negotiations.
The funds, Mr Croeser said, would contribute towards the financing of the
national budget, play an important role in strengthening the country's
reserves, and promote economic stability and the further normalisation of
South Africa's relations with its foreign creditors.
Strengthening the country's foreign reserves is particularly important as it
will allow the Reserve Bank (central bank) to pursue a less restrictive
monetary policy, and enhance economic growth. In recent years, South
Africa's ability to finance economic growth has been constrained by the need
to export savings to finance debt repayments. The country exported about
R30bn of capital in this way between 1986 and 1990.
In international terms, South Africa is an under-borrowed country. Total
external debt at December 1990 totalled USDollars 19.3bn, equivalent to 70.2
per cent of annual export earnings. The interest service ratio is 7.1 per
cent. South Africa's total foreign debt was Dollars 23.7bn at the end of
August 1985, when the standstill on international borrowing was declared.
The Ecu issue, for maturity in 1997, has a coupon of 10.375 per cent. The
Department of Finance said this was a premium of about 1.77 basis points
over the average for three benchmark Ecu issues, of similar maturity, by
Spain, Norway and Belgium.
The premium is partly a function of political risk, the debt standstill, and
the fact that having been out of the market for so long, South Africa lacks
liquid issues, and it is liquidity which brings marketability and a lower
price.
Last week Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said the country
would push for a final debt arrangement to deal with the outstanding Dollars
5bn when the third interim arrangement ended in 1993. He said a further
arrangement was necessary because South Africa could not afford to repay the
whole amount in 1993.
The removal of the debt standstill, and South Africa's readmission to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), are the biggest remaining obstacles to
the normalisation of South Africa's relations with the international
financial community.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Merger plan lifts London
futures market activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE green light given to the merger of the London International Financial
Futures Exchange and the London Traded Options Market last week has
increased activity in individual UK stock options on LTOM.
Average daily volume in LTOM's 67 stock options in the last quarter of 1991
was just 17,000 contracts a day, (although the FT-SE 100 index option has
remained quite active). Last Monday, volume was just 13,000.
On Wednesday, when Liffe announced it had found enough market-makers in the
product for the merger with LTOM to proceed, volume rose to 39,000. On
Thursday, 35,000 contracts were traded, and on Friday close to 30,000. Open
interest, which reflects the positions held in the market, rose from 511,000
when the market opened on Wednesday to 547,000 at Friday's close.
However, volume slipped back somewhat yesterday to 20,000 contracts.
Mr Bruce Froud, head of derivatives at Kleinwort Benson, reported 'positive
feedback from our institutional clients, now that the uncertainty is out of
the way.'
Some institutions had been reluctant to take positions in the market, while
its future was not secure, creating some pent-up demand.
The increase in volume reflected greater commitment by market-making firms,
which have themselves been nervous about taking positions, dealers said.
'There does appear to be a gathering confidence now that the merger issue
has been resolved,' said Mr Tony de Guingand, chief executive of LTOM.
While the stock market was reasonably active last week, dealers said the
rise in volume was not market-driven. Only one stock option - Asda  - was
traded in very high volume, because the company's results were published
last week. Otherwise, the increase in trading was across the board.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Midland Bank considers
mortgage securitisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK is considering securitising part of its Pounds 4.5m mortgage
book. It has sent letters to some of its 150,000 mortgage customers to ask
whether they would object to having their mortgages securitised.
The bank said letters had been sent out, but it declined to give the numbers
of customers approached, beyond saying that less than 10 per cent were
involved.
The bank said it was testing the water and that it had no commitment to do
anything at this stage.
Although Barclays and TSB have carried out experimental securitisation
operations, so far none of the clearing banks has carried out a large-scale
securitisation operation of the sort common in the US.
Securitisation - taking a group of high quality mortgages and selling them
as a bond on the financial markets - is attractive to financial institutions
because it enables them to reduce the amount of lending on their balance
sheet and so strengthen their capital ratios. In the UK, about Pounds 10bn
of mortgages have been securitised by the centralised lenders.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Bonds: EC paper 'disappointingly small'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO offerings in Ecu dominated the primary Eurobond market yesterday,
although many traders' minds were still focused on the worsening state of
the dollar sector.
South Africa launched its expected Ecu bond issue, an Ecu250m five-year deal
via Paribas. The deal, priced at an attractive spread to compensate for
credit risk, appealed to continental retail investors, particularly in
Germany. South Africa returned to the international capital markets last
year, with a successful offer ing in the D-Mark sector.
The European Community launched an Ecu190m seven-year deal via Warburg. The
pricing of the deal was considered to be on the aggressive side, but strong
demand for five-to-seven year Ecu paper, and appetite for the EC name,
ensured reasonable demand. Dealers said the offering, like many EC deals
which are onlent, was disappointingly small.
In the Australian dollar sector, Swedish Export Credit launched a ADollars
300m three-year deal via Hambros Bank. The deal is the third in the sector
to be structured as a global offering.
In the dollar sector, Eurobond yield spreads remain wide, with corporate
bonds generally under-performing sovereign and supranational paper. For
example, ABB's four-year deal is now trading at a yield spread of 65 basis
points above the Treasury yield curve, against 50 basis points at launch
last week.
The World Bank's 10-year global bond offering has also lost some ground. The
deal is currently quoted at 9 basis points above the 10-year Treasury,
compared with, at best, three basis points last week. However, the deal is
still trading six basis points tighter than its launch spread.
The Bank of Scotland has raised Dollars 230m of subordinated debt in the US
market, through the SEC's rule 144A.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Japanese issues slide on exchange
intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERVENTION in the foreign exchange markets on Friday to push up the yen in
favour of the US dollar duly showed through in the Japanese government bond
market yesterday.
The short upward swing in bond yields, which had accompanied the weakening
yen as the week progressed, turned down smartly again. From Friday's close
of 5.345 per cent, the yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.30 per cent
and turned immediately lower, touching 5.27 per cent before rebounding.
The domestic front also provided more ammunition to keep bond market
afficionados happy.
The Nikkei index of leading Japanese stocks turned down sharply, to reach
its lowest since the autumn of 1990.
The closer to 20,000 the Nikkei gets, the greater the threat to the capital
adequacy of Japanese banks, and the more the market expects an interest rate
easing to be brought forward before the financial year-end at the end of
March.
Mr Kiichi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, whose comments on Friday
signalled official confirmation the downturn in the economy was
intensifying, further added to the mood with comments that recent wholesale
prices had stabilised. As a further indication of the economic slowdown,
bankruptcies in December were more than double those of December 1990.
WEAK industrial production data helped to push the French government bond
market ahead yesterday, in what was a quiet day for bond markets generally.
Production figures for last November showed a 0.6 per cent decline. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond declined from 8.41 per cent
to 8.36 per cent.
The German government market firmed slightly, also in quiet trading. The
market is focused on talks due today over the steelworkers' pay claim:
failure to resolve the issue could lead to a vote for a strike in a ballot
on Sunday, while a successful conclusion could give the government bond
rally a new lease of life.
Details were also announced of a four-year bund auction this Friday.
Observers said demand for such medium-term paper had been high recently.
A firmer pound gave greater confidence to the UK gilts market yesterday. In
a quiet day, with only 12,000 futures contracts traded, the Liffe March
contract firms from 97.17 to 97.23.
Weak retails sales in December added to the mood of political uncertainty
around the market. Provisional figures for the month showed a 1 per cent
decline - but a change in the basis of calculation exaggerated this decline.
Rather than helping the bond market, the news was taken as a sign of the
forthcoming electoral difficulties of the Conservative party.
The market was quiet ahead of today's announcement of details of the next
gilt auction.
US markets were closed for a public holiday.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Brazil's sell-off gathers pace
as field widens - The country's programme of two-a-month privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE heads of Brazil's big state enterprises appear at last to be developing
a taste for privatisation. The announcement last week that Embraer, the
state aerospace company, would be privatised this year prompted a complaint
from the president of Acominas, a state steel mill, that it would delay the
sale of his company.
Such a pro-privatisation attitude from within Brazil's enormous state
machine shows how much feelings have changed since the programme's
inauspicious beginning in September. It then faced a barrage of legal
objections and violent protests attempting to block the sale of Usiminas,
the continent's largest steel mill.
The fact that Usiminas finally went under the hammer in late October is a
tribute to the perseverance of Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the National
Development Bank (BNDES), who is co-ordinating the programme. Three months
and 30 lawsuits on, he can now relax, having just completed his sixth
sell-off and the first without any legal controversy.
'Privatisation has caught on,' he says. 'Had we not started with Usiminas,
we'd still be having legal questions. As it was, we had to deal with them
all in one go.'
So confident is Mr Modiano of Brazil's new acceptance of privatisation, the
government is issuing weekly decrees expanding the programme.
Already 22 sales are scheduled for this year, including Embraer and Lloyd
Brasileiro, the state aerospace and shipping companies, and Mr Modiano is
working on the inclusion of ports and railway concessions. He has even dared
mention the sale of Petrobras, one of the last bastions of nationalism.
Although each of the companies sold so far has raised above the minimum
price, financial targets have been radically reduced.
Instead of the Dollars 18bn Mr Modiano was originally aiming at by the end
of 1992, he hopes to raise Dollars 3.4bn this year to add to last year's
Dollars 1.7bn.
Even these figures are misleading as most purchasers are using government
debt, swapped at par, even though creditors had long since thought it would
never be honoured.
The main problem is the almost complete lack of foreign interest, frightened
off by the fiasco surrounding Usiminas. Mr Modiano says: 'The only solution
is doing what we're doing - going ahead no matter what and eliminating
disincentives to foreign capital.'
Thus, though the limit on foreign capital remains at 40 per cent and the
discount rate for external debt conversion at 25 per cent, shares no longer
have to be held for two years and the money no longer has to stay in the
country 12 years. The participation of Brazilian state pension funds in the
auctions, which had led to fears of continuing state control, has been
limited to 25 per cent.
Although Mr Modiano admits Brazil's continuing economic volatility remains a
deterrent, he believes one problem was that his first sales were in the
steel sector which holds little attraction.
He points out that the announcement of the sale of Embraer has already led
to overseas enquiries.
Once petrochemical companies go on sale in March, Mr Modiano says 'the tide
will turn'. He achieved an important victory with the presidential decree
forcing Petroquisa, the petrochemical arm of Petrobras, to sell all but 15
per cent of its share in each of the sector's companies.
Petrobras directors had been lobbying hard to retain 33 per cent which, says
Mr Modiano, shows, 'the interests of Petrobras are no longer necessarily the
interests of the sector'.
Although Mr Modiano would obviously relish the sale of Petrobras (requiring
a constitutional revision), he says: 'I don't want to jeopardise the sale of
the manufacturing sector by dwelling too much on this.'
Benefits of privatisation are already obvious. Freed from state control and
able to compete more aggressively, Usiminas has increased market share,
which explains the sudden interest in privatisation from the president of
Acominas.
Mr Modiano admits that in some cases the eagerness is because state
companies, many of which are loss-making, think they will get cash
injections. But he warns: 'We will put no money in - we will not repeat 1987
when BNDES put Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn in the steel sector to prepare for
privatisation and it just disappeared'. His team is hard at work, however,
restructuring debt.
The old state mentality is not yet dead. The Air Ministry wants the
government to retain a golden share when it sells Embraer to ensure that
supply to the Brazilian air force is not affected.
Mr Modiano says 'if I do that, everyone will want one believing it is their
last link to Treasury coffers'.
He points out that when Celma, an aircraft-maintenance company was sold, the
ministry had a list of 10 items they considered strategic, which he reduced
to one. 'In the case of Embraer, they will probably have three pages of
things, but they will get only limited and temporary protection.'
For the privatisation of ports, Mr Modiano has found an unusual ally in the
form of state governments. Brazilian ports are still governed by 1937
legislation which protects labour and results in costs which are among the
highest worldwide.
'We first need to modernise the legislation or no one will buy,' he says.
He also hopes to take advantage of a constitutional revision due next year
to lobby for the privatisation of Telebras, the telecommunications company,
which, he says, urgently needs new investment and 'could raise more than the
entire manufacturing sector'. In the meantime, with an average of two
sell-offs a month, he has plenty to occupy him.

computers
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COMPUTER sales revenues declined last year for the first time,
according to a market research study of the industry.
Sales revenues in the personal computer, minicomputer and mainframe segments
of the market dropped sharply, while workstation and supercomputer sales
grew.
Dataquest of the US revealed that total computer revenues were down 7.8 per
cent in 1991, compared with the previous year.
'The computer systems industry ran into two very high hurdles in 1991: the
negative state of the worldwide economy and the mammoth organisational
structures many vendors were supporting,' said Ms Nancy Stewart, senior
industry analyst.
The industry's largest companies, such as International Business Machines,
Digital Equipment and Unisys, are restructuring their operations to cut
costs. 'In the face of this maturing market, we can expect to see further
cost-cutting measures and restructuring from vendors in 1992,' said Ms
Stewart.
Total industry revenues, measured in terms of factory revenues (the prices
charged by manufacturers before third party distributors add their margins),
were Dollars 109.7bn in 1991, down from Dollars 119bn.
Sales of personal computers were down more than 8 per cent, from Dollars
49.9bn in 1990 to Dollars 45.7bn last year. IBM lost market share, while
Apple Computer, NEC, Compaq Computer and Olivetti gained market share.
Mainframe computer revenues fell to Dollars 26.9bn from Dollars 30.6bn in
1990. Sales of midrange computers, including minicomputers also declined,
from Dollars 29bn in 1990 to Dollars 26.5bn last year. There was, however,
growth in the workstation segment, albeit at a much lower rate than in
previous years. Revenues for 1991 were Dollars 8.8bn, up from Dollars 7.6bn
the previous year.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Rand's Barnbrook mine likely to
be closed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SATISFACTORY performances during the December quarter by the four operating
gold mines in the Rand Mines group were spoilt by the announcement that the
fledgling Barbrook mine will almost certainly have to be closed.
Barbrook's directors said in a statement yesterday that there was no point
in continuing the care-and-maintenance programme which had been in effect
since the mine ceased operating at the end of 1990. The mine only came into
operation in 1987 and had been expected to have a life of about 50 years.
The directors said that, given a lower grade of ore than expected and a
higher cost structure, the mine would not be re-opened. Care-and-maintenance
was futile in the absence of an offer for the mine or its assets from a
third party.
Rand Mines, Barbrook's controlling shareholder, has said that, failing any
such offer before the end of January, it would have to consider applying for
the winding-up of the company.
For the Rand Mines gold producers as a whole, net profits fell by nearly 7
per cent to R25m (Dollars 8.9m) after a 44 per cent rise in the tax bill.
Operating profits were marginally ahead following a reduction of costs and
an improvement in productivity.
With an average underground cost of production of R31,596 per kg, compared
with the prevailing gold price of about R32,000 per kg, the group's gold
operations remain highly marginal. Profits remain dependent on forward
selling, which helped secure an average gold price during the quarter of
R33,591 per kg.
The bulk of profits came from Harmony, the group's largest mine, which
produced an after-tax profit of R18.3m, down from R19.9 in the previous
quarter.
Although Durban Deep managed to lift gold production and reduce costs, a
lower gold price and tax payments saw profits drop to R3.5m from R5.1m.
Profit at Blyvooruitzicht dropped to R5.1m from R7.6m, while ERPM made a
R1.9m loss, a considerable improve-ment over the previous quarter's R5.7m
loss. The mine remains heavily burdened by large borrowings, with a R9.3m
operating profit wiped out by a R13.4m interest payment.

BOWATER, a leading US manufacturer of newsprint, yesterday reported a sharp
drop in fourth-quarter net income because of the US economic downturn, but
said it saw some encouraging signs for the second half of 1992.
Net income in the period fell to Dollars 1.6m, or 2 cents a share, from
Dollars 18.3m, or 48 cents, on sales down to Dollars 326m from Dollars 353m.
Full-year income totalled Dollars 45.6m, down from Dollars 78.4m in 1990.
Mr Anthony Gammie, chairman, said the most important factors behind this
were falling prices for all major product lines over the past few quarters
and stoppages in the final period to control newsprint inventories.
He added there was as yet no apparent pick-up in the economy of the kind
needed to improve newspaper advertising demand and thus newsprint prices.
However, he said encouraging signs included an apparent end to the decline
in newsprint consumption and major capacity closings by the Canadian
industry.

MINORITY shareholders in Shun Tak Holdings, the Hong Kong listed vehicle of
Mr Stanley Ho, the Macau gambling magnate, yesterday approved the purchase
of a 5 per cent stake in Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes de Macau (STDM),
the holding company for Mr Ho's gambling interest in the Portuguese colony.
Shun Tak will pay HKDollars 233m (USDollars 30m) for the STDM stake, giving
investors their first opportunity to buy into what is regarded as one of the
world's most profitable casino operations.
Shun Tak's share price eased 2.5 HK cents yesterday to close at HKDollars
4.80.
Shun Tak, a diversified company, runs a jetfoil service between Hong Kong
and Macau, and has interest in restaurants, hotels, aviation and property.
In 1991, it made a profit after tax of Dollars HK171m.
The addition to its portfolio of an interest in STDM could well be the jewel
in its crown. Mr Ho, together with other Hong Kong investors, has held a
monopoly on gambling in Macau since 1962; in 1986, STDM's monopoly was
extended until 2001.
STDM is a private Macau company and does not have to publish accounts. But
in documents presented to minority shareholders by Wardley Corporate
Finance, STDM said it had shareholders' funds of HKDollars 7.77bn at
end-1991 and had paid dividends to shareholders over the three years 1988 to
1990 of Dollars HK210m, Dollars HK300m, and Dollars HK420m.

<TEXT>
THE NEW York Insurance Department is due to set out its plans for Executive
Life of New York later today. Speculation that Metropolitan Life will
acquire a sizeable block of the life insurer's business is already rife.
MetLife, the nation's second largest insurance group, declined to comment
ahead of the insurance regulator's formal announcement.
Shortly after the insurer was seized by the NY Insurance Department in
April, a group of insurance companies, headed by MetLife, stepped forward to
help manage the business and advise the department. At that stage, however,
no formal offer to buy the operation was made.
ELNY was the smaller of two operating units within the Los Angeles-based
First Executive group. The larger unit, Executive Life of California, was
also seized by regulators after its heavy junk bond exposure prompted a
policyholder run. It has since been 'rescued' by a French consortium.
ELNY, which has around 103,000 policyholders and certificate-holders, was
always thought to be in better shape, and at the outset the insurance
department's stated aim was to rehabilitate the business.

<TEXT>
WEST INDIES Shipping Corporation (Wisco) has suspended operations after the
seizure of two of its vessels for unpaid bills.
The line, owned by the governments of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), was
being prepared for privatisation when it cancelled its schedule. Government
officials say efforts will be continued to sell the company to private
business in the Caribbean.
The shutdown will adversely affect the Caribbean Community's efforts to
increase intra-regional trade. Wisco traditionally carried over 80 per cent
of the goods traded among Caricom members.
Mr Charles Pennycooke, general manager of the company, said the line's
recent troubles were caused by the failure of the shareholders to pay over
USDollars 7.5m which they had committed to the company.
One vessel was impounded in Miami because of outstanding payments of Dollars
95,000 for leased containers, while another was impounded in Antigua because
of overdue payments of Dollars 80,000 in agent fees. The vessels were
released after shareholders provided Dollars 250,000 to settle outstanding
bills. The line's third vessel is under mandatory docking in Trinidad.
The shareholding governments agreed six months ago to pay off the
outstanding liabilities of the company so that it could be sold. The company
has, however, received only a half of the promised funds, including the
recent payments to secure the release of the impounded vessels.

VOLVO, the Swedish car maker, plans to co-ordinate component planning and
product development with the French Renault group over the next 10 to 12
years, AP-DJ reports from Stockholm.
The co-ordination programme is part of the alliance between Volvo and
Renault. The programme, which covers production of light trucks as well as
engines, gear boxes and other components, is expected to save Volvo between
SKr350m (Dollars 60m) and SKr400m in 1992, Mr Christer Zetterberg, Volvo
chief executive said.
'The earlier estimates of savings of SKr2bn a year from 1995 onwards through
co-ordination with Renault have been adjusted upwards,' he said.
He also confirmed that the cut in Volvo's workforce will total 11,000
employees by the end of 1992. To date, about 8,000 employees have been made
redundant since 1990, with 7,000 job losses in Sweden and 1,000 abroad.
'The majority of the 3,000 redundancies in 1992 will occur abroad,' he said.
He emphasised the reductions in 1992 are the consequence of earlier measures
and did not represent new or additional redundancies.
Volvo Personvagnar, the group's passenger vehicle unit in Sweden, said it
would cut production of its 960 model by 2,000 cars in the spring.

by cost-cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOB cuts and other cost-savings reduced annual losses at Thyssen Edelstahl
last year by more than 50 per cent, Mr Karlheinz Rosener, chairman of the
special steels subsidiary of the Thyssen group said yesterday.
However, since there were no firm signs of improvements in markets, he
added, more economies would be needed this year.
The company was already making losses in the first quarter of the current
year, he said, because of noticeable weaknesses in demand from machinery and
motor car makers.
Sales in the year ended September 1991 fell 14 per cent to DM3.3bn (Dollars
2.08bn), producing a loss of DM63m, compared with a DM176m deficit last time
on turnover of DM3.9bn.
Confirming a plan for the company to merge with Thyssen Stahl, part of the
parent group, Mr Rosener hinted that when that was complete later this year,
the group might resume 'co-operation' talks in the special steels business
with Krupp, another leading German maker.
A first round of negotiations was broken off just before Christmas.
Long products, mainly engineering steel, which account for 38 per cent of
the company's sales and 56 per cent of volume deliveries, had suffered
particularly badly from 'recessive tendencies' which first hit the group in
the middle of 1990. Turnover in the sector, which includes stainless and
tool steels, fell 22 per cent during the year.
Prices of steel for construction and ball-bearings fell by up to 10 per
cent.
Economies last year included an 8 per cent reduction in the workforce,
halving overtime hours worked, short-time in some plants and the retraining
and transfer to other Thyssen group companies of 256 people.
Thyssen Edelstahl was currently reducing costs in central administration by
about 30 per cent, Mr Rosener said, and more job losses were inevitable this
year.

GROUP net profits of Baer Holding, the Zurich-based parent company of the
Julius Baer banking group, rose 25 per cent to SFr60m (Dollars 42.5m) in
1991.
Gross income increased 8 per cent to SFr397m, with all business sections
contributing to the result, the group said. Operating expenses rose 5 per
cent to SFr276m, resulting in a gross profit of SFr121m, up 17 per cent.
Cash flow climbed 24 per cent to SFr104m, but depreciation and provisions
were also up 23 per cent.
At the year-end, total assets stood at SFr5.7bn while published equity was
up 7 per cent to SFr601m.
Bank Julius Baer's net profit jumped 20 per cent to SFr42m last year. Total
assets grew 2 per cent to SFr4.4bn. After payment of a SFr26.3m dividend to
its parent company and allocations to reserves, published equity stood at
SFr386m.
Ares-Serono, the world's leading producer of human fertility drugs, said its
sales in 1991 rose 15 per cent to Dollars 751m.
Pharmaceutical sales advanced 15.5 per cent to Dollars 625.2m, with sales in
each of the Geneva-based group's three main therapeutic areas rising by
almost 20 per cent.
Sales of over-the-counter products jumped 32.6 per cent to Dollars 19.1m.

FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Cementia sees 'similar' half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CEMENTIA, the Swiss sub-holding company in the Lafarge Coppee cement group,
expects net income in the second half of last year to be 'similar' to the
SFr38.1m (Dollars 27m) reported in the first half.
That would indicate a slight improvement on the SFr72m in net income
recorded in 1990.
'This is a considerable achievement in view of performances of other
companies in our sector,' Mr Ernst Schneider, who became chairman on January
1, said in a letter to shareholders.
The growth was achieved as a result of restructuring in the US and strong
performances in the Indian Ocean area and in Austria and Kenya.
Due to bleak market conditions in Ontario, Lafarge Corp of the US, in which
Cementia has had an 11 per cent holding since a restructuring of Lafarge
interests in North America last June, will suffer a full year loss. However,
due to a positive result in the second half, it will make a contribution to
Cementia's profits.
Von Roll, the Swiss steel and engineering group in which Proventus, the
Swedish investment house, bought a 22.8 per cent stake last month, said on
Friday in a preliminary statement that it suffered a loss in 1991.
Von Roll warned last summer that it expected a sharp drop this year in
consolidated net income from the SFr58m earned in 1990.
It said that its reverse was due to the severe recession in the Swiss
building industry as well as a marked downturn among all steel products and
problems in its Isola wire subsidiary. It did not give a specific figure for
the loss but said consolidated sales dropped 6.7 per cent to SFr2.3bn. New
orders tumbled 13.7 per cent to SFr2.3bn.
Group first-quarter sales at Landis &amp; Gyr rose 15 per cent and order intake
remained strong, Mr Willy Kissling, chief executive, said at the Swiss
building and energy controls and telecoms equipment group's annual press
conference.
However, the directors expected that growth in turnover and profits would be
somewhat lower than the very high levels achieved last year.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Wheway declines to Pounds 2.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEWAY, the environmental engineering group, yesterday announced a sharp
fall in profits and strengthened its board by appointing Mr Gareth Davies,
chairman and chief executive of Glynwed International, as a non-executive
director.
Pre-tax profits in the year to September 28 fell from Pounds 7.54m to Pounds
2.81m, in line with expectations, while the final dividend, as forecast, is
halved to 1p on the increased capital, making 2p (3p) for the year. Earnings
per share dropped from 6.44p to 2.08p.
Turnover at Birmingham-based Wheway, which has been transformed over recent
years from a Midlands metal basher into an international clean air and
design engineering group, fell from Pounds 120.3m to Pounds 89.3m, although
the 1990 figure included Pounds 37.5m from discontinued activities. Those
activities made an operating profit of Pounds 1.97m last year.
Mr John McGowan, chairman, blamed the profits decline on three factors:
the decision to withdraw from businesses which previously made up the
industrial and building products division;
the reorganisation and investment programme in air filtration, which came on
line in April;
and the depth and duration of the worldwide recession.
Mr McGowan said the group had entered the current year with an weaker order
book than it would normally expect, resulting in immediate action further to
contain operating costs and conserve cash.
There were signs, however, that the order book was improving. In the UK,
Cudd Bentley, which does mechanical and electrical design work for the
construction industry, had taken more orders in the past six weeks than in
the previous 22 months.
Overall, the first half of the current year was expected to be
disappointing, but Mr McGowan expressed confidence for the outcome in the
second half, assuming that the trend in orders continued to improve.
He said Synsafe, a new air filtration product, was doing 'pretty well' in
the UK since its launch in November. Synsafe will be launched in the US next
year, and the group is negotiating to expand into Germany and Spain.
Another non-executive director will also be appointed soon, and the group
then plans to move as quickly as possible to appoint a non-executive
chairman so that Mr McGowan can concentrate on his role as chief executive.

WATERFORD FOODS, the Irish dairy and foods group, has announced an IPounds
25m (Pounds 23.3m) rights issue to part-finance its IPounds 62m purchase of
Express Ireland from Grand Metropolitan.
The 34m new A ordinary shares will be issued on a 2-for-9 basis at 74p
apiece.
Waterford Co-op, the principal shareholder in the group, holding 79 per cent
of the existing 153m shares, will only subscribe for 8m shares of the issue.
This will effectively dilute its holding to about 69 per cent.
Brokers in Dublin said there had been much interest shown by institutional
investors in the issue, with the price being regarded as cheap. Waterford
shares closed at 76p on the Dublin Stock Exchange last Friday.
Waterford's acquisition of Express puts the group alongside Dairygold as the
biggest milk processor in Ireland.
It is the latest step in a rapid expansion plan which has been in train
since 1989.
Then, Waterford purchased Healds Foods, near Manchester, followed by
Galloway West in Wisconsin in the US in 1990, and United Co-operative
Dairies in northern England last year.
In total, the group has spent an estimated IPounds 200m on these
acquisitions.
In announcing the issue, Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, said: 'We
believe that the time is appropriate to raise new equity to expand the
capital base of the group and position it for further developments'.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Seismic rumblings along global party-lines
 -The industry-wide effects of an AT&amp;T/Cable and Wireless alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GLOBAL alliance between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and Cable and
Wireless - which has been the subject of intense negotiations since last
September - would create an earthquake in the international
telecommunications industry.
AT&amp;T is the most formidable player in the industry, although largely based
in the US. C and W is much smaller but has the best global spread of any
telephone company, with operations in the UK, Hong Kong, Japan, the US,
Australia and countless developing countries.
Wide-ranging collaboration between the two groups would almost certainly
cause a knock-on effect in the rest of the industry as other telephone
companies scramble to form their own alliances. The sector is already in a
frenzy of matchmaking as national monopolies try to turn themselves into
internationally competitive operators.
But will an alliance be concluded? The negotiators failed to make progress
in talks earlier this month, denting hopes of a quick deal.
The two companies seem to have reached agreement in principle on AT&amp;T buying
a quarter to a third of Mercury Communications, C and W's UK subsidiary. But
they were unable to agree on how wider co-operation would work and AT&amp;T also
has doubts about moving ahead on Mercury before the British general election
later this year.
The main attraction of an alliance from C and W's perspective is that AT&amp;T
would give it the necessary muscle to compete more effectively with British
Telecommunications in the UK.
Lord Young, C and W's chairman, has made it clear that he does not want to
compete head on with large groups like AT&amp;T and BT. He prefers a
'super-niche' strategy of providing mobile, data and international services
in high-margin markets around the world.
AT&amp;T would be expected to pay about Pounds 1bn for a minority share of
Mercury as well as committing itself to investing further cash to help build
Mercury up as a competitor to BT. Effectively, Lord Young would be getting
two giants to compete against each other, rather than competing directly
against either himself.
Such thinking was also behind C and W's decision not to proceed with its
planned Dollars 174m (Pounds 97m) acquisition of TRT/FTC last November,
which would have made it the fourth largest long-distance operator in the
US, but pitted it directly against AT&amp;T.
Lord Young seems also to want AT&amp;T's collaboration in continental Europe. He
has already called on the European Commission to take decisive action later
this year to open up the telecommunications market to competition.
For C and W, the main problems in concluding a deal are to get the maximum
price and to ensure that it does not get squashed by AT&amp;T, which has been
described as 'an 800lb gorilla'.
C and W is protected from a hostile takeover bid by the UK government's
'golden share', which prevents any single shareholder owning more than 15
per cent of its stock. On the other hand, the company appears to want to do
a deal on more than just Mercury for fear that AT&amp;T would otherwise team up
with different partners in other European countries, turning Mercury into
the UK appendage of a global empire.
For AT&amp;T, a deal with C and W would take it closer to chairman Mr Bob
Allen's goal of earning half the group's revenue from outside the US by the
time he retires in 2000.
The main attraction of taking a stake in Mercury would be that AT&amp;T would
then be operating a network on both sides of the Atlantic.
Instead of handing over most of its UK phone calls to BT in the
mid-Atlantic, as at present, it would hope to channel most of them through
Mercury.
International calls have been a pot of gold for telephone companies in
recent years as a result of cartel practices which have kept prices
artificially high.
The UK-US route is the most lucrative anywhere in the world, earning both BT
and AT&amp;T well over Pounds 100m in annual profits, and the US group may well
ask why it should not try to grab a larger share for itself.
Some AT&amp;T executives are concerned about disturbing the traditional
profitable correspondent relationship with BT. Others, though, argue that BT
has already declared war by buying a 20 per cent share of McCaw, the largest
US mobile communications operator, and setting up Syncordia, a US subsidiary
which is designed to poach some of AT&amp;T's largest business customers.
The old correspondent relationships, which have characterised the industry
for decades, are breaking down anyway. Technological advances are driving
down costs while liberalisation is allowing new breeds of competitor to chip
away at the market.
Earlier this month Sprint, the third largest US long-distance operator, said
it planned to establish a UK network to compete with BT and Mercury.
If AT&amp;T teamed up with Mercury, BT might feel it had no option but to do a
deal with MCI, the second largest US long-distance operator.
But AT&amp;T may have doubts about joining forces with C and W throughout the
European Community. C and W's operations on the Continent are still
embryonic and the US company may therefore feel it could do better on its
own.
AT&amp;T is also clearly concerned that a Labour government might change UK
telecommunications policy. Some observers,though, believe the most likely
change would be to block any new competition - so strengthening Mercury's
position.
AT&amp;T has looked seriously at making a sizeable investment in the UK several
times - acquiring a stake in Mercury in the early 1980s, buying part of STC
and taking over the manufacturer GPT as part of the Metsun consortium which
considered bidding for GEC in 1989. Each time, though, it pulled out and its
only significant UK acquisition to date has been Istel, which provides
enhanced telecommunications services, for Pounds 180m in 1989.
Recently AT&amp;T has been more aggressive. Last year it acquired NCR, the US
computer manufacturer, after a bitter takeover bid. Only last week it formed
a joint venture to build and run a telephone network in the Ukraine.
Strategic decisions within AT&amp;T usually follow a fight between hawks and
doves. Whether to link up with C and W or not will be largely determined by
which group of AT&amp;T executives has the upper hand.

<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya of Spain are to allow their business
customers access to each other's national branch networks.
BBV is the fifth European bank with which Lloyds has signed a bilateral
agreement. It already has similar arrangements in France, Italy, Germany,
and the Netherlands.
Lloyds said that by using the branch networks offered by selected banks, it
would be able to give its business customers full banking services
throughout the EC.
The agreement gives them access to 1,900 BBV branches in Spain. Lloyds
already has a 19-branch network there
Business customers of Lloyds will be able to open accounts, obtain advice on
local business practices, and other services from banks with bilateral
agreements. The arrangements do not operate multilaterally between Lloyds'
partners.

<TEXT>
MR DAVID Quayle, founder of the B&amp;Q DIY chain, has joined a management group
which is seeking to replace the directors of Cityvision, the video rental
chain.
Mr Quayle was a non-executive director of Cityvision from 1986 until October
1990, and was instrumental in setting its early direction.
Institutional shareholders, representing 16.8 per cent of the equity, are
seeking to replace the current management with Mr Quayle and two former
Cityvision executives, Mr Phillip Crane and Mr Ray Hipkin.
The move follows an agreement by Cityvision to be acquired by US-based
Blockbuster Entertainment. Mr Hipkin yesterday issued a writ for libel
against Cityvision and its advisers, J Henry Schroder Wagg, in connection
with comments made about his former employment at the company.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Steetley seeks shareholder support for
Tarmac merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for control of Steetley, the building materials group, is
expected to intensify with the publication today of the group's latest
appeal for support to shareholders.
The group has written to its 7,000 shareholders - institutional investors
own 80 per cent of the 156.3m shares - defending its proposal to merge its
UK brick, clay roof tile and concrete products businesses with those of
Tarmac, Britain's biggest construction and building materials group.
The announcement of the joint venture plan at the beginning of December
prompted a hostile bid from Redland, the building materials group which has
long coveted Steetley's domestic brick and French aggregates operations.
Redland's 85-for-100 share exchange offer was yesterday worth more than
Pounds 630m, valuing each Steetley share at 405.45p. Steetley's shares
closed last night at 377p.
In the document, which will be posted to shareholders today, Steetley says
the Tarmac merger would reduce unit production costs by up to 15 per cent
and generate combined savings of at least Pounds 10m a year.
Savings would include the closure of 14 out of 56 plants. Combined brick
production would be cut by 20 per cent or 160m bricks a year.
Tarmac's large UK construction, housebuilding and concrete operations and
its international interests would be excluded from the joint venture, which
would be named Allied Building Materials. Steetley would retain its European
concrete and aggregates businesses. It is the largest aggregates producer in
France.
The document says: 'No other combination could bring together two companies
with anything like the same benefits across the total range of their
building products.'
It forecast that by the mid 1990s Allied would be generating profit margins
higher than those achieved during 1988 and 1989, the two best years for UK
construction output.
A letter from Sir Eric Pountain, Tarmac's chairman, included in the
document, endorses the joint venture proposal which he says 'will represent
a potent challenge to our competitors . . . founded on one of the lowest
cost structures in the industry'.
Steetley is due to publish by next Monday its official defence document
against the Redland bid. This, however, may be postponed if the Office of
Fair Trading has not pronounced by then on possible monopoly implications
raised by the bid.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Eurocopy shares leap on OFT clearance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Eurocopy yesterday jumped 25 per cent to 100p as the Office of
Fair Trading announced that it would not revoke the photocopier
distributor's 18 consumer credit licences, which allow it to arrange
third-party financing.
However, Sir Gordon Borrie, director general of the OFT, strongly condemned
office equipment leasing documentation in general. Much of it was
'unsatisfactory', he said, and 'open to abuse . . . I will not hesitate to
move against someone who uses such paperwork.'
Eurocopy, which came under fierce criticism last year for the sales
practices employed by some of its subsidiaries, said it was delighted with
the decision.
Its annual results, which have been postponed three times pending the OFT
announcement, are due on Friday.
Mr Cyril Gay, chairman, said the decision was 'a huge relief . . . If they
had had those licences taken away, it would have been the end of the
company.'
Sir Gordon said he had received 10 assurances from Eurocopy and its
associates regarding future business practices, including a re-casting of
agreements, a seven-day cooling-off period, and a new training programme for
sales staff. The OFT would also receive regular reports from the company on
the level of complaints and on how the assurances were being met.
The director general pointed out that the questionable practices were
largely connected with companies - especially the Scottish group Purdie &amp;
Kirkpatrick - acquired from Sketchley in 1989.
The companies had been criticised for misleading lessees into signing
contracts by understating the minimum volume of copies or the length of the
lease they contracted to pay for, and for getting junior staff to sign
contracts.
'I am now satisfied that before I told them in August I was minded to revoke
their licences, Eurocopy had already taken steps to overhaul their selling
practices,' Sir Gordon said.
Eurocopy said it introduced contracts with larger print, on which the terms
of the agreement are more clearly set out, as early as October 1990. Mr
Michael Armitage, finance director, claimed that the group had had no
serious complaints since the new documentation was introduced.
Not surprisingly, the uncertainty surrounding the issue has given Eurocopy's
competitors a field day and depressed its share price which reached a peak
of 256p on August 7 1990.
Mr Armitage said that competitors had used the adverse publicity to take
business from Eurocopy.
In August the company claimed that publicity surrounding the investigation
had cost the company about Pounds 4.5m in lost profits. Analysts are
expecting at least a 33 per cent drop in Eurocopy's profits to Pounds 7.5m.
Nevertheless, the consensus in the City is that, questionable sales
practices apart, Eurocopy still has a solid business. Before the
announcement, Mr Andrew Yeo at Hoare Govett valued the shares at 60p on the
basis of the cash generated by existing contracts alone.
However, yesterday's decision has taken them closer to the underlying value
of between 120p to 130p, he said.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Unwelcome approach for Wilkes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES WILKES, the world's largest supplier of beer mats, has received an
'unsolicited and unwelcome' approach which might lead to an offer being made
for the Sheffield-based mini-conglomerate.
Shares in Wilkes, which has most of its business in engineering, closed up
30p at 189p, for a market value of Pounds 33m.
Mr Stephen Hinchcliffe, chairman, refused to identify the prospective
bidder, but said a further announcement would be made.
While the company continued to trade profitably, it has been pursuing a
policy of reducing borrowings in light of the general economic outlook.
Mr Hinchcliffe declined to give a gearing figure. But he agreed the company
had stretched its balance sheet last year paying Pounds 3.6m for the
outstanding 25.8 per cent stake, held by Record Holdings, the
Sheffield-based hand and power tools manufacturer, in Easterbrook Allcard,
the cutting tools concern Wilkes acquired in 1990.
The company also said that Mr Arthur Watt had been made group managing
director on January 14, and a second non-executive director would be
appointed shortly.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Medeva acquires Glaxo brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday acquired more than 30 brands
from Glaxo in a deal worth Pounds 13.5m.
The products, which range from treatments for paracetamol poisoning to nose
inflammation, have a turnover in the UK and the Republic of Ireland of about
Pounds 6.5m a year. The purchase price is to be paid by instalments over a
period of two-and-a-half years.
The move follows a series of acquisitions by Medeva, which aims to have
sales of Pounds 500m by 1995. In 1989 the group had revenues of less than
Pounds 1m.
Mr David Lees, Medeva's finance director, said yesterday: 'These treatments
are more fitting in a company our size where they will be first and second
rank products while at Glaxo they were in the fifth-rank.'
Mr Lees said Medeva should make profits of Pounds 15m this year. That would
compare with Glaxo's profits last year of Pounds 1.2bn on turnover of Pounds
3.4bn. Mr Bernard Taylor, Medeva's chairman, was formerly Glaxo's chief
executive.
Glaxo said it was selling niche generic products of which Medeva could make
more use than itself. It added that it did not have enough time to give them
the attention they deserved.
The acquisitions fit into Medeva's existing sales and distribution channels,
said Mr Lees. The company already manufactures some of the products and will
sub-contract the others.
No additional capital expenditure was required to set up manufacturing, he
added. Mr Lees said he was particularly pleased with the timing of payment
which would make the deal cash-flow equal.
Last October Medeva bought Adams Laboratories, a Texas-based branded
pharmaceutical manufacturer, for Dollars 77.2m (Pounds 43m).

FT  21 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutions which have been baying for British Aerospace's blood at least
have the satisfaction of seeing Mr Dudley Eustace quit his job as finance
director. Doubtless, Mr Eustace must share the blame for last autumn's
rights issue fiasco. But it does not help that there is no replacement to
hand, while the problems that piled up during the reign of the idiosyncratic
Sir Roland Smith are as acute as ever.
Asda's property claim against BAe has at least been provided for, so there
is no extra impact on the profit and loss account. It will involve a cash
outflow, though, which the company can ill afford - especially since it
looks increasingly unlikely to clinch the cash-rich second phase of the
al-Yamamah deal until the UK election is out of the way.
Meanwhile, BAe has to be doubly careful in managing its working capital. Its
cash position may have improved in last year's second half as stocks of
unsold Rover cars were reduced. But cars will be difficult to move this year
as well. BAe needs to find a new finance director quickly, and a good one at
that.

FT  21 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as if the Agnelli family has fallen foul of the French
establishment after all in its attempt to take over Perrier. The fact that
Perrier may instead go to a Swiss company is apparently secondary. The
Agnelli decision a few weeks ago to make a full bid for Exor, the holding
company which controls Perrier, was an attempt to mollify powerful minority
shareholders like Banque Indosuez. Now that Suez has joined forces with
Nestle in a rival but direct bid for Perrier, such displays of politeness
are presumably over.
It is hard to see Saint Louis, which bought a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier
at the start of the year and was until yesterday an Agnelli ally, turning
down a capital gain estimated at more than Pounds 40m. Whether the Agnellis
then accept the Nestle/Suez offer and realise their own capital gain remains
to be seen. But the Italian family's ambitions in the European food industry
have suffered an embarrassing setback.
Arguably the eminence grise of the whole affair is BSN, which stands to gain
the Volvic brand as its price for helping to deliver Perrier to Nestle. The
Agnellis could perhaps make trouble by pursuing their previous desire to
increase their stake in BSN. But that would doubtless involve a battle with
the French establishment as well.
Unless Brussels intervenes, the clear winner is Nestle, which has emerged as
a master of European takeover strategy. It presumably intends eventually to
buy out Suez and run Perrier for itself. As with its bid for Rowntree four
yearsago, it appears to have outflanked the opposition when it looked as if
the game was up.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's drop below 21,000 on the Nikkei emphasises the dilemma facing
the Japanese authorities. On the one hand, they need a higher Yen to stave
off protectionist pressure from the US. On the other, the risk that falling
equity prices could prompt a banking crisis suggests a further cut in
interest rates is imperative. Caught in the middle is the dollar, which
closed in London 3 per cent below its pre-weekend level against the yen,
thanks largely to Friday night's intervention in New York.
In the short run, it looks as though the authorities will not find it too
difficult to shore up the yen ahead of Saturday's ministerial meeting of the
Group of Seven. Intense US political pressure on the trade issue may just
help to hold the yen up thereafter. That could resolve the policy dilemma by
allowing the hitherto reluctant Bank of Japan to cut interest rates once
more without worry about a revival of inflationary pressure.
If, however, the markets prefer to concentrate on the effect of low Japanese
bond yields on capital flows, it will be touch and go whether the Miyazawa
administration can pull off the conjuring trick. It would doubtless help if
the US were to cut its own rates again in the not-too-distant future. It
would also help if the dollar turned out not to have embarked yet on a
sustained upward trend, despite its worldwide rally last week. A stronger
dollar would also make it harder for Germany to start cutting rates as its
domestic economy weakens. There is a co-operation challenge for G7 ministers
here. The question is whether they will grasp it.

FT  21 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: The shopper's tangled tale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,544.9 (+8.2)
The picture of UK retail sales is getting murkier just when the market most
needs guidance. The government tells us that December was awful. The CBI
tells us that December continued the mild recovery of the previous four
months but that January looks awful instead. Anecdote tells us that the
picture was appalling until just before Christmas, then got sharply better
until early January, then may have gone off again.
With luck, the CBI's expectations for January may chiefly reflect the
depressed mood of its respondents in mid-December. On the other hand, if the
anecdotal evidence is right, the official 1 per cent drop in December retail
volume is worse than it looks. The period ended on January 4, thus taking in
most of the recovery period. Early December must thus have been dire indeed.
Where we are now is anyone's guess.
The trouble is that this slender evidence is being loaded with a
significance greater than it can bear. The market looks to the retail sector
for clues to the economy. The government looks to the economy for clues to
the election. The consumerlooks to the election for clues on when it is safe
to start spending again. The result is gridlock.
It seems to follow that last week's recovery in retail stocks - the sector
outperformed the market by 4 per cent - was once again premature. The
sector's historic p/e is over 18 times against 14.5 times for the market,
while its yield is more than a full percentage point below the market
average. There is no doubt that the retailers are more geared than most to
recovery. It could also be argued that wider faith in recovery was implied
by yesterday's slight rise in the FT-SE despite the retail figures. The fact
remains that in terms of the economic fundamentals, the market is proceeding
in the dark.

Sir, In your article, 'The Lloyd's Report' (January 16), Mr Tom Benyon, on
behalf of the Association of Lloyd's Names, is quoted as saying: 'For the
first time in its 300-year history, it's putting the outsiders first, and
not the insiders'. Mr Claud Gurney (Letters, January 16) uses the same
conception of outsiders and insiders to make the opposite point.
In fact, Lloyd's has always put outsiders first. They are the
policy-holders. Those of us who take a serious interest in the running of
Lloyd's and our own syndicates in particular are very much insiders and are
treated accordingly.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: District council spending that bears examination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JUDY MALLABER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Reports of our analysis of Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for 295
shire district councils have focused on political debate, yet Mr Michael
Portillo's assertion that our findings are 'ludicrous' cannot go
unchallenged (Parliament and politics, January 17) .
The report concentrated on shire district councils because the figures for
these authorities bear examination. The study was requested by our members
who have often expressed their concern about the way in which SSAs are set.
The proposed national average increase in SSAs is 6.8 per cent, yet Liberal
Democrat and Labour controlled districts are in line for increases of 4.87
per cent and 3.92 per cent respectively. Our research was unable to find a
reason which would account for this.
Mr Portillo cites increases in some London boroughs to demonstrate
even-handedness. For the record, in the 32 London authorities both Labour
and Tory administrations received average SSA increases of 7.7 per cent.
Liberal Democrat authorities and hung councils get 7.3 per cent. The
closeness of the London figures is an explanation of differences between
districts even more important.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: Part-time work the only option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms VALERIE AMOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alison Wolf from the Institute of Education seeks an explanation
(Letters, January 16) as to why so many British women are working if the
UK's childcare provision is so scarce. The explanation comes in two words -
part time.
While it is true that the UK has the second highest rate of female
participation in the labour force, this is because we have so many
part-timers.
In all EC countries, married women are more likely to work part-time than
non-married women. But in the UK, 53 per cent of married female employees
worked part-time in 1988 (last year for which figures available) compared
with an EC average of 37 per cent.
A significant proportion of part-time working women would prefer to work
full time, but are prevented from doing so by the lack of affordable quality
childcare.
The UK is also different from its EC neighbours in that 34 per cent of
fathers of children under 10 worked more than 50 hours a week, the highest
total in the EC.
Women in Britain work out of necessity. But the lack of affordable childcare
means that for most women a life of low-paid, part-time work is substituted
for the prospect of a long and successful career.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: Cyrus Vance, not EC, behind Yugoslav lull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M GAVRILOVIC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Next steps in Yugoslavia' (January 16), unconvincingly
attributes the present lull in Yugoslav fighting to 'unilateral German
diplomacy'. Germany has been on one side of the Yugoslav conflict right from
the start of the present fighting, making its entire diplomatic and media
services available to former Second World War ally Croatia along with
secessionist Slovenia.
The fighting became an inevitability once the Serbs in Croatia realised that
they might well find themselves imprisoned within another independent state
of Croatia for the second time in 50 years.
With its most powerful and dominant member on one side of the conflict it
was only predictable that any EC initiatives were going to be heavily
distorted in favour of the secessionist republics and stood little chance of
acceptance at any diplomatic or negotiation level.
Far more convincing has been the involvement of Mr Cyrus Vance and his UN
team who, almost on their own, achieved within a few weeks what German-led
EC unilateralism failed to achieve in six months. Many of the EC moves and
proposals have been unprecedented in their deviation from international
legal norms and ignored many EC procedures as well.
It is now far more likely that several Northern Irelands have been created
where a once multi-ethnic state was able to guarantee minority rights far
better than the untried and instantly ignored (by Germany and the EC) paper
guarantees now on the table. M Gavrilovic,

<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Adviser warns of Russian power struggle threat' (January
16), gives 10 paragraphs to Prof Sachs's criticism of the Russian central
bank and only one to the Russian central bank's criticism of Prof Sachs. In
effect, it takes sides with Prof Sachs and Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime
minister, in their struggle against the central bank and its chairman, Mr
Georgy Matiukhin. May I make two comments?
First, I believe Mr Matiukhin to be a man of complete integrity, a rare
commodity among Russia's ruling classes. Second, the Russian central bank
has some valid arguments in its defence. It is no good just reducing the
issue of currency when there is no effective circulation, no mechanism to
ensure that notes return to banks or enterprises. Though it is admittedly
inflationary, if the growth of the money supply ceased, some workers would
not be paid at all.
A foreign adviser should offer advice in private; Prof Sachs's use of
western publicity to wage an internal war and defend his own privileged
position is an unwarranted interference in Russia's affairs.

<TEXT>
Watch India. It stands a far better chance of becoming an important new
industrial power than Russia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and all the other
states of the former Soviet Union put together.
This does not mean that it will do so. Delhi's history of economic
mismanagement is discouraging. Its tradition of heavy-handed planning was
established when Stalin was a hero to the world's socialists. As to
political risk, the persistence of inflation in the low double-digits could
bring India's minority government down at any moment deemed suitable by the
opposition. It is not only Mr Boris Yeltsin's regime that is threatened by
price increases.
Yet when you list pluses and minuses India seems to have more going for it
than the ex-Soviet states. It is well-placed to follow Indonesia, Mexico and
others into a period of high growth and rapid industrialisation, financed by
a strong inflow of foreign capital. The former Soviet state is not.
Let us tick off the top three items. First, Russia is trying to build a
market economy on the crumbling ruins of a communist polity. There has been
no systemic failure in India, although last summer's teeter on the brink of
financial collapse was a close-run thing. Second, the Russians are starting
from scratch. Everything must be changed. The new government in Delhi has a
far lesser task. It is merely trying to open up a formerly closed economy,
restrain the growth of the public sector, and put an end to the
Soviet-inspired system of licensing and regulation that has led many Indians
to describe the four decades since independence as wasted years.
Third, the Commonwealth of Independent States is mystified by capitalism.
India is the home of some of the brassiest capitalist buccaneers on the face
of the globe. The Russians are searching for an understanding with the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund; many of Delhi's leading economic
advisers have served time in either the Bank or the Fund. They speak the
language of international lenders.
Several other factors favour India. The newly liberated ex-communist states
are struggling to learn financial management. India has rapidly growing
stock exchanges, sophisticated (if constrained) capital markets, and an
urban public accustomed to the trading of goods and services in the hustle
and bustle of huge permanent marketplaces like the streets of Calcutta and
Bombay. It also has a working if uneconomic railway system, improving
telecommunications, and goods in the shops. Russia's Gosplan-designed
infrastructure is an obstacle to its progress; its shop windows are empty.
More to the point, it is not certain that the Russians know what they are
doing. The new Indian government is advised by highly sophisticated and
knowledgeable economists who are convinced that their programme is the right
one. Some of them produce papers written years ago to demonstrate that they
were Britain has a direct commercial interest in building a closer
relationship with this future India
market economists long before the last August's loans-for-liberalisation
deals were struck with the IMF and the World Bank.
The small coterie of politicians and officials who are managing India's bold
programme of stabilisation and reconstruction seems determined to plough
ahead, whatever the political difficulties. A phrase familiar to Britain of
the early 1980s - 'there is no alternative'  - is ringing round Delhi.
All that said, India remains India. The caste system, the commercial and
political corruption, and the stifling bureaucracy will not be disposed of
easily or quickly. The three-quarters of the people who live in villages,
many of them in abject poverty, will not enjoy the trickle-down of any drops
of prosperity for many years to come. As the growth rate increases, the
existing disparities between the regions will be widened. Yet it is possible
to visualise a sort of success, however erratic the pace may be.
Britain has a direct commercial interest in building a closer relationship
with this India of the future - a greater interest, I suspect, than in
trying to purchase or establish businesses in the former Soviet Union.
Perhaps this will be recognised after the next general election. During the
past three weeks two senior ministers, the home secretary and the foreign
secretary, have visited Delhi. Mr Kenneth Baker's talk was of extradition
treaties and immigration, Mr Douglas Hurd's of relationships with Pakistan
and the desirability of a political solution to the Kashmiri problem.
It is probable that both visits were at least partly inspired by domestic
British political calculations. The votes of immigrants from India and
Pakistan will be important in several marginal constituencies. Rich Indian
businessmen resident in Britain are important contributors to both
Conservative and Labour party funds. Yet both Mr Baker and Mr Hurd had good
departmental reasons for their visits. Both expressed admiration for the
courageous way in which the government of Mr P V Narashima Rao is persisting
with its new economic policy.
If it works, there will be a lot of business to do. Britain should be
well-placed to capture some of it.
In support of this proposition, I offer just one vignette of a three-week
visit to the subcontinent. It is Calcutta, on a Sunday afternoon in January.
On the green grass of the huge city-centre park there are hundreds of games
of cricket in progress. There is barely space to walk between the pitches;
one game melds into another. Everyone is in best Lords whites. Much Bengali
is spoken, but much English too. From time to time an English phrase floats
across the air. ''Owzat?' is particularly common, challenging the umpire to
declare the batsman out.
Nehru's socialist, statist legacy is walking to the pavilion. It is time to
start taking proper notice of India again.

FT  21 JAN 92 / No winners in the chip race: Recession and huge excess
capacity are hitting Japanese semiconductor manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese electronics companies are fast concluding that leading the
technology race does not mean winning the commercial race. Having rushed to
produce ever more sophisticated semiconductors, the tiny devices at the
heart of modern electronics equipment, they have suddenly discovered that
the market's appetite for their advanced products is not as healthy as they
had anticipated.
Leading companies such as NEC, Toshiba, Hitachi and Fujitsu had presumed
that they would now be reaping the financial benefits of their lead in
making the memory circuits, or chips, used to store and retrieve
information. Instead, they are cutting production targets, reviewing capital
investment programmes, and asking themselves if the high price of
participating in the memory market is worth the now meagre returns.
In part the troubles of the chip makers reflect the global economic
downturn, in particular the weakness of the US economy. The industry is also
plagued with massive excess production capacity, which has prompted a sharp
fall in semiconductor prices. More fundamentally, chip makers' investment in
technology appears to have run ahead of what their customers want to buy.
This is something of a novel experience for the Japanese semiconductor
manufacturers. They had long regarded the chip market as special, driven by
a so-called 'silicon cycle' with a life apart from the real economy. Each
new and more powerful generation of memory chip seemed to create its own
market as it was embraced by the makers of consumer electronics goods and
computer companies to improve the quality and capacity of their products.
For the makers themselves, producing ever more powerful memory chips has
long been a potent symbol of technological prowess, even though their basic
function, information storage, is relatively simple. For the past two
decades, companies have vied to squeeze ever larger amounts of memory on the
same small chips, with each new generation rising by a multiple of 4. Before
the current 4-megabit, or 4Mbit, generation, mass produced from 1989, came
the still popular 1Mbit; the next generation is the 16Mbit, which is
expected to begin mass production shortly.
But the market is no longer expanding as expected. In the case of the
current generation of semiconductors, potential customers, made wary by
recession, are proving slow to begin the process of redesigning their
products to incorporate the new technology.
The result is that prices of the 4Mbit chips have fallen by almost 50 per
cent over the past year and are still falling. An executive at Fujitsu, the
Japanese electronics company, lamented that 'nobody will make a profit on
this generation' of chips, while a senior executive at Matsushita Electric
Industrial said the company is considering whether to commit the estimated
Y120bn (Pounds 524m) a year needed to stay in the memory chip race.
The question is all the more pressing because most Japanese electronics
groups have been confronted by falling profits in other product lines,
including video-cassette recorders, computers, and televisions. Consumer
electronics sales have been been particularly sluggish on the domestic
market over the past year, with the result that companies reported lower
profits in the first half of the current financial year ending in March:
Toshiba was down 62.6 per cent, Hitachi 27.3 per cent, and Mitsubishi
Electric 24.5 per cent.
Memory chips remain potentially lucrative. The world market is worth about
Dollars 14bn, of which Random-Access Memory chips such as the 4Mbit comprise
about two-thirds of the value. There are other types of chips, many of them
more sophisticated than memory chips - with some, for example, working as
the brain of a computer - but the memory market is the largest and, Japanese
makers had hoped, the most profitable.
That was certainly the case with the 1Mbit generation, in which Toshiba led
the pack and reaped large profits. For the 4Mbit, the competition has been
much tougher, with eight Japanese companies, three US makers, and one South
Korean company, Samsung, in the field, and two other South Korean companies
preparing to begin production.
This challenge to Japanese makers, which last year captured about 93 per
cent of 4Mbit sales, has forced them to cut chip output targets in the
financial year ending in March by 30 per cent and more. Toshiba has delayed
the opening of a new production line by six months. And a month ago,
Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer maker, announced it was cutting investment
in semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the year to March 1993 by 40
per cent to Y90bn, and postponing construction of new plants until the
following year at the earliest. The pain is also severe at Hitachi, where
memory chips comprise about 40 per cent of chip production.
The cuts in Japanese production targets are an attempt to bolster the price
of the 4Mbit chip. But that strategy has been undermined by the continuing
weakness in demand and the aggressiveness of Samsung, which is quoting
prices to customers at up to 10 per cent below the level agreed on by
Japanese makers.
Partly as a result, Japanese companies are nervous about the prospect for
profits on the next generation of 16Mbit chips. They are even more anxious
about the risk involved in developing the new technology necessary to
manufacture the even more sophisticated 64Mbit chips. Mr Hajime Sasaki,
senior vice-president at NEC, said the types of products that might use a
64Mbit - for example, video telecommunications systems - are still under
development, and he is unsure who will be buying when the chips arrive on
the market in the mid-1990s.
This uncertainty has prompted Japanese companies, once proud that they
dominated the market, to try to share the 64Mbit development burden with
foreign partners. Mr Kazuo Kimbara, Hitachi's senior managing director,
sometimes called 'Mr Chips' for his leading role in developing the Japanese
industry, said that 'the need for international co-operation is being felt
more strongly than ever'.
Hitachi and Texas Instruments of the US recently announced an agreement to
research jointly the technology needed to make the 64Mbit chip, which
requires the use of finer circuits than present technology can manage. There
are also agreements between IBM and Siemens, and NEC and AT&amp;T
Microelectronics, and Toshiba has been considering a partnership with an
unnamed European company. AT&amp;T estimates that the cost of developing the new
process will be about Dollars 500m, and that is before a production facility
is built.
These agreements have another beneficial side effect: they help to solve the
problem of trade friction that has long plagued Japanese semiconductor
makers. In their quest to build market share in the early 1980s, Japanese
companies flooded the US with chips, with exports rising from Dollars
285.66m in 1982 to Dollars 987.1m in 1984. When challenged by the US
government they admitted that some of the devices had been dumped - that is,
sold at less than cost.
The result was a five-year, bilateral semiconductor pact signed in 1986 and
renewed last July, when Japanese makers again vowed that they would not dump
chips and Tokyo agreed that foreign chips should have at least a 20 per cent
share of the overall Japanese market by the end of the next year.
What these longer-term agreements have not done is help the 4Mbit market,
which has little chance of revival until the US economy recovers and demand
increases from US computer makers. In the meantime, Japanese companies will
be under extreme pressure, and the stronger, NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi, are
hoping that the weaker, such as NMB Semiconductor and Oki Electric Industry,
will drop out of the memory market.
'There are just too many companies making the chips,' a Fujitsu executive
said. Even the large electronics companies determined to remain in the
market are having to adjust their vision of the future. A good reason for
continuing to push ahead is that the technology involved, particularly the
process of miniaturisation, is likely to have applications beyond the memory
chip itself.
That in itself, however, will not guarantee profitability. In the past, the
Japanese manufacturers were fond of describing chips as the 'industrial
rice' of the modern age; like rice, memory chips have indeed become just
another commodity.

Reports that Rathbones, a firm of Liverpool financiers, is 'borrowing the
Bank of England' for its 250th birthday party have raised a few eyebrows in
the City.
Was not William Lidderdale, the Bank of England governor who masterminded
the rescue of Barings 100 years ago, a Rathbones' partner? Could it be that
the current small firm of Rathbones is more privileged than anyone knew?
On closer inspection, however, the event is not quite as grand as it sounds.
It is being held in the Bank's museum, which can be hired for Pounds 325 per
hour plus catering costs - and no, the Governor of the Bank of England will
not be gracing the occasion. But at least Peter Baring, chairman of his
family firm, will propose a vote of thanks.

Hold on to your fast forward buttons, Brits, and prepare for a surfeit of
Falklands war memorabilia - particularly from the BBC. Hard on the heels of
Channel 4's kamikaze dive into the history of the Anglo-Argentine war in
1982, comes the promise of no fewer than three different bites at the same
cherry by the Beeb.
'War Stories', produced by Peter Grimsdale, is a five-part series largely
filmed inside Argentina and looking at the events of 10 years ago from a
grunts-eye view. Brian Lapping Associates, in true Lapping-fashion, opts for
the Olympian style, digging into Washington's arcane corridors of power.
Touch Productions took Simon Weston and two other ex-combatants on a tour
through Argentina - where they met some of their erstwhile enemies.
If that weren't enough, TVS (part of the commercial network) is also
producing a series called In Time of War.
Observer detects a slight air of one-upmanship among the respective
programme-makers, who all make warm remarks about each other's programmes.
Lapping is proud of having obtained an interview with former brigadier Lami
Dozo, the air force representative of the three-man Argentine junta which
launched the invasion.
But no one has yet managed to wring an interview from the tight-lipped and
frequently tired and emotional ex-general, Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri.

From Luneburg Heath to Medicine Hat. The British Army, which will have to
give up its main training area in Germany from mid 1994, has secured an
'absolutely crucial' guarantee from Canada allowing it to fire guns and
drive tanks around the Alberta prairie for the next 15 years.
But the defence ministry was on sticky terrain in trying to persuade the
Albertans of its considerate nature.
'The preservation of this area for army training has, as is so often the
case with military land, led to it becoming well known as a safe environment
for natural plant and animal life to flourish,' it said.
That message clearly did not impress residents of the Luneburg area, who
cam-
paigned successfully to save the heath from soil erosion, noise and
pollution by cad- mium, lead, mercury and oil.

Visionary Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, is not limiting himself merely to the economic regeneration
of eastern Europe. Besides solving the former Soviet Union's debt problems,
his latest inspiration would simultaneously reduce the nuclear threat to the
world.
According to the first edition of EBRD Watch, a weekly newsletter devoted to
monitoring Attali and his bank, he is mooting a debt-for-nuclear-
warheads-swap. 'I believe my proposal represents a practical way of
providing the republics' relief from their debt and providing the West with
relief from the potential threat of existing warheads,' he says.
Perhaps so. But wouldn't the impact of such debt forgiveness, involving
Dollars 60bn-Dollars 70bn, rather overshadow the effect of the EBRD's own
plans to commit 'Ecu 1bn or more' through loans and equity investments to
eastern Europe this year?

Whatever else he may be remembered for, Northern Ireland secretary Peter

The last before him was agriculture minister Sir Thomas Dugdale, later Lord
Crathorne, in 1954. But unlike Brooke, who has been persuaded by the Prime
Minister to continue in office, Dugdale insisted on going even though the
then premier, Winston Churchill, urged him to stay.
His resignation followed the agriculture ministry's failure to honour an
undertaking to release land requisitioned in wartime at Crichel Down in
Dorset. Dugdale insisted that ministers must accept responsibility for the
actions of their departments even when unaware of detailed decisions made
without their direct knowledge.

Old city hands will find something reassuring about the sight of Joe Barclay
taking over from Allan Tritton as Barclays Bank's number one banker in
Lombard Street. Running the group's City of London business is not as grand
a job as it sounds, but the slot has generally been reserved for a member of
the Barclays founding clans.
That said, the family grip on Britain's biggest bank is nowhere near as
strong as it once was. True, there is another Barclay running East Anglia,
and managing director Andrew Buxton is also well-connected. On the other
hand chairman Sir John Quinton is not a member of the family, and it is by
no means certain that the next chairman will be a member, especially if the
roles of chairman and chief executive are split.
Alan Tritton himself was only 43 when he was appointed to the Barclays main
board 17 years ago. Young Joe is two years older and has far to go before he
gets a boardroom seat . . . if ever.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Leading Article: The way ahead for Poland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS ago Poland summoned up the collective will to make the leap across
the chasm from a state-controlled economy into the free market. It did so
with a lot of external good will, advice, and practical help. Yet today the
faltering progress Poland has made stands as both an example and a warning
for those emerging nations to its east about to undertake the same great
adventure.
Even before the fall of communist regimes throughout the region, individual
Poles travelled the length and breadth of the Soviet empire trading and
building. The entrepreneurial culture was not as enfeebled as in, for
example, Czechoslovakia. This individualistic spirit, linked to the
continuing existence of private farming, made it possible for Poles to fill
their food shops within weeks of embarking on the economic stabilisation
plan in January two years ago. That same spirit enabled the remarkably quick
privatisation of the retail and wholesale system and service sectors, such
as trucking and construction, which are now largely in private hands.
What is proving far more difficult is the privatisation and restructuring of
the real socialist legacy - the thousands of monopoly enterprises tied in to
old technology, but often providing sustenance to entire communities. The
hoped-for supply side response to market price stimuli has not worked under
these circumstances. The problem was made far more acute by the collapse of
the old Comecon, and especially Soviet, market, which many of these
factories were specifically created to serve.
Bad debts
In order to free up resources, many of these enterprises need to be closed.
Instead, they have gone on accumulating losses which have been financed by
collusion with other enterprises in a similar position. But the growing bad
debts of these bankrupt enterprises have deprived the government of its main
source of income and made it impossible to contain the public sector
deficit.
This is serious, not least because the willingness of foreign governments to
write off 50 per cent of Poland's Dollars 33bn official debt and the
disbursement of investment funds from the IMF and World Bank are linked to a
set of performance criteria which Poland has simply not been able to meet.
Fragile base
At the same time, the political unity which was Poland's strength two years
ago has gone. The country's first free democratic elections last October
were fought under an electoral law which resulted, predictably, in a
parliament with 29 political parties. This has proved a fragile base upon
which to build a workable government coalition. Mr Jan Olszewski, a man of
impeccable democratic credentials, whom President Walesa himself wanted as
prime minister a year ago, managed to secure sufficient support in
parliament to form a new government. But he has been undermined by a
president whose own political ambitions sit uncomfortably with Poland's
attempt to create a parliamentary democracy.
This is gravely to Poland's disadvantage. Looking further afield, those
countries which in recent years have successfully reformed economies badly
distorted by statist policies, such as Mexico, Chile and Turkey, have done
so under relatively authoritarian political regimes. This Poland does not
need. What is required is the best democratic alternative: a government with
broad-based support prepared to persist with the unpopular decisions that
must be taken if the sacrifices made thus far are to bear fruit.
Last week, the World Bank indicated its continuing support for the
transformation of Poland's economy. There is, in any case, little
alternative but to carry on with the tasks of stabilisation and
privatisation, both of which have been slowed by recent politicking. The
rapid development of a dynamic private sector, most of it either
export-oriented or service-providing, is the only way for Poland and the
other former communist states to provide alternative employment. It is
foolish to expect governments to be purist in their devotion to economic
adjustment. None the less, they must keep in sight this ultimate economic
goal.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Leaders that have lost their way: The difficulties facing
the three best known Italian companies - Fiat, Pirelli and Olivetti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flag bearers of Italian industry are in trouble. Fiat, Olivetti and
Pirelli, the three best known Italian companies abroad, have ushered in the
new year with a chorus of grim business tidings.
Sales are falling or at best stagnant, and profits have lost all the shine
they displayed during the 1980s boom. In the latest FT 500 ranking of
European companies, published last week, Fiat slipped from 15th place last
year to 53rd, Olivetti from 178th to 375th and Pirelli Spa from 257th to
362nd.
The plight of these three companies epitomises the problems facing Italian
industry as a whole. A recession-hit domestic economy and fierce
international competition have exposed the country's high labour and
financing costs. And unlike in the past, the government is not in a position
to bail its companies out. Numerous key industries now face their biggest
restructuring since the mid-1970s - well after their European rivals in such
sectors as defence, petrochemicals, ship-building, steel and textiles.
'This is now the third year that Italian industry has suffered a loss of
competitiveness due to high fixed costs and labour rigidities,' says Mr
Innocencio Cippoleta, managing director of Confindustria, the Italian
industrialists' confederation. 'We are preparing ourselves for large-scale
redundancies,' says Mr Ottaviano del Turco, assistant-secretary general of
CGIL, the largest union federation.
Undoubtedly, Fiat, Olivetti and Pirelli are victims of wider circumstances.
They, like many other Italian companies, are also paying the price for
failing to invest in new products during the late 1980s; for failing to
strike up suitable international alliances as many companies of comparable
size elsewhere in Europe have done; and for failing to react swiftly enough
to the economic downturn.
Yet there are other reasons why this is a critical moment for all three, and
they have to do with their top management. Fiat and Pirelli are under
increasing pressure to resolve the issue of generational changes in
management and in particular the question of what role their 'ruling'
families - the Agnellis and Pirellis  - should play.
At Fiat, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, is 70, and has designated as heir
his younger brother Umberto, aged 57. But the Agnelli family seems
increasingly absorbed by its private entrepreneurial activities outside the
car sector and outside Italy, highlighted by the spate of recent
acquisitions and strategic alliances in France, notably in food and drinks.
At Pirelli, Mr Leopoldo Pirelli, grandson of the founder, is 66 and is
considered unlikely to hold the reins much longer following the acrimonious
collapse of the company's bid for Continental, the German tyremaker, last
November. Mr Pirelli will almost certainly step down after a decent
interval. At the same time, the family is having to dig into its own pockets
to recapitalise the company.
Management changes are also in the air at Olivetti, where first half losses
last year of L73.7bn (Pounds 34.4m) prompted the return to direct control in
November of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the 57-year-old owner/entrepreneur who
controls 42 per cent of Olivetti stock. Originally brought in from Fiat to
rescue Olivetti in 1978, Mr De Benedetti, a skilled financial engineer, now
faces the far tougher task of proving that he is also an industrial
strategist.
Such difficulties have prompted some Italian commentators to call into
question the future of Italy's unique system of corporate ownership and
control. 'Within 20 years the system of family capitalism will be considered
industrial archaeology,' says Mr Beniamino Andreatta, a former treasury
minister. 'In Italy this system has lasted longer than it should.'
That may be an exaggeration. Some companies that grew up under family
control are faring well: for example is still run by its active founders;
Zanussi, the white goods maker, which has been absorbed by the Swedish
multinational Electrolux; and Ferruzzi-Montedison, which has trimmed its
ambitions after it failed to take control of the petrochemicals joint
venture Enimont 14 months ago.
Even so, prominent economists such as Prof Franco Reviglio, a former finance
minister, say Italian companies are two and three years behind their
international competitors in reacting to the changing world business
climate. Unlike its main European partners, Italy has few large industrial
groups, a limited number of medium-sized industrial ones and a myriad of
small companies, particularly in the north. Less than 20 per cent of all
Italian companies employ more than 500 people, compared to 52 per cent in
Germany and 47 per cent in the UK.
The largest companies have a bigger impact on the Italian economy than even
these figures suggest because of the broad range of their interests. Above
all comes Fiat, the bellwether of the private sector. While car
manufacturing generates more than 80 per cent of turnover, the group's
diversified activities - taking in aerospace, civil engineering, defence,
financial services, leisure, metallurgy and publishing - account for 4 per
cent of Italy's gross domestic product, 10 per cent of total spending on
research and development and 32 per cent of private R and D spending.
Yet the company's core business is under siege. Last year Fiat sold 147,000
fewer cars at home than in 1990 while foreign competitors sold 139,000 more.
The Turin-based group's share of the Italian market, generating two thirds
of sales, has fallen by 15 percentage points to 45 per cent in less than
five years.
For much of last year, a third of Fiat's 300,000 workforce was temporarily
laid off or on short time; another round of large lay-offs is due at the end
of this month. Financial results for 1991, to be published at the end of the
month, are likely to be disappointing; first half profits were almost halved
and in September, Mr Agnelli forecast a difficult 1992.
Fiat's problems relate fundamentally to its car and components business
where it has traditionally relied on a strong local market. A compliant
government has also provided tax incentives for consumers to buy the small
cars on which the group has concentrated. Yet too many of Fiat's models are
considered technically less sophisticated than foreign competition. For
example, Fiat is some two years behind its main competitors in introducing
catalytic converters for exhaust emissions.
Fiat executives are at pains to emphasis their commitment to car production;
L40,000bn, they point out, has been pledged in investment over the next
decade. This includes a government-funded greenfield plant at Melfi in
southern Italy, firm investments in Poland and Algeria and a proposed
project in Russia.
However, these latter investments are politically risky to say the least.
Fiat's plans also do not, in the eyes of many observers, take sufficient
account of the biggest challenge facing the European car industry: the
increasingly powerful presence of Japanese manufacturers. Scarcely a week
goes by without some rumour of a Fiat tie-up with the Japanese. But it is
doubtful such an alliance would prove politically acceptable.
A strategic alliance with the Japanese - following the example of Fujitsu's
link up with British computer maker ICL - is one option for Mr De Benedetti
as he considers how best to reverse the slump in Olivetti's fortunes. But
this, too, would provoke a political storm in Rome and Brussels - Olivetti
is one of Italy's three largest industrial groups in terms of market
capitalisation and the fourth largest information technology (IT) group in
Europe.
Olivetti's computers and office equipment business has been badly hit by the
worldwide saturation in this market. First half losses in 1991 totalled
L73.7bn with the prospect of full-year losses of about L200bn. Industry
analysts say Olivetti is paying the price for not investing enough in R &amp; D
and for failing to develop the software end of its business.
Mr De Benedetti is searching for a partner to help him complement the
company's traditional strengths in computer hardware by developing a
software business, but so far without success. Last autumn IRI, the Italian
state holding company, rejected his offer of a merger of Olivetti's software
interests and Finsiel, IRI's software and IT arm.
The choice facing Olivetti is clear: it can either form a strategic alliance
in which it would almost certainly be the junior partner - talks are now
being held with France's Cap Gemini, the French IT group - or it must accept
that to stay independent, it needs to operate on a reduced scale.
Last year Olivetti cut its worldwide workforce by more than 6,000 to 47,000;
management told unions this month that it wants to cut another 2,500 jobs on
top of the 3,000 cut last year in Italy as operations are slimmed down or
transferred to cheaper production sites in Mexico and Singapore, where costs
are one tenth those in Italy. Last week unions at Olivetti began a series of
stoppages, underlining the fact that forcing redundancies is more costly and
complex in Italy than elsewhere in Europe.
As for Pirelli, the family-run cables and tyre business and one of the most
revered names in Italian industry, it is licking its wounds after its
long-running bid to take over German tyre maker Continental collapsed in
November. The bid was badly handled and Pirelli incurred large costs in the
process, which - including indemnities to allies  - are likely to amount to
some L340bn of the group's L670bn forecast losses for the current financial
year. One prominent casualty may be Mr Leopoldo Pirelli, the chairman, who
is expected to be replaced soon. Pirelli's failed bid ended, temporarily at
least, its ambitious plans to create a European rival to France's Michelin,
the world's biggest tyre producer.
Adjusting to its reduced circumstances is already proving costly: last week
Pirelli announced it would cut 5,000 jobs from its cable and tyre activities
and sell off non-core business. 'We are going to put on the market all that
is not cables and tyres, dozens of companies employing 13,200 and with a
turnover of L1,780bn,' Mr Pirelli said in December.
The big names of Italian industry have, of course, faced troubled times
before. In one important respect, however, this time may be different: the
government, burdened by a huge public sector deficit, is talking about
privatisation rather than increasing its presence in the economy.
In the past industrialists relied on the state to buy out loss-making
operations, provide investment funds and help with redundancy payments. Weak
government and lax rules worked in their favour. But with the public sector
deficit now totalling 10.5 per cent of GDP, and the government under
mounting pressure in the EC to reduce it, the treasury can no longer afford
to spend freely - even in this election year. Indeed, for the first time in
the post-war period, Italian industrialists find themselves trading
accusations of blame with the politicians for the state of the economy and
their own plight.
Mr De Benedetti recently gave forth a litany of complaints: he bemoaned the
poor quality of Italy's public services; the paltry amount spent by both
private and public sectors on R &amp; D - currently 1.3 per cent of GDP, half
that of its EC competitors; the faltering growth of Italian exports - up 12
per cent in the last three years when the economies Italy exports to had
grown by 23 per cent; and the restricted nature of Italy's capital markets -
more limited in scope, he said, than those in Madrid.
So long as Italian industrialists have to contend with the the
inefficiencies of the economic system - including woefully inefficient
public services - and the complexities of party politics, they will remain
at a serious disadvantage to their main international competitors. It is
precisely these problems which also deter international investors from
forging strategic alliances with the Italians. However, in an election year,
a radical shake-up is just what Italian politicians seem most unlikely to
deliver.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Continental hostile bids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTESTED cross-border takeover bid has arrived in continental Europe;
as witness yesterday's attempt by Nestle and Suez to carry off Perrier in
the teeth of Agnelli family rivalry. It is not the first such attempt: the
contest between Suez and Mr Carlo De Benedetti at the height of the 1980s
takeover boom for control of Societe Generale de Belgique probably has that
honour. But continental companies must now treat the possibility of
unwelcome overtures as a fact of life.
These may not be officially described as hostile takeover bids; they may be
attempts to coerce the victim into an ostensibly 'friendly' merger, as in
Pirelli's pass at the Continental tyre group and Krupp's moves on Hoesch.
However described, they indicate that a new process of corporate control is
at work.
It would be wrong to see this mainly as a triumph of the practices of the UK
and the US. Instead, it is more accurate to see the emerging way of business
as combining Anglo-Saxon opportunism with the complex capital structures,
relaxed regulation, and intimate relationships traditional in continental
economies.
On the face of it, this new mix looks more 'modern' than the old, more in
tune with the doctrine of economic liberalism encouraged by the European
Community's single market programme. As such, there are aspects of the new
approach that deserve a whole-hearted welcome; but there are also dangers in
attempting to combine takeover habits derived from one industrial culture
with the structures and attitudes inherited from another.
Equitable treatment
One good thing about the new era of contested takeovers is a greater
attention paid to equitable treatment of shareholders. France's takeover
rules, introduced two years ago, have made the Agnellis' attempt to control
Perrier a more visible, less effortless one; they may yet lead to a
transaction that treats all Perrier's shareholders equally, something that
would previously have been regarded as a laughable Anglo-Saxon eccentricity.
There is further to go in this direction, and many markets lag behind. But
in France at least, the first, vital steps have been taken.
The new era also brings market discipline to bear on companies that have
previously proved impervious - because of size or significance  - to the
traditional bank or government systems of corporate control. Societe
Generale de Belgique is reforming itself more briskly under Suez's guidance
than it ever would if left to its own devices - even if Mr De Benedetti
might have proved a yet more exacting task-master.
Existing powers
So much for the benefits of the new approach. The dangers stem from the fact
that though finance ministers and bourse authorities increasingly speak the
language of economic liberalism, other participants - rival ministers, top
bankers, captains of industry - often wish to preserve the dominance of the
existing powers, including, in some countries, the state. The risk is that
the new, more open takeover mechanisms may simply become a tool to defend
the privileged position of the banks in Germany, the state in France, or the
politician-family nexus in Italy.
Thus, Continental's defence against Pirelli combined the trappings of an
Anglo-Saxon takeover battle with old-fashioned appeals to the loyalty of
German industry. Krupp is trying to take over Hoesch at least in part
because it fears that otherwise British Steel might gain a foothold in the
German market. French state-owned banks and insurance companies are taking
ever-wider stakes in private industry, and play the takeover game as avidly
as their private-sector rivals.
Unfriendly bids must therefore be judged not just by the nature of the
battle, but by the extent to which they avoid all types of abusive
behaviour, whether towards shareholders, competitors or consumers. More open
contests for corporate control require that equitable takeover rules go hand
in hand with strong European and national competition policy. The Perrier
case provides an opportunity to demonstrate both.

BBC2's foreign affairs series Assignment (7.45) begins a new run with a
programme about this year's presidential election in the US. Cameras have
been following the main Democrat contenders for the past six months and
Gavin Esler (an excellent reporter on 'Newsnight') assesses their prospects.
Channel 4 screens the third and last part of Brother Felix And The Virgin
Saint, an account of 15th century tourism which has so far proved not only
informative but charming, funny, and sometimes - as in last week's Rules for
Pilgrims (Don't paint your coat of arms on monuments) - astonishing. This
week Brother Felix achieves his life's ambition and reaches the bones of St
Catherine (8.00).
40 Minutes (9.50 BBC2) takes a look at 'real men'. The irony about this
movement in the US (where else) is that it is so obviously a product of the
age of feminism. What do real men do? They hug one another, howl, get in
touch with their childhood selves ..in fact they seem to behave awfully like
feminists, yet we are told this is all a reaction against feminism. Hmm.
Omnibus (10.55 BBC1) tries to decide whether London is a city in crisis.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Arts: Sympathies with the Soviet - A look at the current
exhibition at MOMA, Oxford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Museum of Modern Art at Oxford to call its latest exhibition,
Engineers of the Human Soul, is to pitch it a shade too strong. It may catch
the eye, but it can hardly be held to signal a unique and isolated
phenomenon. What, after all, do we imagine religious art, or any official or
publicly commissioned art, was trying to do in every age? This does not make
this exhibition any the less interesting or worthwhile: only the more
particular.
The subtitle, 'Soviet Socialist Realist Painting 1930-1970', supplies the
particular gloss. Here are characteristic examples of the art that was
officially acceptable in the Soviet Union, from the time that Josef Stalin
first imposed his dreadful rule, continuing on through the comparative thaw
in official attitudes in the years following his death, and so on into the
early years of Brezhnev's regime.
But even so, what we have is not altogether what we might have expected.
There are indeed some odd and awful things, dire enough to fuel any
prejudice: the usual hagiographies of Lenin and Stalin; the workers in field
and factory happy in the service of the workers' state; the image of
parenthood as public duty; and the lovers who stride out so confident into
the socialist future. Most sinister of all we have Grigori Shegal's 'Leader,
Teacher, Friend' of 1937, a modestly smiling Stalin slipping quietly onto
the podium behind the speaker, at the very time of the show trials and the
greatest terror.
But even here we must be careful to distinguish between the form and the
content, and face the awkward truth that the most dreadful lies and blackest
politics may be propagated rather well. Some of the works are frankly bad,
'They are writing about us in Pravda', as it were picnic-time on the
collective farm, is as crude and mawkish in execution as in sentiment. If
mockery is what one enjoys, there is plenty to mock. The truth is, however,
that even that sinister Stalin is done - within its terms  - with creditably
competent panache. Vruir Mosesov's somewhat later and larger composition of
Stalin leading a demonstration in 1912 (1949) is technically as sound a
history painting as we might have had from any Salon or Academy of the 19th
century. Intense and alien though her actual commitment may seem to us,
Vyacheslav Mariupolski's 'Young Leader of the Pioneers' (1949), reading out
her lecture with all the seriousness of youth, is as well observed, well
executed and touching an image of a girl as any from more politically
acceptable a hand, as though Millais had lived on to paint a Girl Guide in
her best uniform.
It is not quite that it is old-fashioned, but there attaches to so much of
the work a decided flavour of the past, yet still active and vigorous. This
is especially true of the greater portion of the work that is political,
that is to say socialist, only in the broadest sense. Much of the work on
show dates, in any case, from the 1950s and the milder, post-Stalinist
cultural climate. None of these artists were dissident: all accepted the
constraints imposed through their union, most of them never knowing any
other dispensation. No matter that they had no choice: the fact is that, cut
off from the later developments of modernism, they remained active within
the broader encompassing realism of the western tradition, extending through
a generalised post-impressionism to incipient expressionism.
So it is that with 'Pushkin meeting Kyukhelbeker' by Aleksei Merzlyakov
(1957), we have something neither more nor less histrionic than, shall we
say, Lady Butler's Crimean 'Roll Call', or any other romantic Victorian
reworking of history. 'The Gingerbread Arcade' by Vladimir Stozharov (1956)
carries no historic nor political charge at all, but is simply a painting of
a provincial market-place in muddy mid-winter that we might take as easily
as by one of the masters of the Hague School, or a Scottish social realist
of the 1870s and '80s.
Mai Dantsig's girl hanging out the washing in the sun (1965) and Aleksei and
Sergei Tkachev's 'Postgirl' (1951) are vigorous and engaging examples of
academic post-impressionism. Eduard Bragoviski's woman by the river,
'Logging on the Vetluga' (1964), she foursquare in her scarlet coat against
the red landscape, is far more honest and straight-forward a composition
than anything of our western neo-expressionism of the 1980s. (It is just
such stuff, straight-forward, well-crafted, variously academic in the best
sense and for the most part quietly apolitical, that Roy Miles has been
bringing onto the London market at his Bruton Street Gallery, and his latest
show is no exception.)
But even were it to be overtly political, there is not necessarily a
problem. Our luck has been that no significant art came out of Nazi Germany,
and it has too-long been fashionable to laugh socialist realism out of
court, similarly high-minded and utopian propaganda as it is. The virtue of
this serious and fascinating loan exhibition at Oxford (30 Pembroke Street,
until March 15: supported by Visiting Arts and what was the Artists' Union
of the Soviet Union) is that it makes us address ourselves to a central
feature of our own art in the 20th century.
What, really, is the difference in principle between Ekaterina Zernova's
'Tank-driver Kuznetsov' (1933) and a portrait by Eric Kennington of a
British Airman of the Second World War: what between the furnaces of the
Stalin Factory by Mikhail Kostin (1949) and Stanley Spencer's paintings of
the war-time ship-builders on the Clyde, or Laura Knight's 'Ruby Loftus
screwing a breech-ring'? Can it be that what is bare-faced propaganda to one
side is no more than cheer and encouragement to the other in difficult
times? The moral dilemma remains, but it is only fair to admit as much when
it is well done.

SHADOWPLAY by Donna Perlmutter Viking Pounds 17.99, 420 pages
Antony Tudor was one of the most significant choreographers of our century.
He gave ballet its first clear awareness of psychology, showing how it might
probe personality, and expose the essence of character. His reputation rests
upon a handful of works created in the decade 1936-1945; with Jardin aux
lilas, Dark Elegies, Pillar of Fire, a one-act Romeo and Juliet and
Undertow, his place in dance history is secure. In these ballets Tudor
explored human feeling through movement of extreme precision. The anguish in
Jardin, the exquisite sweep of Romeo, the sexual urgency in Pillar of Fire,
are as potent today as when they were first seen, and Dark Elegies, made in
1937 as a realisation of Mahler's Kindertotenlieder must still pierce an
audience's heart while our civilisation sacrifices children to war and
natural disaster.
For a man so compassionate in his creations, Tudor was notoriously prickly,
difficult in his relationships with dancers and collaborators. His
affections were tenacious, but his tongue could be ungenerous in dealing
with the often insecure psyches of dancers. Telling them the truth - his
truth  - for their own good did not so much brace them as appear a bitter
response to a need for help.
Tudor's life must seem in many aspects that of a disappointed man. A
self-created figure, he was transformed from William Cook, son of a butcher
in Central Street, London EC1 and destined for the meat trade, into Antony
Tudor, apprentice dancer at Marie Rambert's studio in 1928, and thence,
thanks to Rambert's goadings and encouragement, into a choreographer of
profound originality. There may have been difficulties in making his work
known - it was hardly in keeping with an audience taste nurtured on Ballets
Russes glamour or Vic-Wells classicism - but Tudor had devoted associates,
notably the elegant, expressive Maude Lloyd; Peggy van Praagh; and the
dancer Hugh Laing, who was his companion for more than 50 years. By the mid
1930s Tudor was making great things.
In 1939 Tudor and Laing went to the US to join the newly-founded Ballet
Theatre. For this company Tudor produced masterpieces - Nora Kaye his muse
for Pillar of Fire, and Alicia Markova an exquisite Juliet in Romeo, with
Laing a crucial figure in these, as in Undertow, which explored a murderer's
psyche.
Then the well-spring of inspiration seemed to dry. Brief sorties to New York
City Ballet and to Sweden were neither fruitful nor happy. Ballets failed,
and by the 1950s Tudor devoted himself increasingly to teaching in New York.
Zen Buddhism seemed to bring further discipline to an already austere
temperament, but there came an upsurge of creativity when Tudor returned to
England for two visits to work with the Royal Ballet. He staged Shadowplay
for Anthony Dowell at Covent Garden in 1967, and in the following year made
Knight Errant for David Wall with the Royal Ballet's touring section. Two
last works were made in 1975 and 1978 for American Ballet Theatre. Tudor
died in 1987 at the age of 79, and a year later Laing, too, died.
Such a man, and such a career, merits serious and searching biography, and
now that need is the more urgent in the light of Donna Perlmutter's nugatory
life of Antony Tudor. It is difficult to know how to qualify this vulgarly
written exercise save as one of those books that demand to be thrown across
the room in fury at their stupefying awfulness. I gather from the
dust-jacket that Miss Perlmutter is a Los Angeles journalist. Her prose
style contrives to be arch, strident, and given to a fearful sprightliness,
as if afraid that readers might not otherwise reach the end of a sentence.
That Miss Perlmutter has a taste for neologisms - 'policymeisters',
'spitework', 'dancewright', Tudor the 'interiorscape' and
'characterological' are a few choice specimens - is an incidental deterrent
to her text. That she has subjected Tudor's work and his relationships to
reach-me-down psycho-analysis is an abiding annoyance.
As page succeeded hectic page, I gained an impression that Miss Perlmutter
has failed to understand the nature of Tudor's ballets, or has much
familiarity with the fabric of dance history. She believes that Tudor
'plucked' Anthony Dowell 'from the corps de ballet' for Shadowplay, ignorant
of the fact that he was already a principal of the Royal Ballet. And to aver
that Tudor cast the ballet with 'sensitive nobodies' may intrigue Dowell,
Merle Park and Derek Rencher, the eminent and well-established principals of
the first performance. She believes that Markova was a guest artist with
Ballet Theatre at the time of the creation of Romeo. Dame Alicia's memoirs
provide a different and more reliable account of the staging of a very
beautiful ballet.
Miss Perlmutter's view is that biography is means of re-hashing in lurid
terms the stormier scenes of her subject's life. In the process, Tudor's art
and genius are cheapened. Miss Perlmutter fails in matter of research by
glossing over his Swedish visits, and certain other foreign journeyings, and
fails even more significantly in her assessments of his creations. She
prefers, instead, gossip and amateurish analysis, and the resultant portrait
is as foolishly hectic as any back-stage chatter.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Quick word with the
neighbours pays off - Business expansion scheme / The option is still open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Strangled by Inland Revenue regulations to prevent tax evasion and hijacked
by the introduction of special privileges for rented housing, does the
Business Expansion Scheme (BES) have any role still to play in financing
small businesses?
The history of the BES as a programme for promoting enterprise has not been
a happy one. It has raised more than Pounds 1.5bn since it was launched in
1983 but much of this money has gone into low-risk, asset-backed ventures,
far removed from the entrepreneurial businesses first envisaged.
The BES allows investors to claim income tax relief on equity investments of
up to Pounds 40,000 a year in unquoted companies while investors are also
exempt from capital gains. In return, the companies in which they invest
must conform to strict rules governing the sorts of activity they carry out
(no commodities dealing or banking), their geographical spread (mainly in
the UK) and the composition of assets (not too much land and buildings).
The introduction in 1988 of a two-tier system under which companies
providing homes to let under assured tenancy agreements could raise up to
Pounds 5m while other 'trading' companies could raise only Pounds 500,000 -
since increased to Pounds 750,000  - tilted the scales still further away
from the entrepreneurial small business.
But wait. The BES may be down but it is certainly not out. Some small
companies are managing to steer between the rocks of regulation to raise
useful amounts of finance, while allowing their investors to enjoy the BES
tax breaks.
The Oxford Toy Company, a two-year-old company with projected sales of
Pounds 50,000, raised Pounds 31,200 from BES investors - friends and
neighbours of its two founders in Wallingford, Oxfordshire - to finance the
manufacture of its Quickword board game.
Hannah McDonald, who set up the company with her husband Stuart, says she
read up the rules for raising BES finance in the Inland Revenue's BES
leaflet, IR 51. A 10-minute telephone conversation with the company's
auditor filled in the remaining gaps.
Writing a brief for investors was easier than filling in a tax form,' says
McDonald, a former fund manager. The local tax office gave its approval for
the BES fund-raising in five days and Oxford Toy raised the money it needed
within three weeks for a cost of just Pounds 86.
One of the investors, Martin Vaughan, a consultant with Unipart, a car parts
group, was invited on to the board. Vaughan says he had no previous
experience of the BES though he does own shares in three quoted companies.
Vaughan says he had been asked, as a neighbour, to test the board game and
he was impressed by the enthusiasm and ingenuity of the McDonalds. 'My wife
and I thought it was worth a bit of a gamble,' he says. Shareholders are
kept in touch with a quarterly newsletter and several have offered their
garages to store stocks of games.
But if Oxford Toy found it surprisingly easy to find its way through the
thicket of regulations which surround the BES, The Whole Thing, a 'green'
mail order company based in Kendal, Cumbria, fell victim to the rules.
The Whole Thing attempted to raise Pounds 500,000 last year but ran into a
problem with two large investors who would have owned more than 30 per cent
of the company. This led to 'the surreal situation of having to go to the
the City Takeover Panel', recalls William Pryor, managing director. The six
months delay forced the company into liquidation, though the business has
since been resurrected as The Green Catalogue with projected first year
sales of Pounds 500,000.
'People can slip up over the simplest things and lose their BES status,'
warns Mavis Seymour, BES tax consultant at accountants Stoy Hayward. One
investor realised that he was not allowed to become a paid director of the
company but he announced his intention of billing it for some work he
planned to do. This would also be seen as 'receiving value' from the company
and led to him forfeiting his tax relief.
Most BES fund-raisings are small, private deals similar to that arranged by
Oxford Toy, says Seymour. In terms of the money raised, however, most comes
through the more formal prospectus issues backed by a BES specialist
issuing-house.
Prospectus issues enjoy two main benefits: they have been prepared by a
specialist so should avoid the pitfalls which can trap the inexperienced.
They can also make use of the sponsor's database of clients known to be
interested in BES issues.
Derek Miles, an inventor, attempted to raise BES finance for The Contented
Cook, a company set up develop a range of products based on an innovative
cooking pot. Miles wrote his own document and arranged for copies to be sent
out by a local financial consultant in Sidmouth, Devon. Miles raised just
Pounds 6,000 of the Pounds 25,000 he was seeking and now says he would have
been better to produce a proper prospectus for wider circulation.
The problem with prospectus issues is that any company not involved in
providing assured tenancy housing has to compete with the property schemes.
Since property companies can raise larger sums of money, their costs of
fund-raising are relatively lower. This helps to explain why trading
companies accounted for just Pounds 12m of the Pounds 256m raised by public
BES offers in 1990-91.
'You cannot let the costs go above 10 per cent of the amount you are
raising,' says David Royds, a director of Matrix Securities, a BES sponsor.
'But there is invariably more work in raising money for a trading company.'
One way to reduce the cost of producing and distributing a prospectus is to
put several companies in the same document. Neill Clerk &amp; Plant Hill, a
Glasgow-based firm of solicitors is currently working on a combined
prospectus for three different companies. This can bring the cost of a
typical fund-raising down from Pounds 35,000-Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 15,000,
says Ross Macdonald, a partner.
An alternative way of reducing costs and boosting the amount of finance
which can be raised is to create separate companies each owning one of a
chain of, say, hotels or retail outlets.
If a company believes it can raise the finance it needs from a fairly small
circle of investors, it may opt to prepare a memorandum. This need not
contain as much detail as a full prospectus but may only be distributed to a
restricted number of people, usually taken to mean up to 40 people.
A fourth method of raising BES finance is for a company to approach a BES
fund. But investors have shunned funds, preferring to invest directly. For
all the complications that surround raising BES finance, it remains popular
with many companies. Neill Clerk says it receives three approaches a week
from companies seeking BES finance while Matrix Securities claims to be
'inundated' with requests for finance. Many companies are keen to attract
investors they believe will be less demanding than professional venture
capitalists.
The BES Association, representing sponsors and others in the industry, is
calling for changes to the BES in the forthcoming budget to promote
investments in smaller and riskier companies. It is clear that there is a
continuing need for the BES and that it is failing to serve its original
purpose.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Cutting down on hot air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The owners of one large London office building reduced their gas consumption
by two-thirds over a three year period when they modernised their energy
management system.
Many businesses could make similar savings if they improved the quality of
their energy controls, according to a new handbook.*
Quadrant House, headquarters of the Reed Publishing Group, was a
speculative, air-conditioned office building, completed in 1980. Impressive
savings in energy use and costs were achieved after energy management was
contracted out to Matthew Hall. Under the arrangement, the contractor could
invest its own time and money to make savings and share the benefits with
the client.
Gas consumption was reduced by better control of the central air handling
plant and by eliminating the inefficient use of central boilers in summer by
installing point-of-use heating of hot water for catering and washrooms.
Just before the start of the contract in 1987, automatic lighting controls
were fitted in the building and the banks of switches in corridors were
replaced by local switches in each office. The improved plant and lighting
management cut electricity use by 15 per cent, in spite of increased use of
office equipment and the move to electric hot water heating in summer.
Managements should start by questioning their own energy use and policies,
the guide suggests. What is the cost of energy used in their offices? How
does it compare with other similar buildings? When was energy use last
surveyed? And has management implemented any efficiency measures?
Technical assistance is available from a range of organisations providing
energy consultancy and contract energy management.

More than half of business customers may be paying incorrect interest
charges to their bank, according to a survey carried out by Phoenix Finance
Management, a Northampton-based supplier of computer software.
Phoenix surveyed customers who had bought its Bankchek program, which checks
to see if interest is being properly calculated, and found that 67 out of
116 respondents had discovered discrepancies.
Eleven had received refunds, usually accompanied by explanations and
apologies, while 30 others were challenging their banks.
Some businessmen and women found a new bank manager was unaware of verbal
agreements reached with a predecessor and then imposed a higher rate which
went undetected for months or even years.
Often customers were unaware of the penalty rates of interest which applied
when an overdraft limit was exceeded.

the British Franchise Association (BFA) and National Westminster Bank.
A total of 189,500 people are now employed in the franchise sector, the
survey found. But combined sales in the year ended June 1991 fell from
Pounds 5.2bn in 1990 to Pounds 4.8bn.
The number of franchised outlets rose from 18,260 to 18,600 and franchisors
expect the number to double by 1996. The number of franchise systems
available rose by 14 per cent from 379 to 432.
The failure rate of franchised businesses rose from 5.7 per cent a year to
7.2 per cent but was still below that of non-franchised businesses, the

FT  21 JAN 92 / Management (In A Nutshell): Venture capital famine forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small firms may be starved of venture capital finance when the economy
starts to recover following a sharp fall in the amounts of venture capital
raised in 1991, Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures (F&amp;C), a development capital
fund, has warned.
Independent UK venture capital firms raised only Pounds 400m in new funds
last year, less than half the Pounds 850m raised in 1990 and well below the
Pounds 1.7bn figure the year before that, according to estimates by F&amp;C and
Venture Economics, an industry research group.
Independent venture capital firms have had difficulties raising finance in
the past year because of the poor performance of many of the funds raised
during the 1980s. But the independents account for only part of the venture
capital market and the F&amp;C figures exclude 3i, the largest venture capital
firm, and the 'captive' funds belonging to the banks and other financial
institutions.
The amounts invested by independent venture capitalists also fell last year,
though less sharply, F&amp;C estimated. Investments were Pounds 900m in about
600 companies compared with Pounds 951m put into 618 companies in 1990 and
Pounds 1.2bn into 574 companies the year before that.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Technology: It's all in the genes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gene therapy in the UK received approval last week from a government
committee chaired by Sir Cecil Clothier, a distinguished lawyer.
The procedure, pioneered in the US, involves correcting genetic defects by
adding new genes to the cells where they are needed. It is expected to be a
more effective and longer-lasting treatment than conventional drugs which
merely alleviate some of the symptoms.
Several research groups in the UK are preparing trials of gene therapy for
diseases including cancer and thalassaemia (a severe blood disorder) as well
as cystic fibrosis. Most patients are likely to be children.
The first gene therapy patient was a four-year-old American girl suffering
from a rare inherited disorder of the immune system. The treatment in
September 1990 has brought about a dramatic improvement in her condition.
Since then, half a dozen other gene therapy studies have started in the US.
The treatment approved by the Clothier committee is 'somatic gene therapy'.
It corrects the defect by adding new genes to certain cells - for example in
the lungs or bone marrow - but the genetic change is not passed on to the
patient's offspring.
The committee decided that on moral and ethical grounds this type of gene
therapy is not fundamentally different from other advanced medical
procedures such as organ transplants or blood transfusion.
In contrast 'germ line gene therapy', which would affect future generations,
is generally regarded today as medically unpredictable and ethically
unacceptable. It is unlikely to be approved anywhere in the world, at least
for a few years.
A procedure equivalent to germ line therapy is now used to make 'transgenic'
animals - for example sheep which produce valuable human proteins in their
milk - by inserting genes into newly fertilised embryos. But, as the
Clothier report points out, 'little is known about the possible consequences
and hazards (of human germ line therapy) and any harm to future generations
would take a long time to discover and deal with.'
Even somatic gene therapy has possible dangers, but these would only affect
the individual patient. The present technology, which uses disabled viruses
to carry new genes into human cells, inserts the DNA almost at random. There
is therefore a risk that it could cause a new mutation by disrupting some
other gene or its means of control - possibly even switching on a dormant
cancer-causing gene.
However, in comparison with the severity of the inherited diseases they are
intended to treat, the risks of gene therapy are generally thought to be
acceptable. After publishing the Clothier report, the Department of Health
said there would be a four-month consultation period before the government
decides on permanent arrangements for regulating gene therapy. Any proposals
for UK gene therapy trials made before then will be considered by Sir
Cecil's Committee on the Ethics of Gene Therapy.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Technology: Breathing easier about new cures - Gene therapy
offers the most promising method of treating cystic fibrosis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELISABETH TACEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine trying to clear your throat of a mucus so thick that researchers
have to cut it with a razor blade for their experiments.
That is daily life for 30,000 Americans and 25,000 Europeans suffering from
cystic fibrosis, the most common genetic disease among Caucasians.
It is likely to kill most of those people before they are 30, yet by the end
of the century this fatal disease may be curable. If so, it will provide an
outstanding success story for biotechnology and genetic medicine.
Ten years of worldwide genetic investigation reached a climax in 1989 when
researchers at the universities of Toronto and Michigan isolated and worked
out the structure of the gene which causes the disease. It turned out to be
a code for a protein known as cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR)
which is involved in carrying chloride ions across the cell membrane.
Scientists then managed to correct the defect in test-tube cell cultures.
This month the journal Cell reported another breakthrough: the National
Institutes of Health in the US had successfully treated rats with cystic
fibrosis by getting the gene into the lungs using a virus to carry it.
Genzyme, the Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, is working on a cure
for cystic fibrosis. It claims to be the first to have built the entire DNA
sequence responsible for directing the protein's production in cells and in
inducing genetically-engineered cells to form the protein.
Gene therapy appears the most promising treatment in the long run, since it
would be permanent. However, Alan Smith of Genzyme says that the one-off
gene replacement operation is 'way, way off'.
Getting the correct gene to the lung site is a difficult job. Francis
Collins at the University of Michigan said on reporting the test-tube
experiments: 'Safe and effective delivery of the gene to a large proportion
of lung cells is the big question now.'
The human DNA has to be fitted into the DNA of a virus made harmless by
genetic engineering, then the virus targeted at the correct cell where it
can copy the human DNA.
However Robert Beall of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, who also leads the
research programme at the NIH, claims to have solved some of the problems.
His team treated rats with cystic fibrosis using an inhalation technique to
get the virus carrying the correct gene into the lung.
The next step is to try the technique on monkeys, with human trials to
follow if monkey treatment is successful. Smith points out that such therapy
as changing a person's genetic material will only be done once the science
has been fully worked out.
As an interim treatment, Genzyme is developing drugs to stop the defective
gene working. Patients would be given these together with the correct CFTR
protein.
Smith reckons that the mutant protein does not fold properly, so it gets
stuck in the cell and broken down there. The problem seems to be caused by
the deletion of one amino acid of the 460 that form the protein. His team is
working on making the protein using transgenic goats, in which the human
CFTR gene is inserted. The protein is released in the animals' milk in
greater quantities than could be achieved in a laboratory.
The next step, he says, is to find out how to get the protein to the
affected sites - which will mean reconstituting it in the lungs, as the body
will break it down elsewhere.
Meanwhile in California Genentech, the US's largest biotechnology company,
has developed a treatment with the more immediate aim of easing the
breathing problems of sufferers whose air passages get blocked by mucus.
Steve Shak, director of immunobiology at Genentech, was struck by reports
from the 1960s of 'extraordinary amounts' of DNA being found in the mucus of
cystic fibrosis suffers, which made it so thick. The researchers found that
a bovine DNase, an enzyme in cows that breaks down DNA, There had even been
uncontrolled experiments on cystic fibrosis patients that showed that the
bovine enzyme thinned the mucus but that some sufferers reacted against the
foreign protein. Shak explains that the work had not been followed up:
'Mucus secretions are not a topic of great scientific investigation'.
Two years of recombinant DNA work led to the isolation of human DNase. Shak
then got some mucus from acute cystic fibrosis sufferers and, having had to
cut it with the razor-blade to get it into test-tubes, found that after 15
minutes mixing with DNase, it 'flowed freely'.
Clinical trials of DNase began in the US last June and final trials began
this month, with approval for sale expected next year. 'We know that DNase
is not likely to be a cure,' says Shak. 'It's likely to be used with other
therapies under development.'
He stresses the part that biotechnology played in its development. 'There is
no way of solving this problem (of thick mucus) other than by recombinant
DNA methods.'
The Genzyme and Genentech treatments are likely to be approved as 'orphan'
drugs, which target diseases afflicting less than 200,000 people in the US.
Orphan drug makers receive tax benefits and a seven-year monopoly on the
drug once it comes to market.

FT  21 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Councils may face challenge over
sick-pay schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL government employers will almost certainly have to introduce sick-pay
schemes for the large number of mainly female, part-time workers earning
less than Pounds 52 a week, as a result of European Community equal pay
legislation.
Mr Stephen Bubb, assistant secretary of the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities, said yesterday that the AMA is concerned that it may not be
treating part-time workers fairly and that it may also be falling foul of EC
legislation.
Almost 70 per cent of the 800,000 local government manual workers are
part-timers and a large number of them fall below Pounds 52 a week. Having
to provide sick-pay for several hundred thousand workers who were previously
excluded could significantly increase pay bills.
Mr Bubb said it was difficult to quantify how many workers would be affected
by an extension of sick-pay schemes but the equality audit being conducted
by employers and unions would probably provide an answer.
The exclusion of part-time workers from sick-pay and other benefits is
likely to be a main theme of this year's local government manual worker
negotiations.
A local government employers' consultation paper, to be distributed this
week, says that the manual workers' interest is likely to shift to equality
issues in this year's negotiations. 'They can be expected in particular to
pursue the position of part-timers' conditions of service,' says the paper.
It continues: 'Already there are indications of concerted union efforts,
through industrial tribunal references, to have the national agreement's
effective exclusion from occupational sick-pay of part-time manual workers
earning less than Pounds 52 a week declared illegal'.
Underlining that point the National Union of Public Employees yesterday
launched a test case at Leeds Industrial Tribunal on behalf of 1,000 school
meals staff employed by North Yorkshire County Council.
Nupe said that following competitive tendering of the school meals service
the council dismissed all its staff and offered them back their jobs on
lower rates of pay, reduced holidays and little or no sick-pay. Nupe is
challenging the action under British and European equal pay laws.
The unions said that the women had been treated differently from groups of
male workers, such as Highways Maintenance, who were also subject to
competitive tendering laws.
Union leaders at Ford New Holland, the tractor maker owned by Ford and Fiat,
will meet this morning to consider whether to order industrial action after
the company said it would not increase a three-year pay deal including a 4
per cent rise in the first year from last November. It warned management
yesterday of the possibility of one or two-day strikes.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Household rubbish recycling 'limited'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECYCLING HOUSEHOLD refuse is considered important by most people, according
to a survey on recycling published yesterday. But 64 per cent of those
questioned said they put all their rubbish into the dustbin rather than
arrange for any of it to be recycled.
Compilers of the survey, published by Mintel, the research group, questioned
1,000 adults throughout the UK in May and August last year. They find that
94 per cent of respondents considered recycling important for the
environment.
Household waste forms just 21m tonnes, or 3 per cent, of the UK's annual
700m tonnes of rubbish. The typical household disposes of some 650kg of
glass, paper, ferrous metal and waste food each year. The government has
fixed a target for councils of recycling 25 per cent of all household waste
by the year 2000.
However, according to Mintel, few councils have yet completed their waste
recycling plans, which must be presented to the Department of the
Environment by August. Between 3 per cent of 5 per cent of all waste comes
from households, and Mintel believes that at least 42 per cent of the
household share could be recycled. As available landfill space runs out,
pressure will build for legislation to compel more recycling, the survey
says. Mintel estimates after questioning councils that the capacity of
existing landfill sites will be exhausted within about 11 years.
Britain rates low on a Europe-wide recycling league table, according to Mr
John Cunningham, Mintel's chief executive. Only 19 per cent of Britain's
household glass is recycled, placing the UK 11th out of 13 European
countries surveyed.
Mintel said yesterday that the report had been printed on recycled paper.
But as that cost 50 per cent more than virgin paper the exercise might not
be repeated. Mr Tony Baldry, junior environment minister, yesterday
announced final details of a scheme in which local authorities will make
payments to recycling groups and companies based on the amount they collect
for recycling.
The new scheme of payments, known as recycling credits, will start on April
1.

FT  21 JAN 92 / ITV teletext tender attracts five bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE consortia yesterday delivered sealed bids to the Independent Television
Commission for a new 10-year public teletext licence.
Oracle, the existing service run as a subsidiary of the ITV companies, was
challenged by:
Intelfax and Carlton Communications.
Teletext UK, a consortium led by Media Ventures International.
TV-am Cable Television, a subsidiary of the breakfast television company
that lost its broadcasting franchise.
Update Teletext, a consortium put together by Independent Television News.
As with the tenders for ITV franchises, the teletext licence for Channels 3
and 4 will go to the highest bidder meeting content requirements unless
there are 'exceptional circumstances'. The period of the licence runs from
January 1 next year.
Teletext is the news and information service carried on spare lines in the
television picture. Nearly 7m homes have sets that can receive teletext.
Oracle promised a new computer system that would greatly reduce the time
taken for news to reach viewers.
Update Teletext, whose shareholders apart from ITN are MAI Broadcasting,
Scottish Television and Anglia Television, is promising local news, weather
and events.
The TV-am bid is evidence that the company is trying to survive the loss of
its television franchise and find other broadcasting outlets. The company is
offering 14 separate regional services and special multicultural pages. The
main news on the service will be provided by the Press Association news
agency.
Media Ventures is backed by Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily
Mail, and Philips Electronics. It is promising a more comprehensive service
with sharper headlines and faster updates of news.
Carlton, winner of the London weekday television franchise, has joined
forces with Intelfax, which already provides information for the Channel 4
teletext service. The proposed service - to be called Gemini  - will offer a
total of 2,600 pages of information across Channels 3 and 4 with a strong
emphasis on regional information.
The ITC plans to announce the winner in April.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Lloyd's faces row on governance reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW over the governance of Lloyd's of London is brewing in the wake of
last week's report by a task force which advocated far-reaching reforms to
the insurance market.
The task force, made up of underwriters, brokers and Lloyd's executives,
recommended a number of radical changes - including proposals to modify the
unlimited liability of Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets back
underwriting at Lloyd's.
Lloyd's Council, the market's governing body, accepted most of the proposals
but rejected the suggested separation of its own regulatory and
business-development functions. It said that acceptance would have delayed
implementation of other reforms.
Hinting that Lloyd's had understated the depth of its opposition on this
issue last week, Mr Alan Lord, chief executive of Lloyd's and a member of
the 28-strong council, said yesterday he would have considered resigning had
the proposal on corporate governance been accepted.
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, said that the report was 'full of
incredibly sensible, well-thought out things' but described some of the
thinking on governance as 'codswallop' and 'absolute hot air'.
In their report the task force suggested the council, which would retain the
majority of outside Names (who do not work at Lloyd's) and nominated members
as at present, should retain its regulatory role but would be chaired by an
independent nominated member.
But it also advocated the creation of a market board, made up mainly of
representatives of underwriting businesses, which should have responsibility
for developing the market's business strategy.
Mr Lord said the creation of the market board would be 'retrogressive'
because it would have reduced the effectiveness of the regulatory structure
introduced by the 1982 Lloyd's Act.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Ford cuts discounts to rental fleets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FORD is to cut its sharply discounted sales to many big rental fleet
operators, whose combined new car purchases from all carmakers approach
100,000 annually, John Griffiths writes.
This should help Ford to return to profitability this year, Mr Ian
McAllister, chairman and managing director, said yesterday.
A study for the Retail Motor Industry Federation, the franchised dealers'
trade body, found that discounts of up to 40 per cent have been available
from some manufacturers.
A number of large fleet deals have been concluded directly between
manufacturers and fleet operators, bypassing the dealer networks.

FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: EC in push to revive Gulf free trade talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EC will today propose to the six states of the Gulf Co-operation Council
(GCC) a speedier phasing-out of import duties on the latter's petrochemical
products, in a move to revive talks for eventual free trade between the two
blocs, David Buchan reports from Brussels.
In the run-up to last year's Gulf war, the GCC states, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the UAE, rejected proposals by the EC, which
suggested phasing out its import tariffs on Gulf petrochemical products over
16 years.
Spurred by the need to help rebuild Gulf economies, especially Kuwait's,
after the Gulf war, EC governments last autumn decided to risk the wrath of
their own petrochemical lobbies by softening the Community's terms. The
package, which European Commission negotiators will today present to their
GCC counterparts, would do away with the last curbs on petrochemical imports
from the Gulf within 12 years. But no definitive end to the talks is
expected this week.
Some 95 per cent of GCC exports to the EC, totalling Ecu 11.87bn (Pounds
8.4bn) in 1990, enter the EC free, because crude oil and refined products
carry no duty. But the rest, mainly petrochemicals, bear import duties of
6-13 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE racketeering and murder trial of Mr John Gotti, the reputed head of the
biggest organised crime family in the US, begins today in Brooklyn.
The 51-year-old Mr Gotti, known in the US media as the 'Dapper Don,' is
charged by Federal prosecutors with five murders, extortion, illegal
gambling and obstruction of justice. The most important of the murder
charges concerns the December 1985 shooting of Mr Paul Castellano, the
previous head of New York's Gambino crime family, whom Mr Gotti succeeded.
Since 1986 Mr Gotti, a flamboyant dresser who has become something of a
popular figure in the US, has been acquitted on lesser charges in three
previous trials. The investigation that led to the latest indictments was
aided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who clandestinely recorded
Mr Gotti's conversations at his headquarters in Manhattan's Little Italy
district.
The trial, which will be directed by the US Attorney in Brooklyn, is
expected to make use of three Mafia informers who have turned state's
evidence. They include Mr Salvatore Gravano, who was initially a
co-defendant and who has been identified by police as Mr Gotti's trusted
consigliere, or right-hand man.
US officials are trying hard to ensure their quarry is not acquitted this
time. The presiding judge has already disqualified Mr Gotti's main defence
lawyer on the grounds that he participated in conversations with Mr Gotti
that were secretly taped as part of the government's evidence.
The first few weeks of the trial, which is expected to last three or four
months, will consist mainly of jury selection, which prosecutors deem
extremely important since they argue that Mr Gotti's criminal organisation
has a history of influencing jury members not to convict him. The jury
candidates will therefore be chosen anonymously and will be sequestered
under the protection of federal guards for the duration of the trial.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Haiti army's fears scuttle deal for Aristide's return: What
lies behind the failure of a compromise to resolve the exiled president's
status?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW days after it appeared that there had been a breakthrough in efforts
to agree conditions for the return to the Haitian presidency of Mr
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ambitious members of the country's interim
government and an intransigent military have again shut the door on him.
They have rejected a political compromise brokered by the Organisation of
American States which was intended to pave the way for the return of Mr
Aristide, who was overthrown at the end of September and sent into exile.
Some Haitian legislators who have attempted to act independently of the army
and seek a negotiated settlement, have been brought into line.
A resolution was thought likely in a meeting which was planned for the
weekend, after an agreement between Mr Aristide and a group of Haitian
legislators on an interim prime minister who would head the government on
the president's return.
But the selection of Mr Rene Theodore, head of Haiti's small communist
party, is being rejected by most legislators, and by the leadership of the
army which is in effective control of the Caribbean state of 7m people. Once
the legislators accept Mr Theodore as prime minister, they will have in
effect agreed to Mr Aristide's return.
Senior officers of the army fear they will suffer at the hands of Mr
Aristide and his supporters if the president is allowed to return. Mr
Aristide, who has been living in Caracas, Venezuela, since the coup, has
said that while enlisted men were following orders and would be pardoned,
the army's leaders would be either tried or exiled for their part in the
coup.
Behind all this are clear signs of a stalemate. Haiti has been subject to an
economic embargo imposed by the OAS, and several European countries, and
aimed at having the military and the government it appointed accept the
return of Mr Aristide.
The Haitians, however, are asking for the embargo to be lifted before they
agree to the return of Mr Aristide. The OAS members say Mr Theodore's
appointment should be ratified first. The recent return to Haiti of the
legislators who negotiated with Mr Aristide in Caracas, and who settled on
Mr Theodore as prime minister, was met by a statement from the Haitian
foreign ministry that foreigners should not try to pressure the country.
Although the embargo has brought commercial life to a halt, crippled Haiti's
small industrial sector and left the country with very limited supplies of
electricity, the military has been emboldened by the sporadic arrival of
shipments of fuel products. Three shipments since the imposition of the
embargo (one of which was a clear violation of the sanctions) have offered
the administration some relief.
Haitian politicians themselves appear to be divided, and some at odds with
the military, in determining how best to resolve the crisis. In the seven
months of Mr Aristide's government, following a handsome win in the
country's first elections in 30 years, he was frequently criticised by
parliamentarians for being too heavy handed. They wanted government
responsibilities to be given to elected officials and not those appointed by
the president. The selection of an interim prime minister, such as Mr
Theodore who has been an Aristide critic, was intended to create a buffer
between the president and the legislature. It appears, however, that such a
compromise will not move those who fear the president's return.
The fear is genuine among Haiti's elite. It is not only the army and the
legislators, but Haiti's prosperous business community which fears the
president's return. Mr Aristide's supporters, from among Haiti's majority
poor, are likely to take revenge on those who were responsible for and
supported the coup. Business leaders have said publicly that they do not
want the president back. Blood-letting appears inevitable.
But while the army, legislators and the OAS are involved in a game of
political chess in Port-au-Prince, the capital, the old political order is
reasserting itself in the provinces. Anarchy prevails with provincial
politicians, supported by the military, establishing virtual fiefdoms,
exacting taxes and violently punishing all opposition. Many of the leaders
are known members of the tontons macoute, the feared praetorian guard of the
Duvalier dictatorship which was overthrown by a wave of popular unrest six
years ago.

<TEXT>
CUBA'S council of state, headed by President Fidel Castro, has confirmed the
death sentence for terrorism and sabotage on the leader of a group of Cuban
Americans arrested on the island's north coast three weeks ago.
However, the council commuted the death penalty against another group member
to 30 years' jail. Earlier a third man, also originally sentenced to death,
had his sentence cut to 30 years' imprisonment by the supreme court.
The men, residents of Florida who the Cubans say were captured with arms and
explosives, have no other avenues of appeal.
Television broadcasts in Cuba showed the three men confessing that they
planned to sabotage public installations 'to give the impression that the
counter-revolution had began'. The Cubans also broadcast the names of
Cuban-Americans they said were behind the financing and training of the
group.
The council of state said it had provided this information to the US
authorities, and charged the US with 'spectacular incompetence' in dealing
with the matter. 'There has not been a single arrest or a sign that any will
be made,' the statement said.
The US administration has denied Cuban charges that Washington approved of
terrorist attacks on the island. The State Department and several human
rights organisations, appealed for clemency.

<TEXT>
TALKS TO avert a clash between a huge force of riot police and workers
barricaded at South Korea's largest car-maker ended in discord yesterday and
a police raid seemed imminent, a company spokesman said, Reuter reports from
Seoul.
'The two sides failed to narrow any differences. The chances are growing
that police will enter the company to end the occupation,' a spokesman for
Hyundai Motor Company said by telephone.
It was not clear whether the talks between workers and management would
resume today, the spokesman said.
Police helicopters hovering overhead dropped tens of thousands of leaflets
calling for an end to the occupation of Hyundai's five car plants in the
south-eastern city of Ulsan.
Thousands of masked and hooded car workers armed with metre-long steel pipes
are dug in behind towering barricades of trucks, cars dragged off assembly
lines, tyres, car doors and hijacked fire engines.
Many of the workers staged a 'defensive exercise' yesterday, hurling petrol
bombs and iron bolts in readiness for a police assault, witnesses said.
About 15,000 riot police deployed in the city were standing by to evict the
strikers, news reports said.
In a riverside park in Ulsan, about 30,000 people demonstrated in favour of
a quick end to the labour dispute that they said was threatening to damage
the city's economy.
Ulsan is a leading industrial city and home to 14 companies owned by Hyundai
Group, one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates.
Workers who have occupied car plants since last Wednesday are demanding
better conditions, special bonuses and reinstatement of sacked union
members. The union also wants legal charges against union leaders to be
dropped.
'We asked workers to end the occupation first and discuss their demands
after operations of production lines are normalised,' the Hyundai spokesman
said after tense 90-minute talks at the main company building. 'The union
showed no signs of backing down today. The situation needs police
intervention,' he said.
A union spokesman said: 'We have nothing to give in the way of further
concessions. Now it's management's turn.'
In labour-management talks on Sunday, union leaders offered to temper their
demands for a special annual bonus if the company called off the riot
police, a union spokesman said by telephone yesterday.
The union proposed to work out a compromise over its demand workers be paid
throughout the dispute and offered to make up for production losses through
overtime.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Western airliner deaths rise to 624 in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE airline insurance industry described last year as one of the worst ever
with hull losses suffered by western-built aircraft totalling Dollars 481m
(Pounds 269m) and the number of passenger deaths up sharply on the previous
year.
Although the value of hull losses was lower than in the previous two years
(Dollars 680m in 1990) it was still 50 per cent higher than the annual
average of Dollars 323m during the 1980s.
The annual statistics compiled by Airclaims, a London-based organisation
controlled by insurance companies, showed that 23 western-built jets became
total losses last year compared with 22 the year before.
Eight of last year's accidents resulted in passenger fatalities totalling
624 people.
This was almost twice as many as died in 1990 when there were 329 passenger
fatalities, but below the annual average of 707 passenger fatalities during
the 1980s. About three-quarters of fatalities last year resulted from two
accidents: the Lauda Air Boeing, which crashed last May in Thailand, and a
DC-8 crash in Saudi Arabia last July.
The number of hull losses has followed a relatively flat trend during the
past 20 years, but the cost to insurers has been increasing significantly
because of higher value aircraft and higher repair costs.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Property companies lead record bankruptcies in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of more than 1,000 property companies in Japan last year helped
push corporate bankruptcies to a record high, according to reports published
yesterday by two private credit agencies.
Figures from Teikoku Data Bank and Tokyo Shoko Research show that corporate
liabilities of bankrupt companies last year reached roughly Y8,000bn (Pounds
35bn). This is about four times higher than in 1990, and nearly double the
record set in 1985.
The figures are for corporate bankruptcies of more than Y10m.
The sharp rise in insolvency was a direct result of the Bank of Japan's high
interest rate policy, which was aimed at reversing a steep rise in asset
prices in the last decade that the central bank saw as unhealthy. The high
rates, which the bank began to ease last July, have also sharply slowed the
economy.
Central bank economists have nonetheless repeatedly expressed confidence
that underlying economic activity remained at healthy levels, and that
commercial banks would be able to withstand the steadily rising level of bad
debt on their books.
The conflicting pressures on the economy were underscored by an analysis by
Teikoku Data Bank, showing the second biggest cause of insolvency was the
inability of companies to hire sufficient labour. This accounted for 548
bankruptcies, with debts of Y110.5bn. The central bank has kept interest
rates high in part to combat wage inflation caused by a labour shortage.
Bankruptcies caused by the downturn of property prices accounted for 1,036
cases, with Y2,980bn in liabilities.
The number of insolvencies, while rising from 6,468 cases in 1990 to 10,723
last year, fell well short of the levels of the early 1980s. The number of
bankruptcies with liabilities over Y1bn, however, hit a record 713 cases,
with ll cases over Y10bn.
Teikoku Data Bank said little relief was in sight. December bankruptcies
reached more than 1,200 cases for the first time since March 1987. Total
liabilities of bankrupt companies during the month reached Y868.2bn, the
second highest following the record of Y957.2bn set in August.
The number of property companies filing for bankruptcy in December reached a
monthly high of 119 in spite of recent cuts to the official discount rate
and moves by the government to lift restrictions on property-related
lending.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG opposition from labour leaders yesterday forced a delay in the
formulation of a policy to close down public and private sector entities
that are chronically unprofitable and considered by the government to be
beyond redemption.
A meeting of management, labour and government representatives decided that
the policy would be delayed for at least another month while a unit-by-unit
study is made by six tripartite committees.
The government called yesterday's meeting to discuss what is called an
'exit' policy for unprofitable enterprises and to formulate a consensus on
it.
The government has drawn up a list of 58 public sector companies it wants to
close down. Their accumulated losses are estimated at Rs100bn (Pounds
2.2bn). They have a total labour force of 470,000.
The policy is a major part of the government's economic reforms. A 'national
renewal fund' worth Rs2bn is planned to re-train and redeploy workers
declared redundant. The World Bank is contributing towards the fund.
Consultations with the unions concerned began three months ago and at
yesterday's meeting union leaders accused the government of talking only in
terms of retrenchment rather than redeployment.
They urged the establishment of workers' co-operatives to take over the
running of the loss-making companies after writing off all the accumulated
losses. Dr Mahoman Singh, the minister of finance, was reported to be
sympathetic to this demand.

MUTINOUS troops in Congo, led by the army high command, controlled key

But sources close to the premier, who had apparently gone into hiding,
claimed he was still in control of the oil-producing central African
country.
Hundreds of armed soldiers were deployed at the radio and television
buildings, the treasury and other key points after demanding the resignation
of Mr Milongo's government on Sunday.
The city was mainly calm but government officials said troops fired in the
air to disperse about 1,000 pro-Milongo demonstrators in the district of
Bas-Congo. Leaflets circulated calling for a general strike against the army
moves.
A military communique broadcast on television said the high command was
meeting leaders of the interim parliament, the High Council of the Republic
(CSR), yesterday afternoon to discuss the crisis.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Zaire PM suspends national conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nguza Karl-i-Bond, Zaire's prime minister, has ordered the pro-opposition
national political conference to be suspended, leading to renewed fears of
street protests in the capital, Kinshasa, agencies report.
The conference is supposed to chart an end to 27 years of autocratic rule by
President Mobutu Sese Seko.
In a speech on state radio and television on Sunday, Mr Nguza said that the
conference, dominated by opponents of President Mobutu Sese Seko, was
contributing to violence in the central African country.
Mr Nguza said he decided on the suspension after consultations with
President Mobutu.
The Belgian government has strongly condemned the conference's suspension.
Mr Mark Eyskens, the country's foreign minister, said yesterday that the
move was 'in flagrant contradiction with the guarantees given to the Belgian
government' during two recent high-level visits.
Mr Eyskens said that Mr Nguza, during a visit to Belgium, the former
colonial power, had given 'guarantees on the continuation of the
democratisation process.'
Opposition supporters yesterday set up barricades in several districts of
Kinshasa. The city remained tense but calm.
Public transport stayed off the road. Schools and offices were closed for
fear of recurrence of violence similar to the the army-led looting which
killed 250 people and wrecked several Zairean cities last September.
The conference has been suspended for much of the time since it opened in
August, partly because of the September riots and partly over procedural
rows. It had resumed sessions last Friday, despite a boycott by more than
500 delegates loyal to President Mobutu and a cut-off of government funds.
Supporting his decision to suspend the conference, Mr Nguza said the
conference had made two decisions which he deemed unconstitutional: calling
for removal of a magistrate checking delegates' credentials, and demanding
that conference delegates check out of expensive hotels to cut costs.
Mr Nguza also cited a recent case in which the defence ministry said eight
people were killed in a battle between partisans of the prime minister, from
the southern Shaba region, and supporters of main opposition leader Etienne
Tshisekedi, from Kasai.
The opposition denies any such incident occurred and blamed the report on
government efforts to portray the conference as inflaming racial hatred.

KHMER ROUGE guerrillas mortared central Cambodian villages yesterday after
killing 13 civilians and sending 10,000 fleeing in the worst violation so
far of the three-month peace accord, agencies report from Phnom Penh.
The attack prompted envoys of the five permanent members of the UN Security
Council to call for the urgent stationing of United Nations soldiers in the
disputed area, diplomats said. The five are Britain, France, the US, China
and Russia.
Separately, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said in Tokyo that Mr
Yasushi Akashi, newly-appointed head of the United Nations Transitional
Authority in Cambodia, was suggesting that Japan send police to help restore
peace there.
The official added, however, that Japan would not be able to send police
under proposed legislation that would allow it to send Japanese troops
overseas for UN peacekeeping operations.
Under the October peace accord between the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian
government and guerrillas who fought it for 13 years, the UN authority is to
play an important role in keeping the peace and guiding the nation to
elections next year.
The attacks which violated the ceasefire took place in Kompong Thom
province, 150km north of Phnom Penh. Cambodian Red Cross officials said they
had registered 9,700 people displaced by the fighting in Kompong Thom since
January 5. They reported at least 13 dead and 18 seriously wounded in the
heaviest mortar attacks on 25 villages around the district capitals of
Stoung and Kompong Svay from January 6 to 7. Whole villages were burned.
Cambodian Red Cross trucks delivered 100 tonnes of rice, blankets, plastic
sheeting for shelters and other emergency supplies.
The new refugees brought to 180,000 the number of people displaced by the
war inside Cambodia. Another 370,000 Cambodian war refugees live in camps in
neighbouring Thailand.
The Khmer Rouge apparently mounted the attacks to hasten deployment of UN
peace-keepers to the area, diplomats said.
Last week Khmer Rouge chief Khieu Samphan presented the UN with a list of
eight areas where his group wanted peace-keeping troops deployed, they said.
So far only a few hundred foreign soldiers forming the UN Advance Mission in
Cambodia are in place, stationed in Phnom Penh, north-western Battambang
province, neighbouring Siem Reap province and other guerrilla areas in the
west.
The troops now in place are not charged with peace-keeping duties.

AN East German border guard was found guilty yesterday of killing an
attempted escapee at the Berlin Wall, in the first trial of human rights
violations committed under the former Communist regime, writes Leslie Colitt
in Berlin.
Mr Ingo Heinrich, a 27-year-old electrician in civilian life, was sentenced
to three and a half years in prison for firing the first fatal shot at
20-year old Chris Gueffroy, who was attempting to flee to West Germany on
February 6 1989.
The sentence was 18 months more than the public prosecutor had demanded.
A co-defendant was given a suspended two-year prison term for severely
wounding another escapee. Defence lawyers said they would appeal.
Two other border guards were found not guilty of shooting at the escapee.
Justice officials said the verdicts were likely to influence future trials
of east German border guards accused of murder along the frontier.

<TEXT>
BULGARIA and Greece yesterday began unofficial talks in Athens aimed at
preventing a rift following Bulgaria's recognition of the Yugoslav republic
of Macedonia last week.
The move came as Mr Milan Babic, leader of Krajina, the Serb-inhabited
self-proclaimed republic in south-western Croatia, said no UN troops would
be deployed in the region.
'Without our acceptance, the mission to deploy (UN) peace-keepers and disarm
Krajina's armed forces is doomed to failure,' Mr Babic told Borba, a
Belgrade newspaper.
Bulgarian diplomats said negotiations with Greece, which follow the
re-election on Sunday of Mr Zhelyu Zhelev as Bulgarian president, would seek
to guarantee stability in the Balkans.
Fears over stability increased last week after a special arbitration
commission, set up by the European Community's peace conference on
Yugoslavia, recommended recognition of Macedonia's independence by EC
countries.
However, the EC postponed recognition following Greek objections on the
grounds that the choice of name - the independent republic of Macedonia -
could indicate future territorial pretensions on northern Greece. But
Bulgaria went ahead, recognising Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia and
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Nova Makedonika, the Macedonian newspaper, yesterday accused Greece and
Bulgaria of 'exposing its concerted plans for Macedonia and the Macedonian
people'. Macedonia was once divided by the two countries.
In Croatia, Mr Babic, who believes Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Serbia, has betrayed Serbs in Krajina by accepting the UN peace plan, said
UN peace-keepers should be deployed only on the current frontline between
Krajina and the rest of Croatia.
This would, de facto, recognise Serbia's control over a third of Croatian
territory.
Mr Babic also repeated his opposition to the withdrawal of the federal army
from Krajina, a linchpin of the peace plan which has been approved by the
leaders of Croatia, Serbia and the army.
Belgrade radio, a mouthpiece of the Serbian leadership, reported yesterday
the deaths in Krajina of a family of Serbian and Croatian background, and
the murder of three federal army officers. The extensive coverage given to
the alleged killings may be an attempt by Serbia to discredit Mr Babic's
standing among the military and the enclave's population.

FT  21 JAN 92 / IMF hopes for Russian entry deal by April

<TEXT>
LEADING western countries and the International Monetary Fund would like to
see an agreement as early as April to admit Russia to the IMF, clearing the
way for substantial western support for comprehensive market reforms, Leyla
Boulton writes from Moscow.
After initial doubts over how to respond to Russia's requests for massive
western financial aid, it is understood that the fund's political
decision-making body, the interim committee, is likely to approve Russian
membership when it meets in April. The committee is made up of the finance
ministers of 22 countries, including the richest western countries.
Formalities for entry would then take several more months to complete.
IMF membership will give Russia access to IMF funds to support economic
reforms agreed with the fund. It also traditionally unlocks other sources of
western finance.
An IMF mission is now in Moscow for talks on the course of market reforms.
It is also collecting the economic data necessary to complete Russia's
application.
The fund would also like to admit other former Soviet republics such as
Ukraine and the Baltic states simultaneously. Apart from political concerns,
it will be easier to work out their individual quotas - or rank in the IMF
pecking order - through one exchange rate, while they are all still using
the rouble as their common currency.
The issue of IMF membership may next be raised as early as this weekend when
Group of Seven finance ministers are expected to meet in New York.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (12): Democracy from the top - Appraising a
decade of Hosni Mubarak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX RODENBECK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN OCTOBER 1991 Hosni Mubarak celebrated his 10th anniversary as Egypt's
third president. Asked to list his greatest achievements, the former Air
Force pilot was characteristically plainspoken. First, he said, came the
great improvement in Egypt's infrastructure. Next came a widening of
democracy.
No one would dispute the first of Mr Mubarak's claims. Many would challenge
the second.
Egypt has a freer press than it ever did under previous presidents.
Elections to the People's Assembly in November 1990 maintained the
oppositions's minority voice in the legislature. Compared with most of its
Arab neighbours Egypt remains a bastion of tolerance.
But 1991 also marked Egypt's 20th year under a constitution that enshrines
what the French call an etat rais, (rais being the Arabic for leader). Under
the Egyptian system, presidential decrees have the power of law. The head of
state effectively appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers, armed forces and
security chiefs, provincial governors, university presidents and other
officials.
Last year was also Egypt's 10th under Emergency Law. Enacted at the time of
the assassination of Mr Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar al Sadat, the law
permits arbitrary detention for up to 60 days and trial for some crimes in
State Security Courts with no right of appeal. Human rights groups charge
Egypt's security forces with systematic abuse of the law including the
practice of torture. More outspoken opponents say trigger-happy police have
shot suspects, usually Islamic activists, in cold blood.
Egypt's much-touted freedom of the press is true enough if taken literally
to mean the printing press. Opposition newspapers can be hysterical in their
attacks on the regime. But literacy is barely above 50 per cent. The
important media television and radio remain state monopolies; their version
of events is heavily doctored to express the government line. Film, theatre
and music are censored for overtly political content, and recent cases have
shown that even book publishing is not safe from officialdom's scissors.
Given the persuasive powers of the state it is hardly surprising that the
ruling National Democratic Party has retained an 85 per cent majority of
seats in the People's Assembly through the three general elections held
since Mubarak took office. After a promising flowering under the relative
liberty of the early 1980s, the legal opposition's continuing
ineffectualness has demoralised Egyptian democrats.
The government does not deserve all the blame for the opposition's failure.
Egypt's half dozen opposition parties, which ostensibly represent trends
from Green to National Socialist to Liberal to Islamic, have proved
remarkably inept at gaining grass-roots support.
Still, there is one political trend that challenges the government:
political Islam. Its activists range from pious liberals and mainstream
Moslem Brothers to violent extremist fringes. In the past decade, as
Egyptian society has grown more conservative, the breeding ground of
fundamentalism has grown.
Unlike many neighbouring governments, however, the Mubarak regime has proved
adept at containing the Islamicist tide. By control of religious
broadcasting, mosque sermons and Islamic institutions the Egyptian state has
coopted Moslem orthodoxy. Although permitted to operate, political groups
such as the Moslem Brothers are carefully circumscribed. Extremists face the
harsh teatment of the security forces.
What the government fears more, and with good reason, is the emergence of
economic problems that may arouse popular anger. Memories of serious urban
riots over bread prices in 1977 have not faded. Mubarak's advisers are aware
that food prices sparked the riots that forced governments in Algeria and
Jordan to loosen their holds on power.
When he spoke of being proud of Egypt's democracy, Mr Mubarak did not have
the Algerian model in mind. For the President and his lieutenants Egypt's
stability - meaning the stability of the regime  - will always be paramount.
Faced with a choice between popular unrest and sticking to economic reform,
Mr Mubarak would probably choose to let down his foreign creditors.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (14): Cairo film studios in crisis - Pirates
and videos assail the Arab world's 'Hollywood'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX RODENBECK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWITCH on a television anywhere in the Arab world and the language one hears
is likely to be the urban slang of Cairo. The city's entertainment industry
dominates 150m Arabs as Hollywood's dominates the English speaking world.
But after seven decades in film making and three in filling the region's
television screens, Egyptian show business is in a crisis. From 100 feature
films a year in their 1950s heyday, the output of Cairo studios has dropped
to only 30, producing a meagre annual turnover of Dollars 10m. Egypt's
state-owned Radio and TV Union once supplied 70 per cent of programming in
the Arab world. Competition from satellites, video and nascent national
studios have whittled away its market share.
For Egypt's cinema industry the foremost obstacle is finance. 'We have
excellent artists, excellent technicians and no real competition in the Arab
nation,' says Mounib Shafei, who heads the cinema branch of the Egyptian
Chamber of Industries. 'Our whole problem is economic.'
With cinema attendance in decline and video piracy rife in the home market,
Egyptian film makers have come to rely on foreign sales for two thirds of
their revenues. That gives their foreign distributors so much clout that a
handful of Arab producers now finance 80 per cent of the industry.
A typical Egyptian film costs Dollars 200,000 to shoot. Most studios finance
production by selling a film in advance to a distributor in the Gulf. With
his foreign right sold, the film maker's profits must come from local sales.
Serious film makers are concerned by Gulf money's effect on the standards of
Egyptian cinema. Foreign producers tend to be unadventurous, demanding only
well-known stars and formula scripts studded with plenty of flesh and
violence.
Financial pressures have limited the creativity of younger directors such as
Mohammed Khan, Khairi Bichara and Atef al Tayeb whose work is representative
of a trend away from the slapstick humour and melodrama that Cairo studios
are famous for. The real Egyptian issues they like to treat - class
conflict, urban crowding, corruption, the hypocrisy of tradition - are of no
interest to video watchers in the Gulf.
Efforts to secure local financing have not been encouraging. Egyptian
producers are wary of alienating the foreign finance monopoly. Director
Mohammed Khan set a precedent by financing his latest film, Knight of the
City, with a bank loan. Given the difficulties he has had getting the film
screened in Egypt and sold abroad, few are likely to follow in his steps.
Nevertheless there are some bright signs for the future. Egyptian producers
have plans to set up a joint production fund and a centralised agency for
foreign sales. Long closed by inter-Arab squabbles, lucrative markets for
Egyptian films have reopened in Lebanon, Syria and Libya. Anti-piracy
structures which will soon be legislated in Egypt and other Arab countries
should boost video sales that generate the bulk of income.
As a near monopoly of the state, Egypt's television production faces
different problems. Its most successful products - soap operas, religious
programmes and variety shows - remain popular outside Egypt. But the Radio
and TV Union's bureaucratic approach has depressed artistic standards just
as the sophistication of Arab audiences has grown. At the same time Gulf
countries have promoted their own programming, often luring away the best of
Egypt's technicians.
Officials at the Radio and TV Union refuse to disclose sales figures that
probably run into tens of millions of dollars, but admit that their share of
Arab programming has fallen.
'Ten years ago we were the only producers of drama,' says Mrs Zeinab Ezzat,
who runs the Union's foreign sales department from a dingy, cramped office.
'But now Arab countries are producing their own programmes. They get
satellite TV. There is even private TV production.'
Still, Mrs Ezzat appears unworried. 'The competition is better for us. If we
make better quality the viewers will ask for Egyptian programmes.'

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (13): Car makers set the pace - Private
industry is the key to growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX RODENBECK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANY sector is to create prosperity for Egypt it is industry. Already the
fastest growing part of the economy, industry is facing new challenges. A
shift to greater reliance on private enterprise and exports has recently
accelerated as the government launches privatisation plans, liberalises
rules for trade and investment, and restructures the state sector which
still accounts for half of industrial output.
In a clear sign of re-ordered priorities, the Egyptian government last year
gave General Motors and Japan's Suzuki approval to build passenger cars.
Both companies have assembled commercial vehicles in Egypt since the
mid-1980s, but had been unable to overcome the entrenched opposition of
state-owned carmaker NASCO, which feared that its own inefficiently
produced, outdated models could be squeezed from the highly protected local
market. Analysts now expect Egypt's car production to nudge 30,000 vehicles
a year by 1995, with an average 40-50 per cent local content.
Government industry officials admit that the granting of the licences marks
a policy change. During its flirtation with state planning in the 1960s
Egypt nationalised traditional industries such as textiles and concentrated
investment in heavy industry. The public sector was managed as an extension
of the burgeoning welfare state, providing guaranteed employment and
producing cheap and often subsidised goods.
Since the 1970s the private sector's share of industrial output has grown
from 15 per cent to more than 50 per cent, according to figures from the
government's General Organisation for Industrialisation.
Attractive investment incentives and a divestment programme by which the
state plans to sell some Dollars 850m in shares it holds in joint ventures
will soon widen the private sector's lead, Egyptian analysts say. Already,
new investment in heavy industries such as a Dollars 138m specialised steels
project, a 120,000 tonne capacity paper mill and the expansion of the large
Alexandria National Iron and Steel plant have been almost entirely privately
financed.
Dr Mohammed Abdel Wahab, who as Egypt's Minister of Industry oversees some
150 state-owned enterprises with combined annual sales of around Dollars
5bn, says that Egypt has turned away from its long-standing policy of import
substitution. 'We are now looking to the global, not the local market,' he
says.
Dr Abdel Wahab believes that the current major shake-up of the public
sector, signed into law last year, will help to further this goal. 'Law 203
was the most important event of 1991,' he says, describing its effect as to
lower an 'iron curtain' between government and the industries it owns.
Under the law, all state industries - including some outside the purview of
the Industry Ministry - will be organised into Italian style sectoral
holding companies responsible to a single Public Sector Minister. The
holding companies will be given unprecedented freedom to map strategy,
appoint management, raise capital and, perhaps most importantly, to sell off
assets. 'Some holding companies will have to sell successful parts to pay to
restructure bad parts,' says Dr Abdel Wahab, but adds: 'We want
privatisation to be a tool for restructuring, not an objective in itself.'
The minister promises that private and public sector companies will soon
operate under precisely the same rules. Already the two compete on equal
terms for capital and foreign exchange, and will soon pay the same prices
for energy. The government has stopped financing enterprises from its own
budget; state owned companies must find their own resources.
Dr Adel Gazarine, a former chief executive of NASCO who now runs a private
consultancy, believes the new public sector law will be useful as a
transition. But ultimately, he says, some state industries are likely to
die.
During a recent visit, International Finance Corporation director Sir
William Ryrie said he believed Egypt was on the verge of a period of
sustained growth in which industry would play a growing role. 'Egypt is at
the same stage Turkey was at 10 years ago,' said the IFC official, adding
that as a sign of confidence the World Bank's private finance arm planned to
invest up to Dollars 80m a year in Egypt.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (10): Snakes and ladders - The civil
engineers' dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHRAF GHONIMA, who heads the Cairo office of Bechtel, the big US
contractor, sums up the paradoxical nature of the construction sector in
Egypt in two sentences.
'We have been here 10 years and in the last three years we have been doing
extremely well,' he says. 'Egypt is a very good prospect.' But a little
later he adds emphatically: 'We avoid anything here that is Government
funded.'
This may seem puzzling, given that Government contracts account for the vast
majority of the local construction business - which a senior Egyptian
contractor estimates is worth around EL5bn a year (Dollars 1.5 bn) - and the
Government has a bad record on contract planning, management and payment.
But there is a ready explanation.
A big chunk of the work commissioned by the Government is infrastructural -
typically in water and sewerage, power plants, transport and
telecommunications - and is heavily dependent on foreign financing. About
one third of the annual US economic assistance to Egypt of Dollars 815m -
all of it in grant form  - goes to infrastructure projects. There are also
military construction contracts supported by US military aid.
Other sources of foreign finance range from other bilateral aid programmes -
such as the backing for the Cairo Wastewater Project from the British
Overseas Development Authority - to multilateral agencies such as the World
Bank, the Africa Development Bank and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development.
The assured source of funds and standards of project management that come
with these large injections of foreign aid have made Egypt a fertile ground
for many foreign contractors in recent years, as well as the mostly
publicly-owned local operators. Big projects have included the US-British
dominated Cairo wastewater scheme, said to be the biggest sewage
construction project in the world, the French-built, Cofas-financed first
phase of the Cairo Metro and a series of power station contracts.
Such projects have not been without financing problems. The Cairo wastewater
project has suffered serious delays because of funding disputes with the
authorities. A similar project for Alexandria has also been delayed.
But the outlook for a continued high level of foreign financing has been
bolstered by Egypt's winning stance in the Gulf crisis and its recent
economic reform agreements with the International Monetary Fund and Paris
Club creditors. A recently launched Dollars 1bn project to build a 1,200
megawatt power station at Kurimat won more than Dollars 850m in foreign
financing, including a Dollars 200m grant from the US Agency for
International Development and a Dollars 325m loan from the Africa
Development Bank.
Other big schemes which the Government intends to go ahead with over the
next few years include a Dollars 500m-Dollars 750m extension of the Cairo
Metro, a Dollars 1bn expansion of the Suez canal and a third terminal at
Cairo international airport.
Opportunities in the private sector are much fewer and less certain. A big
twin-tower office complex on the east bank of the Nile in Cairo built by
Britain's Higgs and Hill for a Gulf investor has never been filled, standing
as a grim testament to the risks of investing in the commercial sector.
But contractors say there are investors moving in to the important tourism
sector in which the Government is keen to encourage private participation.
As Mr Ghonima indicated, however, foreign contractors and the handful of
small private sector Egyptian builders are extremely wary of
domestically-funded projects, such as the Government's favoured New Cities
project. Any cursory inspection of the country's dismal public offices and
houses shows why. The quality is appalling. Contractors say what money is
spent is badly managed and, worse, the Government frequently does not pay
for work completed.
Mr Ismail Osman, a director of Arab Contractors (Osman Ahmed Osman and Co),
the country's biggest builder, cheerfully admits that the Government owes
his company EL1bn. The state-owned banks provide the safety net, but the
company's interest charges are huge - EL123m in 1989-1990, or some 12 per
cent of turnover.
Criticism tends to focus on the individual ministries involved in a
particular area, some of which have worse reputations than others. Mr
Cherine Scandar, President of Sodeco, a private Egyptian company, cites a
series of on-again, off-again moves to build new cement plants in which a
French company initially awarded a contract was strung along for more than a
year before the project was cancelled. 'It's a mess. The Government is not
able to control the awarding and follow-up of contracts,' says Mr Scandar.
Mr Ghonima, however, sees conditions improving. The big state-owned
contractors are high on the list for privatisation, the early planning of
which Bechtel is involved in with Coopers and Lybrand. Local industry is
keen to improve its management and production skills, he says, noting that
the presence of international contractors has had a 'trickle down' effect.
For example, he says, the quality and range of locally-made building
materials has much improved in recent years.
Government attitudes have also changed, says Mr Ghonima, with a much greater
emphasis on quality and less emphasis on taking the cheapest option. But,
again, even the layman knows that when it comes to construction quality,
Egypt is playing off a very low base indeed.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (11): Attractions of peace - Tourists are
returning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S tourist industry is celebrating its own victory just 12 months after
it was plunged in gloom by the Gulf crisis.
In the wake of a publicity drive, Dr Fouad Sultan, the tourism minister, is
ebullient. 'Trends are extremely positive. We are worried about
overbooking,' he says, adding that he hopes this season will be the best on
record.
Last year began on a less happy note. In the fiscal year July-June 1990-91
the industry recorded 16.5m tourist nights compared with the record of 22.1m
the previous year. The drop in tourist income was even more dramatic - by 60
per cent from Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 1bn.
But the first quarter for this fiscal year (July, August, September) showed
a strong rebound. In August 1991 the number of tourists from Arab countries
rose by 5.6 per cent. The average increase in arrivals in August 1991 stood
at 2.5 per cent. The recession in the west continued to affect non-Arab
arrivals which fell by 9 per cent.
The activity at some of Egypt's famous tourists sites only partly reflects
the improvement shown by the statistics. In Luxor, site of the Karnak Temple
on the east bank of the Nile and the Theban necropolis on the west bank,
tour guides confirm an increase in tourists compared with a year ago, but
say numbers are still well down on 1989.
'We used to have 4,000 tourists a day visiting the tombs in the Valley of
the Kings before the Gulf crisis. Last year there were days when no-one
came. Now we have 1,000 a day.'
Ferries used by tourists to cross from the east to the west bank at Luxor
are running well below capacity although local tour operators reported
capacity bookings in Luxor's 33 hotels for January.
Dr Sultan feels confident that occupancy rates at Cairo hotels for this
holiday season would reach 98 per cent, 75 per cent in South Sinai (Sharm el
Sheikh), 60 per cent in Hurghada on the Red Sea coast, and 65-70 per cent in
upper Egypt - Luxor and Aswan.
He attributes some of the success to Egypt's marketing campaign after the
end of the Gulf war when the government and private sector launched a
campaign to sell Egypt as a secure destination.
Another factor may have been that many tourists had delayed their travel
until after the Gulf crisis, contributing to a surge in arrivals in the
early months of the new fiscal year.
Mr Sultan anticipates that tourist nights for 1991-1992 will reach something
like 25m (compared with 22.1m in 1989/90). Income will exceed the Dollars
3bn achieved in 1989/90.
He says that another positive trend has been the fact that many hotels in
Egypt are reporting tourists returning for a second, third or even fourth
time. Mr Sultan says the average stay in Luxor, which used to be about one
night, is now three.
The main change, he claims, is that people now know Egypt 'not only for
culture, but also for other activities such as leisure and conferences'.
Egypt has encouraged the development of more and better facilities for
tourists over the last 10 years. As a result an important factor in the
growing number of arrivals has been the large increase in the number of
hotel beds.
In June 1991, there were 53,000 rooms compared with fewer than 25,000 rooms
in 1985. Another 14,000 rooms are under construction and will be completed
in the next couple of years.
Dr Sultan says the authorities have been successful at stimulating private
sector investment in the tourism sector which is by far Egypt's fastest
growing industry.
There is also evidence that Egyptian nationals with large off-shore dollar
deposits are beginning to invest in the sector.
New projects including extensions to the Meridien Hotel in Cairo and
ambitious schemes on the Red Sea coast south of Hurghada are attracting
investment from foreigners as well as Egyptians.
The industry has its tensions, however. For some involved in preserving
Egypt's ancient monuments, the government is pursuing development at the
cost of preserving historical sites.
'We take our monuments for granted. The government exploits their earning
potential, but does nothing to protect or develop them. Not enough is being
done to curb pollution and ensure we have historical attractions for decades
to come,' says a tour guide in Cairo.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (9): Farmers in clover - Central agriculture
planning is to be relaxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPTIAN agriculture is one of the most productive systems in the world. Of
a total area of 286m acres, only about 6.5m acres, or 3 per cent, are arable
 -mostly along the Nile and its delta.
Centralised control, which has acted as a brake on this productivity over
the last three decades, is being dismantled, and Egypt's estimated 3.5m
farmers may soon be able to reap the real benefits of their labours.
Egypt's Ministry of Agriculture has targeted three areas for reform, all
with varying degrees of success:
state control of production patterns and crop quotas;
price controls;
land reclamation.
The main reason for these reforms remains Egypt's food import bill of
Dollars 4bn a year.
Traditionally the ministry has tightly regulated the sector by dictating
production patterns through crop quotas, procurement prices and input
allocations.
This control was dictated partly by the big food subsidy programme, which
remains in place. About 90 per cent of Egypt's population is eligible for a
ration of subsidised sugar, vegetable oil, and rice.
These controls have affected productivity and yield ratios. Many farmers,
for example, have grown beseem (clover) because they have been able to sell
it for a higher price than many other crops.
'We had become obsessive about control to ensure the fullest production,'
says Dr Hassan Khetr, the ministry's under secretary in charge of
agricultural economics and statistics.
The present structures have been in place since nationalisation in the early
1960s. Because it was difficult to talk about nationalising the total
production process in agriculture, the government confiscated decision
making rather than land.
'Our reforms are aimed at getting the government out of the production
process. Our mandate is to create a conducive environment for producers  -
the farmers,' he says.
Reforms initiated in 1986 have already begun eroding state control. The
government no longer sets fixed production quotas, prices and government
allocation of fertilisers for crops, except cotton and sugar cane.
In the case of wheat, marketing and production controls - including
mandatory acreage - were liberalised in 1987. Since then production has
increased sharply. In 1990 wheat production reached a record 4.2m tonnes and
it is expected to climb to 4.8m tonnes this year - sharply higher than the
1.8m tonnes produced in 1986.
Although self-sufficiency has re-emerged as a national issue, Egypt remains
the world's largest flour importer and the third largest wheat importer.
Production increases have done little more than keep pace with a rise in
consumption.
Imports of wheat are expected to total 6.5m tonnes this year, the same as
last, while total consumption, 10.6m tonnes last year, is expected to rise
to nearly 11m tonnes this year.
But increased production has to be weighed against increased consumption.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation argues that the two have
increased in tandem, keeping the import bill static.
But the task remains formidable - and, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Land Reclamation, not solely its responsibility.
It points to Egypt's population, which increased by 2.3 per cent - or 1.25m
people - last year.
The ministry also argues that consumption patterns need addressing. Each
Egyptian consumes 200kg of flour a year, more than in any other nation.
The ministry also says the wheat import bill could be reduced by tightening
the pricing system further. The number of different prices for flour
(destined for bread-making) has been reduced from seven to three.
'Unless consumption and production patterns are altered significantly,
domestic agriculture will play an increasingly supplementary role in
providing for Egypt's food needs,' a foreign adviser warns.
Egypt's foreign advisers argue further that self-sufficiency will remain a
dream for Egyptians because of a shortage of land.
Expanding the land base and reclaiming the desert for agricultural purposes
continues to be a policy priority for the government.
Over the last five years land reclamation projects have added 750,000
feddans (a feddan is about one acre) to the land resource base.
Until recently land reclamation remained a source of dispute between Egypt
and international organisations. 'In the past the World Bank and other
donors were reluctant to support these projects. The rationale was that the
payback was too long and that financial profitability was questionable.
However, they have changed their stance dramatically,' says Mr Khetr.
The World Bank is now supporting one of the biggest land reclamation
projects in the Sinai peninsula.
Headway also seems to have been made in curbing urban encroachment. Mr Khetr
says a 1983 law, which for the first time banned ploughing, building on or
excavating the topsoil, is proving effective.
These successes are greeted with some caution by western advisers, who are
concerned about Egypt's water supply. While the Nile flow is at present
adequate, this could change if greater demands were made upstream in the
Sudan.
Egypt still faces the fundamental contradiction of, on the one hand, needing
to reduce the huge drain on its resources by increasing output, and, on the
other, introducing reforms in a sector which supports 35 per cent of the
country's labour force.
In the words of Mr Khetr: 'We are true believers in liberalisation. But our
programmes have to be justified not only on economic but also on social
grounds.'

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (6): Drain age comes to Cairo - A look at
one of the world's biggest sewerage projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SEWAGE pumping station may seem an unlikely spot for a big official
celebration. But glasses will today be raised at Ameria in north eastern
Cairo to mark the inauguration of probably the world's biggest new sewer
building operation.
The somewhat coyly named Greater Cairo Wastewater Project is behind schedule
and some way from full completion. Nevertheless, the opening of the first
phase of the scheme to provide a proper sewage disposal system for one of
the globe's most notoriously overpopulated and insanitary cities is a
significant moment which promises a cleaner and healthier future for the
Egyptian capital.
When the eight huge centrifugal pumps sunk in the cylindrical Ameria station
are switched on, they will suck 650,000 cubic meters of sewage a day out of
a newly constructed main tunnel and its branch feeders collecting waste from
Cairo's east bank of the Nile for conveyance by culvert and drain out of the
city.
When all the systems encompassed by the Cairo wastewater project are up and
running, perhaps in 1995, they are designed to cope with a total sewage flow
from the city's 12m-plus population of more than 2m cubic meters a day - and
be expanded to meet the capital's wastewater output well into the next
century.
This huge civil engineering task, the centre piece of an extensive
Government programme to modernise Egypt's creaking infrastructure, was first
conceived in the late 1970s.
By then it was odorously clear that the existing city sewage system,
designed by British engineer J. Carkeet James in 1910 for a projected
population of just 1m, was woefully inadequate, despite two improvement
projects undertaken down the years. Infant mortality rates in Cairo of twice
the average in developing countries gave statistical backing to the all too
visible evidence in the streets of an overflowing system.
What transpired was an EL5bn project which has been planned and executed
jointly by the Egyptian Government and British and US contractors, with
heavy US and British financial backing.
The Government set up the Cairo Wastewater Organisation (CWO) to oversee the
scheme which has been managed by a joint American-British consultant group -
called Ambric  - made up of the US companies Camp, Dresser &amp; McKee and Black
&amp; Veatch, and the British companies John Taylor (now Acer/John Taylor) and
Binnie and Partners.
An initial Dollars 130m emergency scheme, including Dollars 100m in US aid,
was set up to rehabilitate the existing system, mainly by refurbishing more
than 100 pumping stations around the city. Completed in 1987, this was
responsible for a marked reduction in street sewage floods still proudly
shown off by Egyptian officials in dramatic 'before and after' photographs.
But the real work was to be on a much greater scale. As it evolved, Cairo
was divided into its two natural geographic halves, the east and west banks
of the Nile.
On the east bank, backed by Pounds 65m in British government grants and
Pounds 185m in loans from Samuel Montagu underwritten by the Export Credit
Guarantee Department, British contractors and their Egyptian partners would
bore a new 12-km long main tunnel and an extended closed culvert to collect
and carry sewage to Gabal el-Asfar north east of the city.
There a wastewater treatment plant, initially capable of processing 1m cubic
meters of flow a day, would be built. Once complete, more than 140 old
pumping stations could be decommissioned.
On the west bank, a similar scheme was designed for the American-led effort.
Culverts, not tunnels, were required to carry effluent westwards to a
treatment plant at Abu Rawash. But extensive work to install sewers in
previously unsewered areas, including the Pyramids, was needed.
Initiated by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1985, the east bank scheme was the
biggest overseas construction project ever undertaken by UK companies.
The main tunnelling contracts went to two consortia, one comprising Tarmac,
Balfour Beatty, Cementation, Edmund Nuttall and Arab Contractors of Egypt,
the other Lilley International and Misr Engineering. Other companies to get
a share of the work were Kier, Christiani and Nielsen, GEC, Laing and
Fairclough.
Not all was plain sailing. There were technical delays, including an
18-month hold-up in sinking the Ameria pumping station caisson and delays in
acquiring the 36m acid-resistant bricks needed from local producers for the
lining of the 5m-diameter main tunnel.
There were also financing problems. Some Pounds 150m to finance outstanding
branch tunnelling work is not secured. More seriously, the commissioning of
the Dollars 160m Gabal el-Asfar treatment plant was seriously delayed by
disputes between the Egyptian and British sides over financing. Eventually
the Italian government stepped in. But the plant is five years behind
schedule, meaning east bank sewage will flow untreated to the Mediterranean
Sea at least until 1994.
The much bigger commitment of the US government - Dollars 816m has been
pledged to the Cairo Wastewater Project by the US Agency for International
Development - has meant smoother progress on the west bank. Completion there
is set for September 1994. Meanwhile, the EC has put up funds to back a
sewage scheme in Helwan in south Cairo to complete the picture over the 875
sq km Greater Cairo area.
Mr Selama A. Salem, the chairman of the CWO, is understandably enthused by
the transformation he has presided over. But he acknowledges that completion
of the project raises new issues to be overcome. The government has not yet
decided what it will do with the treated wastewater - or the hundreds of
tonnes of sludge that will be left over.
More difficult is deciding how to structure the operation and maintenance of
the system which Mr Salem estimates will cost EL120m a year at present
prices.
Joint venture companies with the foreign contractors will operate the
systems for the first few years. After that, the Government is contemplating
merging the now separate fresh water and waste water authorities and
possibly breaking up and privatising the resulting structure along the lines
of the British water privatisation.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (7): A new hand at the pump - Confidence is
rising in the oilfields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR EGYPT'S oil and gas sector it has been a year of upheaval, but things
appear to be settling down following the abrupt replacement last May of the
long-serving oil minister, the volatile Dr Abdel Hadi Qandil, by Mr Hamdi
el-Banbi, a low-key technocrat.
The new minister of Petroleum and Mineral Wealth has quietly put his stamp
on his ministry with a reshuffle of senior positions and a new pricing
policy for crude oil exports.
The new formula, which applied from October 1, sets the price of Egypt's
benchmark Suez Blend crude at 60 per cent Brent minus Dollars 3.00, 20 per
cent Iran Heavy minus Dollars 0.55 and 20 per cent Suez Blend spot.
Mr Tarek Heggy, head of Shell in Egypt, was speaking for the industry when
he observed that 'in the old days, Egyptian pricing was a dollar out on a
daily basis, now its barely a dime'. Apart from bringing greater order to
the daily marketing of Egyptian crude, and thus lessening friction with
foreign companies, the new formula is also designed to appeal to purchasers
seeking long-term contracts.
Mr Banbi's initiation in his early days as minister has not been without
pain, however. British Petroleum's decision to sell its 16.67 per cent stake
in the Suez Oil Company (SUCO) to Repsol of Spain and to scale down its
activities in Egypt was hardly a vote of confidence. But BP executives say
the decision was less a reflection of the difficulties of doing business in
Egypt than of the company's worldwide rationalisation to enable it to
concentrate on new and perhaps more promising exploration zones.
Mr Banbi, at a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo late
last year, sought to place the best gloss on the BP decision, noting that
big players such as Shell had come and gone in Egypt without serious effect.
The new minister also foreshadowed a renewed drive to increase areas under
exploration for both oil and gas after a hiatus period in the past year or
so, due in part to personnel changes in the petroleum ministry and in the
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Fourteen exploration
agreements were currently being processed, and there would be at least two
bid rounds for new acreage this year. 'Our goal is not only to maintain our
reserve base of 6bn barrels equivalent, but also to exert all efforts to
increase it,' Mr Banbi said.
To this end, Egypt has, since the mid-1980s, been encouraging oil companies
to explore for gas. The introduction of a new gas clause has spurred efforts
in that direction. Egypt's present gas reserve totals 12 trillion cubic feet
(TCF). The target is 27 TCF to meet anticipated demand for the next 20
years. Dr Banbi, in his American Chamber address, described this as a 'real
challenge to all involved.'
He added that if companies discovered larger quantities of gas than could be
absorbed by the growing domestic market, as Egypt seeks to convert as much
as possible of its power sector and larger processing industries to gas use,
surpluses could be exported.
Shell has been particularly active in gas exploration and development. Its
main production comes from its Badr al-Din deposits in the Western Desert
where reserves total about 2TCF. The gas is delivered via a 270-km pipeline
to al-Amiriya near Alexandria. Shell has also been among the leaders in
investment in oil exploration with drilling programmes from the Gulf of Suez
to the Western desert: it has made modest finds in both, including gas in
the latter. It is also exploring offshore in the Mediterranean.
British Gas is another foreign participant which is relatively bullish about
its investments in Egypt. The company, in partnership with Yukong of South
Korea and Union Pacific Petroleum Suez of the US, is committed to commercial
production from its Gulf of Suez North Zafarana concession. Reserves in the
British Gas concession - the first sizeable find in the Gulf of Suez for
several years - are put at between 50-100m barrels, somewhat less than
indicated by initial exploration.
Among other noteworthy developments in the past year or so was Repsol's
strong entry to the Egyptian scene. In 1990, it bought Conoco's Western
Desert interests, and followed that up in 1991 with its SUCO purchase.
Repsol's aggressive strategy in Egypt appears aimed at securing a reliable
Mediterranean source of crude oil.
Mr Banbi's elevation to minister (he was previously chairman of EGPC) was
accompanied by the good news that Egypt's oil export earnings jumped by 70
per cent to Dollars 2.54bn in the year to June, due largely to the Gulf
crisis.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (8): White gold loses its shine - Cotton
growing is in decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT can still claim to produce some of the best quality cotton in the
world. But it has singularly failed to breathe life into an industry which
has been in steady decline for 20 years.
Cotton remains one of the most important crops produced in Egypt. Exports
are Egypt's fifth largest source of foreign exchange earnings, after oil
revenues, worker remittance, tourism and Suez Canal earnings.
Cotton output fell sharply in the early 1970s and in the past decade dropped
a further 40 per cent. This year, planted acreage is expected to show a
further sharp decline.
Despite increasing export prices, export earnings have fallen steadily.
Gross revenues for lint were Dollars 200m for the 1989-90 crop but are
expected to decline to Dollars 170m for the 1990-91 crop.
Cotton is important to Egypt for reasons other than foreign earnings. The
textile industry is a major public sector employer, with about 230,000
workers in 31 public sector plants - operated by the Textile Industries
Corporation under the Ministry of Industry.
It is precisely because of its importance that the government is reluctant
to relinquish control and cotton continues to be one of Egypt's two
remaining controlled crops (the other is sugar cane.) Cotton production and
procurement is mandatory and marketing and export remain government
monopolies.
Farmers almost unanimously do not like to plant cotton. Known in the past as
'white gold' in Egypt, it is now referred to as the 'government's crop'.
Many farmers still find it more profitable to pay the minimal fines for not
growing cotton or to divert resources to the production of other more
lucrative crops.
The government openly admits its policies actively discourage farmers from
growing cotton. Mr Hassan Khetr, the ministry's under secretary in charge of
agricultural economics and statistics, talks of the 'disease' of government
control that has worked as a disincentive to farmers.
'The government was squeezing cotton producers - they were getting 25 per
cent less than what they deserved,' he says.
The government has outlined three objectives and insists that it is
committed to them:
to reform the pricing policy by increasing the procurement price of cotton
to a level closer to its world price;
eliminating subsidies;
eventually privatising the cotton sector.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (4): Lost: 20m condoms - US assistance is
far from trouble-free
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR AMERICAN officials administering the Dollars 815m annual US aid
programme for Egypt, the Case of the Missing Condoms is no laughing matter.
Acutely sensitive to any allegations of misappropriation of US taxpayers'
dollars, officers of the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
were alarmed as well as embarrassed when it became clear recently that no
fewer than 20m condoms allocated to a Washington-backed Egyptian birth
control programme had been taken up by local private sector companies.
Private sector involvement in the scheme was officially prescribed. But
USAID officials did not believe such a 'surprisingly high' number of condoms
could realistically be properly distributed by the private sector.
Jokes quickly began circulating among Egyptians that the condoms had been
sold as children's balloons. USAID suspects they have been sold for profit
or are being hoarded. The agency is threatening to bill the Egyptian
authorities unless the missing items are accounted for.
The condom mystery is more than just an amusing tale to be told at the
expense of American blushes.
It also illustrates how the USAID programme extends to the most mundane
levels of Egyptian life.
In the years since Washington began pumping in economic aid, as a reward for
Egypt's 1979 Camp David peace treaty with Israel, more than Dollars 15bn in
grants have been forthcoming.
The aid, which comes on top of the Dollars 1.2bn annual military assistance,
is much less in both absolute and per capita terms than the yearly US
economic aid to Israel. Unlike Israel, which gets the money 'up front' to
disburse as it pleases, USAID runs a 500-person operation in Egypt to manage
the project-by-project allocation of the assistance to the country.
Nevertheless, USAID funds have become an extremely important and constant
source of development funding in the economy. In particular, they play a
vital role in supporting infrastructure development, which accounts for
about one third of the annual USAID flow to Egypt.
The funds are divided into three main categories:
Dollars 115m a year goes in the form of a cash subvention to the Government,
to date loosely tied to economic performance but not conditioned
specifically to policy.
Dollars 200m a year is allocated for commodity imports from the US, until
recently chiefly for the public sector, but now weighted Dollars 175m to
Dollars 25m in favour of the private sector.
Dollars 500m goes for infrastructure and social sector development.
Schemes supported under the last category cover crop research and
development, reducing Government interference in agricultural prices, basic
education projects, health programmes - USAID claims its child disease aid
has helped reduce infant mortality from 100 deaths per 1,000 to fewer than
50 - population control and local development projects.
By far the biggest sums, however, have been spent on infrastructure, chiefly
in the areas of potable water and wastewater programmes, power generating
plants and telecommunications.
USAID has been the biggest outside backer by far for the huge Cairo sewage
project, now more than 12 years old and within a few years of completion. A
total of Dollars 816m has been committed to the scheme. Wastewater projects
in Alexandria will account for Dollars 350m and smaller projects in three
Nile cities and three Suez Canal cities will swallow a further Dollars 500m.
There is a heavy flowback to the US as American contractors do 79 per cent
of the work and US companies supply much of the inputs. But the payout to
Egyptian contractors is considerable and the benefits to Cairo and the other
cities as a whole are unarguable. The next biggest USAID infrastructure
commitment is to the power sector where Dollars 1bn has been earmarked. US
officials say more than one quarter of all Egypt's generating capacity has
been US-built. One project just at the completion stage is a Dollars 150m
job to replace the 24 'runners' which feed the turbines at the Aswan High
Dam.
Telephone users in Cairo and Alexandria will also testify to the effects of
Dollars 300m put into the hopelessly outdated telecommunications systems in
the two cities by USAID in the past few years.
The decisions on how USAID money is spent are taken by USAID and officials
from the Ministry of International Cooperation. Each side has a veto in the
sense that a project cannot go ahead unless both sides agree to it.
Under the new director of the Egypt USAID operation, Hank Bassford, a
strategic reassessment is underway to review where the money goes. The trend
is clearly to shift away from pure public sector works to a greater
involvement in the private sector, in line with the course of economic
reforms set for Egypt by its agreements with the IMF, World Bank and Paris
Club creditors.
'For years we couldn't really do anything in the private sector for
political reasons,' says a US diplomat. 'There are still a lot of old-line
socialists going back to the Nasser period in the bureaucracy who really
don't want to change. But we are beginning to overcome the Government's
reluctance to commit our funds to the private sector.'
With the Government, Mr Bassford is also aiming to design assistance schemes
which help Egypt meet the reform targets it has been set. USAID money is,
for example, supporting studies by Peat Marwick on how to administer a new
general sales tax and, similarly, work by Coopers and Lybrand on
privatisation.
USAID funds will continue to be a big source of traditional development
funding. But assistance will tend to be more closely policy-related. 'We
will not attempt to move them in new directions, but we will help them to
carry out the economic reform programme they are already committed to,' says
Mr Bassford.
