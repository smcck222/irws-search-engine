FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fannie Mae posts record earnings

THE Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the largest provider
of mortgages to US homeowners, has ended its best year in record style.
Yesterday, it reported record fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 361m, a
performance which took total 1991 earnings to Dollars 1.36bn, the highest in
the association's history. In 1990, it earned profits of Dollars 1.17bn.
Fannie Mae was able to post record earnings against the background of a
depressed housing market and a economic recession primarily because of
strong growth in the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) business, which
involves selling securitised packages of mortgage debt to institutional
investors.
During the year, Fannie Mae issued Dollars 112.9bn of MBS, taking the total
of outstanding securities to Dollars 372bn and boosting guaranty fees on MBS
business 26 per cent to Dollars 675m.
The recession also failed to halt growth in the association's mortgage
portfolio, which expanded 11 per cent over the year to Dollars 126.5bn.
There was a similar-sized increase during 1991 in Fannie Mae's earnings from
net interest income, which totalled Dollars 1.78bn.
Contrary to public perception that the weak economy left homeowners
struggling to pay their mortgages last year, the number of foreclosed
properties acquired by Fannie Mae actually fell, from just over 8,000 in
1990 to 7,450.
Similarly, charge-offs to the association's allowance for loan losses
dropped in 1991, falling from Dollars 233.5m in 1990 to Dollars 205.3m.
Fannie Mae reported that during the year it helped 1.7m families acquire
mortgages, in the processing doing Dollars 139bn of business.

PEUGEOT Citroen's 1991 net profit was probably 'somewhat below' that of the
previous year, Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of the French car maker, said
yesterday, AP-DJ reports.
However, he reaffirmed his belief that the result would be favourable
compared with those of other leading car makers.
Mr Calvet, added that Peugeot's consolidated revenue was fairly stable last
year, against that of the previous year.
Peugeot posted net profit after payments to minority interests of FFr9.3bn
(Dollars 1.75bn) in 1990, down 10.5 per cent from 1989.
Revenue rose 4.6 per cent to FFr160bn.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Japan's banks 'face tougher
environment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FINANCIAL de-regulation has forced Japanese banks to increase efficiency,
but the results of liberalisation have been partly obscured by 'excessive'
expansion during the speculative era of the late 1980s, according to a Bank
of Japan report which was released yesterday.
A central bank study found that commercial banks have generally reduced
operating costs since the early 1980s, and that there is no 'clear sign'
that higher interest charges were used to compensate for increases in
interest payments to customers.
However, the bank concluded that Japanese banks are 'likely (to) face a more
severe environment' in the future, partly because cost savings accompanying
the introduction of new technology have been realised, and because
'excessive expansion by some banks in the late 1980s increased their credit
risks'.
Since the late 1970s, and under pressure from the US government, Tokyo has
gradually liberalised financial markets, with the Foreign Exchange Law
amended in 1980 and discussion continuing over the role of banks in the
securities industry.
The de-regulation of interest rates on virtually all time and ordinary
deposits is scheduled to be completed by 1994.
The issue of de-regulation has become entangled in the troubled trade
relationship between the US and Japan.
However, the central bank emphasised the virtues of change: 'It should be
noted that the de-regulation process stimulates market competition, urging
banks to achieve further efficiency and ultimately enhancing the economic
welfare of a nation.'
Bank of Japan researchers found that the quality of services provided to
depositors has 'significantly improved' in recent years through the
expansion of automatic payment systems and automated teller machines.
However, the report suggests that the banks' desire to broaden their
customer base has increased their exposure to credit risk, while the
expansion of the corporate bond market will limit the banks' ability to
offset increased funding costs by marking up lending rates.
'Banks will inescapably face a more competitive environment in the future,'
the report said.
'In addition, the credit risks of some financial institutions seem to have
increased owing to imprudent expansionary activities during the monetary
ease of the late 1980s.'
The central bank insisted that the increase in credit risk does not mean
that deregulation was a mistake, but shows that 'some banks were not fully
prepared for financial de-regulation in terms of credit risk management'.

HERSANT, which owns the Paris-based daily Le Figaro, France Soir and 27
other smaller newspapers in France, has paid Dollars 22m to buy 48 per cent
of Mlada Fronta Dnes, the best-selling daily in Czechoslovakia.
Selling 400,000 copies a day, the daily became a private company owned by
the employees in August 1990. Already known as relatively progressive before
the revolution, it has gained support for its objective and wide-ranging
coverage.
Hersant already has a stake in the largest daily in Poland, Rezeszpospolita,
and in seven other provincial dailies. In Hungary, its owns 49 per cent of
Magyar Nemzet, the second largest daily and oldest in the country.
In Czechoslovakia, the French group beat competitors from Italy, the US and
Germany, including the powerful Algemeine Zeitung press group.
Last year, a smaller media joint venture was forged when Eurexpansion, a
holding company which includes the Groupe Expansion of France, and Business
Week and Dow Jones of the US, bought 45 per cent of Hospodarske Noviny, the
most influential economic daily in the country which sells 140,000 copies
per issue.
The Swiss media group Ringier, based in Lausanne, has also acquired a stake
in a newspaper in the northern Bohemian town of Ostrava and has created an
economic weekly called Cesky Profit.
German companies, dominating foreign investment in the country, have been
less successful in striking significant joint ventures in the press.

<TEXT>
INCENTIVE, the Swedish industrial and investment group dominated by the
Wallenberg family, is to sell its Gense silver and stainless steel cutlery
division to the Dutch company Corpeq.
The move is another stage in Incentive's strategy to concentrate its
industrial activities in the engineering sector.
Gense remains Scandinavia's largest and one of Europe's leading makers of
silver and metal-based serving materials with annual sales of around SKr260m
(Dollars 45m).
Corpeq is a diverse industrial group that also makes building materials,
consumer products and hospital equipment, with annual sales of Fl 260m and
around 1,200 employees. Gense will become part of its cutlery and stainless
steel serving materials division which is the market leader in the
Netherlands under the Van Kempen and Begeer name.
Incentive was separated from the Swedish engineering company Asea early in
1991 and floated on the Stockholm bourse last July. In the restructuring of
the company, up to seven segments of the old Incentive, accounting for
around a quarter of its profits, are to be divested.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Pirelli raises interest in
Continental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the financially-strapped Italian tyres and cables group, now holds
shares and options for around 39 per cent of the capital of Continental, the
German tyres concern it tried to buy last year.
In a letter to shareholders sent ahead of a meeting to be held on January 20
to approve a L518.6bn rights issue, the company reveals it has spent over
L127bn (Dollars 106m) to buy options on 32 per cent of Continental's shares.
The shares, pulled together by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank which is
Pirelli's main adviser, stem from the holdings owned by Pirelli's allies in
the attempted takeover.
Pirelli has also negotiated an option to buy the 2 per cent Continental
stake held by Fiat, which was not believed to have been directly involved in
the takeover attempt. A further 5 per cent of Continental's stock is owned
by Pirelli Tyre Holdings (PTH), the group's Netherlands-based subsidiary.
Pirelli's poor financial health makes any resumption of the Continental bid
highly unlikely in the short term. However, the options will give Pirelli
much greater flexibility over the timing of any sale of its Continental
stock, or even of a renewed bid.
Under the terms arranged with Mediobanca, Pirelli has paid a premium of DM60
(Dollars 37.90) a share for the option to acquire, in whole or in fractions,
the Continental shares at any time over the next five years.
Together, capital losses on PTH's own Continental shares, legal costs and
acquisition of the options account for around L340bn of Pirelli's estimated
L590bn loss for 1991. A further L240bn stems from restructuring costs in the
tyres and cables divisions, while operating losses account for L110bn.
Pirelli is taking a number of initiatives to shore up its finances, which
have suffered from over-ambitious expansion as well as the Continental bid.
Apart from the rights issue, L1,500bn will be raised from loans arranged by
Mediobanca and Credito Italiano. A further L1,000bn should accrue from the
sale of Pirelli's diversified products division.
Diversified products is the third of Pirelli's operating divisions, with
1991 sales of around L1,700bn. It includes activities in industrial and
automotive components, shoes and clothing.
Pirelli expects the disposals, which will be of the seven independent
business units forming the division, rather than individual companies,
should be completed within the next 19 months. Ironically, Continental,
which, like Pirelli, is active in industrial and vehicle components, has
already expressed interest in some of the businesses for sale.
Shares in Pirelli SpA, the most widely traded of the group's quoted
operations, fell slightly to L1,045 in Milan yesterday. With new shares in
Pirelli's one-for-two rights issue being priced at L1,000 each, some
analysts doubt the issue will be well received by private investors.
However, Societe Internationale Pirelli, the Swiss-based company which owns
a majority of the shares, will be taking up its full quota, while the rest
will be underwritten by a Mediobanca-led consortium.

CREDITANSTALT, Austria's biggest bank, is broadening its involvement in
Czechoslovakia with the launch of a commercial paper market in
Skoda-Volkswagen debt.
The discount paper, worth Kcs320m (Dollars 12m), was issued by Skoda
Automobila, the joint venture forged between Volkswagen of Germany and
Skoda, the Czech car manufacturer, earlier last year. They were issued for a
period of six months with an annualised yield of 14.3 per cent.
Mr Peter Schupp, risk manager at Volkswagen, said that the issue was a pilot
launch and could lead to further local financing.
Creditanstalt-SP Securities, a 60 per cent-owned subsidiary of
Creditanstalt, placed the securities privately. The largest buyers were
domestic institutions and banks, said Mr Nigel Williams, the manager of the
Prague-based company.
'Local investors have been happy to buy the paper because they offer greater
liquidity and certainty of payment. In a country where a bank transfer can
take up to three weeks, surety of payment is worth a lot,' he said.
'This form of borrowing will especially be available for the 20 or so
internationally-known names which have invested or are intending to invest
in Czechoslovakia,' he added.
The company successfully placed a first tranche of Kcs200m-worth of
six-month paper for Pilsner Breweries of northern Bohemia last year.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bank of America lifts
divestitures to Dollars 7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of America yesterday revised sharply upwards - from Dollars 4bn to
Dollars 7bn - the size of divestitures it plans to make in connection with
its merger with Security Pacific, the troubled Los Angeles-based bank.
Mr Dick Rosenberg, chairman of Bank of America, had said that problem loans
and other assets would be placed in a Dollars 4bn 'bad bank' that would be
separated from the merged bank and assigned to Bank of America shareholders
as a distinct entity.
Estimates of this 'bad bank' were contained in merger filings with the
Federal Reserve that have now been revised in a new filing to around Dollars
7bn.
Bank of America yesterday said the increase reflects revisions it has made
in its plans to divest branches and deposits in certain markets in which
Bank of America and Security Pacific currently compete.
Divestitures are planned in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington.
The revised plan would not affect the term of the Dollars 4.2bn merger, the
largest in US banking history.
Analysts, however, speculated that the increase in the size of the bad bank
also reflected the deterioration of Security Pacific's own balance sheet,
and possibly Bank of America's as well, in light of the worsening recession
in California.
Mr George Salem of Prudential Bache, said the Dollars 7bn figure showed that
Bank of America's original Dollars 4bn assessment was 'too optimistic'.
In earlier filings, Bank of America had said it expects it will take a
Dollars 250m restructuring charge in connection with the merger as well as
setting up a Dollars 900m reserve for merger-related purposes.
The merger with Security Pacific, which is scheduled to be completed by the
end of next month, will create the largest commercial bank on the west coast
and the second biggest in the US after Citicorp, with Dollars 180bn of total
assets and a network (before divestitures) of 2,400 branches.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEGHIN-SAY, the French sugar and foods concern controlled by Italy's
Ferruzzi group, has bought Ducros, the family-owned French foods group
specialising in spices, condiments and infusions.
Ducros, which had sales of FFr1.6bn (Dollars 290m) in 1990, is Europe's
leading supplier of spices. The company is the market leader in France,
Italy, Spain and Portugal, while having significant market shares in other
parts of Europe and in Africa, according to Ferruzzi.
A price for the deal, in which Beghin-Say was advised by Colker, Gelardin, a
new private investment bank, has not been disclosed.
Ferruzzi is preparing a complex merger between Beghin-Say and Eridania,
which is still subject to separate court-approved valuations in France and
Italy and has yet to be approved by shareholders.
The purchase of Ducros will increase Eridania-Beghin-Say's coverage of the
European foods business, where the group already has a commanding position
in the market for sugar and edible oils.
Following the acquisition, Beghin-Say's turnover is set to rise to over
FFr8bn. Meanwhile, the deal offers Ducros access to the Ferruzzi group's
financial resources in order to stimulate further growth.
Ducros offers complementary technological expertise to Beghin-Say.
Ferruzzi, which is in the process of divesting a number of activities, has
identified the agro-industrial business, grouped under its Eridania
subsidiary, as one of its core businesses.
'The group sees value in further acquisitions on a case by case basis,' said
one banker closely involved in the latest deal.

HAWTIN, the Cardiff-based leisure, building products and property group, saw
pre-tax profit drop 7 per cent, from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 1.4m, in the year
to September 30 1991.
The leisure and fitness side, now the largest division, had performed well,
said Mr Phillip Dovey, managing director, and its current trading was better
than expected helped by recent acquisitions such as Ultrabronz and Aston
ocean.
However, the property and building materials side took a beating last year
and Hawtin was looking to reduce this sector while seeking to expand its
leisure and fitness businesses, together swith the associated textiles
concern whose output was largely aimed at the leisure industry.
Income from rents in the property division was ahead 'substantially,' Mr
Dovey said, but there was no profit on property sales. The building products
side suffered its worst trading conditions ever, but managed to stay in
profit.
Earnings slipped to 1.71p (1.75p). The proposed dividend is 0.86p (0.825p).

<TEXT>
TRINITY International, the Chester-based publisher of the Liverpool Daily
Post and Echo and local weekly newspapers in the US, Canada, north-west
England and North Wales, is to sell its papermaking and packaging division
to Danish Paper Packaging for Pounds 27m cash.
The division has been a big profit earnerbut has been struggling in the
recession. It made Pounds 5.42m out of the group's Pounds 18.2m in 1990,
compared with Pounds 6.05m out of Pounds 17.7m in 1989. The price paid by
Danish suggest the 1991 performance will turn out below Pounds 4m.
Trinity had been deliberating about investing Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m to keep
the business competitive. Its main product is the corrugated board used in
cardboard boxes for bottled goods. Trinity went into the business in 1961,
when it started to diversify out of its economically threatened Merseyside
base.
With the packaging industry consolidating throughout Europe and becoming
dominated by larger, specialised groups, Trinity decided to divest. It will
continue to look for acquisitions to expand its core media interests.
Mr David Snedden, chief executive, said yesterday: 'We could not be certain
of adequately rewarding our shareholders by spending more money on
papermaking and packaging. We intend to stick to the communications game."
Trinity yesterday also announced a series of senior appointments signalling
the management succession of Mr Snedden, and Mr Christopher Czilinsky,
managing director of the Liverpool Daily Post
Mr Philip Graf, group corporate development director, will become deputy
chief executive next month. Mr Snedden retires next year. Mr Czilinsky, who
retires in a few weeks, will be succeeded by Mr Leo Coligan.
Last year Trinity backed Mr Phil Redmond, the television programme-maker, in
his rejected bid for the Granada TV franchise. It also applied to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission for permission to bid for Southern
Newspapers, the Southampton-based printing, property and publishing group.
This led to Reed, Emap, and Westminster Press ' part of Pearson, owner of
the Financial Times ' also seeking clearance to bid. But the price of
Southern's shares then rose to 295p, so no bid was made. The price has since
fallen to 245p. The groups can again decide whether to bid in the summer,
after a six-month interval.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert plunges into the red - Finance
director on 'paid leave' as dividend is halved to 2p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JACQUES VERT, the womenswear group, is replacing its finance director after
falling sales and rising costs plunged the company into loss for the six
months to October 26 1991.
The interim dividend is halved to 2p; the joint chairmen are waiving their
dividend entitlement in respect of their 57.9 per cent stake in the company.
The level of payment at the year-end will be 'considered in the light of
circumstances pertaining at the time of the preliminary announcement in July
1992', the company said.
The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 125,000, compared with a profit
of Pounds 1.23m last time. The shares fell from 193p to 116p.
The company blamed 'extremely tough' trading conditions for a fall in sales
and a sharp rise in air freight charges following the Gulf war for the
higher costs.
Sales at its 22 UK shops dropped by 6.5 per cent.
The result was a fall in gross margin from 43.4 per cent to 39.5 per cent.
'We have now introduced an early warning system for margin control,' said Mr
David Tiedeman, managing director, yesterday. He said that the previous
system for monitoring the margins 'had failed'.
The company said yesterday that 'after three years with the group, latterly
as finance director, Sashi Mylvaganam is no longer carrying out his
executive duties.'
Mr Tiedeman said Mr Mylvaganam was on paid leave and that a temporary
replacement had been seconded from the company's auditors.
The board is undertaking a strategic review of the group's operations with
particular emphasis on manufacturing, overheads and brand development.
Turnover for the six months slipped from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 19.7m, and
the company registered losses per share of 0.8p (earnings 8.1p).
With the tightening of cash management, gearing fell to 51 per cent (65 per
cent).
Directors said that while there were 'few signs of abatement in the
recession', the second half of the year was traditionally stronger.
The company has nevertheless shelved plans to increase the number of shops
beyond the current 25.

potential of Colombian field
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM has stepped up efforts to evaluate its Cusiana oil find in
Colombia, potentially one of the world's largest oil discoveries containing
as much as 2bn barrels of oil.
The company is to spend Dollars 200m (Pounds 112m) on drilling new wells in
the region to appraise the Cusiana field - which it discovered last year -
and to look for oil in the surrounding area.
BP has highlighted the importance of its Colombia find by assigning Mr David
Harding - currently head of exploration in Europe  - to head the programme
in Colombia and lead the company's South American operations.
The company also plans to expand its workforce in the region from 120 to 500
people by the end of the year.
Mr John Browne, BP Exploration chief executive, called the planned appraisal
programme a 'very considerable undertaking,' which over the course of the
year would establish a reliable estimate of recoverable reserves.
The company plans to have 10 drilling rigs operating in Colombia this year.
BP has a 40 per cent stake in the Cusiana field, with French group Total
holding another 40 per cent and Triton, a US independent oil and gas
company, 20 per cent.
Under Colombian licencing terms, the state oil group Ecopetrol has the right
to take a 50 per cent interest if a discovery is developed.
BP needs a substantial discovery to boost its portfolio of reserves, most of
which are concentrated in the mature oil-producing areas of the North Sea
and Alaska.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard declines 29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELLIS &amp; EVERARD, the chemicals distribution company, yesterday reported its
first profits decline in 10 years, with the interim return down 29 per cent
to Pounds 7.5m.
Mr Peter Wood, managing director, warned that conditions continued to be
difficult in the second half, and said it was likely that the group would
report lower profits for the full year.
'We assume that the underlying level of demand will remain depressed for the
remainder of the financial year,' he said.
The impact of the recession on the group's non-core, higher margin
businesses - swimming pool chemicals and surface cleaning products  - took
the heaviest toll. These operations accounted for about Pounds 1.5m of the
overall Pounds 3m decline in profits.
The US, where operating profits fell by about 24 per cent, accounted for a
further Pounds 1m of the pre-tax decline. The remaining profit fall was due
to losses of about Pounds 400,000 at the Spanish operations.
Mr Michael Marshall, chairman, said the group had concentrated on reducing
costs in the first half and had maintained them virtually at 1990 levels.
This would imply that Pounds 1.5m had been trimmed from total costs - before
acquisitions, said Mr Wood. Some 5 per cent of jobs had also been cut.
Mr Wood stressed that the performance of the core UK commodity chemicals
businesses had proved the group's long-held maxim that distribution
companies benefited in times of recession. The theory is that customers will
switch to buying smaller quantities from distributors rather than in bulk
from manufacturers.
In the UK, profits declined by just 2 per cent, he said. In the US, chemical
distributors form a larger share of the overall chemicals market, and thus
do not benefit as much from an economic downturn.
Acquisitions, which were largely responsible for the 10 per cent increase in
group sales to Pounds 198m, contributed little to profits.
Mr Wood said the group saw its future growth and focus in the 'heartland
commodity chemicals business'. However, he would not be drawn on whether the
group intended to put the non-core businesses up for sale.
Interest charges rose from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 1m. Mr Wood said debt -
about Pounds 16m at the half year, or 25 per cent geared  - would be reduced
by the year-end. Earnings per share fell by 30 per cent to 6.7p. The interim
dividend is held at 2.25p.
COMMENT
It looks like this will be a dull year for Ellis &amp; Everard. At least the
declines of the second half have been halted. The group appears to be
bumping along the bottom - a condition it might be able to maintain for some
time yet. Ellis &amp; Everard has maintained its market share and simply has
along with everyone else. Forecasts for the full year are pitched at Pounds
14m, making a prospective p/e of about 15. This looks a little high for the
moment, given the economic uncertainty.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Cabra arm issues writ against Chelsea FC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH Court writ has been issued against Chelsea Football Club demanding
that it pay Pounds 22.85m to buy its Stamford Bridge ground in west London.
Mr John Duggan, chairman of Cabra Estates, the property company that owns
the ground, repeated yesterday that Chelsea would be evicted if it did not
complete the purchase.
The writ was obtained by SB Property Company, a subsidiary of Cabra. Mr
Duggan said he had arranged for it to be served on Friday. This would give
Chelsea until January 23 to pay or contest the claim.
Cabra said the independent valuation of Pounds 22.85m, in late November, had
finalised a contract for Chelsea to buy the ground. In March Cabra had net
debts of Pounds 52m.
Mr Duggan said yesterday: 'I want to get paid and to take the shortest route
so that I do get paid. If they don't pay, we will kick them out.'
Mr Duggan added that 'fruitful discussions' had continued with Chelsea. He
had had lunch with Mr Ken Bates, Chelsea's chairman, on Friday.
The parties had exchanged promises 'not to be controversial'. Mr Duggan
understood that Mr Bates had gone to Hong Kong as part of his efforts to
raise the money. He also believed there had been some talks with a UK bank.
Mr Bates was described by his public relations aide as being 'on a working
holiday for three weeks'. He had left on Sunday and the Far East was thought
to be on the itinerary, as well as a cruise ship.
Mr Bates has contended that the net amount to be paid for the Stamford
Bridge site could be reduced by such factors as: Pounds 5m from Fulham FC, a
potential ground sharer; the value of Chelsea's stake in SB Property; and a
settlement of Chelsea's outstanding legal actions against Cabra.

Pre-tax profits at Newcastle Building Society rose by 12 per cent to Pounds
12.5m during 1991, up from Pounds 11.2m.
Total assets of the society, which ranked 30th by size in 1990, were Pounds
973m, up 14 per cent on 1990, and will reach Pounds 1bn by March 31 1992,
the society said. Its free capital ratio rose to 4.57 per cent (4.39 per
cent).
'These results show the strength of the medium-sized society and its ability
to compete in the hardest markets. Only the strong can survive but with
these results behind us we are confident that we can,' said Mr Bill Midgley,

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fletcher King declines to Pounds 108,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fletcher King, the commercial estate agent and surveyor, saw pre-tax profits
decline from Pounds 433,000 to Pounds 108,000 in the six months to October
31.
Mr David Fletcher, chairman, said that while the results were 'disappointing
by comparison with the corresponding period last year', they were 'slightly
higher than in the second half of the year'.
He added that the property market in 1992 was likely to remain difficult and
that in the first half political uncertainty would exacerbate an already
fragile market.
The volume of transactions in the period under review fell by 18 per cent
and as the value of properties handled also declined, turnover was adversely
affected, falling from Pounds 3.77m to Pounds 2.68m.
Earnings fell to 0.8p (3.1p) per share. The interim dividend is cut from
1.8p to 0.5p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Real Time Control dropped from Pounds 661,000 to Pounds
507,000 in the half year to September 29 1991.
Turnover fell from Pounds 4.36m to Pounds 3m - but that could be attributed
to a change in the timing of deliveries, said Mr Byron Carrell, chairman.
The principal contribution came from supplying electronic point of sale
systems. The group entered the second half with a good order book and Mr
Carrell is hoping for a full year result in line with last year's record
Pounds 1.2m.
Earnings worked through at 4.9p (6.1p).

<TEXT>
'DESPITE the economic conditions being the worst in Dalepak Foods' 16-year
history', the food manufacturer continued its steady progress with a 42 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 1991.
In the corresponding period they rose by 71 per cent and in the year to
April 30 1991 by 57 per cent.
This time taxable profits of Pounds 1.71m (Pounds 1.2m) were struck on
turnover fractionally ahead at Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 21.1m). Turnover in
continuing activities was up 15 per cent, with Dalepak and Fawcetts, the
frozen food businesses, rising 14 and 16 per cent respectively.
The company said that its traditional meat grillsteak market grew 8 per cent
in the half after several years of decline. The markets for its
vegetable-based products grew rapidly, stimulated by new product launches
and heavy marketing expenditure.
The interest bill fell to Pounds 15,000 (Pounds 148,000) and earnings
emerged at 10.13p (6.99p) per share. The interim dividend is lifted to 1.5p
(1.2p), an increase of 25 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Excalibur static at Pounds 2.01m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCALIBUR GROUP, the jewellery manufacturer, music merchandiser and
engineer, yesterday played down its reliance on retail jewellery when
reporting flat interim profits.
The group said it agreed with last week's estimate by the Ratners Group that
sales were down about 15 per cent over the Christmas period, but said only
about a fifth of its annual jewellery sales of Pounds 20m went to the
troubled retail chain, Britain's biggest.
Excalibur's pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.01m, compared with Pounds 2.05m,
although sales for the six months to October 31 rose from Pounds 30.9m to
Pounds 33.4m.
The group said difficulties in the jewellery market were offset by solid
performances in giftware and merchandising.
In precision engineering, the aerospace business performed well in difficult
circumstances, with customers putting pressure on margins. The order book
was satisfactory, and the group was optimistic that the worst of the
recession had passed for this division.
In industrial products, the group had decided to withdraw from the
low-margin transmission business undertaken by its Clarke and Hi-Ton
operations. Costs of Pounds 993,00 associated with this closure were taken
as an extraordinary item.
Gearing at the half-year was 69 per cent. Interest charges fell from Pounds
1.2m to Pounds 1m.
Because of an increased number of shares in issue following a Pounds 8.5m
rights issue, earnings per share fell from 3.4p to 2.4p. The interim
dividend is held at 0.4p.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Recession leaves Evode halved at Pounds
7.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVODE GROUP, the adhesives, coatings and plastics concern, continued to
suffer from a harsh trading environment which resulted in halved pre-tax
profits of Pounds 7.3m for the year to September 28, against Pounds 15.2m.
Turnover was higher at Pounds 279m (Pounds 271.4m), although the figure fell
by 6 per cent if divestments and acquisitions last year are taken into
account.
After dividend payments, the group incurred a retained loss of Pounds 1.8m,
against profits of Pounds 3.2m, for the year.
The group, which derived 47 per cent of sales last year in the UK, said that
the UK economy was in a worse state than that of the US or Australasia.
Overseas trading had improved in the second half of last year, but a
recovery in the UK could not be expected unless confidence improved, Mr
David Winterbottom, group chief executive, said.
The group is recommending a lower final dividend of 1.8p making a total of
3.58p (6.42p). Fully diluted earnings per share were 3.8p (11.4p) or 0.5p
(10.6p) basic.
The industrial coatings division was affected by the 17 per cent fall in the
UK powder coatings market. Last year was the first time in 10 years that
there has been anything but steady growth, Mr Winterbottom said.
The footwear division suffered not only from recession in the UK but from
the disappearance of the Iraqi market which it supplies, due to the Gulf
war.
In addition, Evode was still suffering the effects of its acquisition of
Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe components group, in 1989 for nearly Pounds
89m. Partly as a result gearing has risen to 78 per cent with net debt of
Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 41.8m).
COMMENT
The outlook for companies heavily dependent on UK markets remains very
uncertain and Evode is rightly cautious about prospects for the current
year. It is unfortunate that it has had to spend so much time and expense
sorting out problems at Chamberlain Phipps just as business was hit by the
recession. That exercise left Evode with an uncomfortably high level of
gearing, which would be even higher at about 200 per cent if the preference
shares are considered as debt.
Evode has managed to avoid passing its dividend this year, and looking ahead
to when that UK recovery comes, it has all the catchings of a strong
recovery play. But until there is some evidence of possible disposals to cut
borrowings and prospects of an uplift in the UK, there is little in the
short term to move the shares above current levels.
With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 9m, and earnings per share of 3.8p
the shares, at 56p, give a multiple of nearly 15 which is high enough.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Stanley to sue over Pounds 100m
Canary Wharf deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN STANLEY, the US bank, is suing Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian
developer, over the timing of a deal worth more than Pounds 100m.
The dispute centres on Morgan Stanley's office block - at Canary Wharf in
London's Docklands - which was the subject of a sale and leaseback agreement
with Olympia &amp; York in 1990.
Morgan Stanley claims that it should have already received the proceeds from
the sale and leaseback. Olympia &amp; York, however, believes that it is not
required to complete the deal until the end of June.
The companies are not arguing about the sum involved, which they would not
disclose. The dispute concerns the interpretation of an option agreement,
which Morgan Stanley believed it had the right to exercise at the end of
last year.
Olympia &amp; York has also taken Morgan Stanley to court to press its own
interpretation of the agreement. The two sides are attempting to reach a
settlement out of court, although there is no sign of an imminent
conclusion.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Thornton agrees Pounds 14.6m Bromsgrove bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering
conglomerate, yesterday announced its expected agreed takeover of GW
Thornton Holdings.
The shares or cash deal values the Sheffield-based engineer at Pounds 14.6m.
Bromsgrove also announced a fully underwritten 1-for-4 rights issue at 105p
per share to raise Pounds 10.75m. This should eliminate gearing, which, at
the end of last September, was 31 per cent.
The new shares, both those issued through the rights and those issued to
Thornton shareholders, will attract a fractionally higher final dividend for
1991-92 than Bromsgrove paid in the previous year. A proposed final of 2.5p
brings the year's total to 4p (3.9p) on the enlarged capital.
The acquisition terms, which because of their acceptance by Thornton
directors, advised by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance, mean that Bromsgrove
has control of 55 per cent of its target's equity, are seven new Bromsgrove
shares for every four Thornton; this values each Thornton share at 220.15p
against a suspension price on January 6 of 150p. There is a cash alternative
of 200p per share.
Responding to the suggestion that such a price looked expensive in
historical terms, Mr Steven Mills, Bromsgrove chief executive, said 'In
prospective terms we have not undertaken acquisitions which have been
earnings-diluting.'
The main attraction of Thornton for Bromsgrove is its precision forging
side. Thornton's aerospace activities dovetail with those of Bromsgrove,
while at the same time, Thornton's manufacture of orthopaedic equipment like
hip and knee joints takes Bromsgrove into a new engineering sector.
The acquisition would have lifted gearing to an unhealthy level. Hence the
rights issue, underwritten by Albert E Sharp. The rights price compared with
Bromsgrove's suspension price on January 6 of 131p.
Thornton, in the year to last September, made pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.6m.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Fresh financial scandal hits Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARREST last night of a former Japanese cabinet minister for alleged
bribe-taking has raised serious doubts about the leadership of Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister.
The latest in a series of financial scandals to hit Japan. the arrest has
also added weight to popular perceptions that Japanese politics remains
riddled with corruption.
Mr Fumio Abe, 69, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party
(LDP), was charged with having received Y80m (Dollars 630,000) from Kyowa
Corp, a property developer, in return for providing the company with
confidential planning information, and for unlawfully assisting it to obtain
low-interest loans.
The arrest is particularly embarrassing for Mr Miyazawa, since the
high-profile Mr Abe was secretary-general of the prime minister's faction
until last month. Mr Abe also played an important role in the campaign
leading up to the premier's appointment.
Last night Mr Miyazawa described the arrest of Mr Abe as 'regrettable', but
denied an allegation that the Miyazawa faction ultimately received Y120m in
'political donations' given to Mr Abe by Kyowa.
The prime minister said action would be taken to prevent a recurrence of
bribery scandals, but provided no details of his plans.
Mr Abe checked himself into a Tokyo hospital yesterday, but prosecutors
decided that he was capable of answering questions. Other investigators
raided his home and offices.
The alleged bribes, part of an estimated Y500m given to Mr Abe by Kyowa,
apparently took place after he became director general of the Hokkaido
Development Agency in August 1989. At this time he was a member of the
so-called 'clean cabinet' of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, former prime minister.
Mr Abe's home is in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's main islands, and
Kyowa, which had been a maker of steel frames, was interested in development
projects on the island.
It is alleged that Mr Abe's office provided confidential information about a
planned motorway, and that Kyowa intended to buy property along the route.
It is also alleged that Kyowa, which collapsed with outstanding debts of
Y200bn in late 1990, was given confidential information about a proposed
stadium complex in Hokkaido and received assistance from Mr Abe in obtaining
low-interest loans from Hokkaido-Tohoku Corp, a semi-government institution.
The case again highlights the chronic problem of 'money politics', cited as
the cause of the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal which led to the
resignation of Mr Noboru Takeshita as prime minister in April 1989.
Parliamentarians complain that Japanese politics is an expensive business,
and that even well-meaning politicians are tempted to take illegal
donations. Mr Abe allegedly used Kyowa money to pay off debts and to fund a
re-election campaign.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Demand for credit shrinks as consumers repay debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RELUCTANCE of British consumers to borrow, reflected in official figures
released yesterday, underlines expectations of a slow economic recovery.
Demand for credit shrank in the three months to November, when consumers
made a net repayment of Pounds 216m.
This compared with net borrowings of Pounds 183m in the previous three
months.
In November, the latest monthly figure available, consumers made a net
repayment of Pounds 33m on credit agreements with finance houses, building
societies, and on bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard
system. This followed a net repayment of Pounds 76m in October.
According to the seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical
Office, November was the fourth successive month in which consumers made a
net repayment.
The previous increase in outstanding credit was in July when consumers added
Pounds 187m to their overall debts.
The amount of new credit advanced to consumers in November was Pounds 3.74bn
 -the lowest since June. In October new credit advanced was Pounds 4bn.
Consumers, chastened by rising unemployment and high interest rates, appear
to be making the repayment of expensive debts accrued in the 1980s a
priority.
Although the low credit figures are bad news for the government, which is
hoping for a consumer-led recovery, government ministers will have been
heartened by a small upwards revision in retail sales volumes for November.
Revised figures for retail sales in November, seasonally adjusted, showed a
1.3 per cent increase on October. However, in the three months to November
the volume of retail sales was down 0.3 per cent on the previous three
months.
Household goods, which are particularly sensitive indicators of consumer
confidence, were down 2 per cent on the previous three months, while
clothing and footwear were down by 3 per cent.
Lack of consumer confidence was further highlighted by the figures for
credit card debt where the amount outstanding increased by Pounds 50m in
November against Pounds 69m in October.
In the three months to November the amount outstanding increased by only
Pounds 45m, compared with an increase of Pounds 173m in the previous three
months.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers International in
London, said he expected to see the emphasis on paying off debts continue
into this year.
'Consumer spending is being maintained by the run down of personal sector
bank deposits rather than through increased borrowing,' he said.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said economists
were taking a very cautious view of consumer spending, and consequently
revising their GDP forecasts downwards.

FT  14 JAN 92 / EC farm stance seen as biggest threat to Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Community objections to the draft agreement on farm subsidies
reform proposed last month may still wreck the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
Countries taking part in the trade liberalisation talks yesterday
unanimously agreed to work for successful completion of the talks by Easter.
But the EC is still opposed to the draft agreement on farm trade reform -
the most crucial of the 26 draft accords concluded last month.
The draft was prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), after the US and the EC failed to
reach agreement following weeks of intensive talks. The Community's stance
is seen by negotiators as by far the most threatening.
The EC was not entirely without support at yesterday's meeting of the
top-level Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) called to decide the future of
the five-year-old round. Japan, South Korea, Canada and Switzerland were
among participants also expressing serious reservations about proposals in
the agriculture text.
Mr Dunkel, who is also chairman of the TNC, said he was prepared to serve as
'honest broker' in the resolution of outstanding differences. He warned,
however, that any move to adjust the 436-page text 'must be very precise and
concentrated entirely on what we all can collectively agree to without
unravelling the package'.
'I have no new - or better - solutions to offer on my own,' he added.
President Bush of the US said yesterday that he was not pessimistic about
the chances of reaching a Gatt agreement, but he vowed to reject any deal on
global trading rules which failed to lower farm subsidies in Europe. At a
meeting with leaders of the American Farm Bureau Federation in Kansas City,
he said he would not take to the Congress a deal that was silent on
agriculture or unfavourable to American farmers.
In a deliberately low-key statement, Mr Tran van Thinh, head of the EC
delegation in Geneva, said the Community had serious difficulties with the
agriculture text - which would have to be 'significantly improved'. It was
also unhappy about some aspects of the rule-making accords. But the EC was
ready to continue negotiations on the basis of Mr Dunkel's proposed
timetable.
There remain serious doubts over whether other countries will be prepared to
reopen the farm subsidy talks as the Community wants.
The US and most members of 14-strong Cairns Group of farm exporters are
backing the current draft. If anything, they would like tighter disciplines.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the draft final agreement
contained the basic ingredients for finalising the round, even though in
places it did not go as far as Washington would have liked.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Yeltsin may see Major before talks: Russian leader's
presence at UN summit will let members voice concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major has invited President Boris Yeltsin to visit London on his way
to a United Nations security council summit in New York, now confirmed for
the end of this month.
In the short visit, which has yet to be finalised, the two leaders will
discuss a range of issues, including Russia's application for full
membership of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The news of the invitation was seen at Westminster as highlighting the prime
minister's role on the world stage in the run-up to the election,
particularly as it coincided with Tory demands for greater clarity in
Labour's defence policy.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the government of
'looking for a photo-opportunity not an agenda'.
Speaking in Downing Street after a meeting with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
who took over as UN secretary-general at the beginning of this month, Mr
Major said the meeting, on January 31, would both be the first occasion for
Mr Yeltsin to attend the security council as Russian president, and an early
opportunity for security council members to discuss a range of matters with
the new secretary-general.
It will also enable security council members to discuss with Mr Yeltsin
concerns about the effective control of the former Soviet Union's nuclear
weapons following the country's dissolution into independent republics.
There are particular worries that the smaller independent former Soviet
republics might sell off some of their nuclear weapons and technology to
foreign buyers.
Mr Major singled out as other key subjects for discussion the enhancement of
the UN's role as a 'peacemaker, peacekeeper and settler of disputes' in
regional conflicts; and the 'very great importance the UN generally gives to
good government and human rights'. As the UK took over the rotating
presidency of the security council at the start of the month, Mr Major will
chair the general meeting.
Mr Major himself said yesterday that he did not claim credit for the idea of
the meeting, which came from President Mitterrand of France some months ago,
but that he was confident in view of the warm response it had received that
it was 'an idea whose time has come'.
His remarks came after both Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, and Mr
Tom King, the defence secretary, renewed their demands for Labour to 'come
clean' on its defence policy.
Underlining that the opposition had failed to produce a document on defence
despite more than 70 policy launches in the past two years, Mr Patten said
Labour's position was merely 'to sit on the fence and say as little as
possible.'
But Mr Kaufman countered by charging the government with calling a 'stunt
debate' for electoral purposes while ignoring the key issues raised by the
break-up of the Soviet union.
Tabling an amendment to the motion for debate in the Commons today, he
demanded substantive government action to address the issues of nuclear
proliferation, arms control and defence diversification.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Personal view: A fairer way to fund public transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financing of British public transport is in a mess. More investment is
desirable because demand for public transport grew unexpectedly fast in the
1980s, while projects such as the Channel Tunnel and the redevelopment of
London's docklands will give rise to even more demand. But these projects
have failed to attract significant private funds as the government had
hoped; at the same time the government's desire to control public
expenditure has limited the amount of public capital that it is prepared to
invest.
Many believe that public expenditure on transport should be increased. The
Labour party has proposed that public corporations should be able to borrow
directly from the private sector. But there must always be some limit on
public expenditure; merely changing the method of borrowing does not alter
its economic consequences. The real requirement is to make the investment
more profitable, and the way to do so is to collect more payments from those
who benefit.
The paradox of investment in public transport is that it can create
substantial benefits, especially around cities, yet produces low financial
returns because the operator cannot charge many of the beneficiaries of its
investment. The users of new or improved services can be made to contribute
to the cost in fares, but they cannot be made to pay all the costs of a new
underground line, for example. The cost of construction is so high that
profit may be unattainable. But the other beneficiaries, the landlords and
developers who own property in the area served by the the service, can
rarely be made to pay anything for their gains.
These gains are represented by increases in the value of property from
improved access, or decreases in value avoided by preventing deterioration
in access. Property owners in cities have for decades been subsidised by the
private and public sector financiers of transport systems, who have made
possible the expansion of city-centre activities but have not profited from
their pains.
Where a large new development is undertaken, such as that at Canary Wharf in
London's docklands, specific improvements in transport will be essential to
the commercial success of the project. One or a few developers can then be
identified as the beneficiaries from the improved transport, and they can
then be expected to pay for their gains.
The government has recently attempted to apply this principle by seeking
contributions from developers towards the cost of extending London
Transport's railway system into docklands, but the amounts collected have
been small. The extension of the Jubilee line is expected to increase the
rents achievable at Olympia and York's Canary Wharf development; but Olympia
and York and British Gas - which owns land that the extension will serve -
have contributed only 17 per cent of its cost. Olympia and York has also
contributed about 40 per cent of the Pounds 110m spent on improving the
Docklands Light Railway, which will be the only railway serving Canary Wharf
when it is completed.
Substantial contributions can only be obtained if negotiations start before
either the developer or the transport authority have committed themselves to
any expenditure. If the developer is to be expected to pay much, he must
understand that the improvements will not be made without his support; and
if he is to pay for them, he needs to know what they will cost when
forecasting his profits. Once a commitment has been given to build a new
line, little can be collected from developers along its route.
Improving the sources of finance for general investment in urban public
transport depends on some means of collecting the smaller benefits which
each landlord receives from the existence of such a system, and from any
subsequent improvements. These small benefits cannot easily be identified or
collected from landlords. A tax paid by landlords therefore seems the most
suitable method of appropriating a share in these benefits for the operator
of the transport system.
Such a property tax would be a supplement to the business rate, but paid by
the holder of the head lease or the freehold of each property. The size of
this charge should be determined locally, not nationally, because its level
would represent a choice between burdens on local travellers and burdens on
local landlords, which would best be decided by the representatives they
elect.
Increased property values in a city created by improvements in local
transport are likely to reflect transfers of business to that city from
other parts of the country, rather than any increase in the national level
of output.
These benefits are therefore more appropriately financed by local than
national taxation. If national taxes are used to support transport in
cities, funds will be transferred from the poorer to the richer districts
and individuals in the country, and to companies which - outside the present
slump - have been among the more profitable.
The proposed method of financing public transport would ensure that it was
paid for by those who benefited from it. Such a system would be efficient as
well as equitable; the beneficiaries could influence the level of
expenditure through their payments and their elected representatives.
Transport operators would invest if their expected revenue from fares, the
property tax and any direct payments from developers would make the
investment profitable. Developers would only launch big projects if they
would be profitable after contributing to the cost of the transport they
would need.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Dragon looks for re-kindled fire: South Korea is seeking to
regain its strength in export markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Koreans are coming,' warned the cover story of Business Week in December
1985, predicting the imminent arrival of a wave of Korean exports in western
markets.
Come they did. The next three years saw one of the most dynamic export
drives since 1945. Overseas sales of Korean goods, from cars to computers,
doubled from Dollars 30.28bn in 1985 to Dollars 60.7bn in 1988. The world
was braced for a second Japan.
But the second Japan did not arrive. Instead, in the new decade there was a
sharp slowdown in export growth and a fall in exports to Japan and the US,
Korea's most important markets. Last year, this trend continued. Exports to
the US fell by about 7 per cent. Exports to Japan struggled to match levels
achieved in 1990.
So was Korea's assault on western markets just a flash in the pan? Or is its
export machine merely pausing for breath, rebuilding its competitiveness
before another surge of dynamic export growth?
On both counts the answer is likely to be no. The expansion of the 1980s is
unlikely to be repeated. Competition from lower cost Asian rivals such as
Malaysia, Thailand and China, combined with difficulties in upgrading the
quality of its products, will constrain what was once the fiercest of Asia's
'dragon' economies.
However, at the same time, Korea's retreat in international markets may also
be nearing an end. The next few years should reverse the trend of declining
competitiveness and lay the foundation for a more sustainable, if more
moderate, export performance.
The difficulties which have stifled the roar of the Korean export dragon are
easily explained. The introduction of democracy in 1987 heralded an
explosion in manufacturing wages and a wave of industrial unrest as
long-repressed workers demanded their share of Korea's economic miracle.
Combined with a steady appreciation of the exchange rate, which climbed from
Won846 to the US dollar in 1987 to Won666 to the dollar in 1989, the result
was a sudden loss of price competitiveness.
'Any one of these factors on their own would have been difficult to absorb,'
says Mr Suh Sang Mok, one of the top economic policy-makers in the ruling
Democratic Liberal party. 'What really hurt was that these shocks came
together.'
If the causes were easy to identify, so were the solutions. Most important
was the need to increase productivity through investment in automation and
new capital equipment and to improve the quality and sophistication of
Korea's export products. This would allow exporters to regain their price
edge, keep a step ahead of new competitors from south-east Asia and to
expand profit margins on their sales in overseas markets.
But these adjustments have proved difficult.
Part of the problem is that Korean industry has relatively little experience
in product development and innovation. This is largely the result of the
pattern of its industrialisation, which was achieved through the acquisition
of foreign technology and which was started only after the end of the
1950-53 Korean war.
'Weakness in engineering sciences and their application is one of our
biggest problems,' says Mr Lee Dae Un, director of advanced engineering at
Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car manufacturer. 'Just one generation ago
Korea was an agricultural society.'
Management attitudes have also been slow to change from the successful
formula of the 1980s. In particular, the large conglomerates which dominate
the economy have continued to pursue strategies of diversification and
volume production as opposed to increased specialisation in specific
industries.
'The top executives of the large business groups are basically merchants,'
argues one foreign businessmen in Seoul. 'They built their empires through
large-scale production of consumer items and then found markets for them.
But that no longer works. They have to be more responsive to the customer
and pay more attention to the engineering and design of their goods.'
The problems involved in industrial restructuring are compounded by a
scarcity of financial resources. Prime lending rates at Korea's commercial
banks are fixed at 12.5 per cent. But these loans are restricted, forcing
companies to unofficial 'kerb' markets where interest rates are as high as
20 per cent.
Yet the worst may now be over. The cost rises of the late 1980s are
gradually being absorbed, while there are signs that the declining
competitiveness of Korean products is also being reversed.
'We are at a juncture where things are beginning to look up,' says Mr Kim
Chul Su, president of Kotra, a government agency which promotes exports. His
optimism is supported by some hopeful trends:
Productivity increases have caught up with pay increases. The Economic
Planning Board, the most powerful economics ministry, estimates that last
year, for the first time since 1986, productivity increases outpaced
earnings growth.
The rate of wage increases, which saw the average manufacturing worker
double his earnings between the end of 1986 and the end of 1990, have
started to fall.
There has been a marked improvement in industrial relations. The number of
strikes, which disrupted production so severely between 1987 and 1989, has
fallen sharply. Last year, there were fewer than 240 strikes, a sharp
decline from the 1,610 in 1989.
The exchange rate has been depreciating. From a peak of about Won666 to the
US dollar in 1989, the Korean currency has fallen to about 760 to the
dollar. With an expanding trade deficit, which exceeded Dollars 10bn last
year, further weakening is expected.
Industrialists and business leaders say they are starting to see a recovery
in motivation on the factory floor. 'After the introduction of democracy in
1987, our work ethic disappeared,' says Mr Kim Chong In, chief presidential
economic secretary. 'But now people are beginning to realise the necessity
of re-establishing their working morality.'
These factors will help sharpen Korea's competitiveness, giving exporters,
sandwiched between lower-cost south-east Asian rivals and high-quality
Japanese producers, more room for manoeuvre.
Several Korean companies have also responded to the challenge of upgrading
production. Samsung Electronics has invested heavily in research and
development and is now the equal of the Japanese market leaders in the
production of D-RAM semiconductors, essential components for most electronic
products.
Hyundai Motors, previously dependent on Mitsubishi of Japan for key
components, last year started to fit its cars with its own-designed engines.
A comparison of the Elantra, the stylish new addition to the Hyundai range,
and the humble Pony Excel, which launched the company's export drive in
1986, demonstrates the improvement in quality.
Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motors are exceptional cases. But
improvement is beginning to emerge more broadly. 'After a slow start, there
is a mania for developing technology and developing strategic alliances with
foreign firms,' says Mr Han Duck Soo, director-general for industrial policy
at the ministry of trade and industry.
Mr Han concedes that such adjustments will take time. 'The restructuring of
Korean industry and a greater capability in technological-intensive sectors
cannot be achieved overnight,' he says. Fortunately for Korean industry,
some time is available.
Korean manufacturers are being given a breathing space by a strong domestic
market and by the emergence of new markets overseas. Expansion in Korea's
exports to eastern Europe, China and south-east Asia has eased the pain
suffered in the US and Japan, and accounted for last year's rise of 10 per
cent in total exports.
These new markets do not represent an alternative to Japan and the US. They
have limited purchasing power and are showing signs of slowing demand. But
they do give Korea some leeway as it adjusts to its new role as a
higher-cost manufacturer.
The consensus among government officials, economists from the ruling party
and from the Federation of Korean Industries, the powerful interest group
which represents the country's large conglomerates, is that this adjustment
will take between two and three years. By then, they predict, export growth
will stabilise at annual increases of 10-15 per cent, and the current
account will return to balance.
Such figures would be welcomed by most of the world's economic ministries,
and they are likely to prove more sustainable for Korea's exporters. But
after the heady expansion of the 1980s they will represent a mellowing of
east Asia's meanest export machine.

overlooked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir WILLIAM HARDING

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader-writer ('HK governor', January 9) is jumping the gun. When
he prescribes that the successor to Sir David (now Lord) Wilson will need to
be 'not only an effective representative of departing Britain, but also
alert to the needs of Hong Kong people . . . a politically adept, sensitive,
robust and open chief executive', he is describing the sorely-tried
incumbent himself to a T. But when he adds that the next governor should not
be a symbol of the Raj, he is surely overlooking the quintessential nature
of the office recognised alike by Her Majesty's government, the Chinese
Peoples' government and the people of Hong Kong themselves which must needs
continue right up to the 1997 handover to Peking. Or are we to interpret him
as advocating by implication a headlong rush to autochthonous democracy in
Hong Kong, in which case why does he not say so openly? Whatever the sequel
to the present regime - and none of the candidates so far canvassed appears
to offer the desirable combination of personal qualities, professional
expertise and political nous - long before 1997 the cry will surely go up in
Hong Kong: 'Come back Wilson, all is forgiven]'

FT  14 JAN 92 / Letter: RSPB executive's case for Fisons finding solution on
peat bogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms BARBARA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Fisons' director, Mr D R Peters, (Letters, January 9) describes the
company's peat extraction operation as 'an environmental issue of small
commercial significance'. But since peat extraction has brought Fisons into
direct conflict with Britain's leading environmental organisations, one
might well ask why it is still being continued.
The destruction of peat bogs may be of small significance to Fisons, but
many are sites of prime nature conservation importance, which can suffer
irreplaceable damage through large scale industrial peat extraction. Peat is
not a sustainable resource when mined wholesale from bogs, and companies
operating within Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) must recognise
their wider responsibilities.
Attempts to resolve this conflict require an imaginative and flexible
approach. Some companies have seen the economic sense in developing
alternatives to peat. Retailers, such as B &amp; Q, now offer alternatives while
refusing to stock peat mined from SSSIs.
It would seem to be in Fisons' best interests to reach a solution which does
not damage the remaining peat bogs and secures a wider share of the peat
alternatives market and its shareholders should urge it to do so,

<TEXT>
Sir, In your report on the conclusion of the industrial tribunal hearing of
the case of shop stewards unfairly dismissed by the Port of London Authority
in 1989 ('TGWU Pounds 1.5m to fight dockers' case', December 24) you
accurately draw attention to the support given by the TGWU to its members in
this case, regardless of the great financial costs incurred. In giving this
support the union was clearly discharging its obligations to its members. We
do not put a price on securing justice.
I must, however, take serious exception to your concluding paragraph, which
asserts that such support 'has a political dimension' and implies that I
gave it, as general secretary of the TGWU, because I was in turn supported
by 'mainly left-wing dockers'.
This is a slur on myself and the union. All members, irrespective of their
political views (or any other opinions), have exactly the same right to
support from their union when it is needed. Any shop steward or other
members victimised by their employer in this outrageous way will receive the
unqualified backing of the TGWU in whatever way is necessary to secure
justice. Politics does not enter into it, and the implication that I am more
supportive of those who allegedly support me than those who do not is
grossly inaccurate and unworthy of the Financial Times.

<TEXT>
BEAR HUNTING WITH THE POLITBURO By A. Craig Copetas Simon and Schuster,
Pounds 15.99
Soviet capitalism - a coupling of two words that strikes us as incongruous -
has in the first years of its more or less permitted existence been more
revealing of the effects of communism than of the shape the market might
take in the former USSR.
The principal effect has been that most businesses - except those few which,
with western assistance, can work at the very top end of the market (in
consulting, accountancy, investment banking) - must operate for much of the
time as criminals. Supplies must be liberated from the state, or diverted
from their planned destinations. Officials must be bribed. The nature of
production or trade must often be concealed.
Add to that the tendencies to lie, cheat, overcharge, evade taxes and con
customers natural to early commercial cultures, and add to that again a
public largely hostile to trading and profit of any kind and long inured to
cheap commodities, and you have the environment of a piranha fishtank.
This environment is a field replete with the ghostly echoes of a million
unfulfilled promises, unfilled contracts and ventures that got no further
than the brainstorming stage. A. Craig Copetas has written the best book
that I have seen on this wasteland, although it has a few of the annoying
mannerisms of American 1960s-1970s journalism of the Village Voice/Rolling
Stone school, and is over-emphatic, even dogmatic, in its dismissal of any
possibility that Sovietised business people might raise a capitalist culture
 -for all his experience, he cannot know that the current fumbling efforts
will remain the rule.
But the great thing about Bear Hunting with the Politburo is the vigorous
intelligence of a reporter who has dug deep into Soviet commercial life.
Copetas, working for different US magazines and free of the crippling
constraints of daily or newsweekly deadlines, was able to see what being a
'co-operator' meant.
In one chapter, among his best, he describes the attempt of an Azerbaijani
farmer named Hajibau to build a co-operative farm in an environment
controlled by an overlapping series of Party, family and most of all corrupt
institutions, which brook no challenge from those seeking to use the frail
new laws to start their own businesses.
'Seventy per cent of Azerbaijani co-ops are run by criminals who bribe the
state to stay in business or limit production to maintain shortages,'
explains Hajibau. 'The communists first came back to me about my chickens.
Hajibau had more chickens than the state (farm). They did not like this. The
criminals on the state farms sold the people eggs at five for one rouble;
Hajibau sold them for 15 for one rouble.
'The communists said this was not good for them and told me to destroy my
chickens. Hajibau said no. The communists said, give us more money. Hajibau
said no. They came back and burned my chickens.'
This story is a good antidote to perestroika - although, today, no one has
to try very hard to convince a western audience that perestroika has not
worked (this dulls its impact a little: Copetas's argument that the west
should not delude itself about the real intentions of the Gorbachev regime
assumes a level of gullibility now probably past).
Much of the book is devoted to Vladimir Yakovlev, the founder of the Fact
co-operative, and now the founding editor of Commersant, a successful weekly
newspaper that prints in Russian and English. Yakovlev was Copetas's main
guide through the co-operators' inferno.
The picture he paints of Yakovlev, and of his and related ventures, is of a
world where business ethics, even the most self-interested kind, do not
exist. Copetas quotes an American, Lorrie Grimes, who had come to Moscow in
1988 to promote rock music and other ventures. She made a deal with
Yakovlev, for which he demanded (and got) computers and other electronic
equipment, and publicity in the US press. But he delivered almost nothing
that he had agreed to. Says Grimes: 'I realised Yakovlev was incapable of
taking responsibility for his mistakes and was only interested in getting
computers and press for himself. He was not interested in doing business at
all. He never thought anything through to the end. If it created an
interview or a computer, that was enough.'
Here is a description of a 'business' mentality which is not, in capitalist
terms, rational. Modern capitalism demands both rational planning, codes of
behaviour and service, and a public style which lays stress on reliability
and honesty.
Can this miasma of dirty dealing ever be clean? Can those who come out of
Orthodox and communist traditions, both of them hostile to capitalism,
develop a business ethic? There is no reason, on the face of it, why not:
many proper and successful capitalist companies have criminal great
grandfathers - it is a pity that they did not have reporters like Copetas to
preserve their contemporary records. His is the first Soviet business
narrative: it sets a high benchmark.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Besserwessi, a jolly new compilation with unfortunate connotations, has been
elected word of the year for 1991 by the German Language Society in
Wiesbaden. A play on the expression for a know-all, it is used to sum up the
irritatingly superior demeanour of some westerners coping badly with poorer
eastern cousins.
Confronted with a list of 10,000 words and expressions purporting to
encapsulate life in 1991, a learned jury chose to focus on the etymological
consequences of unification. Hence it passed over day-to-day trivia like
celebratory Mozart-Kitsch, even if it tarried admiringly over the 'No blood
for oil' slogan minted during the Gulf war protests.
Other contenders, including expressions such as The Wild East, the Wealth
Wall and the newly-coined economic euphemism, Zero Short-time Working, also
underscored the lingering contrasts between the two parts of the country.
Auslanderhass is another newcomer spotted by the jury. Spawned during this
year's outbreak of xenophobic attacks in the streets, the expression,
meaning hatred of foreigners, has largely replaced the older and less blunt
phrase 'animosity'. This new coinage is expected to show staying power.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Observer: Ruding's exit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to near misses on the world finance jobs circuit, Onno
Ruding's record is hard to match. He has been angling for a high
international post since deciding not to seek a third term as Dutch finance
minister in 1989.
Much to his chagrin, he lost out to Jacques Attali in the race to head the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development last year - a reminder of
his failure to beat another Frenchman, Michel Camdessus, to the top job at
the IMF in 1986.
The 52-year-old Dutchman is currently chairman of the Netherlands Christian
Federation of Employers, a three-day-a-week post which leaves him plenty of
time for non-executive directorships and advisory jobs at not only Citicorp
but Philips, Unilever, Nationale-Nederlanden and the Robeco investment
group. However, this clutch of assignments hardly adds up to the
international job the lanky Ruding was looking for.
His failure to land top posts in international bodies (as opposed to
private-sector institutions) may be partly due to inept lobbying by the
Dutch government. He was a competent finance minister, and is probably best
remembered for holding the line against increased public spending in the
Netherlands between 1982 to 1987, in a bid to put the state's financial
house in order.
But whether his type of financial rectitude is enough to turn the tide at
Citicorp, where he is expected to take a leading role, is a different
question. Observer can only wish him well.

A coda to last week's cautionary tale of Douglas Hawkins, the one-time James

Given that Dixons is Sony's biggest UK retail customer and sources roughly
two thirds of its merchandise from
Japanese-owned companies, it ought to be in a pretty powerful position when
negotiating with its suppliers.
However, it seems that simple buying power is not enough when dealing with
Japan, so it has gone out and hired a well-connected Japanese businessman -
63-year-old Yasuo Ishizaka  - to be non-executive chairman of its Japanese
subsidiary.
Dixons' Mark Souhami hopes Harvard-educated Ishizaka, who spent 27 years
with Mitsui &amp; Co, will tell him 'what the Japanese are thinking, as opposed
to what they are saying'. Maybe so, but the appointment might have carried
more weight if Ishizaka had been put on Dixons' main board.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Hack work for Hawke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
White-collar unemployment can evidently cause quandaries even for
ex-premiers.
Australia's Bob Hawke, in particular, is casting around for a renewed career
following his December dumping by the Labor Party after more than eight
years as prime minister. Unlike Malcolm Fraser and Gough Whitlam, he seems
set on staying in the public eye.
One long-term possibility is becoming the first Australian premier to go on
to be governor general. After all, he himself set the precedent for giving
that post to a prominent politician by appointing his foreign minister Bill
Hayden, instead of the more customary judge or diplomat.
In the meantime, however, Hawke is considering turning to hack-work as a
television journalist. While intending to stay in parliament at least until
next year's election, he is talking to tv networks about doing a series of
interviews with present and past world leaders.
One obvious candidate is George Bush, who went out of his way to see his
friend Bob when in Canberra last month. Another is Margaret Thatcher, whom
Hawke respected although didn't like.
He apparently has no qualms about becoming a member of a profession he has
frequently derided as incompetent, and with which he was increasingly at
odds during his last days in office. Nor does he fear attracting one of the
writs with which he liberally peppered the Australian media during his 30
years in public life.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Leading Article: See-through pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SELF-PROMOTION is usually a suspect activity; but nobody is likely to oppose
the recommendation from Pro Ned that top pay in all listed companies should
be set by a named non-executive remuneration panel, although this body
exists to promote the role of non-executive company directors. The practice
is already widespread, but often falls short of the standards proposed in
this report - a clear remit for the panel, and the publication of details
and explanations of top pay well beyond the meagre requirements of British
company law.
Transparency and demonstrable independence would help to defuse some of the
public resentment which has recently flared up about top pay. Full
disclosure of top pay and fringe benefits should be legally required, as
disclosure of service contracts already is. But disclosure will do little
good if what is disclosed is seen as greedy or unjust. For example, where
pay is related to performance, it should, as it does not always, move down
after bad years as well as up after good.
This would protect non-executives from 'having to defend the indefensible',
as Pro Ned rather self-regardingly demands. And it would avoid the real
economic penalties of pay awards which tend to raise shop-floor wage
pressure when the economy can least afford it, quite apart from getting
privatisation, not to mention capitalism itself, a bad name.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Not so miraculous: Christopher Parkes asks whether industry
is moving out of Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a land where people are reputed to have the best, longest and most
expensive education in Europe, it is not unreasonable to expect them to be
able to tell the time.
But the Germans are having problems. There are those who say it's five to
midnight in midwinter, and unless someone does something soon, the country's
economy will turn into a pumpkin. Then there are those who claim it's midday
in midsummer . . . and it looks as though it will turn out fine again
tomorrow.
Over-dosing on education, it seems, can be a dangerous thing. So too,
according to the doomsayers, can excessive health care, too much unspoilt
countryside, early retirement, too many holidays and too much pay for too
little work.
This is a theme that has been taken up lately almost with one voice by
German industrialists. They argue, at length, loudly and persistently, that
Standort Deutschland - Europe's prime industrial base  - has lost its charm
and risks losing its key role in manufacturing. Not only do foreign
investors shun the place, but now German industry is moving away to escape
the unwelcome consequences of the economic miracle.
The figures prove it, they claim. In 1990 German companies invested DM30bn
(Pounds 10.50bn) overseas, while foreigners invested only DM3bn in Germany.
Outsiders readily cite a host of disincentives to investing in Germany. A
report last year from the Japanese External Trade Organisation (Jetro)
blamed high taxation, high pay, low flexibility in the workforce and
over-generous social security as the main reasons against investment. It
echoed precisely the complaints turned up in a poll a year earlier among
members of the US Chamber of Commerce in Germany.
Industrial labour costs of DM39 an hour are the highest in the European
Community. About 10 per cent of gross national product - almost DM5,000 a
head - is spent yearly on health care, thus raising industry's ancillary
labour costs. Environmental laws obliged the country's chemical industry to
spend DM8bn last year - 60 per cent more than any of their competitors - on
cleaning up their act. Total public expenditure on education, rising 8 per
cent annually, is about DM100bn a year. A German works 500 hours a year less
than a Japanese, and he takes all his generous holiday allowances. As
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the other day, the federal republic is becoming
the holiday republic.
Working times, moving steadily down to 35 hours a week across industry, are
another bone of contention. Working lives are abbreviated by late starts
after university. A typical graduate takes his first job at 29, and at
present, retires at around 62. Mr Peter Stihl, president of the national
chamber of trade and industry (DIHT) encapsulates widespread concerns: 'I
have little faith in a country where it is considered revolutionary for
shops to be allowed to stay open after 6.30.'
Pay is an over-riding worry, and topical in the light of the current strife
in wages negotiations. 'If we want to stay competitive with our products,'
said Mr Marcus Bierich, chairman of auto component maker Robert Bosch, 'we
must work in low-pay countries where wages are upto 90 per cent lower than
in Germany.'
Recent moves by top German companies, it is said, underline the problem:
Mr Edzard Reuter, head of Daimler Benz, declared recently there were some
products the company could no longer afford to make in Germany. 'Making a
diesel engine in our works at Unterturkheim costs half as much again as the
same engine made in South Korea,' Mr Reuter said, stressing industry's
complaints about high wages and ancillary social security and other costs,
which amount to 46 per cent of the total labour bill. The Mercedes-Benz car
subsidiary is reported to be considering building its first full-scale
overseas car production works in Mexico.
Bosch has shunted its manufacture of car loudspeakers to Mexico and
Malaysia, shedding 1,500 German jobs.
Siemens is exporting car wiring systems manufacture to Czechoslovakia and
Turkey - along with an unspecified number of jobs.
BASF is moving fertiliser production from the Rhine to Antwerp, and last
year spent only half of its DM5bn investment budget at home. According to Mr
Wolfgang Jentzsch, a senior member of the BASF board, for Ludwigshafen, one
of the group's long-standing manufacturing bases, 'it is already five past
midnight'.
The ticking-clock argument has been going on and off in Germany since the
early 1980s, when Eurosclerosis was a fashionable economic disease. Since
then German industrial arteries have pumped through almost a decade of
continuous expansion, creating more than 3m new jobs in the process.
But in the last few months, the question of Germany's competitiveness as a
manufacturing centre has been raised with renewed insistence. Indeed, it has
taken on the air of a concerted public relations campaign, dressed up with
apt one-off quotes from industry leaders, to attract public attention.
Cynics say that this has more to do with events such as the unexpected
burdening of Germany with 16m more people from the east, the wreckage of the
DDR's economy and the resulting economic surge and slowdown in the west than
with a sudden worsening of industry's cost base.
Mr Johann Eekhoff, state secretary in the economic ministry, the first
notable to use the word 'recession' in a speech late last year, takes the
strain coolly, and industry's appeals with a pinch of salt. 'Whenever
Standort Deutschland comes up, you must always listen for the undertones,'
he says. He remembers the last alarm bells, when Japan was about to sweep in
and trample all over European industry. There is always, he suggests, a hint
of protectionism.
For Mr Eekhoff, the key to Germany's enduring attraction as an investment
base is demonstrated in the country's ability to generate new jobs. 'We
created 800,000 last year. That cannot be a bad sign,' he says.
There is, he points out, no real sign that domestic investment has run into
the sand. After a 10 per cent surge in 1990 and a real 6 per cent increase
in capital expenditure last year, spending on new plant and equipment at
home even in these straitened times is expected to increase by a real 3 to 4
per cent in 1992. As the latest report from the Bundesbank said, 'readiness
to invest in the German economy continues unbroken'. Recent forecasts also
indicate that a further 250,000 new jobs will be created this year.
Increased overseas investment by German companies, says Mr Eekhoff, is a
natural result of German wealth. The opening of opportunities in
Czechoslovakia and Poland provides a chance for Germany to show itself as a
'good neighbour'. Coastal sites near developed ports make more natural bases
for chemicals works than inland riverbanks. Aluminium factories would be
better off in energy-rich Ukraine or Russia, Mr Eekhoff says.
The current round of 10 per cent pay claims, an echo of last year's wages
boom when industry was prepared to pay any price to keep production going to
feed demand in the east, may be hitting the headlines at the moment.
But it is no more important than the other issues being raised by industry,
many of which were being addressed and dealt with long before the current
debate began. Basic changes in health provisions, introduced in 1989, drove
down government spending on health by 9.5 per cent in their first year. Wide
ranging corporate tax reforms, although the first stage is stuck in the
federal legislature's fraught approvals process, are on their way through.
The national pensions programme has recently been adjusted to keep people at
work for longer.
No one suggests that the process of adaptation to so many changed economic,
political and geographic circumstances can be hurried. But Chancellor Kohl
sent a clear message for the medium and long-term future last weekend and
perhaps set the pattern for the future development of the Standort
Deutschland debate. 'We must rethink our priorities,' he said. 'We must
examine what is absolutely essential now, what can be put off, and what we
can do without.'
Industry is already ahead of him. Given German car makers' losses of market
share in the US, a Mercedes works next door in Mexico would seem to be an
essential step to help Mr Reuter compete more effectively with the Japanese.
And an expanding economy based on high-tech, high added-value engineering
industries can, like the Japanese, probably do without relatively low-tech,
low added-value businesses like fertilisers and loudspeakers.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Ports in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SAGA of the trust ports has turned into one of the most bizarre in the
short history of Britain's privatisation programme. What should have been a
routine and uncontroversial sell-off has turned into an embarrassing
debacle; and the government has only itself to blame.
The roots of the government's disarray lie in the ports' unusual status. Run
by independent, self-governing local trusts set up under acts of parliament,
they had no owner. This raised doubts about the government's right either to
force their sale to the private sector or to take a share in the proceeds.
In legislating to overcome this problem, the government embarked on an
unsatisfactory fudge at every juncture. Privatisation was to be voluntary,
the government said; but it was to be compulsory for the 15 biggest ports.
The trustees themselves were to choose how their ports were to be sold and
to whom, but only subject to the government's approval. Management-employee
buy-outs were deemed to be desirable, but only up to an ill-defined point.
The proceeds of the sales were to go to the ports, but since that would mean
anyone buying a port would get all their money back, the government decided
to take 50 cent for itself.
With the privatisation of the first trust port to come forward - Tees &amp;
Hartlepool - the chickens have come home to roost. The trustees' decision to
award the port neither to the highest bidder nor the buy-out team has
brought confusion, anger, and the threat of a judicial review from one of
the losing bidders. The response of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport
secretary, has been to say that he is 'minded' to accept the trustees'
decision; meanwhile other ports have imposed an information black-out on the
bidding procedure in an attempt to prevent similar embarrassments.
This is no way to privatise the ports. However well-intentioned the
government's motives in seeking to involve local interests in the sales, the
trustees have no experience in such matters and could conceivably be
presented with conflicts of interest because of their local connections. The
insertion of this unnecessary layer into the decision-making process has
simply served to obfuscate it.
If the privatisation of the trust ports is to command public support, it
must not only be fair, but be seen to be fair. Mr Rifkind should insist on a
public auction of the trust ports, with the Department of Transport acting
as referee. Any requirements as to employee ownership or the future
development of the port could be made preconditions of the bid. Better a
U-turn in favour of fair play now than more unseemly farragos such as the
one over Tees &amp; Hartlepool.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: Trapped by a formula - From Lingotto, William Packer
takes American Art to task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the millennium now in immediate prospect, an urge to look back across
the several phases and developments of the 20th century is hardly perverse.
American Art 1930-1970, sponsored by Fiat at Lingotto, its former factory
complex on the outskirts of Turin (until March 31), thus takes the century's
middle 40 years, and a national school as important as any in the
up-and-down, in-and-out history of modern art.
The importance of American Art in the second half of our century is
manifest, mainly for the commercial and critical power it has commanded and
the influence it has enjoyed. Any exhibition that marks its transition from
provincial and insignificant backwaters to world power must be important,
and all the more so for being well-chosen, installed and documented.
But whatever the fond hopes of scholars and curators, it does not follow
that every such exhibition will necessarily be a celebration of its subject.
The recent Pop Art show at the Royal Academy was a useful if inadvertent
beginning, and now here at Lingotto, with an ever deepening scepticism, we
again confront the critical claims made for later 20th century American Art.
Ever since abstract expressionism burst on an astonished world shortly after
the Second World War, these claims have been extraordinary, both in their
critical extravagance and the reward they have brought at least some of
their perpetrators. We may not accept that Jasper Johns or de Kooning, for
example, are quite the peers of Degas or Velasquez in terms of talent or
achievement, but the market has been saying no less of them these many
years. Such claims may still pass unchallenged, yet, the moment we pause to
think before the work itself, they fall away.
The practical test is simple enough. Walk slowly through the Lingotto
exhibition, following natural curiosity rather than supposed duty, and note
where one is detained the longer. We find that the earlier spaces, smaller
in themselves and accounting for no more than a quarter of the space
overall, require time and close attention in inverse proportion to the wider
spaces beyond. They contain the work of the 1930s and 40s, principally
figurative and comparatively small in scale, conscientiously made.
What do we find beyond? Why, the abstract expressionism of Still and
Motherwell, the Pop Art of Rosenquist and Wesselman, the minimalism of
Andre, Stella, Ryman, Marden, the conceptualism of Kossuth and Baldessari,
the neon tubes of Flavin and Sonnier, the twisted pipes of Serra, the
celebrated junk of Rauschenberg and Johns: in short the sum of American
genius after 1950. 'It is incredible', says Attilio Codognato in his
catalogue introduction, 'how much our garbage can reveal about our lives.'
To come round to Philip Pearlstein at the very end of the show, and he no
master of the nude figure, is to feel a real relief at something attempted,
struggled with, something to look at. But it is with the long disregarded
provincials, the realists and symbolists of the first period, Hart Benton,
Hopper, Sheeler, Reginald Marsh and Isobel Bishop, that the real pleasure
and interest of this exhibition lie.
It is not that the later developments are without critical interest and even
beauty. The parallel currents of abstraction and figuration, in the 1940s
especially, are fascinating to trace, as much in the early work of Rothko
and Gorky as of Hopper and Marsh. What is both astonishing and unforgiveable
is the extraordinary critical totalitarianism by which suddenly, around
1950, the new order was imposed, what had gone before deemed trivial and
irrelevant to the great task and future that lay ahead.
The effects upon the world at large, that more or less swallowed this humbug
whole, are another matter. Here the havoc wrought on American Art itself is
enough. We have only to consider the later work of true talents such as
Philip Guston and Mark Rothko, even de Kooning, shown alongside the earlier,
to sense real desperation and despair. Commercial interest was put before
any complexity or inconsistency in the artist's imaginative development.
Consistency and predicability were all, a mere matter of style, to be
recognised and presented to the world at large.
Trapped by a formula, Rothko killed himself: Guston escaped into a
vigorously cynical symbolism: de Kooning's fierce figurative expressionism
simply drained away. And for the rest, was there ever anything serious to
say of Rosenquist, as inept a painter ever to achieve an international
reputation, or Clyfford Still, or Barnett Newman, or Rauschenberg? By such
heroes as these is the claim, sustained, that the American School is most
significant of our time.
What is ultimately so depressing is not so much the over-vaunted claim, as
the its acceptance by so many of the artists themselves. By 1960 there had
developed that curious aesthetic and moral arrogance which is perhaps
America's truer contribution in the history of art. The artist no longer
struggles, does not look and learn from the world about his own abilities
and perceptions. The artist is always right.
Such is the patronising cynicism, or naivety perhaps, of a Rauschenberg with
his paint-daubed bric-a-brac, a Johns who nails a broom to his canvas, a
Lewitt who simply tells the gallery assistant to draw lines in pencil on the
wall, a Baldessari who paints the banal text from the painter's manual, a
Robert Morris who would wrap his brain in dollar bills?
The conceptual artist would tell us what to think, would limit our
experience of his work to what he would tell us. And he must forgive us if
we yawn and turn away. American aesthetic correctness, as opposed to its
sometime art, is to be resisted.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: Andrew Strong - Town &amp; Country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You could tell it was a hot ticket by the persistence of the touts - they
had infiltrated Kentish Town tube station offering to buy and sell. And the
audience, too, was older and smarter than the usual T &amp; C crowd. It was
indeed an occasion and a very odd one. The star was no cult hero but an
unknown with pitifully little experience of live performance.
A year ago Strong was a Bunterish school boy, familiar in County Kildare
through his size and pigtail. Now he has a six album contract and the
trappings of a Sunset Boulevard career. When director Alan Parker trawled
Ireland seeking unknowns for his movie The Commitments he hired Strong to
give weight to the role as the singer in the band. It has since proved a
surprise international hit and the fictional Commitments have moved from
being just another failing Dublin blues band to a hot commercial property.
It is very bizarre. Throw a stone and you will hit a pub band belting out
the sixties soul classics of Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding. Its harmless
nostalgia, as far away from the music business as Sunday morning soccer from
the World Cup. But the movie has popularised both the performers and the
songs. There was, after all, an audience for 'Mustang Sally' and 'Try a
Little Tenderness', and Strong, a Roy of the Rovers come to life, is the
unlikely vehicle for the craze.
He is the hyperactive kiddie on the school treat, lumbering around the stage
fingering an imaginary guitar just like the teenager in the bathroom. This
is how it should be. Strong is just 18. He might look like a 48-year-old
truck driver, Meat Loaf on a quiet day, but there is no way he can lay on a
sophisticated performance.
It is a sweet parody of soul - 'How's you all doing now', he drawls in a
tentative charade of a southern singer working the cabaret circuit. After
that his chat consists of spotting friends in the audience and wondering at
the strange twist of fate which has made him this week bigger than big. Of
course there is some sense in it all. Strong has a remarkably solid 'black'
voice. Close your eyes and he is the soul singer of your dreams.
Strong is already trying to move on, slipping in his own songs, which seem
like a pastiche of the real thing. And he has a raunchy band with a
six-strong brass section and girl singers who strut. It is just possible
that the voice will keep him touring medium-sized venues in the US after the
movie has moved on. But I can't imagine he will be such a hot ticket in
Kentish Town again.

The repeat run of The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin continues on BBC1
(8.00). This is not one of the greatest TV comedies, but the late Leonard
Rossiter did bring a delightful Walter Mitty-ish quality to Perrin's
character. Otherwise the most promising programmes appear to be on Channel
4. Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint (8.30) is the second part of Bamber
Gascoigne's account of a long 15th century journey by a Dominican monk who
fell in love with St Catherine and determined to touch her bones. Today he
reaches the Holy Land and Jerusalem. Without Walls (9.00) is in two parts.
The first is another item in this programme's 'J'accuse' series, with
architect Max Hutchinson arguing that St Paul's Cathedral, far from being
the triumph that so many believe, is a second rate mediaeval botch.
For the second part television archivists should have their video recorders
ready: Paul Madden offers a tribute to 'The Avengers', the seminal 60s
series in which bowler-hatted Patrick Macnee was partnered first by Ian
Hendry, then by Honor Blackman in leather, then by Diana Rigg, and later
still by Linda Thorson. There has never been another series quite like it.

<TEXT>
In KaDeWe, Berlin's largest department store, there is a coat for sale that
looks both classically trench and stylishly Scandinavian. Its lining is
beaverskin and the price tag is DM 3,750 (Pounds 1,300).
But while the inside of the coat is merely expensive, the outside is
revolutionary. It glows like silk and feels like the bloom of a peach. The
cloth is made of polyester microfibres, the filaments of which are finer
than silk.
There are some in the textile industry who believe, or at least hope, that
microfibre fabrics will eclipse Du Pont's Lycra as the hottest new material
in popular clothing.
Lycra has graduated from womens' hosiery to professional and fashion
sportswear, as exemplified by cycling shorts. Now microfibres are following
a similar route. Once limited to blends with wool and cotton, their
combination of toughness and softness has put them into sportswear,
rainwear, silk mixture blouses and even medical filters.
The tight weave possible with such fine filaments means that a fabric can be
made waterproof without the need for a plastic coating. The spaces in the
weave do not let rainwater seep in but they let water vapour, from sweat,
out.
The principle is not new. Gore-Tex, a fabric invented in the US and popular
in outdoor clothing, also has microscopic holes that perform the same role.
But Gore-Tex holes are made in a plastic film, rather than the weave. With
microfibres, the need for such a coating is eliminated.
For more advanced fabrics, a chemical coating can be used which makes it
possible for the material to pick up water from the skin and draw it away
from the body to the outside of the cloth. 'The results is theoretically
seven times more porous than cotton and will dry three times as fast,' says
an executive at UK fibres maker Courtaulds.
There are more adventurous products yet. By combining highly twisted
microfibres with conventional fibres of lower twist, delicate napped
surfaces such as on the Scandinavian coat can be made. 'Each fibre might
have to be twisted hundreds of times,' explains Mike Bartle of Yorkshire
silk fabric specialist Lister.
But the costs are high and the search is on for short-cuts. 'You can get a
similar effect by mixing fibres that respond differently to heat,' says
Bartle.
Other exotic finishes are possible. In Japan, Toyobo makes a 'powder touch'
material and Kanebo a 'moist touch' fabric. Both are intended for the
fashion industry.
The origin of these high technology materials is humble. When nylon first
hit the streets in the 1940s it was called artificial silk and priced
accordingly.
It was quickly joined by polyester and production grew rapidly. Prices fell
quickly as volumes rose. By 1975, polyester accounted for around one third
of the entire US textile market.
Such popularity bred contempt. By the late 1970s, nylon and polyester had
become cheap to produce. Synthetic fibre clothes were considered tacky and
sweaty. Their only advantages were strength and an ability to withstand
being thrust into a washing machine every week. In the 1980s, cotton and
wool were, once again, the fabrics of choice - except in Japan.
There, demand for silk is traditionally higher than in western countries and
demand has grown alongside the Japanese economy. The price of the raw
material remained high and its supply, largely from China, unpredictable.
As a result Japanese textile companies redoubled their efforts to reproduce
the feel of silk. Since the mid-1970s, Japan has led the world in making
fibres as fine as silk.
Microfibres are usually less than one denier (the number of grams that 9,000
metres of the filament weighs). What such fine fibres do in principle is to
make a fabric feel soft. Microfibres have been blended into wool or cotton
for a luxurious feel that is as strong as a more traditional
natural/artificial fibre mix.
Fine fibres also make floppy fabrics: a silk garment drapes quite
differently from one made of wool or cotton. Used on their own, microfibres
can imitate silk better than any previous synthetic and still stand up to
being machine washed. Experts can tell the difference between microfibres
and silk, usually on sight and more easily by touch. But consumers seem to
be prepared to pay high prices for fabric that feels luxurious, regardless
of how it is produced.
'There are huge margins for clothes retailers,' says Les Jacques at ICI's
fibres division. The profits thus generated are what makes microfibre
products so attractive to manufacturers and retailers.
Clothes, such as specialist sportswear, made from microfibres are marketed
as luxury goods. Special materials, such as that in the Scandinavian coat,
even more so.
The typical extra cost of a microfibre is 30 to 50 per cent above that of
the normal gauge of filament. But by the time the clothes are on sale in a
shop, even an expensive fibre represents only a small proportion of the
selling price.
Microfibres appeal particularly to manufacturers in developed countries.
They are capital intensive products. Third world suppliers, which have made
huge in-roads into developed country markets with natural fibre fabrics,
cannot compete.
So the push for finer filaments continues. Today, Japanese fibre producers
such as Toray can produce polyester of 0.01 denier. Such fabric is used to
make artificial leather and can be 'sueded', in which an abrasive breaks
some of the fibres in the weave to create a different surface texture.
Garments are not the only route for microfibres. At 0.1 denier, fabrics can
be used in the medical world as biological filters. And there is the barely
explored area of industrial filtration, where polyesters are particularly
useful because they are relatively inert.
At the cutting edge, there are reports that Japanese laboratories have made
a filament of 0.0003 denier. This would be a laboratory curiosity with no
obvious applications.
The road to world domination for these products is far from smooth. Even for
ordinary microfibres, there are production problems. Existing machine
designs have to be scaled down to make finer fibre, so production is low.
There are risks that filaments will break during manufacture and hold up
production.
Furthermore, the greater surface area of a large number of smaller filaments
means that much more dye has to be used. 'You will never get the same
intensity of colour with microfibres,' says Bartle.
The greater surface area can be useful, however. The high surface area of
microfibres means they are already being used as cleaning cloths, especially
for optical equipment and spectacles. Towelling is another possibility.
The very promise of the fibres has led to a sharp growth in production
capacity. In 1990, the Economist Intelligence Unit listed 19 Japanese
companies making microfibres. They included giants such as Mitsubishi and
Asahi, as well as more traditional fibre makers such as Toray, Teijin and
Kuraray.
European companies have been slower to join in. While the Japanese started
in the mid-1970s, the likes of Courtaulds started only five years ago.
European manufacturers now include Hoechst of Germany, Montefibre of Italy,
Akzo in the Netherlands and ICI.
The result is over-capacity. This has already hit the prices of the larger
sizes of microfibres, at close to one denier. Hoechst acknowledges that
there has been some price erosion and that last year was difficult.
Nevertheless, the desire to reduce fibre diameters will continue. The aim is
to make artificial materials better than natural alternatives. The potential
rewards of genuine innovation in this largely mature industry will continue
to push manufacturers towards new products and applications.

Even if your business has survived the recession by dint of good management
or good luck, you may have found yourself having to cope with the
repercussions of business failure among suppliers, customers or competitors.
But do you really understand the technical terms which are used by the
accountants and insolvency specialists? What is the difference between
bankruptcy, receivership, administration and liquidation?
KPMG Peat Marwick has produced a 13-page Glossary of Insolvency Expressions
ranging from Administration Order to Wrongful Trading which explains some of
English (and Scottish) jargon. Irritatingly, the Peat booklet adopts a
straight-laced, technical approach, and is too concise, describing the
different procedures rather than attempting to relate one to another and
explain how they differ in practice.
Cork Gully, part of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, have done a better job with
Insolvency in Brief, a rather longer (24 page) guide which comes down to the
level of the businessman or woman in the street. Unfortunately the Cork
booklet has proved so popular internally that few copies are available to
outsiders. It may be worth pressuring a friendly partner though.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Tories' battle plan avoids an economic front: The defence
dilemma facing the Labour party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pre-election trench warfare in Westminster switched fronts yesterday as
the Tories attempted to soften up Labour's defences on nuclear and military
policy with a bombardment of briefings, interviews and open letters to Mr
Neil Kinnock.
As an early warning of today's defence debate, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, had already been strategically deployed in newspaper articles at
the weekend.
And last night, the prime minister himself rounded off the day's
manoeuvrings with confirmation of his initiative on nuclear proliferation at
the United Nations - a not overly subtle reminder of his electorally
valuable seat on the international stage.
Yet if the sheer fury of Labour's response - 'cheap', 'squalid' and
'pathetic' were just a few of the adjectival hand-grenades lobbed in reply -
was evidence of the party's continued sensitivity about defence, there is no
doubt that the issue has dropped far down the voters' list of concerns.
At the 1987 general election, the Tory poster depicting Labour's defence
policy as a British 'Tommy' holding up his hands in surrender was regarded
as one of Conservative Central Office's few hits.
Today, however, it is questionable how much real mileage the Tories can make
from the issue.
Still, by shifting the political focus back on to what are, in effect,
international issues, the government's strategy aims at playing to Tory
strengths and keep Labour on the back foot in what military tacticians would
describe as 'offensive defence'.
In short, it deflects voters' attention from the economy.
The Conservative leadership, none the less, argues that its attack has more
substance than merely stirring up voter anxieties. The joint assault
launched by Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, and Mr Chris Patten, the
party chairman, yesterday concentrated heavily on the charge that Labour
continues to be vague on its plans.
It is, they claimed, specifically unclear on its policy stance on a fourth
Trident submarine and sub-strategic nuclear weapons for Nato. In spite of
more than 72 policy launches in the last two years, there is still no
document on defence, they added.
Furthermore, opinion poll findings and votes at Labour's conference suggest
that the opposition cannot be trusted not to order substantial defence cuts
once in power, they said.
In fact, Labour has answers to most of the charges. The leadership has
already emphasised that it will ignore the demand from last year's
conference to harmonise UK defence spending with the European Community
average - a cut calculated as equal to Pounds 6bn off the Pounds 24bn
defence budget, according to the Tories.
It has also said it will keep the Trident nuclear submarine programme,
although it continues to promise to abandon commissioning a fourth boat if
savings can be made by doing so.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, confirmed last night that the
party would now reluctantly go along with a new sub-strategic weapon system
if a majority of its Nato partners insist it is essential.
Furthermore, Labour's support for the government's line at Maastricht on
denying the European Commission a role in formulating EC defence and foreign
affairs policy and its successful efforts in dissuading its EC socialist
partners from backing an EC deterrent last December suggest that the party's
policy is not far removed from that of the government.
Yet all that does little to defuse defence as a certain winner for the
Tories in much the same way as the National Health Service is a guaranteed
trump for Labour. But if there is no rapid worsening of instability in the
former Eastern bloc or elsewhere when the election is finally called, it
will probably prove little more than a peripheral skirmish to the main
event.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind dismisses fears over rail
links - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH row over British Rail blew up in the Commons yesterday as Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, transport secretary, denounced a report saying dozens of towns and
cities might lose InterCity rail links after privatisation as 'bogus'.
The report, which had been seen by Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's Scottish
transport spokesman, was said to have been an internal BR document.
Mr Wilson reiterated yesterday that he had no doubt as to its authenticity.
Mr Rifkind accused the Labour spokesman of passing the document to the press
and raised the question of whether or not the Opposition was aware that it
was not genuine.
'What the public would like to know is whether the Opposition . . . were
aware this was . . . something prepared no doubt for political purposes,' he
said.
In a personal letter to Mr Wilson, Mr Rifkind referred to remarks made by
Sir Bob Reid, the BR chairman, in a separate letter.
He quoted Sir Bob as saying: 'This is not a British Railways document. Nor,
can I assure you, has a document of this sort been commissioned by the
board.' Mr Rifkind concluded: 'It therefore appears that this whole story
was based on a bogus document.'
The government is pressing for improved safety standards on ferry services,
which have been internationally approved, to be implemented more quickly, Mr
Patrick McLoughlin, shipping minister, said yesterday.
He gave a warning that Britain might consider unilateral action if
international agreement on speeding up the process could not be reached.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont keeps option of tax cuts -
Budget speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS signalled yesterday that the option of a tax-cutting pre-election
Budget remained firmly open as the Labour party sought to maintain its
attack on the government's management of the economy.
As Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, switched the emphasis of Conservative
campaigning to Labour's defence policy ahead of today's debate in the
Commons, ministers dismissed reports that the shape of the Budget had
already been decided.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has yet to take any firm decisions on the
main measures that will be included.
Instead he is understood to be ready to keep open until a week or so before
the Budget the option of a cut in the basic rate of income tax or a large
increase in tax thresholds.
Mr Lamont's colleagues acknowledge strong pressure within the Conservative
party for a Budget that highlights the sharp difference between the
government and Labour's taxation policies.
For many, that points to a 1p cut in the basic rate of tax to present the
electorate with a stark choice in an April or May election.
In spite of Labour's 5-point lead in the latest opinion poll, ministers
believe that their attack over the past week on the opposition's plans for
the 'biggest tax increase in peacetime history' has put Mr Neil Kinnock on
the defen-sive.
The chancellor is said to be instinctively in favour of a reduction in the
basic rate as opposed to higher thresholds if the money can be found to
reduce taxation. In the past, however, Mr John Major, the prime minister,
has indicated that he prefers raising thresholds because of the help that
gives to those on the lower end of the income scale.
The final decision, however, will depend on the shape of the economy in the
weeks immediately preceding the Budget. Ministers believe that if the
recovery still looks weak, the pressure for tax cuts will be irresistible.
If, however, there is much stronger evidence of an upturn as sterling
stabilises, the chancellor will have to balance the possibility of lower
taxes against the potential for a pre-election cut in interest rates.
Labour meanwhile continued to insist that a tax-cutting Budget would provide
further evidence of the Conservatives' 'boom-bust' approach to economic
management. Speaking during one the regional tours that have marked the
launch of the Labour election campaign, Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor, repeated his party's call for a Budget for industry.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Poll tax bills may be 'near Pounds
100' - Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Hunt, Welsh secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the average
poll tax should be 'around Pounds 100' in Wales in the coming financial
year.
He also announced that the increase in the business rate poundage would be
limited to 4.1 per cent.
Mr Barry Jones, the shadow Welsh secretary, dismissed the forecast level of
poll tax as 'unrealistic', and argued that the increase in total
local-authority spending - just over 5 per cent  - was 'nothing like
enough'.
He maintained that an increase closer to 10 per cent was needed to provide
for the additional duties of local authorities.
Mr Hunt condemned Labour's 'spend, spend, spend' approach, but failed to
secure a response when he challenged the Labour front bench to say whether
the demands for extra expenditure made by Mr Jones had been approved by Mr
John Smith, the shadow chancellor.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Choice of Tees port purchaser defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TEES &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority yesterday released the text of a letter
to employees defending its decision to sell the port to a consortium called
Teesside Holdings for Pounds 180m.
Mr John Peart, the authority's chairman, said the time had come for him to
make the board's position 'perfectly clear to those people who matter most,
its management and employees'.
The authority's decision to sell the port to Teesside Holdings has brought
bitter protests from the management-employee buy-out team which had
submitted a rival bid of Pounds 150m during the privatisation process.
Also objecting to the port's decision is Maritime Transport Services,
operator of the Thamesport container terminal on the Isle of Grain in Kent,
which outbid Teesside Holdings with an offer of Pounds 210m.
Mr Peart said in his letter to employees that some of the critics of the
sale procedure had opposed privatisation from the outset and others were
motivated by the need for publicity.
He said: 'Teesside Holdings was selected by the board of the authority as
the preferred bidder because its bid met most closely the privatisation
objectives set by the board and agreed with the secretary of state for
transport.
'These objectives have remained constant and uppermost in the board's
consideration throughout the privatisation process.
'Teesside Holdings' bid was particularly impressive in respect of the most
important of these objectives, maintaining the port as a separate,
Teesside-based company, protecting the the authority's assets and ensuring
that cash generated continues to be wholly devoted to the further
development of the local port facilities and projects benefiting the local
economy and community.'
Mr Peart's letter comes as Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary,
prepares to announce whether he is prepared to approve the port authority's
decision. Earlier he had said he was 'minded' to do so.
The issue will come up in the Commons today when MPs are asked to approve an
order providing for the government to claw back a proportion of any property
profits made by any of the trust ports after privatisation. Government
business managers are expected to ensure a favourable vote.
Teesside Holdings is a three-way venture between Powell Duffryn, the quoted
engineering and shipping group, Humberside Holdings, a company jointly owned
by Powell Duffryn and private interests in the Humberside area, and
Investors in Industry, the venture capital group.
Mr Peart said Teesside Holdings had 'positive and immediate' proposals for
the development of the port and port-related facilities.
They comprised substantial capital investment in excess of that proposed by
the other bidders for the development of the port business and new storage
and distribution ventures.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Outhwaite 'should have known of crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London underwriter Mr Richard Outhwaite should have known that
the insurance of US asbestos liabilities was 'a potential problem of
enormous magnitude', the High Court was told yesterday by another
underwriter.
Mr Outhwaite is at the centre of a civil action brought by 987 members of
Lloyd's syndicate 317/661 managed by RHM Outhwaite Underwriting Agencies.
The members allege that the negligence of the agency and 81 other
underwriting agencies in placing them with Mr Outhwaite's syndicate was
responsible for insurance losses of more than Pounds 200m.
The court heard evidence from Lloyd's underwriter Mr Peter Wingett who said
the insurance market had had plenty of warning about the asbestosis crisis
of the early 1980s. He said: 'Articles appearing in the press . . . were
making it very clear that we had a tip-of-the-iceberg situation. It was an
extremely volatile situation.'
Defence counsel Mr Jonathan Playford said Mr Wingett was acting in
hindsight.
The case continues today.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Auditors' subscription may rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS in England and Wales may face substantial increases in
subscriptions but gain greater access to the workings of their professional
association under plans for long-term reform, it emerged yesterday.
The council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
proposed a Pounds 15 rise in the annual subscription for 1993 to Pounds 100
for members in the European Community of at least five years' standing, and
a further increase of 12.5 per cent above inflation for the next two years.
The council voted in favour of greater openness in the institute's operation
and the provision of a range of new services at its annual conference in
Birmingham at the weekend.
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive, said last night the
council voted unanimously that it would recommend raising subscription
levels at a special meeting for members on June 2 this year.
He said the increase was essential to compensate for the effects of the
recession on institute's commercial activities, such as publication sales.
The institute had a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 633,000 for the year to
December 31 1990. He said unaudited figures for 1991 showed a loss of Pounds
200,000, and the 1992 budget estimates a further Pounds 500,000 loss
including a Pounds 300,000 contingency item.
The council approved a report on openness that would involve far greater
access to institute meetings, more representation and wider circulation of
documents of public interest.
It discussed long-term objectives that might include more lobbying and
advisory services for members, with emphasis on maintaining and promoting
the image of the chartered accountancy qualification.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Fox Milton trial to start today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRIAL of two directors of Fox Milton &amp; Co, a licensed share dealing firm
that went into liquidation in 1989, is due to start today at the Old Bailey.
Mr Stephen Wright and Mr Philip Raisey face a single charge that they
conspired 'to cheat Her Majesty the Queen and the Public Revenue' between
February 1 1985 and January 23 1989.
The allegations cited in the indictment, which are denied by both the men,
include:
Representing to tax inspectors that charitable donations made to religious
organisations were deductible against corporation tax.
Evading tax assessments by failing to notify inspectors that four
Jersey-based companies were liable to corporation tax.
Entering backdated share bargains in clients' accounts to create capital
gains and evade income tax assessments.
Knowingly submitting incomplete or incorrect tax returns relating to both
the firm's income and their personal income.
Approving company accounts that did not disclose the full extent of
directors' benefits.
The trial is expected to last between eight and 12 weeks. The prosecution,
which is led by Mr Douglas Day QC, is being brought by the Serious Fraud

Mr Richard Ager, the Fox Milton office manager, has also been charged with

FT  14 JAN 92 / Ford workers told to raise productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at Ford's Fiesta production plant at Dagenham have been told that
productivity must improve sharply if the plant is to be sure of having a
role in building the present model's successor.
Ford denied last night that it had issued an ultimatum to the Dagenham
workforce, but acknowledged that a series of targets had been set for
improving the plant's performance.
If these were not met, the 'ultimate sanction is that the business can be
lost', Ford said.
According to a confidential internal Ford memo, the 7,000 workers employed
on Fiesta production at Dagenham required 52.2 hours to build a car in 1990.
That compares with 33.3 at Ford's Valencia plant in Spain and only 29.9
hours at its Cologne plant in Germany.
Dagenham's figure for 1991 was forecast to improve to 40 hours per car,
compared with only marginal improvements at Valencia and Cologne.
However, Dagenham is understood to have achieved only about 46 hours per
car, resulting in the setting of performance targets for this year in a
series of briefings to employees by Ford's vice-president of manufacturing,
Mr Albert Caspers.
Although wages rates are lower than in the continental plants, Ford's UK
labour and overhead costs are substantially higher, the company maintains.
Ford's present Fiesta model is only two years old and is unlikely to be
replaced before the mid 1990s. Nevertheless, it has been indicated to
Dagenham employees that fundamental decisions about how production of the
replacement will be distributed are likely to be taken within the next 12
months.
In spite of the productivity gap, Ford has been relatively complimentary
about the improvements already achieved at the plant since Sierra production
was withdrawn and it began producing only Fiestas two years ago. In 1989,
for example, it was taking Dagenham 59.4 hours per car.
The improvement has been sufficient for Ford to have resumed signficant
exports to the Continent. About half Dagenham's total output of 223,000
Fiestas was exported last year.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Five face insider dealing charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST insider dealing trial yet launched begins at the Old Bailey
today. Five people face charges under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider
Dealing) Act in connection with alleged offences that took place in 1988.
It will be the first case brought against so many people, and the first
alleged ring charged with conspiring to profit by using unpublished,
price-sensitive information.
The case is brought by the Department of Trade and Industry against Mr Mark
Riding, 27, Mr David Gray, 32, Mrs Catherine Smith (nee Rowlands), 32, Mr
William Liggins, 33, and Mr Keith Tondeur, 43. All worked for financial
institutions.
The five were committed for trial on March 15 last year in relation to
dealings during the period May to August 1988 in the shares of Ranks Hovis
McDougall, the UK foods group then subject to a takeover bid, Pleasurama,
the leisure group taken over by Mecca Leisure, and/or Hawthorn Leslie Group,
the USM-quoted cellular phone company, which acquired ECT Cellular and
London Car Telephones about that time.
Mr Gray was a share salesman with Morgan Grenfell at the time. Mrs Smith
worked in the corporate finance department at Samuel Montagu and Mr Liggins
was a fund manager at Lazards. Mr Tondeur was with Paribas, the French bank,
and Mr Riding worked for the Co-operative Insurance Society in Manchester.
One or two days of legal argument are expected before the charges against
the defendants are read out in court. If they plead not guilty, the case is
likely to last six weeks or more.
In spite of growing concern and new legislation to combat insider trading in
the past decade, the DTI has put only about 36 people on trial, mostly in
ones or twos. A few small cases have been brought by the Crown Prosecution
Service and the Stock Exchange.
About half have of those tried have been acquitted.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Projects in the budget firing line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pentagon's Dollars 104bn budget for research, development and
procurement of equipment in 1992 includes a number of programmes which are
prime targets for the budget axe:
Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber. The administration had planned to order seven
more B-2s in fiscal 1993 at a cost of Dollars 660m apiece, building its
fleet up to 75 by 1998. It is now expected to halve this goal. But Congress
had already in effect killed the B-2 programme in the current year's budget
authorisation and is unlikely to relent now, so the air force may have to
make do with the 15 under construction.
The Seawolf SSN-21 nuclear attack submarine built by Electric Boat. Mr
Cheney is reported to have ordered the navy to slash its plans for the
Dollars 2bn submarine, which it had already scaled down last year to a
target of one a year up to 1997 or 1998. Seawolf only survived last year
because of frantic lobbying by the senators for Connecticut, in whose state
it is built. This year, Congress is likely to kill it altogether, and tell
the navy to wait for the cheaper next generation Centurion submarine.
The anti-missile Strategic Defence Initiative. The version embraced by the
Bush administration, dubbed Global Protection Against Limited Strikes, or
GPALS, would provide more protection against an accidental launch from the
former Soviet Union or against a rogue attack from one of the emerging
nuclear countries than against the all-out Soviet attack envisioned by the
more ambitious Reagan 'Star Wars', but it is still hotly opposed by many in
Congress.
The Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). The ATF, under development by two
competing teams of Northrop/McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed/General
Dynamics/Boeing, is designed to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Falcon
fighters, but at an estimated Dollars 73m it will be costly to replace the
entire fighter fleet.
McDonnell Douglas's C-17 transport aircraft. While improved airlift
capability is generally viewed as a priority for the new US force structure,
the C-17, now forecast at Dollars 35bn for 120 aircraft, is over budget and
behind schedule.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BANKS yesterday won a victory in their battle to offer a broader range of
financial services when the Supreme Court refused to review a key appeals
court ruling allowing some banks to market insurance.
The Supreme Court decided to let stand a ruling that allowed Citicorp, New
York-based banking group, to continue to exploit Delaware state law by
selling insurance policies through its Delaware unit.
Insurance agents have been battling to close the Delaware loophole through
this legal challenge and by efforts to include a ban on insurance sales in
last year's banking bill.
'Obviously our legal options have now been exhausted. The only arena that is
left is the legislative arena,' said Mr Bob Rusbuldt of the Independent
Insurance Agents of America, which had brought the case against Citicorp.
The loophole has illustrated the tug of war over the US financial services
industry in recent years, as banking regulators have used state and federal
law to expand the services that may be offered by banks.
The 1990 state law allowed banks to enter the insurance business through
locally chartered subsidiaries, an opportunity taken by Citicorp and Bankers
Trust. Last year's banking legislation blocked Delaware from allowing
insurance underwriting, but left open the right to sell policies.
A similar loophole in federal law has been used by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency to allow federally chartered banks based in
towns with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants to sell insurance in their home
states.
The Office of Thrift Supervision, meanwhile, last month announced an
expansion of the right for savings and loans institutions in its
jurisdiction to open branches outside their home states - just weeks after
Congress had decided against similar interstate branching powers for banks.
Many bankers believe that this approach, rather than another bid for a
comprehensive banking reform bill, is their best tactic for winning new
privileges. Citicorp management changes, Page 17

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US SUPREME Court hearings resumed yesterday in the long-running tobacco
product liability case, Cipollone versus Liggett, with Judge Clarence
Thomas, the newest appointee to the court, hearing the matter for the first
time.
Essentially, the court must decide whether federally mandated health
warnings on cigarette packaging pre-empt remedies under state product
liability laws.
The case is seen as one of the most important business-related issues which
the Supreme Court will consider during the current term, with implications
spreading beyond the tobacco industry.
In all arguments yesterday, the plaintiff's lawyers claimed that Congress
had never intended to give companies 'a cast-iron guarantee' against all
state tort action. The defendants, by contrast, claim that the tobacco
legislation was designed specifically to fall outside the normal US pattern
of federal law supplemented by state regulation.
Some observers have argued that a ruling in favour of pre-emption could
effectively end litigation against US tobacco companies, while others have
claimed that a ruling the other way will prompt a flood of new smokers' law
suits. This, it is claimed, could expose tobacco companies to more than
Dollars 100bn (Pounds 56bn) in liabilities.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Test for Collor on austerity policy
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor today faces a crucial political test of
his government's fiscal austerity policy which could determine his success
in obtaining a Dollars 2bn loan from the International Monetary Fund next
week.
The government is fighting for congressional approval of legislation to
increase social security contributions in order to pay a 147 per cent rise
in pensions granted last week by the Supreme Court.
Mr Collor claims that the state welfare system is bankrupt and that the
extra Cr11 trillion (Dollars 10bn) that the pension increase would cost the
Treasury would wipe out all its gains from recently approved tax reforms.
This would jeopardise its proposed fiscal adjustments due to be presented to
the IMF next week.
But amid growing controversy over the system's lack of funds it seems
unlikely that the government will secure approval of the new law.
Yesterday Mr Genebaldo Correia, congressional leader of Brazil's main
political party, the PMDB, said it would vote against the project.
The government insists that the changing demographic profile of Brazil's
population is responsible for the welfare system's parlous financial state.
But opposition politicians claim that the government has been using the
funds to finance schemes such as Mr Collor's pet multi-million dollar
project to construct integrated education centres.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Keating back on high-wire, watched by nervous markets:
Former treasurer, now PM, leads Labor balancing act to restore confidence in
Australian economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government faces a difficult balancing act over the next
few weeks as it seeks to restore confidence to the flagging economy without
spooking nervous financial markets.
Mr Paul Keating, the former treasurer (finance minister) who replaced Mr Bob
Hawke as prime minister in December, got the job because Australians had
lost faith in Mr Hawke's ability to guide the economy out of recession.
Paradoxically, Mr Keating's mismanagement of monetary policy was partly to
blame for seven quarters of flat or negative growth which has pushed
unemployment to a post-war record of 10.5 per cent.
Nevertheless, he appeared to be the only hope for a government traumatised
by Mr Hawke's loss of direction, and desperate to achieve an economic
recovery in time for the next general election, due in May 1993.
Mr Keating has been uncharacteristically quiet since ousting Mr Hawke in a
ballot of Labor MPs on December 19. But he has promised an economic
statement in late February or early March to 'get the economy moving again'.
In the meantime, the prime minister and his cabinet are travelling the
country talking to state and business leaders to cast off an image of cosy
Canberra-bound isolation which built up under Mr Hawke's leadership.
The government is offering a stimulus intended to kickstart the economy
through a mixture of tax incentives for investment, job creation schemes,
and pump-priming through direct government investment at state and federal
level in infrastructure projects.
It is a strategy which will be sympathetically received by business groups,
which have been complaining for months that the economy is in much worse
condition than the government's Canberra-based economic advisers have
claimed.
Mr Keating's problem is that the statement must deliver a stimulus big
enough to have a real impact on the economy, or it will be forgotten within
days, as was a ADollars 300m (Pounds 122m) stimulus delivered by Mr Hawke in
November.
But it is not clear how a larger fiscal stimulus can be reconciled with the
government's long-term target for a balanced budget, stable currency and a
reduction in last year's ADollars 15.7bn current account deficit.
The federal budget is forecast to be in deficit by ADollars 5bn this year as
a result of extra spending and reduced revenues caused by the recession, but
is claimed by the government to be in structural surplus  - implying that
the deficit will disappear when the economy recovers.
Mr John Dawkins, the former employment minister who was appointed treasurer
at the end of last month, says there is scope for further relaxation of
fiscal policy without endangering the structural surplus.
Scepticism about the budget arithmetic was behind a fall of more than 1.5 US
cents in the value of the Australian dollar last week as overseas investors
sent a powerful warning about the dangers of too much pump priming.
The currency regained some stability yesterday , when it recovered to close
at 74.2 US cents in Sydney and at the same level later in London after
intervention by the Reserve (central) Bank of Australia and the US Federal
Reserve.
But most economists expect it to continue to decline over the next few weeks
to between 70 and 72 cents as uncertainty about the Keating statement
continues.
A decline of that much would not unduly concern the government, which would
welcome the short-term beneficial impact on Australia's exporters of
minerals and agricultural goods.
But speculative pressure on the volatile Australian dollar could cause a
currency crisis if Mr Keating's statement fails to demonstrate that the
federal budget is under tight control.
A lower exchange rate also risks re-igniting inflation, currently 3.3 per
cent. The rate is expected to fall further in figures for the December
quarter due later this month, but the falling dollar could worsen a forecast
upward trend later in the year.
The government's freedom of movement is further constrained by the current
account deficit, which reached ADollars 21bn in 1989/90 before falling
slowly last year, and the ADollars 133.5bn foreign debt, equivalent to about
31 per cent of gross domestic product.
Mr Dawkins said recently that he expected the deficit to fall to ADollars
14bn in the current year, equivalent to 3.25 per cent of GDP - low enough to
slow the growth of the debt-to-GDP ratio, but not to stabilise it.
However, monthly figures for the first five months of the year suggest that
the deficit will again exceed ADollars 15bn, even if the economy remains in
recession.
The dilemma for Mr Keating is that too large a stimulus could worsen the
deficit, leading to a renewed balance of payments crisis followed by another
economic slowdown.
But too small a stimulus could fail to take effect until next year - too
late to affect the election.

FT  14 JAN 92 / India bids to repair trade relations with Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K K SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S foreign minister, Mr J N Dixit, left for Moscow yesterday on a
mission to improve relations with Russia and the other republics left from
the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
India, which was the Soviet Union's main ally in Asia, misjudged
developments, placing its trust in Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and failing to
nurture relations with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. It now finds
itself without the preferential treatment it had enjoyed.
Relations with Russia and the republics are important not only because the
Soviet Union was the main supplier of cheap and advanced defence equipment
for India but also because it was a key trading partner.
Mr Dixit's delegation includes Mr A V Ganesan, commerce secretary, and Mr N
N Vohra, defence secretary.
Since Soviet defence supplies dried up several months ago, the Indian armed
forces find themselves equipped with sophisticated weapons which could
become unusable because of lack of spares.
An annual trade protocol between India and the Soviet Union used to be
signed every December for decades. It was based on barter arrangements and
last year's agreement was worth Rs90bn (Pounds 1.86bn). The protocol for
1992 is still to be discussed with Russia and those for the other republics
and are nowhere in sight.
Trade has been cut to a trickle and India is short of supplies of Russian
oil, natural gas, fertilisers and ferrous and non-ferrous metal which it
used to import in mass.
Indian exports are also affected and many businessmen have made shipments
for which payment has still be made. They are refusing to export more goods
without a suitable payments arrangement.
Before the trade protocol is signed, the vexed question of the rupee-rouble
exchange rate has to be sorted out.

GENERAL MOTORS of the US is to set up an Indian joint venture with Hindustan
Motors to manufacture auto components, the Indian government said yesterday.
The venture will involve an investment of Rs8bn (Pounds 165m), with GM
holding a 30 per cent stake. It will export auto components from India to
GM's subsidiaries and associates throughout the world.
Later the plant will manufacture light commercial vehicles and
fuel-efficient cars within Hindustan Motors' existing licensed capacity.
The project is one of seven approved by the government yesterday, and brings
to 10 the number of big foreign investment proposals since India liberalised
its investment laws last July. A foreign equity inflow of Dollars 120m
(Pounds 67m) is expected from the 10 proposals.
Approval of the seven projects - which include Coca-Cola's re-entry into
India after winding up its operations there in 1978 - is a signal to foreign
companies that India now welcomes investment.
Under the liberalised foreign investment policy, companies can win
'automatic approval' for their proposals, provided their equity share is
limited to 51 per cent. A number of areas closed to foreign companies have
been thrown open.
Coca-Cola will re-enter India through a deal with Mr Rajan Pillai, an Indian
resident in Singapore, who controls Britannia Industries. An offshore
company incorporated in Hong Kong has been set up, in which Mr Pillai has a
60 per cent share and Coca-Cola 40 per cent. The venture will have a total
equity of Rs269m, of which the foreign equity will be Rs177m.
Among other proposals approved yesterday was one by General Electric to set
up a joint venture with Godrej, the Indian business house, to manufacture
white goods such as refrigerators and washing-machines. The total equity of
Rs1.2bn includes General Electric's investment of Rs480m.
Suzuki Motors' proposal to increase its investment in Maruti Udyog by Rs220m
will enable the existing joint venture, in which the government has a share,
to increase its capacity, mainly for export.
Also approved was Francis Klein's proposal to set up a venture with Gerb of
Germany to manufacture specialised vibration-isolating systems for use in
power plants.

<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE of the UK and Westinghouse of the US have gained a first
foothold on a new generation of ship engines for the US Navy with a Dollars
160m (Pounds 89.3m) contract to develop a gas turbine propulsion system.
The deal is the first fruit of a collaboration between the two companies
announced in September 1991.
Rolls-Royce is the sub-contractor to Westinghouse. Its share of the deal is
worth Dollars 67m, but this could rise to Dollars 120m if all the contract
options are taken up.
If the US Navy then presses ahead with full-scale development and
manufacturing, it could provide Rolls-Royce with a lucrative new source of
income.
'This is our first contract for US Navy ships for more than 20 years,' said
Rolls-Royce yesterday.
The four-year contract is to develop a 26,400 horse power intercooled
recuperated (ICR) gas turbine engine from Rolls-Royce's RB211 aero engine.
The ICR technology alternately cools and heats gases in the engine to
improve fuel efficiency. Rolls-Royce says that the result is a 30 per cent
fall in fuel consumption. The contract includes design, development and
testing.

QATAR plans to build a joint methanol plant with Penspen, the British

northern gas field, Reuter reports from Bahrain.
Industry sources in the Gulf said yesterday that Qatar last week signed an
agreement with the London-based group to design and project manage the
2,000-tonne per day plant in Umm Said, on the east coast.
They said construction of the plant would cost around Dollars 400m (Pounds
214m) and would be financed jointly by Qatar and British companies.
The money would probably be raised from commercial banks in the area, they
said, but gave no other details.
Penspen declined to comment on the agreement.
Qatar's vast north field gas reservoir, the world's biggest, began
production last August with a target rate of 800m cubic feet per day. The
reservoir contains 380 trillion (million million) cu ft of reserves.

<TEXT>
Since 1990, the US has established formal structures for the conduct of
bilateral trade relations under a series of 16 'framework' agreements in
Latin American and one in Singapore, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
While the agreements are viewed by some as 'just pieces of paper', they hold
the promise for the US, as senior partner, of achieving bilaterally or
regionally many reforms which have proved difficult to get in Gatt. In Latin
America, they are paving the way for free trade agreements.
The pacts generally establish trade and investment councils to monitor trade
and investment relations, pursue the goals of open markets and negotiate
agreements. A typical pact was signed with Honduras in November 1990. It set
out, as an agenda, co-operation on the Uruguay Round, increased market
access, improvement of intellectual property rights protection and reduction
of trade and investment barriers.

JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry is worried the economic
accords reached with the US during President George Bush's visit could
accelerate a drift towards managed trade.
The agreements - which set targets for Japanese companies' purchases of
US-made motor parts - have left Miti officials feeling distinctly
uncomfortable.
They fear the accords could set a precedent for other industries and other
regions, notably the EC, which like the US has a large trade deficit with
Japan.
Other officials say the agreements were essential to maintain relations with
the US - Japan had little choice given the priority Mr Bush put on the motor
industry.
But even the agreement's supporters do not hide their distaste. As Mr Noboru
Hatakeyama, the Miti vice-minister for international affairs, puts it: 'We
are in a dilemma. It would be good for this kind of thing not to exist. But
since we are experiencing a lot of trade imbalances with the rest of the
world, we think it would be good for the Japanese government to try
everything it can within the limits of the government's reach.'
The accords announced last week highlight the extent to which Miti has
developed a new role for itself in the Japanese and world economy. In the
1950s and 1960s, its main policy was to foster growth through the expansion
of exports. By the 1980s, Japanese companies were so successful that Miti
began to put more emphasis on export restraint than on export promotion. But
this was not enough to satisfy Japan's trading partners. So in the last few
years, an increasingly high priority has been put on import promotion.
The government's budget for import-promotion has grown five-fold since 1989
to a planned Y10.1bn (Pounds 44.1m) for the year starting in April. In some
countries, including the US, the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro),
which was established for promoting exports, is more active helping foreign
companies sell goods in Japan.
These measures are all forms of government intervention in trade. But Miti
has been wary of going one big step further and trying to set import
targets.
In a sense, the motor parts agreement signed last week has a precedent in
the US-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, which was first signed in 1986. In
response to great pressure from the US, Japan agreed to measures to regulate
trade in semiconductors, including a pledge to help American chip-makers
increase sales in the Japanese market. The accord contained a controversial
'side-letter' in which Japan acknowledged US companies hopes' that foreign
makers would attain a 20 per cent share of the Japanese semiconductor
market.
The wording was left deliberately vague at Miti's insistence, since Japanese
officials did not want to be bound to a target. But US companies insisted
that, whatever the verbal niceties, Japan had made a commitment.
Following much acrimony, the agreement was renewed last year, with the
reference to the 20 per cent market share for foreign companies being
incorporated into the main body of the accord. There is still plenty of
scope for further arguments since US companies believe the deadline for the
20 per cent target to be reached is the end of 1992 and foreign makers'
currently have around 15 per cent of the Japanese market.
Some Miti officials fear the motor parts agreement is even more likely to
cause disputes than the semiconductor accord. Under the accord, Japanese
companies have promised to increase their purchases of US-made parts from
Dollars 9bn in the 1990 fiscal year to Dollars 19bn in the 1994 fiscal year.
This includes both imports and purchases by Japanese companies for their
factories in the US.
Among the potential causes for dispute is a vague reference to the fact that
US parts makers should 'make their best efforts' to work with Japanese
companies. Another is a loosely-worded Japanese promise to give 'special
consideration' to the US parts industry. This means Japanese car makers are
expected to favour US-owned component makers over the American subsidiaries
of Japanese parts companies.
Moreover, the fact that pledges made by private companies are incorporated
into a government-to-government agreement could in itself spark future
arguments.
It should be said that both US and Japanese officials drafted the agreement
under difficult conditions: Mr Bush was under pressure to achieve concrete
'results'. Miti for its part had to deal with companies which were reluctant
to put their names to numerical targets. Both sides also had to steer clear
of infringing their Gatt obligations.
Nevertheless, Miti officials acknowledge the accord comes at a delicate time
when Gatt members are trying to reach final agreement in the Uruguay Round.
One Miti official says the motor parts accord was designed to meet
short-term political objectives, at the expense of medium- and long-term
goals. The danger is that it may not even do that, given the hostile
reception that greeted Mr Bush on his return to the US.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UN team due in Croatia today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first team of 50 United Nations observers arrives today in Croatia on a
fact-finding mission aimed at deciding whether 10,000 UN troops will be
deployed throughout the republic.
The team, drawn from UN peace-keeping forces in the Middle East, will set up
communications links between the Croatian, Serbian and federal army forces.
One group of observers will remain in Croatia, and part of the second group
is expected to be sent to the ethnically-mixed republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'The UN's first task will be to establish liaison groups between the three
sides in the conflict,' said Mr Joao Mira Gomes, the deputy spokesman for
European Community monitors based in Zagreb. 'The UN observers will then
recommend to New York if the appropriate conditions exist for sending the
blue helmets,' a western diplomat added.
The federal army will today open a liaison office in Zagreb - in the same
hotel as the EC - following an agreement reached at the weekend in Pecs,
Hungary, between the EC, the army, and Croatia.
'This liaison office is necessary because there must be guarantees that the
ceasefire agreement will hold, and the safety of the EC and UN observers can
be ensured,' Mr Mira Gomes said. EC monitors do not want any repeat of last
week's incident in which a federal army jet shot down an EC monitors'
helicopter, killing all five members on board.
Mr Mira Gomes said the UN observers will also work closely with the EC
monitors to ensure the implementation of the latest ceasefire, which was
forged by the UN earlier this month and which still appears to be holding.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's envoy to Yugoslavia, has insisted that a ceasefire
is a precondition for deploying any UN troops.
If deployed, the UN forces would be sent to three regions of Croatia,
including the self-proclaimed Serb-inhabited republic of Krajina,
south-western Croatia.
Deployment will be linked to the complete withdrawal of the federal army
from Croatia, and the disarming of all Croat and Serb paramilitary units.
But Mr Milan Babic, leader of Krajina, is refusing to disarm his units.
The thorny issue of EC recognition of the former Yugoslav republics will be
the focus of deliberations this week, beginning with a meeting today in
Lisbon of senior officials from Community governments.
The decision on recognition depends on a report by Mr Robert Badinter, head
of an EC arbitration commission, on whether the republics seeking
independence have met human rights obligations.
The report, originally due to be circulated to Community governments at the
weekend, is now not expected to reach them until today, officials said.
But Germany has already formally recognised Slovenia and Croatia, although
in deference to its EC partners it has agreed not to implement its decision
until tomorrow.
The German Foreign Ministry yesterday said protocols would be signed in
Ljubljana and Zagreb on Wednesday, changing the German consulates there into
embassies.
The Vatican yesterday also formally recognised Croatia and Slovenia, both of
which are mainly Roman Catholic.

FT  14 JAN 92 / European Diary: Zurich braces itself for drugs park
withdrawal symptoms - Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS in Zurich's notorious Platzspitz, one of Europe's main gathering
places for drug addicts, have risen ominously in the past few days with the
erection of high steel fencing around the benighted park.
The construction signals that the city's tormented leaders have at last
settled on a course of action to end an experiment in rehabilitating
Switzerland's surprisingly numerous drug addicts.
Platzspitz has become famous as much for its ironic location - within a
stone's throw of the glittering shopping and banking plazas of central
Zurich - as for the macabre scenes of its everyday life.
City officials admit that the park, which had been intended as a place where
addicts could find clean syringes and a path to rehabilitation, had become a
huge open market for professional drug dealers.
According to one official, the dealers there were serving not just the
2,000-odd regular addicts in the park but an additional 10,000 or more
casual customers from all around the region.
Also, concentration of the region's addicts at Platzspitz was causing
increasing resentment among Zurich residents. Not only did it add
considerably to the city's operating costs, it also boosted crime levels in
the centre of the city to levels that merchants were no longer willing to
tolerate.
For all this, the Platzspitz experiment has not been a total failure. Dr
Albert Wettstein, Zurich's chief medical officer, says that only 5 per cent
of those coming to the park since the free syringe policy was introduced
have contracted Aids. Before that, the figure was as high as 50 per cent.
However, last October, the city council conceded defeat and agreed in
principle to close down Platzspitz. A new strategy of dispersing addicts, in
the hope of getting rid of both the professional dealers and the crime,
would be implemented.
This has not proved easy. Other local authorities around the country have
not been exactly delighted at the prospect of having their addicts come
home. And there has been strong opposition from residents in areas of Zurich
where the council has set up shelters for its own Platzspitz refugees.
From yesterday the new fences around Platzspitz and an adjacent underground
shopping centre where many addicts sleep at night will be locked from 10pm
until 7am.
Transportation is to be provided to take addicts to shelters in the city for
the night, but they will be allowed to stay at the shelters only at night,
and will be unable to reserve a bed from one night to the next. Non-Zurich
residents will be barred after five consecutive nights and pointed toward
their homes.
Mr Robert Neukomm, director of the Zurich police department, said Platzspitz
would be closed 'before the end of the winter'. Police patrols would be
stepped up to make sure that no new centre for drug dealing established
itself.
Zurich's struggle with drug addicts dates from the late 1970s when young
people, disaffected with their country's clockwork society, gathered in the
Bellevue area of the city. A socialist city administration was loathe to be
tough on them. Some counsellors even campaigned to have heroin distributed
free.
Under pressure from merchants, city leaders sought a less conspicuous
gathering place for the addicts, settling in 1987 on Platzspitz which,
although central, is hidden behind the National Museum on a promontory where
the Limmat and Sihl rivers meet.
There, dealers could sell their drugs, addicts could inject themselves and
no one noticed. The police were under orders not to arrest people who
carried only small quantities of drugs, and the social services did what
they could.
In 1988, alarm at the rising of level of Aids in the Zurich area prompted
the city to institute a policy of distributing free syringes and clean
needles in the park.
From then on, Platzspitz grew and grew. According to statistics released
this week, 116 people in the Zurich area died from drug-related causes last
year, almost double the number of the year before.
Despite its international fame, Platzspitz regulars are almost entirely
Swiss. According to the Zurich police, about a third are Zurich residents
with almost all the rest from elsewhere in the country.
How they will be provided for once Platzspitz closes remains uncertain. One
option was eliminated when the national interior minister, Mr Flavio Cotti,
flatly rejected a request from 100 Social Democratic politicians from the
canton of Zurich that heroin be distributed free to addicts under medical
supervision.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Turkey plans rise in state sell-offs

<TEXT>
TURKEY'S coalition government has tried to dispel doubts about its
commitment to privatisation by announcing plans to raise Tl 5,000bn (Pounds
523m) this year through the sale of its minority stakes in private sector
companies. The sum is twice the figure realised by the outgoing Motherland
party administration in 1991 through similar sales.
The announcement by Mr Cavit Caglar, the state minister in charge, was
greeted with interest from bankers. Mr Caglar said the block sale of
minority shares in 28 companies would be completed this year. Separate
preparations were also being made to sell 11 state-owned cement companies.
The statement, however, does little to resolve the issue of the future of
the 120 companies where the government is the majority partner. These
include the power utility Tek, the state railways, and the national coal
company.
Turkey's state companies are said to account for 25 per cent of
manufacturing capacity and half of total fixed investment. Losses in 1991
are estimated at Tl 13,000bn, equivalent to half of the government budget
deficit which is running at around 11 per cent of GNP.
The government is due to present its new economic programme to parliament on
Thursday. The business lobby Tusiad this week urged the government to take
strong action to stem the losses.
'It is a fact that some of the state enterprises can neither be privatised
nor revived. There is no other solution than closing them down,' said Mr
Bulent Eczacibasi, Tusiad chairman.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S privatisation authorities have launched a battery of initiatives
in an effort to build on last year's record level of sell-offs.
The drive is given urgency by Hungary's recession, which continues despite
the highest level of foreign investment in eastern Europe.
The State Property Agency (SPA), the privatisation authority, yesterday
announced proposals for improved conditions for investors. It plans to
plough back privatisation proceeds into three funds designed to remove much
of the political and business risk involved in takeovers.
The funds would allow 'quicker and safer investments,' said Mr Lajos Csepi,
managing director of the SPA. One would help restructure state enterprises;
another would temper the unemployment resulting from privatisation; and the
third would provide guarantees against hidden liabilities such as
environmental damage.
The SPA also signalled further efforts to remove the bureaucratic red tape
which often entangles sales of state companies.
Half of state enterprises, including all those valued at under Ft1bn (Pounds
7m), are to be freed from the agency's direct supervision.
In addition, the SPA appears unlikely to impede plans by some consultants to
deal directly with creditors of bankrupt public sector companies.
Completed privatisations attracted Dollars 770m (Pounds 429m) in foreign
investment last year, roughly equal to that put into 'green field' ventures.

The drivers said 7,000 taxis would surround the building at the heart of St

Taxi fares went up 10 times at the start of the year as part of plans to

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday came under strong pressure to resign from
his post as prime minister amid increasingly fierce criticism of the Russian
government's decision to free prices.
Mr Yeltsin's press secretary denied rumours that he was quitting as head of
the cabinet of ministers, but government advisers said he was under mounting
pressure to do so.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, said during a
discussion with Italian senators that now was the time for Mr Yeltsin to
replace the 'incompetent' cabinet - or else the parliament would vote it out
of office. He added that Mr Yeltsin should 'distance himself' from the
government, since 'a president is a person standing, as it were, above the
state'.
The cold blast of public distaste for price rises which in some cases have
increased by as much as 30 times is now blowing through the corridors of
power, as deputies and officials hear from furious constituents, and as
demonstrations, the largest organised by hard-line Communists, begin to
gather force.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, was
hauled over the coals by the presidium of the Russian parliament, the forum
in which Mr Khasbulatov made a speech calling for the government to go.
Mr Khasbulatov's remarks, following a trip to provincial cities over the
weekend to see the level of dissatisfaction at first hand, were followed by
a report by the Interfax news agency that several people were being
canvassed as prime ministerial material. These included Mr Khasbulatov
himself, Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg, and Mr Svyatoslav
Feodorov, an eye surgeon, and formerly a candidate for the post.
Mr Alexei Trepekhalin, an aide to Mr Khasbulatov, said last night that 'the
chairman has no intention of becoming prime minister, and will stay as
chairman'. However, his defection to the ranks of the government's critics
means that two highly placed critics - he and Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the
vice-president, - are in open revolt against the government.
The high prices are also stimulating calls for the government's resignation
in Ukraine.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA and Ukraine have said they will both ratify the Start nuclear weapons
reduction treaty and the treaty on reducing conventional forces in Europe as
part of their agreement to divide the Black Sea Fleet between them.
These treaties were not ratified by the Union Supreme Soviet before its
demise last year. The agreement to ratify them by both the Russian and
Ukrainian legislatures is an indication that Ukraine has established a form
of joint control over the nuclear weapons on its territories, and can act as
a guarantor of international treaties concerning them.
However, actual ratification and full agreement between the two states on
defence issues may be some way off - the agreement reached in Kiev at the
weekend refers ultimate agreement to further talks and work by experts. An
aide to Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said 'it would be wrong
to say that there has been any conclusive resolution to this issue'.
Mr Andrei Kozhyrev, the Russian foreign minister, has hailed the agreement
to divide the fleet and ratify the agreements as a 'step towards the
formation of good neighbourly relations between the two countries and
peoples'.
Tensions between the Ukraine and Russia remain high, however, especially
over economic reform. Ukraine's decision to switch a large part of workers'
pay packets to coupons will mean an avalanche of unwanted roubles flooding
into Russia, further pushing up prices which are already up to 30 times
higher.
A meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in Minsk on
January 24 is advertised as focusing on both defence and economic issues.
However, all three previous meetings - two in Minsk, one in Alma Ata - have
seen the members grow further apart, rather than closer, on most fundamental
questions. Most are now laying the foundations for separate armies, most are
considering the introduction of a separate currency, and most - including
Russia - now have trade barriers against each others' produce.
Officials from the commonwealth will meet western bankers in Frankfurt today
to discuss deferring interest payments on its foreign debt, sources close to
the talks told Reuter in Frankfurt.
The former Soviet republics are also likely to ask for an extension of an
existing deferral of principal payments until the end of 1992, in line with
an agreement reached in Paris with government creditors.
The two-pronged request would dent banks' trust in the CIS but the banks
would have no choice other than to accept. Commerzbank's spokesman, Mr Peter
Pietsch, said: 'There's very little we could do against such a request.'
The Russian central bank said on Friday it would seek to postpone interest
payments on both government and bank debt because other commonwealth members
had not produced their share of the cash.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, head of Deutsche Bank, said a more comprehensive debt
deferral arrangement than the one agreed in Paris might be needed in the
second half of this year.
He told the Handelsblatt newspaper he doubted whether the commonwealth
states would be able to accumulate the currency needed for current interest
payments and the deferred principal payments. Germany's economics minister,
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, has invited counterparts from the Group of Seven
nations and the CIS to a two-day meeting in Munster opening on May 8, Reuter
reports from Bonn. An economics ministry spokesman said the meeting would
focus on future western aid for the commonwealth and the rest of eastern
Europe.

As nominations closed yesterday evening, no major figure had come forward to

FT  14 JAN 92 / German steel industry faces strike action over pay claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first strike in the German steel industry for more than 10 years loomed
closer yesterday after pay talks broke off.
An increased management offer, and a conciliatory proposal from union
negotiators failed to break the impasse in the eighth bout of negotiations.
As the wages commission of IG Metall, the country's biggest union, gathered
later to plan strike action, the leader of the DGB trade union federation
declared that the Bonn coalition and employers were 'back on the old
confrontation course' with the unions.
The roots of the current strife lie in union claims that wage earners have
been obliged to pay more than their fair share of the costs of unification.
Although they were assured by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that there would be no
tax increases following unification in October 1990, they have since been
burdened with a special two-year 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge to pay
for community works in the east.
Cigarettes, heating fuel and petrol have also been laden with extra duties
specifically to raise funds for the five new states. Unions also claim that,
while company profits have boomed thanks to increased sales to the former
DDR, their real earning power has been eroded.
The gap between employers and steel unions has, however, closed markedly,
with management offering a phased deal worth 5.2 per cent, and the unions
dropping their 10.5 per cent demand to a package worth 'just over 6 per
cent'.
Both sides seem increasingly anxious to avoid a strike. Steel companies are
concerned that confrontation now with the country's 135,000 steelworkers
might lead to greater conflicts later with the 4m engineering industry
workers who have yet to put in their 1992 pay claim.
Steel industry employees are
also under psychological pressure from the likelihood of job losses later
this year as rationalisation in the industry progresses.
Thyssen, the biggest steelmaker in the country, is reviewing its production,
while Krupp and Hoesch, two leading manufacturers are in the process of
merging.
Even so, the structure of the three-stage IG Metall proposal, ending with a
6.7 per cent increase for the last four months of the one-year deal, was
unacceptable to employers.
IG Metall's wages commission was expected to declare the negotiations with
management formally at an end and call a strike ballot.
The first union claims for increases of around 10 per cent ran into early
opposition when they were put in late last year.
Resistance has hardened since Christmas as economists have steadily
downgraded their forecasts for west German economic growth this year.
The government, which shortly will publish a situation report showing that
growth in the west could be as low as 1 per cent, has lately piled on the
pressure for restraint.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Power station contract awarded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Power, the independent power generator, has awarded a Pounds 370m
turnkey contract for its 1000MW power station at Barking Reach, east London,
to a consortium of Balfour Beatty Projects &amp; Engineering and GEC Alsthom
Power Plants.
Balfour Beatty is part of BICC, the construction and enginnering group that
jointly owns Thames Power with Canadian Utilities, a susidiary of Atco of
Canada.
The new station will use modern 'combined cycle' gas-fired technology, which
has become increasingly popular since electricity privatisation because it
is cleaner and more efficient than coal-fired generation.
It will include five 123MW gas turbines built by European Gas Turbines,
another subsidiary of GEC Althsom. It is the sixth UK combined-cycle
contract for the Anglo-French engineering group in little more than a year.
Work will begin in July, and is scheduled to take three years.

A multilateral phase of Middle East peace talks due to convene in Moscow
this month will probably be postponed until March, a senior Jordanian
official said, Reuter reports from Amman. The official gave no reason for
the delay but said Jordan welcomed the move, which would give more time for
talks in Washington to make progress.
The multilateral talks, the third phase of the Middle East peace process
launched last year, had been due to start in Moscow on January 28.

FT  14 JAN 92 / BR chief moves to clarify position on privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BOB REID, chairman of British Rail, last night moved to counter
speculation that the British Railways Board is opposed to privatisation and
wants to see the railway system sold as a single unit.
Speaking at the Chartered Institute of Transport in London, Sir Bob said
those two 'propositions' could not both be right, and in fact were both
wrong.
'I have never expressed a desire to see the railway sold off as a whole,'
Sir Bob said. 'Our wish is to see preserved both the safety and integrity of
operation and access to a national network for the customer.'
The board could see no objection in priciple to the involvement of the
private sector in the rail business. Much of what was once part of BR -
ferries, hotels, manufacturing - had already been privatised. Sir Bob said
he wanted to see more joint operations with the private sector. Open access
 -for other companies to use the rail network - was an aim of government
policy and the privatisation debate had to bear in mind the implications of
that.
Sir Bob said the board had a responsibility to advise the government on what
was practical and workable for the railways.
The options for privatisations should be tested against five criteria, he
said. Privatisation should:
Build on the board's success in pursuing value for money.
Lead to improved services for customers and ensure a national network
remained open to them.
Allow a railway to compete vigorously within the domestic and international
transport markets for passengers and freight.
Meet the needs of operational integrity and protect safety of operations.
Provide for the necessary investment in the railway to continue without a
damaging hiatus.
Sir Bob said the industry was at a crucial point in the investment cycle and
the privatisation proposals had to address that.
He warned that care would have to be taken in finding the right formula and
the right pace of change.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Wage gap 'wider than in 1886'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP between the earnings of the highest and lowest-paid employees is
wider today than it was in Victorian times, according to an analysis of
official figures carried out for the Council of Europe by the Low Pay Unit
pressure group.
According to the LPU analysis, the lowest tenth of male earnings was 68.6
per cent of median male earnings in 1886, when pay figires were first
recorded. In 1991 the figure had dropped to 64.2 per cent.
At the same time, the highest tenth of male earnings were 143.1 per cent of
the median in 1886 and 160.1 per cent in 1991, the figures show.
More than 27 per cent of full-time workers earn less than the LPU's low pay
threshold - set at two thirds of average male earnings - even when overtime
pay is included, according to the group.
The Labour has set an ultimate target for the level of a proposed national
minimum wage of two-thirds average earnings. Its immediate target if it wins
the next general election is for a minimum wage to match half average
earnings.
The study also found that progress towards equal pay between men and women
was slow during the 1980s and, although gains have been made recently, at
the current rate it will still take 55 years for women's weekly earnings to
reach those of men. Women working full-time still earn, on average, only 70
per cent of men's pay, the LPU reported.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Russia cuts natural gas supplies to Poland
</HEADLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has cut by half its deliveries of natural gas to Poland, adding to
Warsaw's economic uncertainty in face of protests over the steep new year
price increases for energy, AP reports from Warsaw.
Mr Andrzej Olechowski, deputy foreign trade minister, said yesterday that
Russian exporters had informed Polish companies of reduced deliveries since
the government in Moscow had failed to set export quotas for natural
resources for 1992.
'We do not consider the situation serious because it is only a result of
bureaucratic delays,' Mr Olechowski.
The Solidarity trade union, along with two other big labour federations, had
called for strikes today and on Thursday to protest at the price increases
for natural gas, electricity and hot-water heating.
Dissatisfaction with the hardships of market reforms pose a threat to the
stability of Poland's three-week-old government of Prime Minister Jan
Olszewski. The price rises, ranging from 20 to 100 per cent, result from
increased expenditure on energy and lower government subsidies.
Following 'energetic' intervention in Moscow, deliveries are expected to
return within the next few days to the levels set by a trade agreement
between Russia and Poland, Mr Olechowski said.
After months of uncertainty in trade with the former Soviet Union, which for
decades had been Poland's biggest trading partner, the deal on December 24
deal provides for deliveries of 8.1bn cubic metres of natural gas and 5m
tons of oil in return for Polish foodstuffs and medicines.
The switch in 1991 to hard currency payments in trade within the former
eastern bloc and economic turmoil in the former Soviet Union saw a 60 per
cent decline in trade between Poland and its neighbour.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Radical reform of Irish tax system called for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ADVISORY body to the Irish Department of Industry has recommended an
urgent overhaul of the country's tax system, just three weeks before the
government is due to present its 1992 budget.
The Industrial Policy Review Group (IPRG), made up of leaders of Irish
industry, financial institutions and trade unions, in a report published
last week, noted: 'It is time for the government. . . to take the hard
political decisions and decisive action needed for a thoroughgoing reform of
our taxation system.'
The report criticises the pervasiveness of ad-hoc tax breaks and incentives
in the economy 'which have no coherent pattern or logic'. It recommends
their phased reduction or elimination, in order to bring down personal
taxation rates, which are among the highest in the EC.
'Single persons on very little more than the average industrial wage pay a
marginal tax rate of almost 60 per cent,' the report says.
Such a reform, the report argues, would drastically reduce the need for
special reliefs and allowances which are now used 'to promote activities
perceived as necessary for economic development'.
The IPRG also recommends that the special 10 per cent corporate tax rate
applying to manufacturing industry should not be extended to new sectors, or
beyond the year 2010.
'The 10 per cent rate has been far more valuable to foreign-based than to
Irish-owned industry,' the IPRG says, although it recognises that it has
been 'the single most effective tool in inducing inward foreign investment'.
Standard-rate corporation tax is 40 per cent.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Bosnia officials fear Yugoslav war spreading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SARAJEVO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN decision not to send peace-keeping troops to the ethnically-mixed
central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina raises the possibility of
war spreading to the region, government ministers in Sarajevo said at the
weekend.
Moreover, Bosnian officials warned that if the European Community did not
recognise the republic next Wednesday, both Croatia and Serbia would attempt
to carve it up, even though this would lead to heavy loss of life.
Mr Haris Silajic, foreign minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina, said the UN
decision on peace-keeping troops was part of a compromise designed to
persuade Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, to accept the
international organisation's peace plan for Croatia.
That plan, agreed earlier this month by the governments of Croatia, Serbia
and the federal army, envisages the deployment of 10,000 troops in three
areas in Croatia, including the self-proclaimed Serb-inhabited republic of
Krajina, south-western Croatia.
But Mr Silajic and Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia-Hercegovina,
said in separate interviews that peace in Croatia would not mean peace
throughout the rest of Yugoslavia.
Bosnia-Hercegovina's coalition government consists of Moslems, Serbs and
Croats, the three main ethnic groups of the republic's 4.3m population.
The Bosnian Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, who is a close ally of Mr
Milosevic, opposes moves by the republic's Croats and Moslems to seek EC
recognition of independence.
Mr Silajic said Mr Karadzic wanted to make Bosnia-Hercegovina part of the
new, smaller Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. 'He has declared the independence of
the Serb communities in the republic, and insists he wants this region to be
part of the new Yugoslavia.'
The EC's recognition of Bosnia-Hercegovina's independence would legitimise
the republic's borders, and give the government in Sarajevo power to place
the army under political control, or else ask it to leave the republic
altogether.
Government officials in Sarajevo also have no doubt that Mr Franjo Tudjman,
president of Croatia, wants part of Bosnia to compensate for any loss of
Croatian territory to Serbia through the civil war.
Bosnia's Croats are organised under the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of
Bosnia, which is a member of the government coalition and is led by Mr
Stjepan Kluijic. The group is the sister party of Croatia's ruling HDZ. Mr
Kluijic admits he is 'a creation of Tudjman, but I do not support Tudjman's
attempts to carve up Bosnia.'
However, Mr Kluijic, a moderate, is under increasing pressure from the
nationalist wing of his party.

FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Maxwells under TV scrutiny -
Their parliamentary meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We're not political dentists - I can't get their mouths open and make them
speak' says Mr Frank Field, MP. Today at 2pm he will interview the sons of
the late Mr Robert Maxwell in his role as chairman of the parliamentary
committee that is trying to trace hundreds of millions of pounds missing
from the pension funds of the publisher's collapsed empire.
If Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell agree to answer the Social Security
committee's questions, it will be their first public comment on how the
money disappeared.
Today is a hectic day for Mr Kevin Maxwell's lawyers - at 10.30am,
unconnected with the committee proceedings, his court battle over his right
to refuse to answer questions about the missing millions goes to the Court
of Appeal.
Although the brothers are obliged to attend the Social Security committee,
it cannot force them to answer its questions, and attention will be on the
degree of their co-operation.
However, Mr Field pointed out yesterday that the committee would be
televised 'and silences will be recorded. In the days when the proceedings
were just recorded in Hansard, the importance of silences was not obvious'.
Mr Field added that he would open the committee by reminding those attending
that it was not a trial, but that he had suggested to the Maxwell brothers
that they could bring their lawyers if they wanted.
The Social Security committee has ordered the brothers to submit trust
deeds, accounts and financial statements on Maxwell family trusts and
foundations.
It is now clear that some of the missing pension fund money - which could be
as much as Pounds 700m - was used to shore up the tottering private Maxwell
companies. However these businesses, now in administration under insolvency
regulations, are ultimately owned by companies registered in Liechtenstein,
Luxembourg, Switzerland and Gibraltar, and the committee is hoping to shed
light on whether pension fund money has been diverted there.
The committee has said that with 16,000 Mirror and Maxwell pensioners
involved the case is of major public interest.
Its demand was submitted to the brothers in mid-December after they failed
to attend an earlier committee hearing into the loss of pension funds from
publicly listed Maxwell companies.
In a separate move today, the Court of Appeal will consider whether Mr Kevin
Maxwell can rely on the common law right against self-incrimination as a
ground for refusing to answer questions. He is not obliged to turn up in
person.
Mr Maxwell is appealing against Mr Justice Hoffman's decision on December 24
that he must comply with an order on December 8 requiring him to disclose on
affidavit his knowledge of transactions from October 1989 onwards involving
property funds or assets of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which was
manager of most of the pooled pension funds for Maxwell companies.
The basis for Mr Justice Hoffman's decision was that the order was made in
Companies Court proceedings under the 1986 Insolvency Act, which does not
entitle him to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination.
The court will also hear a separate cross-appeal from Mirror Group
Newspapers, one of the publicly-listed Maxwell companies, which has brought
an action for damages for breach of trust, fraud and conversion against Mr
Kevin Maxwell, his brother, and the personal representatives of their late
father.
MGN is appealing against Mr Justice Hoffman's decision that Mr Kevin Maxwell
should be excused from some of the disclosure requirements in an order on
December 12 as the order was obtained in ordinary proceedings by private
writ.

FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Hoare Govett makes 70
redundancies - Job cuts will mean more direct focus on corporate finance
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOARE GOVETT, the stockbroking firm owned by Security Pacific which has been
seeking a new backer for months, will announce tomorrow that it has made
around 70 of its 450 staff redundant, to focus more directly on its
corporate finance business.
The cuts, which will affect most levels and departments of the firm, will
cut back the market making, which employs some 30 people and an estimated
Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m capital.
The move follows the introduction of a bonus scheme, controversial inside
the firm, in which the top 70 have been locked in with 'loyalty payments'
believed to total around Pounds 7m.
Hoare Govett declined to comment 'on any matter involving our staff'. The
firm is expected to argue that the cuts - and bonuses - are necessary either
for a successful deal with a new owner or for the firm's independent
survival. The firm is understood to be in negotiations with a potential
buyer.
The move raises questions of whether the firm's chairman, Mr Peter
Meinertzhagen, has finally secured the future of one of the City's most
respected houses, given the repeated failure of proposed deals in the past
six months.
Hoare Govett's plans for a partial management buy-out from Security Pacific
were scuppered in October when SecPac merged with BankAmerica and it was
made clear that even a reduced investment in the securities firm would have
no place in the two banks' joint future. However Hoare Govett executives
were unable to finance a full buy-out, and the search began for new backers.
Hoare Govett says that no formal deadline has been given by SecPac, despite
reports of a six-month limit to its support. The firm made a small operating
profit in 1991 - Mr Meinertzhagen and his colleagues have cut the cost base
drastically in recent years - and it is believed to share its tax losses
with its owners.
Despite the uncertainty, the firm has managed to hold its share of UK
institutional business at about 5 per cent to 6 per cent, although that is
believed to have been slipping recently, and to have held its share of UK
market making at around 8 per cent to 9 per cent.
However, there is undeniable urgency in finding a solution to the firm's
ownership problems. Hoare's executives did not disguise their disappointment
when a proposed deal with Deutsche Bank fell through in December.
The pressure that Mr Meinertzhagen faces is that Hoare Govett's most
tempting asset, its exceptionally strong list of some 150 corporate clients,
is likely to erode if uncertainty continues.
The loyalty of those clients in recent years has been impressive. While the
firm has lost several - the industrial Sedgwick, both gained by Warburgs -
it was appointed recently by Redland, the building company, for its
attempted merger with Steetley.
Mr Gerald Corbett, Redland's finance director, is emphatic in his support.
'It is a fine established business, with a tremendous reputation on the
corporate side, and if we'd been concerned about its future we wouldn't have
gone there'. However the firm is not immune to the normal wear and tear on a
client list, such as conflicts of interest. As brokers to both Hanson and
ICI, Hoare's suffered the misfortune of being excluded from both sides when
Hanson took its exploratory and unwelcome stake in the chemicals group.
Redland apart, the uncertainty is likely to have been a handicap in winning
more business. The same risk of erosion may apply to its research team; its
leading banks analyst and its retail analyst left recently.
If those are the pressures on Mr Meinertzhagen and his colleagues to resolve
the ownership question, what have been the obstacles?
The pitfalls of investing in any stockbroker have been well illustrated by
the past few years. A particular obstacle is that Hoare's executives have
been anxious to have control of their business.
One former senior employee sums up: 'What Hoare's have been setting out to
do - and Peter Meinertzhagen in particular - is to find a solution that
gives the senior executives a role in the direction of the firm'.
'He is very much of the partnership mentality,' another former colleague
said. 'The deal they were doing before Bank of America scrapped it was the
one they really wanted, where the management of Hoare's had a large minority
or small majority'.
If that is the case, Hoare's market making could have been part of the
obstacle.
The market making employs an estimated Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m of capital
simply to keep the firm's prices quoted for a wide range of shares on the
stock exchange Topic screens. But any investor might well feel uneasy at
putting that capital in a risky activity without majority control.
Cutting some of the capital risk out of business might then be a solution
either in an outside deal, or a plan for management investment.
Several Hoare watchers suggest that Mr Meinertzhagen wants Hoare Govett to
be a pure corporate broker, Cazenove Mark II - referring to the City's
pre-eminent corporate broker. Cazenove's policy is to make markets in shares
as a service to its corporate clients, and in practice that means mainly the
smaller stocks neglected by other brokers.
'Peter admires Cazenove enormously,' said one former colleague, who added
that it might nonetheless be hubristic for Hoare's to expect to emulate
Cazenove's success. Mr Meinertzhagen's uncle was senior partner of Cazenove
until 1981, and there has been a long-standing goodwill - although no formal
relationship - between the two firms, with many corporate clients shared.
The next few months will show whether Mr Meinertzhagen's plans take the firm
in that direction, and its realistic chances of success.
One former colleague of Mr Meinertzhagen said: 'I think Peter will try hard
to do the deal he thinks is right. He will not try hard to do a deal he
doesn't think is right. The business has been messed up once already. It's
not collapsing, but this time it has to work.'

FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Polly Peck directors face US
legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOURTEEN former directors of Polly Peck, the collapsed fruit, electronics
conglomerate, face possible legal action in the southern district of New
York from Lindner Fund, one of the top US mutual funds.
Lindner's action, which includes the company itself, as well as many of its
directors and Stoy Hayward, its auditors, was launched shortly before
Christmas.
Among those named is the Polly Peck former chairman, Mr Asil Nadir, and Mr
David Fawcus, the former finance director.
Mr Paul Hibbs, senior partner at Stoy Hayward, said: 'As far as we are
concerned, it has no foundation at all.'
The petition filed with the court claims that shareholders' rights suffered
because of misleading information in the company accounts.
Polly Peck, one of the star performers on the London stock exchange in the
early 1980s, went into administration in October 1990 with debts of Pounds
1.15bn. Since then it has emerged that many of its main subsidiaries were
much less profitable than its published accounts suggested.
The case is the the second to be brought against Polly Peck's auditors.
Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross, one of three administrators running
Polly Peck, lodged a writ in the High Court in London on December 18
claiming damages from Stoy Hayward for 'negligence and/or breach of
contractual duty of care' on Polly Peck's accounts for the year ended
December 20 1985.
Touche Ross is considering issuing writs related to the company's accounts
for later years. There is also a separate legal action to recover funds
allegedly belonging to the company from Mr Nadir and his mother.
Mr Nadir also faces 72 theft charges and four of false accounting, involving
Pounds 155m of company funds in a prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud
Office.
Polly Peck's administrators are trying to get the US action adjourned.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Pearson drops idea of MGN purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, confirmed last night
that it was no longer interested in acquiring Mirror Group Newspapers.
Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson and a former Mirror Group
executive, who was enthusiastic about an acquisition at the right price,
said: 'In the light of the information we have, we have decided not to
pursue the acquisition.'
MGN has been in difficulties since the collapse of the business empire of
the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, believes
Pounds 400m is missing from the MGN pension fund, and Pounds 100m from the
company. In addition, the Mirror group, whose main titles are the Daily and
Sunday Mirror, The People, The Sporting Life, and the Scottish Daily Record
and the Sunday Mail, have around Pounds 340m in ordinary debt. If little of
the money is retrieved, the company capitalised at Pounds 500m when the
shares were suspended in November may not be worth much.
Mr Tiny Rowlands's Lonrho group also said late last year it was not
interested in an acquisition.
The main remaining candidate to buy the left-of-centre publisher is a
management buy-out led by Mr Richard Stott, the editor of the Daily Mirror,
a plan backed by Electra, the venture capital group. There is also believed
to be interest in putting together consortiums to bid from Hambros bank and
Mercury Asset Management, the venture capital arm of SG Warburg, the
merchant bank.
Mr Barlow told his executive management committee on Monday he thought the
numbers did not justify acquiring MGN. This was endorsed at a Pearson board
meeting on Friday.

FT  13 JAN 92 / EC seeks better deal at Gatt trade talks in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community will seek 'substantial improvements and essential
modifications' in the draft conclusions to the Uruguay Round of
international trade talks at a key meeting in Geneva today, after EC
ministers rejected plans to limit food subsidies.
Following a seven-hour meeting at the weekend, EC trade and farm ministers
agreed that the draft put forward by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), was a 'reference document
for the final phase of negotiations', now due to conclude by Easter.
Rather than single out the 18-month-old farm subsidy impasse, the ministers
reiterated the 'general considerations' they agreed on December 23. But they
said that 'insofar as the 'Dunkel paper' calls into question the foundation
of the Community's agricultural policy, the paper is not acceptable and
therefore has to be modified'.
At the meeting Germany and Britain sought to gain more enthusiastic support
for the trade liberalisation proposals. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the German
economics minister, had said on Friday that the Dunkel paper 'has to be the
basis for an agreement'. Britain had wanted 'a crisp and clear decision
instructing the Commission to proceed on the basis that Dunkel is a good
starting point', according to a senior UK diplomat.
Yet these two countries, backed by the Dutch and Danes, rejected Gatt plans
to limit the volume of subsidised food exports, as well as the amount by
which they are subsidised.
France, the EC's main agricultural exporter - which had been nearly isolated
within the 12 before the Gatt paper reopened the subsidy classification
dispute - found itself at the head of a majority and sought to press home
its advantage.
A re-classification of the direct payments paid by the EC in compensation to
farmers for big price cuts is still 'among the most important changes' the
Community will seek, according to Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira, trade
minister of Portugal, the current EC president.
The Gatt paper categorises this key point of EC farm reform as a production
support, and therefore not eligible for the so-called 'green box' in which
certain subsidies would be sanctioned as they did not distort trade.
Senior Commission officials, however, said the potential disaster of being
handed individual 'shopping lists' of demands for the Geneva meeting had
been averted, although the final communique underlined the need for
satisfactory agreements on market access and services.
One official said US problems with the draft in areas such as textiles
'means we are no longer the only demandeur' in seeking to renegotiate
aspects of it.
According to one Commission official, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture
commissioner, is likely to restart talks soon on the farm chapter with Mr Ed
Madigan, US agriculture secretary, possibly on Thursday.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Russia and Ukraine settle row over control of Black Sea
fleet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA and Ukraine have patched up their quarrel over control of the Black
Sea fleet of the former Soviet navy, but overall control of the military
remains uncertain, and other republics are preparing to take over military
units on their territories.
The Russian side appears to have come off best in the weekend talks with
Ukrainian representatives in Kiev. The military, supported by Russia, had
argued that the fleet was strategic, and as such belonged under central
command. Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States agreed that
Moscow should have control of strategic forces at a meeting in Minsk in
December 30.
The agreement reached at the weekend gives an unspecified part of the fleet
to Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said after the meeting that ships capable of
carrying nuclear weapons - estimated to be 70 per cent of the Black Sea
fleet's 45 warships and 300 smaller craft - would remain under central
command.
Mr Vladimir Grynov, deputy leader of the Ukrainian parliament, was quoted as
saying: 'The Black Sea fleet is not worth the stability of relations between
Russia and the Ukraine'. The two states together make up more than
two-thirds of the population of the former Soviet Union.
An official communique issued yesterday did not mention the strong
nationalist claims which prompted the dispute and which could still lead to
further hard bargaining.
The statement said a section of the fleet would form part of the armed
forces Ukraine is setting up. Those forces will be separate from the
commonwealth force. Ukraine had previously demanded control of the whole
Black Sea fleet, based at the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol, under a carve-up
of former Soviet armed forces.
The statement said an expert commission would meet within a week, and until
then 'the sides will refrain from any unilateral action on issues which are
being examined'.
The agreement seems likely to satisfy the increasingly bellicose generals
and admirals, but may run into difficulties in Ukraine, where Russian moves
are seen increasingly as the flexing of imperial muscle.
In Belarus, the third and smallest of the Slav republics, the parliament
agreed on Saturday to subordinate all army units to Belarussian control, and
to require from them an oath of allegiance.
Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, parliamentary chairman, said Russia was trying to
force the troops in Belarus to sign an oath of allegiance to Russia.
Russian president Boris Yeltsin last week signed a decree making an oath of
allegiance to Russia obligatory for all serving personnel. Other states have
reacted with alarm to this move.
A weekend report in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta said Mr Yeltsin was about
to decree that Russia would command all former Soviet forces until the
Commonwealth agreed a common line on defence, an event that currently seems
unlikely.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Reform of executive pay awards urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY and benefits for senior British executives in quoted companies should be
decided by panels of non-executive directors, according to a report
published today.
The recommendation by Pro Ned, an organisation which promotes the role of
non-executive directors, follows sharp criticism over pay awards for top
executives, particularly in privatised industries, over the past year.
Remuneration is one of the issues being examined by the Cadbury committee on
corporate governance set up by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Today's recommendation from Pro Ned gives a strong indication of what is
likely to be one of the committee's conclusions. The committee, which is due
to report in the next few weeks, is chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, a former
chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, who is also chairman of Pro Ned.
Pro Ned's guidelines being circulated to companies today include the
following recommendations:
All quoted companies should have a remuneration committee made up of
independent non-executive directors.
Members of the committee should be named in the company's report and
accounts.
The committee's policy on the separation of salary and bonus elements of
executives' pay should be set out in the report and accounts.
There should be an explanation of how performance pay and bonuses are
arrived at.
Remuneration committees are already common among UK companies.
A survey by Pro Ned of the top 100 quoted companies found 86 per cent have a
committee. Of those, 56 per cent were made up of non-executive directors,
while a third published committee details in the annual report.
An analysis in the summer by the Financial Times found a large disparity
between the pay increases of senior industrialists and the performance of
their companies.
Pay rose in the years between 1981 and 1990 by an average of 350 per cent,
compared with average increases in companies' earnings per share of 166 per
cent.
Moreover, the pay of top executives rose at more than three times the rate
of increase in UK average earnings.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Leading Article: A step back in Algeria
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chadli Bendjedid, who resigned with evident reluctance as Algeria's
president on Saturday night, has discovered, as Mr Mikhail Gorbachev did
before him, that initiators of democratic reform rarely enjoy its fruits.
Following his departure - apparently under pressure from army officers
anxious to forestall an election victory by Islamic fundamentalists - the
process of political liberalisation that the president set in motion more
than three years ago seems to be shuddering to a halt.
The second round of voting in the country's first free parliamentary
elections - which had been due to take place on Thursday - was duly
cancelled last night. Now, the country seems set to be ruled by an unelected
body of ministers from Mr Chadli's last government behind which lurks the
army. The result, unless this body plays its cards with great shrewdness and
sensitivity, could be a worsening showdown between the military and Islamic
militants with serious repercussions throughout north Africa and the Arab
world - and with worrying side-effects in Europe.
There has been something tragically predictable about the unfolding of
Algeria's gravest crisis since it settled down after independence from
France in 1962: after decades of exercising a stultifying, often incompetent
and sometimes corrupt monopoly on power, the ruling elite faces a growing
challenge on the streets, agrees to hold elections, alternately confronts
and seeks to co-opt the opposition, finds itself in imminent danger of being
swept from power by forces of which it violently disapproves, and seeks to
abort the embryonic democracy with a 'constitutional' coup.
Prominent casualty
President Chadli is the most prominent casualty of this process. He deserves
credit for his sincere efforts to open up Algeria's political system to the
widest range of participants, including the Front Islamique du Salut (FIS),
the Islamic movement that won a startling majority in the first round of
voting on December 26. If the experiment with democracy has now been halted
it is not down to him but to others in the military establishment who could
not contemplate the prospect of a government involving the FIS and setting
out to create some form of Islamic state.
Civil strife
Here is the rub. The prospect of such a change of government fills many
educated, middle-class Algerians with horror and countries with close links
to Algeria, such as France and Italy, with dismay. The former fear civil
strife between advocates and opponents of adopting Islamic law; the latter,
an increasing tide of disenchanted emigrants reaching the shores of Europe.
Such worries cannot be lightly dismissed. The FIS has not displayed much
enthusiasm for democracy except as a route to gain power; its leaders often
suggest that if they do so, they will move swiftly to make the process
irreversible. In a country where democratic institutions are young and
fragile, a party that espouses democracy only with a view to overturning it
is bound to cause political strains.
But to acknowledge the difficulties is not to condone a suspension of the
electoral process. Algeria is unlikely to turn into another Iran. For better
or worse - and even allowing for the irregularities at the polls that the
government has complained of - the FIS seems to have been chosen by a large
plurality of Algerians on December 26. If it puts up a candidate for
presidential elections - if they are held as they should be within 45 days -
it would almost certainly sweep the board there too. To seek to contain or
suppress such a party by force - or by legalistic sanctions such as Tunisia
has imposed on its fundamentalists - would be foolish, and probably
counter-productive.
Algeria has gone too far down the road to democracy now to return to
one-party rule - either of a military or an unconstitutional Islamic kind.
The job of those outside powers which might be able to influence events is
to discourage the country's new rulers from thinking that the west's
preference for secular governments will mean that it turns a blind eye to
abuses of power.

Crown Court, including the first official research into juries, Robert Rice
writes.
The study starts today with a one-week pilot scheme at three courts:
Snaresbrook, east London; Kingston, Surrey; and Reading, Berkshire.
It will involve detailed questioning of all the main participants, including
the judge, the accused and the jury on a range of issues.
The full study will cover 90 Crown Court centres in England and Wales over
two weeks next month.
The issues to be researched include how often the prosecution case relies on
confessions or admissions made to the police that have not been
tape-recorded and how often the right of silence is exercised.

FT  13 JAN 92 / DAF considers sale or joint venture for truck axle plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBION, THE truck axle plant near Glasgow, may be sold or hived off into a
joint venture. Those are among options being considered by its owner, DAF,
the Dutch truck manufacturer that five years ago absorbed Leyland, the
former UK state-owned truck builder.
The plant, whose workforce has been cut by 220 to 530 over the past two
years, produces axles for trucks being built at Leyland and vans at the
former Freight Rover plant in Birmingham, and machines components for DAF's
axles plant in Belgium.
In the past few days Leyland DAF executives have indicated that Albion's
prospects of continuing its present role may be fading as full
rationalisation of the former DAF and Leyland truck ranges draws closer and
the group prepares for a new vans range under a joint venture with Renault
in the mid 1990s.
The biggest threat to the plant is the launch within the next two years of a
range of medium-weight trucks, the components for which have been an Albion
mainstay.
DAF, which has been plunged into heavy losses, mainly by the collapse of the
UK truck market, is restructuring its manufacturing operations this year and
next, moving work as close as possible to core activities. Truck development
is being centred on the Continent, where there is already extensive axle
production.
The workforce has been told that there is no immediate threat because the
present range of vehicles will require supplies for some time, but employees
know that there is uncertainty. The company said several months ago that it
had considered closing the plant but that it would be kept open if costs
could be further reduced.
DAF, which is 16 per cent owned by British Aerospace, has reduced its UK
workforce from 7,095 at the end of 1989 to fewer than 6,000.
At the end of November, DAF said it would cut another 1,600 jobs worldwide
over the following two years. The UK is expected to bear the brunt with
1,200 losses, while 400 are to go in the Netherlands.
So far Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary, has yet to indicate where the cuts
will fall, but Albion is inevitably among the candidates.
Most employees are based at the main truck production centres of Leyland and
Chorley, Lancashire, and the Birmingham vans plant, with 300 marketing staff
at Thame, Oxfordshire.
Leyland DAF considers that Albion is what one executive described as
'fundamentally a facility for the machining of complex parts'. That did not
necessarily mean having to stay in the trucks business, he pointed out.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Nissan buyers meet their maker: The new dealerships set up
by the car producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT SEVEN o'clock on New Year's Eve, Reg Vardy, the publicly owned north-east
England car dealer group, had no building from which to start selling
Nissans. At 7.20pm, after a final inspection, Vardy directors accepted
bright new showrooms just three miles from the Nissan manufacturing plant in
Sunderland.
By 9.45am on New Year's Day the first of two transporters from the plant
arrived. At 10.30am, after a flurry of polishing, cars had been dewaxed and
pushed into the showroom. A few seconds later the first dealer in the new
network set up by the Japanese carmaker was in business - and a 21-year era
ended for Nissan in the UK.
Nissan Motor (GB), the manufacturer's new distribution organisation, has
already delivered 3,000 cars to the 150 dealers - many of them part of large
public groups - that make up the new network.
The new-cars pipeline that from 1970 ran between Nissan and Mr Octav
Botnar's Nissan UK import and distribution organisation and his AFG dealer
network is dry, fractured by the row between Nissan and Mr Botnar last year.
But as Nissan Motor (GB) showrooms opened in increasing numbers this week,
the question uppermost in executives' minds was whether they faced an
immediate, savage price war with Mr Botnar's operation. AFG has 20,000
Nissan cars in stock, which matches the size of the Nissan Motor (GB)
network.
With a cautious sigh of relief, the new dealers have concluded that
predictions of Mr Botnar's flooding the market with cut-price cars in
revenge for his franchise being terminated are unfounded.
In Sunderland, just 600 yards from another Reg Vardy site, a large AFG
dealership is stacked with cars. 'But there's no evidence of any extra sales
drive,' says Mr David Williams, a Reg Vardy executive. 'People were looking
to AFG to give cars away and the evidence is that they're not.'
In the Greater London area, Ancaster Group, which has switched its four
dealerships to the new Nissan network after 20 years of selling Nissans
supplied by the Worthing-based Botnar companies, also detects no sign of
imminent warfare. Mr Robert Cole, managing director, said: 'There's an AFG
outlet very near us in Croydon and they don't seem to be into any aggressive
selling.'
With hindsight, Nissan Motor (GB) dealers say that, considering that AFG has
a finite and dwindling stock of vehicles while Mr Botnar seeks alternative
franchises for them, it never did make sense for a price war to add to an
already vicious battle for sales in a deeply depressed new-car market.
For potential buyers, the situation is already confusing enough. There are
two separate networks selling mainly identical cars with slightly different
specifications and badges.
The new model designations Nissan has introduced make it difficult to
compare prices exactly, but the differentials are mostly not large and the
price advantage varies between the networks.
If Nissan Motor (GB) dealers had expected a rush of customers once the
'under new management' sign was hung up over the franchise, they have mostly
been disappointed.
According to Mr Williams, 'Most people who have come in simply don't
understand, or even know about, the row. The main worry of those who do, and
have previously bought Nissans, is whether their manufacturers' warranties
will be honoured.'
Nissan is expected to contact 400,000 Nissan owners, advising them that the
Nissan Motor (GB) outlets will process official warranty claims wherever
cars were purchased.
Mr Cole describes the customers who are visiting the new dealerships: 'Their
concern is not with Nissan politics but with price, service - the
conventional things.'
Meanwhile, posters in Bradford proclaim: 'The Sun is Rising on Canal Road.'
The posters urge Nissan drivers to phone a certain number. Doing so connects
them with the Appleyard Group's new Nissan dealership, the first of what Mr
Mike Williamson, the chairman, intends will be five or six Nissan Motor (GB)
dealerships.
Appleyard, one of 21 publicly owned groups taking on the Nissan Motor (GB)
franchise, is investing several million pounds in the outlets but, says Mr
Williamson: 'It's very much for the long term - we know it's going to be a
long, hard slog, certainly for this year.'
Bradford has long been a Nissan stronghold, and still houses three AFG
dealers.
The logic of the location from Appleyard's point of view is that Mr Botnar's
operation will have bequeathed a large population of Nissan motorists - and
thus a large potential market - once the AFG dealers' new Nissan activities
fade over the next few months.
The other Appleyard sites are in strong AFG territories for the same reason,
in what can be regarded only as an ironic tribute to the Worthing
enterprise.
As Mr Williamson concedes: 'Whatever Nissan say about Botnar, he did a
cracking job for them when it came to actually selling cars.'

inject a bit more competition into the ports industry and line the
Exchequer's pockets at the same time.
The plan was to privatise the 15 biggest of the 111 British ports that are
run neither by local authorities nor the private sector, but by
self-governing trusts set up under acts of parliament.
It should have attracted little controversy. Most of the ports were expected
to be quietly snapped up by management-employee buy-out teams rather than
speculative bidders - safeguards were built into the scheme to prevent the
ports from being turned into shopping malls. Yet the privatisation has
turned into an embarrassing political debacle.
Tomorrow the row will come to a head in the Commons when MPs are asked to
approve the first privatisation - the sale of Tees &amp; Hartlepool, Britain's
second-biggest cargo port, to the Teesside Holdings consortium.
Tees &amp; Hartlepool had been a founder member of the pro-privatisation club.
Like several trust ports, it was run by a management keen to take an equity
stake in a business freed from the straitjacket of trust status, which
prevented its expansion into related activities such as distribution and
property development.
There was, however, a catch. Under the privatisation legislation - the Ports
Act 1991 - the management could not simply take the port over. To ensure
best value for money for the taxpayer, the port had to be sold through a
competitive tender refereed by the non-executive members of the trust.
Proceeds would be split 50-50 between the port and the government.
When the trust came to take its decision last month, it had to choose
between four bids. The highest was Pounds 210m from Maritime Transport
Services, owner of the Thamesport container terminal in Kent. Next was
Pounds 180m from Teesside Holdings, a consortium comprising the Powell
Duffryn industrial group, venture capital group 3i, and private interests in
the Humberside area. Third was Pounds 150m from the management-employee
buy-out team, and fourth Ocean Group, the distribution company, which is
believed to have bid about the same.
The fact that the buy-out team was outbid did not eliminate it from the
contest. The trust had agreed with the government that price would be only
one of three main criteria, the others being employee participation and
benefits to the local economy.
The trust provoked furious protests from the buy-out team, other contenders
and local MPs by awarding victory neither to the highest bidder nor to the
buy-out team but to Teesside Holdings. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport
secretary, has said he is 'minded' to approve that decision.
In a 13-page memorandum to the prime minister, Mr Stuart Bell, Labour MP for
Middlesbrough, claims that: Teesside Holdings' bid said that, if it won,
room would be made on the company's board for one of the trust's
non-executives, thus presenting the judges with an unacceptable conflict of
interest.
Two of Teesside's directors had previously been directors of port companies
that were put into liquidation in 1989, tion to meet redundancy payments of
Pounds 6.6m.
The Teesside bid provided for employee ownership of only 5 per cent of the
shares, so failing to meet one of the criteria: the desirability of seeing
the whole, or a substantial part, of the equity taken by managers and
employees.
Teesside was given the opportunity to bring in other investors and increase
its bid twice during the contest.
The buy-out team says that, if it had known employee participation would
count for so little, it could have brought in other equity investors and
pipped the Teesside bid.
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm advising the Department of Transport,
says the buy-out team is being a poor loser. It simply misjudged the value
of the preference the trust and the government would put on a
management-employee buy-out.
That is not the end of the affair. The Tees &amp; Hartlepool buy-out team says
it will seek a judicial review of the trust's decision if Mr Rifkind
confirms it this week. Worse, the managements of several other trust ports -
Clyde, Medway, Tilbury and Forth - have privatisation plans in train, each
raising the possibility of a fresh political row.
To try to limit the potential for embarrassment, the Transport Department
has imposed an information blackout on future competitive tenders so that
bids will remain secret. It is also allowing Forth to avoid the tendering
process by floating itself on the stock market, so undermining its own
value-for-money principle.
Whether those measures will be enough to forestall further rows is
uncertain. MPs seem unlikely to be impressed by them and disappointed
bidders in competitive tenders may still break their vows of silence. Unless
Mr Rifkind has a last-minute change of heart over Tees &amp; Hartlepool, the
controversy over that sale seems destined to haunt him until the general
election.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Software theft cases settled out of court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWSUITS alleging computer software theft brought against Mirror Group
Newspapers and the London Borough of Greenwich by leading US software
suppliers are being settled out of court.
Greenwich council, the first UK local authority to be accused of software
theft, said on Friday it had agreed to destroy copies of illegal software
programs, buy replacements from dealers and compensate the software
suppliers for the illegal copies and their legal costs.
A similar statement is expected today regarding Mirror Group Newspapers,
where investigators from the Business Software Alliance - representing
software suppliers - found that 670 of 800 software programs in use were
illegal copies.
Neither the BSA nor Greenwich would disclose the value of damages to be paid
in compensation. It is expected that MGN will pay a six-figure sum, the
largest yet paid by a UK organisation.
The BSA and other organisations representing personal computer software
suppliers, including the Federation Against Software Theft (Fast), have been
conducting a worldwide campaign against suspected software thieves. They
have secured court orders to search premises and taken companies to court
where forged software has been found.
Greenwich, which was sued by US software companies Lotus Development
Corporation and XTree, said the council's policy was to use legal software.
The council said its Housing Directory had broken policy on unauthorised
copying. 'We have taken prompt steps to rectify this situation.'
Later today Apple Computer, a leading US personal computer manufacturer, is
expected to announce that it has joined the BSA.
Fast provides a software audit program free to companies anxious to ensure
compliance with the law. Fast can be contacted on 0628 660377.

FT  13 JAN 92 / BBC reviews central costs and staffing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC has launched a review of all costs and staffing levels in its
central bureaucracy. It may lead to job losses and the contracting-out of
services.
The review, being conducted with the help of Price Waterhouse, will look at
all services not directly involved in programme making - from finance and
personnel to computer services, audience research and publicity.
Last October the BBC announced the Producer Choice initiative, which allows
programme makers to hire technical services from outside the corporation.
The new review aims to put programme makers' central overheads under similar
scrutiny.
It is being led by Ms Margaret Salmon, the BBC's director of personnel. She
said yesterday that under Producer Choice resource capacity had to be set at
appropriate levels by April next year.
'This principle must apply to all overhead services, not just programme
resource departments,' she said.
The introduction of an internal market for all BBC services is potentially
one of the most fundamental changes in the way the corporation is run.

FT  13 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Personal-distress awards sharply up in
bias cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AWARDS for injury to feelings in discrimination cases have more than doubled
since 1988, according to a study by Industrial Relations Services (IRS), the
independent research organisation.
However, IRS said the increase masked wide variations within the sex and
race jurisdictions, with tribunals much more likely to award aggravated
damages in race cases than in sex cases.
The report showed that few industrial tribunals made exemplary awards that
were punitive rather than compensatory and so aimed to deter employers from
similar action.
Injury-to-feelings awards began to rise in early 1988 after the Court of
Appeals set new parameters for the level of such awards in discrimination
cases. It said awards should not be nominal and may include aggravated
damages, putting Pounds 3,000 at the top end of the range.

FT  13 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): 'Going rate' still applies in pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'GOING RATE' is alive and well in British pay setting, according to Mr
Fred Bayliss, a former senior official in the Department of Employment.
He said in a paper prepared for the lobby group Campaign for Work that in
spite of continuing decentralisation of collective bargaining, control over
pay was now in fewer, not more, hands than 15 years ago.
Mr Bayliss took issue with the group's claim that to achieve a better
trade-off between pay and employment, the bargaining process had to be
synchronised around a couple of months every year.
He said that already more than half of all employees in the private sector
had their pay settlements between January and April and argued that
co-ordination of the level of annual pay rise was the key rather than
synchronisation.
Mr Bayliss concluded, after examining pay determination in retailing, banks,
building societies, the car industry and chemicals, that many of the
preconditions for better co-ordination already existed.
He found that companies had their place in a pay pecking order, that there
was a great deal of informal consultation between companies and a strong
desire not to be knowingly adrift of others on pay.
There continued to be acknowledged pay 'leaders'. Mr Bayliss said in
retailing Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and Tesco were the 'heavyweights'. In
banks, Barclays now settled first but NatWest still carried 'about as much
weight'. Among building societies, Abbey National was the leader and in
chemicals everyone watched ICI. In vehicle manufacture, Ford 'is well
established'.
Mr Bayliss accepted that for co-ordinated pay to be successful, key
companies would have to subordinate 'their separate company and sector
goals'.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Tempered optimism in west Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in the west Midlands, one of the country's main business regions,
report a slight increase in confidence, although the outlook remains
difficult, according to a study published today.
The West Midlands Regional Group of Chambers of Commerce says 48 per cent of
companies in the area think sales will rise over the next year, compared
with a figure of 43 per cent in September 1991.
However, Mr Howard Davis, chairman of the regional group, said that growth
prospects remained poor. He wanted the government to reintroduce 100 per
cent capital allowances to boost manufacturing investment and output. The
allowances, which would enable companies to offset capital spending against
profits, would be a sign that ministers were considering the plight of
industry.
He added that it would also tackle the large fall in manufacturing
investment over the past year 'which must affect the ability of industry to
compete as we pull out of recession'.
In the survey of nearly 700 manufacturing and service companies the
proportion expecting a rise in profits increased to 37 per cent, from 34 per
cent in September.
Just over a quarter of companies in the study, which was conducted in
December, have fuller export order books compared with three months
previously. The comparable figure in September was 21 per cent.
According to the survey 15 per cent of companies in the region are working
at full capacity and 11 per cent at below 60 per cent capacity.
Nearly a fifth of businesses say they are finding cashflow easier than three
months ago, while 29 per cent say it is worse. The comparable figures for
September were 16 per cent and 32 per cent.
Consumer confidence is low and will recover only slowly this year, according
to Infolink, which monitors demand for credit. In November 1991, demand for
credit to buy retail goods was up just 9.2 per cent compared with the same
month in 1990, which Infolink says is extremely low for the pre-Christmas
period.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Chambers urge Budget for investment and small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMBERS OF Commerce today called for a Budget that will encourage increased
investment and also take into account the difficulties facing smaller
companies.
The Association of British Chambers, which represents 100 of the largest
chambers, highlighted three areas of taxation where changes would benefit
industry in general and small businesses in particular.
It called for removal of the 25 per cent limit on profits that can be set
against advance corporation tax.
The association also recommended that the government should reform
inheritance tax with the ultimate aim of abolishing it. It said the tax was
important not only for individuals but also for the commercial sector 'where
many proprietors of small businesses are looking to release, or pass on,
their assets in a manner which does not require the break-up of their
company'.
The association's third area of concern is the costs to business of
complying with tax legislation and of administering different taxes. It
called for different forms of taxation to be integrated.
The chambers' Budget submission emphasised the importance of exports. It
urged the chancellor to take a 'long-term view of the UK's place in the
European Community and the world economy' and stressed the need for a
satisfactory conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, even at the cost of big changes in UK and EC economic
policies.
In detailed recommendations for changes in excise duties, the chambers said
duty on Scotch whisky should be charged at the time of sale rather than
manufacture. They also advocated that lead-free aviation fuel should be
given favourable treatment in terms of excise duty similar to that of
lead-free petrol.
Mr Miles Middleton, the association's president, said: 'We are looking for a
long-term strategy for stability. We want a framework which does not overly
distort commercial activity and takes into account the day-to-day problems
which bear particularly heavily on smaller firms which make up such an
important part of the UK economy.'
Paul Cheeseright writes: The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) yesterday
urged the government to bring forward its renovation programme for school
buildings in order to stimulate the depressed construction industry.
The proposal was made in a submission to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
The submission reflects the more general concern among business
organisations that the government should act to revive the domestic economy.
Mr Tony Miller, the FSB's financial affairs chairman, said school renovation
would 'give a kick-start to the building industry', which would affect the
wider economy.
'Business failures are at an all-time high, with all that implies -
destroyed hopes, lost jobs and shattered family life,' Mr Miller wrote. To
stem the failures, the government should help small businesses and the
construction industry, he argued.
The FSB is also advocating the establishment of a state-ubsidised fund to
provide medium and long-term finance at stable interest rates to small
businesses. Mr Miller said that the government could either make funds
available for the commercial banks to lend on to companies or provide funds
so that banks would be able to lend at lower than the prevailing rates of
interest.

MR Roger Freeman, the transport minister, apologised yesterday for his
comments suggesting that 'cheap and cheerful' trains could be provided for
typists while civil servants and businessmen travelled in style.
Mr Freeman said: 'I regret the phrases I used - they were clearly capable of
misinterpretation.' He stood by the principle of price competition on the
railways after privatisation, similar to airlines' pricing systems, but
added that he had not wanted to imply there was to be a two-tier,

MINISTERS yesterday insisted that a white paper paving the way for the
privatisation of British Rail would appear before the general election in
spite of a Cabinet split over the form it should take, Richard Tomkins
writes.
Weekend reports speculated that the difficulties of resolving ministerial
differences might cause an indefinite postponement of the white paper in
favour of a manifesto pledge.
Even so, the Department of Transport was yesterday sticking to its promise
that a white paper would appear by the end of January or, at the latest, in
early February.
Ministers are united in their belief that British Rail should not enter the
private sector in its present form as a large, unwieldy monopoly but are at
odds over how it should be broken up.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, believes it should be split
along the lines of its existing business sectors while Mr John Major, the
prime minister, is said to favour a regional division. Other ministers
believe the ownership of the tracks and trains should be separated.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Ashdown hardens coalition terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday toughened the
conditions for his support in a hung parliament to include agreement on a
four-year government programme and no income tax cuts.
Mr Ashdown said opinion polls showed a balanced parliament after the general
election was 'likely'. Liberal Democrats would seek a 'powerful role' in
creating a stable government that implemented as many of his party's
policies as possible, most crucially on electoral reform.
He stood by the pledge to raise income tax if necessary to fund education
reform and to increase taxes on scarce resources, including petrol.
Asked if he could support a Tory government committed to cutting income tax
to 20 per cent, he said: 'I wouldn't be prepared to do anything that would
be bankrupting for the country or further debilitate our public services.'
Senior Liberal Democrat MPs and officials decided at a final election
strategy meeting that the party would try to ensure that constitutional
reform was not pushed off the political agenda by Labour or the Tories.
They would resist making personal attacks on Mr John Major or Mr Neil
Kinnock, Labour leader - even if that meant the party was denied media
attention during the election campaign.
Liberal Democrat strategists argue that opinion polls are understating
support for the party. Private polling, they say, shows that as many as 49
per cent of voters would support them if they thought the party had a chance
of winning power.
Mr Ashdown appealed to such voters, considered to be latent supporters, in
his interview on BBC Radio yesterday. He said that the more people voted for
the Liberal Democrats, the more their policies would be implemented.
He disliked Labour and the Tories equally, he said, but in the event of a
hung parliament the possible coalition partner for the Liberal Democrats
would probably have been determined by the election result.
'What our aim is, is stable government and successful government for Britain
over four years,' Mr Ashdown said.
'That means a government whose cornerstone is an effective majority in the
House of Commons. It means a government whose reform programme includes
proportional representation . . . and it means a successful programme for
the government to start to implement.'
He said proportional representation was the 'essential prerequisite' for
stable government. Liberal Democrats would insist on the necessary
legislation being implemented within the lifetime of a parliament.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Poor hopes for sales of companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET for selling unquoted businesses was depressed last year and there
is little prospect of an upturn this year, according to Ernst &amp; Young, the
accountants.
Prices were lower in 1991 than in previous years and were also low relative
to the sums paid for similar quoted companies. Many of the sales that were
made resulted from companies' going into receivership or administration or
were distress sales intended to raise desperately needed cash.
In the UK, companies were already over-borrowed and would need to devote
their resources to rebuilding finances rather than making acquisitions.
Companies in continental Europe that paid what seemed generous prices for UK
companies over the past two years were less keen to make foreign
acquisitions now that their own economies were moving into recession.
Nevertheless, for buyers who were confident of the future, this year should
be good for making purchases, Ernst &amp; Young said. The economic cycle was at
or near its trough, while vendors should be more realistic in their price
expectations.

FT  13 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Women expected to dominate super-union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN ARE likely to control Britain's largest trade union for the first time
next year if the triple merger between the Nalgo and Nupe public-sector
unions and Cohse, the health-service union, goes ahead as planned.
At least 44 out of the 67 places on the executive committee of the new
super-union, which has yet to be named, are likely to go to women. That
proportion of places reserved for women on the ruling body will reflect the
new union's heavily female membership.
At present Britain's largest union is the TGWU general union, with 1.2m
members. Although the TGWU has about 230,000 women members only three out of
a total of 39 executive members are female.
The merged public and health service union will have more than 1.4m members.
Of those, over 1m will be women - more than a third of all women trade
unionists in Britain, according to the unions involved.
If a ballot of the three unions' memberships shows approval, the new union
will begin in July 1993. After several months of disagreement, which nearly
scuppered the merger, compromises have been reached on a range of issues
concerning finance and structure. Detailed agreement is outstanding on some
important points, including the role of full-time officials and Labour party
affiliation.
While the new union's executive will be female-dominated, the very top posts
are likely to be held by men. The three existing general secretaries are
male: Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe (Nupe); Mr Hector MacKenzie (Cohse); and Mr
Alan Jinkinson (Nalgo). The unions say they have yet to discuss the position
of principal officers.
The recent trend in the amalgamation of unions has not improved the position
of women in top posts. Two years ago there were four female trade union
general secretaries: Ms Brenda Dean, of Sogat, the printworkers' union; Ms
Helen McGrath, of the National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers; Ms
Elizabeth Symons, of the Association of First Division Civil Servants; and
Ms Diana Warwick of the Association of University Teachers. Ms Dean and Ms
McGrath have since lost their jobs as a result of mergers with other unions.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Israel agrees diplomatic links with China
</HEADLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID LEVY, the Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday Israel and China
had agreed to establish diplomatic relations for the first time, a step
likely to be formally concluded later this month when he visits Beijing.
Final consummation of the relationship, long sought by Israel, would
complete the Jewish state's formal ties to all five members of the United
Nations Security Council following the re-establishment of full relations
with the then Soviet Union last year.
It would clear away any Israeli objections to Chinese participation in the
multilateral phase of the Middle East peace talks due to open in Moscow on
January 28, just as the resumption of ties with the Kremlin opened the way
for the Soviet Union - its place now assumed by Russia - to co-sponsor the
peace negotiations with the US.
The third round of so-far fruitless bilateral talks between Israel and the
Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians and Palestinians are set to get under way in
Washington today. There are hopes that a proceand the joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation will be overcome, but Israel says its
negotiators will not stay in the US beyond Thursday, narrowing the room for
substantive progress until a fourth round at a location yet to be
determined.
Israel has been pressing China to make the move to a formal diplomatic
relationship for years, to draw Beijing away from its close public support
for Arab nations.
Ironically, however, the two sides have well-established informal trading
links with an emphasis on military products, which has upset Washington
since US military sales to China were banned after the violent suppression
of the pro-democracy movement in 1989.
Israel opened a scientific liaison office in Beijing in 1990, but had become
an important source of technological support in areas from arms to
agriculture well before then. Reports have emerged of extensive defence
industry co-operation, including Israeli contracts for equipping Chinese
tanks, jet fighters and possibly advanced missiles.

Pressure on India to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) is
expected to ease because of a statement by a key US senator that he does not
think the country has a nuclear weapons programme, writes KK Sharma in New
Delhi.
Senator Larry Pressler, who is the author of the amendment barring US aid to
Pakistan because of evidence of a nuclear weapons programme, said in New
Delhi at the weekend that he did not think the amendment should be extended
to India.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Establishment's anxieties spell the end for Chadli: A
willingness to live without democracy rather than under Islamic
fundamentalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Chadli Bendjedid left the Algerian political scene as discreetly
as he entered it 13 years ago. He had never aspired to the post of
president, as he reminded his countrymen in a rambling letter of resignation
at the weekend.
Mr Chadli was chosen after the death of Colonel Houari Boumedienne as a
compromise candidate between the pro-Libyan Colonel Salah Yiahiaoui and Mr
Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the then foreign minister.
Born of peasant stock in the eastern village of Boutelja, Mr Bendjedid
started his working life as a docker. He soon joined the fight to free
Algeria from French rule, which lasted 132 years. His family came to enjoy
power but those who knew him well suspect that he remained, at heart, the
bluff commander of the western military region of Oran, which he ran for 15
years after 1964.
Algeria's third head of state was, in effect, pressured into resigning by
the country's establishment. The army had no desire to see its considerable
influence questioned by the Islamic fundamentalists whose party, the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), threatened to come to power in the country's first
free post-independence elections. Senior officers feared that the
fundamentalists would cut the military budget and set up some form of
Islamic militia as a rival to the army.
Pressure also came from the largest trade union and professional and civil
organisations. Many of these people, notably women, made public their
readiness to sacrifice the recent democratic experiments rather than live
under the rule of the FIS.
Mr Abdelkader Hachani, the FIS leader, said at last Friday's prayers that
'the struggle between divine justice and the injustice of anti-Islamic
barbarism is our destiny. Cohabitation between truth and injustice is
impossible.'
The FIS picked up 188 seats in the first round of the general elections last
December and, until their cancellation yesterday, was headed for victory in
the run-off on Thursday
Although FIS leaders reined in their many supporters after the first round,
they continued to preach fire and brimstone, describing the influential
Berber-speaking minority as 'unbelievers' and the 300,000 Algerians who
marched in support of democracy through the capital 10 days ago as 'Jews'.
Algeria's new constitution, endorsed by popular vote in December 1988, bans
parties which carry a religious denomination. After the FIS won control of a
majority of town councils in the June 1990 local elections, it showed little
respect for the rule of law and the needs of ordinary Algerians, much as the
ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party had done before its power was
broken in the streets in the 1988 riots.
Mr Chadli's resignation has brought to the fore Mr Abdelmalek Benhabyles, a
member of the landed gentry and a diplomat.
Nicknamed Socrates, as president of the Constitutional Council he must call
a new presidential election within 45 days. However, candidates must be
endorsed by at least 600 local councillors, which, in effect, rules out any
but an FIS or FLN candidate. The rules would thus seem to be ripe for
change, so the 45-day delay will probably last much longer.
Yesterday, before the elections were cancelled, the FIS warned the
government of the consequences of such a move. Party leaders warned last
week that any tampering with the FIS victory might provoke violent
resistance, but they are themselves likely to meet fierce resistance if they
come out on the streets.
The party is divided. Two of its paramount leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Mr
Ali Benhadj, remain in prison, where they have been since last June's riots.
Two days ago a founding member of the party, Mr Ahmed Merani, accused Mr
Hachani, its current leader, of being 'mad' and 'killing all hope in
Algeria'.
He was happy to see Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali remain prime minister because 'his
government is the best we have had since independence'.
After the president resigned, the prime minister called upon all Algerians
to remain serene and united. The next few days will tell whether his call
has been heeded.

FT  13 JAN 92 / How wage inequality affects working women's pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CROSS-COUNTRY variation in the average wages of women, relative to those
of men, has grown over the past two decades. By the late 1980s, the average
hourly wages of women ranged from 80-90 per cent of men's in Scandinavia and
Australia, to 70-80 per cent in continental Europe and 65-70 per cent in the
US and UK. This variation is often thought to prove that there remain
national differences in the obstacles that women face in the labour force,
compared to those facing men. But this simple comparison is misleading.
There is little cross-country variation in the gender wage gap for single
women with no dependents. The bulk of each country's overall gender gap, as
well as the variation across countries, is explained by the lower wages of
married women with children, relative to married men's (as the left-hand
chart shows). It is not surprising that the gender-gaps are larger for
married women with children than for single women. Most married women take
time off work to bring up children. As a result, the average married woman
has less work experience than the average married man. Moreover, the fact
that married women may take time off work in the future may make it less
attractive either for them or their employers to invest in training.
Prohibitively expensive child-care may also force women to return to
part-time and so lower-paid employment.
What is surprising is that American married women appear to fare so poorly
compared to women in other countries. The US has a commitment to equal pay
and equal employment opportunity legislation that predates other countries
by at least a decade. A relatively high percentage of the female US
population is in employment: 66 per cent compared to 60 per cent in
Australia and 59 per cent in Britain. US women are less likely to be
employed in typically 'female' occupations or industries. Moreover, a lower
percentage of employed women in the US work part-time: 24 per cent compared
to 37 per cent in Australia, 45 per cent in Britain and 46 per cent in
Sweden.
According to a recent study by Ms Francine Blau and Mr Lawrence Kahn at the
University of Illinois, the main reason for the relatively large US gender
gap is the high level of US wage inequality.
The authors identify two separate causes of the variation in the size of the
gender gap across countries: a gender effect, and a wage inequality effect.
The gender effect measures how differences in skills and experience, and
other obstacles to female employment, reduce the relative position of
average married women's earnings within the male wage distribution. The wage
inequality effect measures the extent to which the dispersion of the male
earnings distribution reduces average married women's earnings relative to
average male earnings.
For each country, the position of the average married woman's hourly
earnings in the male wage distribution - the percentage of men that earn
more than the average married woman - is shown on the right-hand chart. The
position of the average married woman in the US male wage distribution is
the same as in Sweden and higher than in every other country in the sample.
In the US and Sweden, 83 per cent of married men earn more than the average
married woman, compared with 88 per cent in the UK and 93 per cent in
Germany.
It is the wage inequality effect, therefore, not the gender effect, that
explains why US married women earn less, as a proportion of average male
earnings, than Swedish women. The average married woman in both countries
earns more than the bottom 17 per cent of men. But the bottom 17 per cent of
US men earn a smaller proportion of the average male wage than the bottom 17
per cent of Swedish men. If Sweden, Britain and Germany all had
American-style wage inequality, the difference in the gender gaps between
the US and Sweden would disappear. But married women in the UK and Germany
would still fare relatively badly. So reducing the degree of wage inequality
is one important way to raise women's wages relative to those of men.

INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data
for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly
and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the
percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and
are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a
percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading
indicator are end-period values.

PRESIDENT Zhelyu Zhelev had a clear lead but was well short of a first-round
victory in Bulgaria's first presidential elections yesterday, preliminary
estimates showed, Reuter reports from Sofia.
Mr Zhelev, former leader of the governing Union of Democratic Forces, was
set to take about 44 per cent of the vote, according to projections based on
partial results.
That would put him well ahead of his nearest rival, Mr Velko Valkanov, but
short of the 50 per cent needed to avoid a second round of voting next
Sunday.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Labour acts to counter Tory tax campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour leadership yesterday unveiled a strategy to claim the moral high
ground in the forthcoming general election campaign as a counter to the
Conservative onslaught on its plans for higher taxes.
Mr Neil Kinnock led a succession of speakers at a party rally in York
warning that voters would not be 'bribed' by a cut in the basic rate of
income tax in the Budget.
He was speaking on a platform emblazoned with the union flag and bearing the
slogan Made in Britain. Mr Kinnock argued that the electorate would make a
clear choice in favour of more resources for the health service, for
pensions, for education, and for child benefit.
'The British people do not want a Tory 'save our skins' Budget. They want a
'save our country' Budget,' he said. He insisted that voters would put
fairness and community ahead of tax cuts. Conservative ministers continued
to warn that Labour's tax and spending plans would mean large increases in
the bills of the vast majority of taxpayers.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour wanted higher
taxes 'for no better reason than socialist spite'. Senior Tories believe
they drove Labour on to the defensive last week and hope for similar success
in this week's planned offensive on Labour's defence policy.
Mr John Major, meanwhile, will resume his meetings with cabinet ministers on
the Tory manifesto. Ministers are deliberately controlling the release of
detailed information on its contents for maximum impact.
Shadow cabinet ministers emphasised yesterday that only the wealthy would be
hit by the party's plans. They claimed that Labour's proposals for increased
public spending would mark the start of a moral crusade.
Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, said higher taxes on the rich to pay
for increased pensions and child benefit would be a major milestone on the
road to a more equal society. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry
secretary, said the party would respond to Conservative selfishness by
proclaiming the enduring socialist values of justice and co-operation.
Despite a five-point lead for Labour over the Conservatives in the latest
opinion poll, speakers at the rally acknowledged implicitly Labour's concern
to sharpen its positive appeal to voters.
Mr Hattersley referred to the need for conviction rather than caution in the
election campaign. Mr Brown said that the rally marked the start of a moral
crusade to turn sympathisers into supporters and the half-hearted into the
wholly committed.
Private Labour unease about the threat posed by a Conservative focus on its
tax plans was marked by an admission by shadow cabinet members. They do not
plan to reverse Budget tax cuts which focus on raising thresholds rather
than on the basic rate.
The rally marked the start of what Labour promises will be the most
intensive campaign ever launched in the run-up to a general election.
Attended by more than 1,000 supporters and characterised by the glitz which
has become the party's campaign trademark it will be repeated throughout the
country in the next few months.
Confidence among UK companies about the business outlook has fallen in the
past three months, according to a Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey published today.
It found that six out of 10 companies saw no immediate improvement in the
outlook for sales or new orders. Page 6

FT  13 JAN 92 / Port privatisation bidders face gag by government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INFORMATION black-out has been imposed on the privatisation of Britain's
remaining trust ports to prevent a repetition of the political embarrassment
caused by the sale of Tees &amp; Hartlepool, the country's second biggest cargo
port.
The Department of Transport has told other trust ports preparing for
privatisation that no information about bids is to be released at any stage
of the privatisation process apart from the identity of the successful
bidder.
Companies involved in the bidding will be required to accept confidentiality
clauses preventing all but the winning bidder from revealing their interest
in any of the ports even after the sale.
This means there will be no information available to the public or the
bidders on how many bids were received, the value of the bids, the identity
of the bidders, or the value of the winning bid.
The department acknowledged, however, that it could prove difficult to
enforce the gag on unsuccessful bidders.
The change in policy follows the bitter row over the privatisation of Tees &amp;
Hartlepool, the first trust port to be sold under the Ports Act.
Three named companies and a management buy-out team submitted competing bids
for the port, with the buy-out team quietly confident of victory. But the
port authority chose neither the buy-out team nor the highest bidder, but a
newly-formed consortium with no experience in port ownership.
The decision, supported by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, has
caused a furore in the ports industry and is likely to lead to a rough ride
for transport ministers when it comes up for ratification in the Commons
tomorrow
Other trust ports seeking privatisation are Forth, Clyde, Medway and
Tilbury. Forth announced on Friday that it had won the transport
department's agreement to opt for a stock market flotation, so avoiding the
competitive tendering process.
The department acknowledged that procedures had changed since the Tees &amp;
Hartlepool flotation, saying it had learned from experience.
The department's advisers, accountants Price Waterhouse, said the tension
created by secrecy was likely to produce a better price than a more public
auction.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Algerian poll cancelled after Chadli quits office: Armoured
vehicles in capital - Islamic party denied victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S transition to democracy received a severe setback last night when
the country's leaders cancelled general elections which looked certain to
hand power to Moslem fundamentalists.
As tanks guarded government buildings in the capital, Algiers, the High
Security Council said the elections could not be continued 'until necessary
conditions were achieved for the normal functioning of institutions'.
Effective power following the resignation on Saturday of President Chadli
Bendjedid now rests with the High Security Council. This includes prime
minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali, senior military commanders and the interim
president, Mr Abdelmalek Benhabyles, who is also chairman of the
Constitutional Council, the top legal body.
The High Security Council said it had taken charge provisionally of public
order and security. Its intervention prompted a strong reaction from Hocine
Ait-Ahmed, leader of the Front des Forces Socialistes, the main lay
opposition, who said on French radio that the country was witnessing a coup
'if not in form, then certainly in fact'.
A second round of the elections, Algeria's first multi-party contest, was
due to take place on Thursday. In the first round on December 26, the
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which aims to turn Algeria into North
Africa's first Islamic state, took a landslide lead with 188 seats in the
430-seat National Assembly.
Mr Chadli's resignation after some 13 years in power came after pressure
from military officers and many other groups representing professional
bodies, trade unions and women.
The FIS called the resignation a 'piece of theatre aimed at suppressing the
people and cancelling the results'. FIS militants gathered outside the
party's headquarters in Algiers, awaiting directions from their leaders. The
capital and other main cities were subdued, however.
Tanks were stationed in front of the prime minister's office, the Ministry
of the Interior and the state television building. But the presence of the
army remained very discreet, with troops confined essentially to the
barracks on the city's outskirts.
Before the High Security Council's intervention last night, the National
Liberation Front, which held a monopoly on power in Algeria until 1988 and
was thrashed in December's polls, reiterated its commitment to the
elections.
The Defence Ministry said that the army 'reaffirms its loyalty to the
constitution and its confidence in the existing constitutional
institutions'. Under the constitution, Mr Benhabyles has 45 days as interim
head of state to organise a presidential election.
France, the former colonial power, has plans to accommodate refugees who
would flee an Islamic state in Algeria if one came into being, according to
Mr Philippe Marchand, the Paris interior minister.
Meanwhile, Britain was among countries which advised their nationals to
avoid travelling to Algeria because of the crisis.
The Foreign Office advised the 200 Britons living in the country to stay in
touch with the embassy and 'to take sensible precautions . . . and avoid
potential troublespots'.

GERMANY is to make steep cuts in arms spending and is urgently reviewing
alternatives to the costly European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) joint venture.
At the same time, the country will build up a rapid reaction force for
international emergencies, Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, defence minister, said at
the weekend.
The cuts, expected to reduce planned spending by almost DM44bn (Pounds
15.55bn) over the next 13 years, represented the biggest economies in the
history of the German armed forces, the minister said. This year's defence
budget is DM52bn.
The overhaul of budgets and strategy, forced by shortages of federal funds
and encouraged by the ending of the cold war, spells the end of the Leopard
III battle tank and the Panther 'tank-killer' projects, delays in
construction of the U-212 submarine and reduced deployment of other land,
sea and air weapons systems.
A decision on whether Germany will buy 250 EFA aircraft, known in Germany as
the Jager 90, will be based on a report, due in the summer, on possible
substitutes. These are believed to include France's Rafale and the
Soviet-built MiG-29.
Whatever was decided, Mr Stoltenberg said, the air force needed a new
fighter by 2000, and the DM12bn earmarked for the EFA was still in the
medium-term military budget.
The planned rapid reaction force would be ready by 1995, and would comprise
seven army brigades, reinforced by several air force squadrons and vessels
and men from the navy.
The German constitution at present limits deployment of forces to Nato
territory, although an amendment is expected soon to allow them to take part
in international actions under the aegis of the United Nations.
Mr Stoltenberg said the end of the cold war had reduced the likelihood of an
attack from the east on Germany, formerly the west's front-line state. But
there were new tensions, such as the war in Yugoslavia, which could endanger
national security.
The minister's announcement drew fire from the military, which said morale
in the 21 army brigades not involved in the rapid reaction force would be
undermined by the lack of modern equipment and what was, in effect, an order
to 'stand down'.
Morale has already been hit by cuts which were announced after unification
15 months ago.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Economics and all that jazz: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US may have an ailing economy, but its economics profession is the envy
of the world. At the new year, the cafes of the French quarter of New
Orleans buzzed with the speculation of 7,000 social scientists, in town for
the annual meeting of the American Economics Association.
Where is the profession going? With more than 500 sessions - many concurrent
 -and 1,500 individual presentations, personal views must be subjective. But
I left with two positive impressions: first, that leading academic
economists are becoming more worldly and less obsessed by abstruse
mathematics; second, that the profession is growing less patient with the
comforting simplicities of free-market economics.
A decade ago, economic 'stars' such as Mr Robert Lucas of Chicago University
preached an abstract souped-up version of monetarism known as 'rational
expectations'. Building on the work of Milton Friedman and others, they
argued that government intervention was ineffectual even in the very short
run. Although such theories created the climate for egregious policy errors
 -such as the neglect of the dollar in the early 1980s - the theorists
rarely strayed from their ivory towers.
Today much has changed. The leading young theorists are heavily involved in
policy. Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist, spoke with authority on
privatisation at the conference, largely because of his practical experience
as an adviser to the Russian and Polish governments. Another Harvard star,
Mr Lawrence Summers, has left academia temporarily to serve as chief
economist at the World Bank. In New Orleans, he seemed to pop up everywhere,
cutting through theoretical arguments with simple, colourful examples drawn
from real life.
Mr Paul Krugman of MIT - honoured at the conference with the Clark Medal for
outstanding achievement under the age of 40 - is in the same mould. While
best known for his pioneering work on trade theory, he has played a
prominent role in US policy debates, strenuously advocating the merits of
flexible exchange rates. Having switched to economics from history, he
claims to use George Orwell as a stylistic model and to have little patience
for the 'dense mathematics' that peppers too many academic papers.
Mr Summers has no more respect for technical wizardry. Today, he notes
approvingly, the leaders of the profession are 'mathematically less able but
more worldly' than their counterparts a decade ago.
The second judgment - that the pendulum is swinging away from free market
economics - partly reflects the pattern of recent theoretical advances. In
spheres such as trade theory, labour economics, and finance, new models tend
to be 'neo-Keynesian', meaning they emphasise the importance of market
imperfections. Using a cricketing analogy, one economist noted that free
market theorists who were hitting boundaries in the 1970s and early 1980s
now found themselves 'padding up' to face fast balls from the likes of Mr
Krugman.
The stagnation of the US economy over the past three years, which has led to
cuts in academia as well as government and industry, has undoubtedly helped
fuel hostility to Reaganite nostrums. Rather than emphasising the flaws of
government, many academics are now looking at what the public sector can do
to strengthen the economy's supply side - for example, by reforming
education or renewing crumbling physical infrastructure.
In New Orleans, openly left-wing economists (a tiny minority in the US)
received a sympathetic hearing. Mr David Gordon of the New School for Social
Research in New York, for example, argued that US industry was hobbled by
adversarial relations between workers and employers. Companies failed to
invest, and employees resisted new work practices because neither side
trusted the other. Nobody quibbled when he claimed that greater co-operation
would be the key to enhanced productivity in the longer term.
But shifts in the ideological climate should not be exaggerated. A new
macroeconomics textbook by Mr Gregory Mankiw, another rising Harvard star,
is strikingly different from the texts I remember from the 1970s. The
conventional Keynesian economics that formed the core of courses in the
immediate post-war decades is relegated to the second half of the book, and
balanced by long sections emphasising the classical principles that predated
Keynes. 'Everybody is to the right of where we were in the 1960s,' says Mr
Summers, 'but less to the right than five or six years ago.'
Finally, the conference illustrated the extraordinary diversity of modern
economics. There is no subject, it seems, on which economists are not
prepared to pronounce. The smorgasbord of seminars included sessions on 'the
economics of religion' and 'the economics of sexual orientation'. The
presidential address, by Mr Thomas Schelling of the University of Maryland,
was entirely devoted to the threat of global warming and contained barely
any economics.
The willingness of some cutting-edge theoreticians to immerse themselves in
practical policy issues bodes well. So does the shift away from rigid free
market theory. Yet with these trends as yet poorly established, it is
perhaps not surprising that the profession's luxuriant growth in the US has
coincided with America's relative economic decline. The rise of Japan, which
has no world-class economists, testifies to the irrelevance of much
conventional economic theory.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Justinian: A code to control chat lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Codes of practice in support of self-regulation of the service industries
continue to sprout.
The most recent covers the provision of premium rate telephone services,
such as those described as 'adult entertainment' and so-called 'chat lines'
for children. The code is produced by ICSTIS, the independent committee
which supervises telephone information services, and comes into force on
February 1.
This new updated code raises the hoary issue of whether statutory control by
governmental agency is preferable to self-regulation, so as to maximise
consumer protection while allowing the service provider the greatest freedom
to provide a commercially viable product.
Almost 20 years ago the UK's Office of Fair Trading, which is statutorily
authorised to encourage trade associations to prepare codes of practice for
guidance in safeguarding and promoting the interests of consumers, and to
give its imprimatur to approved codes, recognised that codes had the
greatest utility in areas which are ill-suited to statutory control.
It singled out for mention codes which were especially adept in improving
the standard of services, which it said could not readily be achieved by
legislation. The acid test is the ability of the supervisory body generally
to set the appropriate standards to which the regulated are required to
conform while at the same time operating an effective system of sanctions to
punish those in breach of the code.
The new code prepared by ICSTIS is broadly divided into two parts:
provisions which lay down the permissible limits of the contents of
communications; and measures covering the type of advertising designed to
encourage the use of such premium rate services (the number of calls total a
staggering 6m a week, although the rapid increase during the late 1980s
flattened out last year).
Much of the public complaint over the content of these services has focused
on the so-called 'adult entertainment' features (though these are declining
in popularity). The code restricts these services to certain prefixes (0898
in the case of British Telecom), which users on digital telephone exchanges
will be able to bar access to, free of charge.
By the mid-90s all but a few remote areas of the UK will be on digital
dialling, enabling a majority of subscribers to opt out of the so-called
pornographic services. This step forward has been widely welcomed by the
public and sections of the telecommunications industry.
Other new measures protecting consumers relate to children's services. Some
of these services last for several minutes and are hence expensive. Children
may not sufficiently appreciate how much their calls are costing, often to
the consternation of their parents who have to foot the bill. Such services
will now be subject to a maximum call length of 7.5 minutes, after which the
call must be terminated.
Advertisements for children's services, moreover, will be required to state
the maximum potential cost of any call. ICSTIS will be monitoring this new
provision to gauge its effectiveness.
Supervision of the advertising of premium rate services has been an
important concern for ICSTIS. Information on prices is not always given;
when information is provided it is often insufficiently legible. Advertising
of sex lines in certain popular national newspapers has been curbed as a
result of a significant ruling last summer by ICSTIS, which declared that
the majority of such advertisements were unacceptably offensive.
The code has one important advantage over its predecessor: it incorporates
many of the provisions of the British Code of Advertising Practice (BCAP),
which were previously included only by cross reference to BCAP.
The BCAP is supervised by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which
was itself created in 1962 as a direct response to the threat of statutory
control over the advertising industry. Its survival without government
interference speaks well for self-regulation, particularly since it is not
entirely independent of the industry.
The chairman of the ASA is appointed from outside the industry and at least
half its members must have no connection with the industry. ASA members
drawn from the industry itself are supposed to serve in their individual
capacity and not as representatives of any sectional interests.
By contrast, ICSTIS contains no-one connected with the service operators.
The chairman* is appointed by the network operators in consultation with the
director-general of Oftel, the overall industry regulator.
The chairman appoints eight other members in consultation with the network
operators. Normally a regulated industry finances its regulatory body.
ICSTIS, however, is financed by the network operators. These operators,
while sharing the income from the premium rate services with the service
providers, do not themselves supply the actual information services and are
therefore not subject to the provisions of the code.
The other special feature of ICSTIS is that it cannot be faulted in theory
for being toothless. If there is a serious breach of its code, ICSTIS can
recommend to the network operator that the guilty service provider should no
longer have access to the lines allotted to it by the network operator.
Each service provider has a clause in its contract with the network operator
requiring compliance with the code of practice. Any adverse adjudication by
ICSTIS, and appropriate recommendation, constitutes a breach of contract.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Monday Profile: A railway renaissance off-track - The career
and record of Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A poisoned chalice, people call it; or, leaving aside the metaphor, simply
the worst job in Britain. Whatever the description, the chairmanship of
British Rail is not a task to be undertaken lightly.
Small wonder, then, that transport ministers reportedly trawled through a
list of 20 or more industrialists in late 1989 before finding a candidate
willing to succeed Sir Robert Reid on his retirement.
They seemed to have struck lucky when Mr Bob Reid (no relation), the highly
regarded chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, agreed to take up the
challenge. Tough, intelligent, sincere and well-liked, he looked just the
man to bring a railway renaissance.
Knighted shortly after accepting the appointment, the then Mr Reid relished
the task that lay ahead. 'I want the trains to run on time, to be safe, to
give a good service, and to improve morale,' he told the Financial Times.
'If I achieve that, I really don't give a damn who gets the credit for it.'
Two years later, it is no longer a question of who gets the credit: more one
of who gets the blame. With Sir Bob's stated objectives patently unachieved,
it is time to ask: is the chairman up to the job?
Hopes had ridden high on Sir Bob because of his demonstrable grit. This,
after all, was the man who overcame the loss of his right arm in a mincing
machine when he was nine years old to become not just a captain of industry,
but also a golfer with a single-figure handicap.
Initially appointed part-time to the BR chairmanship in April 1990, Sir Bob
became the Pounds 200,000-a-year full-time chairman in October 1990. Since
then, the hopes have faded amid BR's inability to extricate itself from
perpetual crisis.
Last year began with the notorious 'wrong kind of snow' affair in which BR
blamed the weather for paralysing the system; ended with severe disruption
to services caused by leaves on the line; and was punctuated by two fatal
crashes, fare rises well above the rate of inflation, and relentless
complaints about the unreliability of trains, the run-down of services and
the lack of passenger information.
It would be wrong to heap all the blame for these shortcomings on Sir Bob.
Some are attributable to a management culture which will take time to
change; others to a history of under-investment or the current cash squeeze.
But operational failings are only part of the story. On the political front,
too, BR has performed particularly badly: and relations between BR and the
government are an area for which Sir Bob is wholly responsible.
Here, it could be argued, Sir Bob has been just plain unlucky. While his
predecessor had enjoyed rapidly rising revenues during the economic boom and
was able to keep the government sweet by reducing his subsidy requirement,
Sir Bob arrived just as recession sent BR's revenues into a downward spiral.
Set against this is the fact that Sir Bob enjoys the patronage of a prime
minister and transport secretary far more sympathetic to the railways than
their predecessors. Notwithstanding this advantage, virtually every
encounter between BR and the government, on issues great and small, has left
the railways defeated.
To take one instance: while BR succeeded in winning more government money in
the last public spending round, the amount was far short of what was needed
to compensate it for declining revenues. When it tried to plug the gap with
big fare rises, the government very publicly intervened to trim the
increases.
The result is that BR's investment programme is in tatters, with all
projects except those already commissioned on indefinite hold.
Still more humiliating was BR's defeat over the planned high-speed link
between London and the Channel tunnel. After battling for four years amid
government vacillation for its favoured route through south London, it was
astonished to have its recommendations overthrown at the last minute by a
political decision in favour of an eastern route.
Now, another humiliation is looming with the government's plans for the
privatisation of BR. Whatever the eventual form of the privatised railway,
it seems probable that the government will override Sir Bob's wishes in at
least two respects: first, in refusing to countenance the preservation of
any organisation resembling BR in its present form, and second, in insisting
on as rapid as possible a transition into the private sector rather than
taking the slow-track approach favoured by Sir Bob.
The puzzle in all of this is that Sir Bob's background at Shell did not
prepare him better for the rough and tumble of politics. Two years ago, Sir
Bob told the Financial Times that the oil industry was even more exposed to
public comment and government interference than the railways.
'From that point of view, BR will be a relief after this business,' he said.
'An absolute relief.'
That the prophecy has not been borne out may reflect Sir Bob's lack of wider
experience. Until his move to BR at the age of 55, he had spent his entire
working life at Shell UK, determinedly climbing the corporate ladder. Even
in his last five years as chairman, he was answerable to the company's
parent, Royal Dutch/Shell, and never served on the parent's board.
Although evidently competent at Shell UK and well-regarded by his staff, he
kept a fairly low profile. Apart from his role in defending Shell UK after
an oil spill in the Mersey in 1989, his time as chairman was marked mainly
by his efforts to underline the company's community work and by his role in
founding the Management Charter Initiative, an industry-led management
training body.
Some managers at BR suggest that Sir Bob's career as an oil man may have
been an inadequate preparation for a task as large, as complex and as
politically charged as the railway chairmanship. He is also criticised for
purportedly having a poor grasp of the detail of the railway's finances and
operations.
The latter might be less of a criticism than it sounds. As at Shell UK, Sir
Bob's policy is to entrust his staff to get on with the day-to-day running
of the railway, seeing his own role more as the policy-maker and strategic
thinker.
But here, too, he has disappointed. His big chance to set out his thinking
was the publication last year of Future Rail, BR's vaunted prospectus
setting out its policies for the next 10 years.
When it appeared, the document turned out to be an insubstantial brochure of
public relations material which had almost no impact and was forgotten the
moment it appeared.
Meanwhile Sir Bob's public performance has been bafflingly inconsistent.
Soon after taking up the chairmanship full-time, he came out fighting with a
series of robust public statements calling for the government to invest
Pounds 1bn a year in the railways to the end of the decade.
Then he went quiet, apparently in the belief that if he played fair by the
government, the government would play fair by him.
That trust was misplaced, as subsequent events have shown. But apart from
his famous outburst after the Channel tunnel link decision ('when you are in
the middle of a pantomime, you want to stay with it'), he has more or less
disappeared from view. The run-up to the privatisation white paper, far from
triggering a ferocious lobbying campaign, has seen him on an extended family
holiday in Australia.
The temptation is to contrast Sir Bob's record with what might have been
expected from some of those who turned the chairmanship down: Lord King, the
British Airways chairman, for example, or Eurotunnel's chief executive, Sir
Alastair Morton. Is it right, however, to go as far as some Tory MPs do in
suggesting that he should be replaced?
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, says in a remarkably telling
observation on Sir Bob's qualities that the chairman is 'on a learning
curve' in terms of his relations with the media and MPs. In the same breath,
however, he says he thinks highly of his abilities and looks forward to
working with him for the foreseeable future.
It seems unlikely, then, that he will be pressed to step down. Quite apart
from anything else, it would be near-impossible to find anyone prepared to
act in Sir Bob's place as undertaker for the funeral of the British Railways
Board when the planned privatisation takes place. The bigger question is
whether Sir Bob will go of his own accord.
The odds are against it. To quit now would be an appalling admission of
defeat for a man whose reputation was built on his determination. But if
ministers reach agreement on a form of privatisation which makes his
position untenable, it is perhaps just conceivable that he could take the
opportunity to wreak one last, marvellously embarrassing act of revenge on
the government that made his job so hard.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Focus on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was little sign of the pressure on sterling within the European
monetary system abating last week and currency analysts are not expecting
any relief this week, writes Simon London.
Having opened on Monday morning at DM2.8550, the UK currency declined
inexorably to a low of DM2.83 on Thursday night. On Friday, sterling closed
higher at DM2.84 but was soon dragged back to DM2.8350 in New York trading.
Significantly, the weakness of sterling took place both when the dollar was
falling and surging later in the week. Analysts noted that a rally in the
dollar is no longer sure to benefit the pound against other European
currencies.
The woes of the UK currency could potentially increase with the release this
week of the first serious UK economic statistics of 1992. On Tuesday,
producer price inflation figures for December are due, followed by
unemployment figures on Thursday and retail price inflation on Friday.
A nasty surprise from any one of these figures could potentially deepen the
gloom for the UK economy, government and currency.
On a more optimistic view, bad news is already factored into sterling's
price. Figures brighter than expected could relieve some of the pressure.
In addition, there were signs on Friday that the D-Mark was weakening
following calls for lower rates from distinguished German economists.
This week, retail sales and inflation figures will be released in Germany.
These could be crucial in determining the future of sterling, potentially
more than the UK economic statistics, by giving a pointer to how long German
interest rates must remain at current high levels - in conflict with the
economic cycle in most of the rest of Europe.

FT  13 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Strong Eurodollar bond market surprises
traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRENGTH of the dollar bond market so far this year has taken many
market participants by surprise.
At the end of last year, many analysts were pointing to a shift in asset
allocation from US to European bond markets during 1992. The strong rally in
the US Treasury market fuelled by a one point discount rate cut to 3 1/2 per
cent has delayed this, and many European investors returned to their desks
after Christmas to find they had missed a two point rally in bond prices.
In spite of a setback to the US bond market at the end of last week, few
market participants believe the recent surge of demand for Eurodollar bonds
has been quashed. The sell-off may be welcomed as a buying opportunity by
some investors.
Pent-up demand for dollar securities has been exacerbated by the lack of
current coupon paper: that is, most Eurobonds and US Treasuries are trading
substantially above par value, as a result of the price rally. Many
investors do not like to pay premium prices, which represent a built-in
capital loss - since the bonds will ultimately be redeemed at par.
This partly accounts for the strong performance of Eurobond spreads relative
to US Treasuries. The Eurobond market has defied the conventional wisdom
that yield spreads widen in a rallying market.
Spreads of top quality Eurobonds are tighter than ever before. The World
Bank's Dollars 1.5bn 10-year global offering, launched last week at a spread
of 15 basis points above the comparable US Treasury, quickly tightened to a
margin of six basis points. In the past, Eurobonds have traded at yields
close to, or even below, US Treasuries usually because of demand from retail
investors, who do not generally assess value in spread terms, or due to
technical reasons, such as tax advantages.
Investors will accept much smaller margins as they expect rates to fall
further and because the dollar is now widely seen to be bottoming out.
Japanese investors in particular like to buy dollar securities when the
dollar is weak, positioning themselves for currency gains.
Some dealers argue it is logical for spreads to contract now that yields are
at such low levels, since the spread represents a correspondingly larger
proportion of the total yield.
Demand has been exaggerated by the readiness of traders to take on
inventory, partly because banks and securities houses share investors'
optimistic views, but also because the positive yield curve in the dollar
bond market allows them to hold bonds cheaply.
They are able to fund positions in bonds, which pay interest of about 7 per
cent, by borrowing at overnight rates of, say, 3 3/4 per cent. (The shape of
the yield curve is also encouraging investors to shift out of money markets
and into bonds.)
But in the heat of their enthusiasm for winning dollar business,
underwriters may be pushing spreads too hard. Demand remains selective,
concentrated among top quality borrowers, and some corporate deals are
faring less well.
Five-year deals for BOC Group and Abbey National Treasury Services launched
last week both widened from their launch spreads.
The deal which set the market trembling was a Dollars 500m 10-year offering
for Credit Local launched on Friday and due to be priced today. The
indicated launch spread for the transaction is 28 basis points above the
comparable US Treasury market.
The pricing reflects lead manager Deutsche Bank's positive view on the
market. Most dealers felt the issue would rely on attracting demand through
a further improvement not only in prices, which is generally expected, but
also in spread performance, which seems less sure.
Some traders believe there is room for spreads to tighten further,
predicting that the World Bank's global offering and the European Investment
Bank's recent deal will soon be trading at the same yield as, or below, the
comparable US Treasury market.
There is certainly room for hope that the Eurobond market will outperform
the US corporate bond market.
Last week, the Eurodollar bond market absorbed a hefty Dollars 4bn of fresh
supply. But the US corporate bond market has been deluged with record levels
of supply, with a massive Dollars 12.4bn last week, and Dollars 7.75bn the
previous week.
But if lack of supply has been a significant factor in the tightening of
margins, spreads may have only one way to go: out.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Syndicated Loans: Lasmo plans to raise Pounds 200m in
three-year revolving credit deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the UK oil exploration group, last week joined the long list of oil
and gas sector companies seeking financing in the syndicated loans market.
Barclays won the mandate for Lasmo's Pounds 200m three-year revolving credit
and Lasmo's close relationship banks have been approached to syndicate the
deal, which is paying a margin of 60 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate (Libor). There is a commitment fee of 30 basis points, and the
front-end fees are 12.5 basis points for lead managers with Pounds 25m or
more, and 9 basis points for managers with Pounds 15m and above.
Lasmo successfully bid Pounds 1.1bn for the oil and gas group Ultramar
recently, and the acquisition will transform it into one of the biggest oil
exploration groups in the world. Bankers associated with the Pounds 200m
revolving credit said the funds were 'for general corporate purposes' and
not specifically related to the takeover.
Meanwhile, Mobil Exploration Norway's Dollars 300m loan was launched in
syndication last week.
Citicorp and NatWest are joint arrangers for the three-year revolving credit
facility. The margin is 40 basis points over Libor and the commitment fee is
20 basis points. The front-end fees are 15 basis points for Dollars 30m and
10 basis points for Dollars 20m.
Bankers point out that a number of oil and energy groups were considering
launching syndicated loans when oil prices were more buoyant than at
present. Oil prices are usually fairly buoyant in the winter, but have
dropped Dollars 5 since October to under Dollars 18 a barrel.
Bankers are expecting Elf to launch a syndicated loan at some stage over the
next few weeks. The loan is for 'at least Pounds 350m', according to one
banker, and is expected to finance a North Sea project.
In addition, the Pounds 676m deal for Thames Power's financing of the
Barking power station is due to be launched in the syndicated loans market
soon. The three lead managers are NatWest, Swiss Bank Corporation, and Bank
of Montreal, and the margin is understood to be between 115 and 120 basis
points over Libor.
The 18-year financing is for the construction of a gas-fired power station.
Construction is due to start in July 1992, and commercial operations in

Among those energy deals already in syndication are Neste, the Finnish
state-owned oil and chemicals group, which recently announced a Dollars 400m
10-year project finance facility, and Aran Energy, which launched a Dollars
225m facility.
Birmingham Midshires Building Society last week announced a Pounds 100m
medium-term revolving credit facility. The deal is being jointly arranged by
JP Morgan and Union Bank of Switzerland and is intended to replace those
medium-term standby facilities which fall due this year.
The four-year facility is paying a margin of 35 basis points over Libor and
a commitment fee of 17.5 basis points.

FT  13 JAN 92 / US Money and Credit: Economists debate cutting long bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN the US government save hundreds of millions of dollars on its interest
bill by refinancing the deficit at shorter maturities and, in the process,
stimulate the economy by bringing down mortgage rates?
This question, first asked last month by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury
secretary, has sparked a lively debate among bond market economists in the
past few weeks.
Mr Brady posed the question because he has been dismayed by the stubbornness
of long-term interest rates, which have refused to decline as sharply as
short-term rates, in spite of the aggressive easing of monetary policy by
the Federal Reserve.
Long-term rates have remained high - the spread between the yield on short-
and long-term securities is currently more than 300 basis points  -
primarily because demand for longer-dated securities has dwindled as
overseas investors, especially the Japanese, have stayed away from the
market or invested in other, higher-yielding sovereign debt.
High long-term rates has led many to ask why the government should be paying
7.5 per cent interest on its debt when it could be paying 4 per cent or 5
per cent.
Although there have been radical calls for a complete phasing out of the
long bond, if there were change it would probably involve reducing the
supply of longer-dated securities.
The theory behind such a move is simple. If less long-term securities are
issued, prices rise and long-term yields fall. This would stimulate the
economy, because long-term yields are used to calculate most US mortgage
rates, and a reduction in mortgage rates would free up extra income that
could be spent on goods and services.
Reducing the issue of long-term debt means having to increase supply at the
short end, which pushes up short-term interest rates. But the rise in yields
at the short end of the market would not be as pronounced as at the long
end, and the Federal Reserve could always cut the discount rate to force
short rates lower if they went too high.
Opponents of reducing the supply of bonds warn serious debt-management
problems could arise if maturities are shortened. They say the Treasury
would have to roll over the Federal debt more often, and that the debt would
be exposed to fluctuations in short-term rates.
The core of their case is that the Treasury's management of the country's
debt should not involve interest rate speculation. If the economy were to
recover strongly, and push up inflation, the government could have to roll
over matured short-term debt at much higher rates.
While the two sides have battled it out, an intriguing solution has come
from Mr Donald Coxe, an economist in New York with Gordon Capital. Mr Coxe,
who for six years helped the Canadian health minister manage Canada's huge
social security pension fund, says the answer lies in the enormous buying
power of the US Social Security Trust Fund (SSTF).
The SSTF, which owns a quarter of the US national debt, is the world's
largest pension fund. It has always invested US taxpayers' social security
payments in US government securities right across the maturity range, from
monthly bills to 30-year bonds, buying them from the Federal Reserve at
auction, and occasionally in the open market.
Mr Coxe believes the fund should stop investing in short-term securities.
Instead, the Fed should announce that in future all 10-, 20- and 30-year
government bonds will be sold direct to the SSTF. This would lead to a big
drop in long-term yields, and quickly bring down mortgage rates. It would
not affect the duration of the government debt.
Moreover, the interests of the taxpayers who contribute to the fund would be
better served because a shift away from lower yielding short-term securities
to higher yielding bonds would improve the return on the fund's portfolio.
Mr Coxe's scheme would not be without its losers, the biggest being Wall
Street's dealing firms, whose commissions would plummet if the SSTF bought
all the supply of new bonds direct from the Treasury. But, as Mr Coxe asks:
'Why should a commission be paid unnecessarily on a sale to a government
trust fund?'
Close observers of the Treasury believe the most likely outcome of the
debate will be a modest reduction in the issue of long-term bonds. Expect
the next quarterly refunding, due in early February, to include Dollars 2bn
to Dollars 4bn fewer 10-year and 30-year bonds than in the previous round,
and more bills and notes.

FT  13 JAN 92 / German Bunds: Outbreak of optimism drives yields down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST, the yield on the 10-year long bund has fallen from the 8.25 to 8.5
per cent range in which it was stuck for the latter half of last year.
A wave of buying from overseas before and after Christmas has driven the
yield to just below 8 per cent, with enthusiasts predicting that it will
reach 7.5 per cent by the middle of the year.
Paradoxically, the catalyst was the Bundesbank's decision to raise each of
the discount and Lombard rates by a full half a percentage point to 8.5 and
9.75 per cent respectively. The increase was denounced as 'going overboard'
by international and domestic observers alike. But fixed-income investors
were pleased.
'A clear consensus has emerged that we have already reached the peak for
short-term interest rates for the current year,' says Mr Mark
Houghton-Berry, executive director in charge of fixed income activities at
Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, explaining international investors' response to
the highest German interest rates in 50 years. 'They believe that they
should not wait for rates to fall, but should buy bunds now.'
Part of the attraction is that bunds offer significantly higher yields than
US Treasury bills. Equally, international investors have been drawn in on
the assumption that the Bundesbank's resolute display of monetary rectitude
just before Christmas will be enough to put an end to the build-up of
inflationary pressures in the German economy.
Consumer price inflation reached an annual rate of 4.1 per cent in December
and is expected to rise to 4.7 per cent in March. Labour cost inflation is
running at over 7 per cent and the Bundesbank must be hoping that the rate
move will frighten German unions into accepting reasonable settlements in
the 1992 wage round. By reasonable the Bundesbank may mean below 5 per cent.
Investors are assuming that the strategy will work, and that after
settlements are finalised in April, the Bundesbank will be in a position to
bring rates down again. Taking into consideration the slowdown of the German
economy, consumer price inflation could be down to 3 per cent by the end of
the year.
These are all reasons why bunds should move into a new trading range - with
yields fluctuating between 7.6 and 7.9 per cent in during the first quarter.
At present, as Mr Dieter Wermuth of Caisse des Depots in Frankfurt puts it:
'Buying bunds is the only game in town,' - with the caveat that the game is
played mainly by non-domestic investors. For capital gains to be anything
other than precarious or short-lived, German investors must buy too - and
there is no incentive for them to do so when yields on overnight money and
three month-deposits are significantly higher than those on 10-year bunds.
One other factor could dislodge the favourable outlook: increasing
instability in the former Soviet Union. International investors attitudes to
Germany are likely to change dramatically if troubles in the east escalate
in some as yet imponderable way - and bund yields may go back up again.

FT  13 JAN 92 / UK Gilts: Investors shrug off auction doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH thrown out of their stride by news of a further tranche of
gilt-edged securities to go on sale later this month, investors continued to
show firm support for the bonds, with yields being pushed down.
Prices rose for most classes of gilts, with yields coming down by about 5
basis points (0.05 percentage points) during the week for long-dated bonds,
and by up to twice this much for instruments at the shorter end of the yield
curve.
The yield fall for the week would have been greater, without the
announcement by the Bank of England on Friday that it will auction an
unspecified amount of gilt-edged stock on January 29.
It seems likely that up to Pounds 2bn of securities, maturing between 1998
and 2002, will go on sale in what has now become a regular series of
auctions. The announcement caused a price drop of about  3/4 percentage
point on Friday, prompted by worries that a large amount of bonds coming on
to the market will force up yields. The Bank is to announce on January 21
further details about terms for the auction and stock to be sold.
However, since the start of 1992 the gilt market has firmed, with fears by
many gilt investors about the consequences of a glut in supply falling into
the background. According to the calculations of some gilt specialists,
action by the Bank in selling Pounds 1.5bn of the securities at this month's
auction would virtually end the requirement by the UK authorities to fund
the public-sector borrowing requirement for this financial year.
According to the Treasury, the UK must borrow Pounds 10.5bn on financial
markets in the year to April, to supplement the government's public spending
funds. Assuming the auction succeeds, the Bank will have sold about Pounds
15bn during the year, more than enough to cover the borrowing requirement,
after taking account of payments on gilt redemptions.
The reduction in funding pressure was illustrated on Thursday when the Bank
disposed of the final components of a tap stock of Pounds 1bn worth of 8.5
per cent Treasury bonds maturing in 2007, which became available in
mid-December. Last month, few buyers had emerged for the instruments,
because of weak demand for gilts generally.
So far this month, the underlying demand patterns have been different.
Investors such as pension funds have demonstrated more interest in switching
money out of equities and into debt-related instruments, due to growing
indications of a long and slow UK recovery which is likely to dampen
inflation and cause downward pressure on interest rates.
The buying activity has increased in spite of problems for the pound. Last
week, the unit traded nervously, often close to its effective floor in the
European exchange rate mechanism of about DM2.832. Should the pound weaken
more, prompting intervention by the Bank, gilts could suffer due to overseas
investors holding back from buying.
However, the mood on currency markets about sterling is relatively calm. The
pound's effective ERM floor is set by the peseta, the system's strongest
currency, If currency investors were to sell the pound in high volumes, the
limit could relatively easily be brought down. According to this view, alarm
bells at the Bank and the Treasury about sterling would ring only when the
pound fell close to the bottom of its 6 per cent band against its central
DM2.95 ERM rate - an 'ultimate floor' of about DM2.78 and some 6 pfennigs
beneath Friday's close.
Figures released by the Bank last week illustrated the strong demand for
gilts by UK institutions in November, when they snapped up Pounds 1.1bn
worth of the instruments. December was a poor month in which yields rose,
mainly due to jitters about sterling, but since the beginning of the year UK
bonds have outperformed all other main government instruments. While yields
on 10-year gilts have fallen 25 basis points since the end of December,
yields on 10-year French, German and Japanese government bonds are down just
17, 10 and 5 basis points. Over this period, yields on US Treasury bonds of
equivalent maturities have increased by 14 basis points.

FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Laidlaw suffers 47% drop in
first-quarter earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EARNINGS at Laidlaw, the Canadian waste services and school bus operator,
fell by 47 per cent in the first quarter of fiscal 1992.
Much of the decline was due to lower contributions from its two affiliates,
ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction group, and Attwoods, the
UK-based waste management company. Laidlaw is the largest single shareholder
in both companies.
Laidlaw's earnings dropped to USDollars 40.6m, or 16 cents a share, in the
three months to November 30, from Dollars 77.5m, or 32 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenues rose fractionally to Dollars 521.3m.
The combined contributions from Attwoods and ADT tumbled to Dollars 8.4m
from Dollars 24.3m. Laidlaw does not publish separate figures for the two
companies.
Laidlaw and ADT have yet to finalise the selection of three out of the four
independent directors who are due to join ADT's board under a truce between
the two companies hammered out nine months ago.
The agreement followed serious allegations by Laidlaw about ADT's corporate
governance under its chief executive Mr Michael Ashcroft.
Laidlaw's US garbage business remains a headache, with margins sinking to 10
per cent from 17.2 per cent a year earlier. Besides the recession, this
division is suffering from management problems and the legacy of an
unfocused acquisition spree in the 1980s.
Despite these setbacks, Laidlaw's share price has moved up sharply in recent
weeks, closing at CDollars 11.50 on the Toronto stock exchange on Friday, up
from a low of CDollars 8.35 late last year.

FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Retail fears shift to Macy's
from Federated/Allied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE big US retail bankruptcy - that of Federated Department Stores and
Allied Stores - is expected to move to a close this week, but worries that
another could start at Macy's drove down the New York-based department store
chain's bonds on Friday.
At the end of last week, the bankruptcy court judge in the Federated/Allied
case agreed to sign an order confirming the companies' reorganisation plan.
Final technicalities delayed his formal approval, but this is expected
shortly. The two groups - which take in chains like Bloomingdale's, Lazarus
in Cincinnati, and Bon Marche in Seattle - could then emerge from bankruptcy
in mid-February.
Under the reorganisation plan, which won backing from creditors in
late-December, Federated and Allied would be merged into one group.
Essentially, creditors would get a mixture of cash, new debt securities and
equity in the merged company. The two retail groups already share common
senior management.
The reorganisation plan provides for the issue of about 80m new shares,
which will be listed. It would reduce debt and other claims against the
companies from about Dollars 8.2bn when Federated/Allied filed for
bankruptcy protection in January 1990, to about Dollars 3bn.
The retailers' escape from corporate purgatory has symbolic significance
too. Federated/Allied were acquired by Canada's Campeau Corporation through
two multi-billion dollar leveraged bids in 1986 and 1988. When bankruptcy
ensued, it seemed to epitomise the demise of the debt-laden 1980s and the
era of financially-engineered deals.
But, while one retail sector problem seems close to resolution, junk bonds
issued by R. H. Macy fell sharply on Friday - following heavy losses earlier
in the week - on rumours of a delayed payment to trade creditors.
Late on Friday, Macy's confirmed that it would not send out vendor cheques
until January 25, essentially two weeks' late, but claimed this was due to
'clean down' provisions in its banking agreements. A revolving credit
agreement requires Macy's to reduce borrowings under the facility below
certain levels during the December-February period. By delaying supplier
payments, Macy's hopes to meet the banking requirements.
Earlier in the week, Macy's claimed that talk of a bankruptcy filing was
'unfounded' and, on Friday evening, said this position was unchanged.
Nevertheless, its zero coupon bonds fell to Dollars 23, having been around
Dollars 35 mid-week. Macy's lost Dollars 155.4m in the quarter ended
November 2, worse than analysts expected, and is thought to have shared in
the generally disappointing Christmas season.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KNAUF, the privately-owned German group, has strengthened its presence in
the European plasterboard market with the acquisition of Danogips of
Denmark, Europe's fourth biggest producer.
The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, consolidates Knauf's position
as the industry's second biggest player, behind BPB Industries of the UK and
ahead of Lafarge Coppee of France.
It also continues the rapid restructuring of the European plasterboard
industry, which will now be dominated by these three companies.
Danogips, which employs 600 people, has two plasterboard plants in Denmark
and one in Sweden.
It also makes specialist interior finishing products, and had total turnover
last year of more than DKr600m (Dollars 97.9m).
The deal gives Knauf its first manufacturing facilities in Scandinavia.

FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Investcorp profit declines by
21% to Dollars 52m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTCORP Bank, the Arab controlled investment bank, suffered a 21 per cent
drop in net profits to Dollars 52.2m in 1991.
However, Mr Michael Merritt, a member of Investcorp's management committee,
said the bank was pleased with its performance in view of the economic and
political upheavals of the past year, notably the Gulf war.
Investcorp specialises in channelling funds held by wealthy Arab investors
into well established businesses located in western economies. In a typical
deal, it will arrange the buy-out of a company, such as that of Saks Fifth
Avenue, the US stores group, which it organised two years ago.
It distributes the equity and subordinated debt needed for the buy-out among
its clients, keeping between 10 and 15 per cent. After the acquisition is
completed, it takes a close interest in the management of the acquired
company.
Mr Merritt said that in 1991 Investcorp took a strategic decision not to
make any acquisitions, because of the 'severe economic difficulties' faced
by most economies.
The bank concentrated on ensuring its existing investments would continue to
increase in value. However, the absence of acquisitions - and thus the
absence of fees for arranging deals - was a substantial contributor to the
fall in profits.
Speaking from the bank's head office in Bahrain, Mr Elias Hallack,
Investcorp's chief financial officer, said he was particularly pleased that
net interest income of Dollars 29.2m was only 13 per cent down on the
previous year and exceeded operating expenses of Dollars 28.6m. He said this
demonstrated that the bank could make a profit simply from the earnings it
received from its portfolio of investments.
Other income, including profits from the disposal of investments and from
trading in securities and foreign exchange, was Dollars 51.6m, down from
Dollars 65.9m.
During the year, it sold its minority interests in Thecla Industries, a
French aluminium components company, and in Fox Photo, the big US retail
photoprocessing company.
The group's net assets increased from Dollars 243m to Dollars 278m. It is
paying a dividend of 3.75 cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier.
Mr Merritt said he expected 1992 to be another difficult year.
Investcorp has a complicated corporate structure. Part of the group has a
listing on the Bahrain stock exchange and it has an estimated 10,000
shareholders.
Just before the Gulf war, Investcorp reorganised its structure and
transferred control of its assets out of the Gulf to a Luxembourg-based
subsidiary. However, the group continues to be managed from Bahrain, though
it also has offices in London and New York.

IN AN aggressive bid to expand its share of the Dollars 9bn market for
computer workstations, Hewlett-Packard will today launch an 'entry-level'
Dollars 5,000 computer workstation that is almost twice as fast as any in
its price range.
HP has set its sights on the market for low-end workstations, currently
dominated by Sun Microsystems, which is the highest volume segment of the
workstation market.
Digital Equipment also entered the field last month, with a Dollars 4,000
workstation and International Business Machines is also expected to announce
new low-end models next week.
HP claims to have leap-frogged competitors by offering significantly higher
performance in a low-cost computer.
While Sun and Digital's 'entry-level' workstations offer performance of
about 20 specmarks - a widely accepted measure of computer performance  -
HP's new workstation is rated at 34 specmarks.
Sun currently holds about 40 per cent of the entire workstation market, with
Hewlett-Packard second at 16 per cent, according to market researchers.

THE London International Financial Futures Exchange is relaunching its Ecu
bond future tomorrow, in an effort to revive interest in the flagging
contract, which started trading last March.
Liffe has instituted a formal market-making scheme, under which five firms -
Deutsche Bank, San Paolo, Swiss Bank Corporation, Tokai International, and
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - will make prices at a maximum bid/offer spread of four
basis points in a minimum amount of 15 contracts.
The contract design has been changed to include only sovereign debt, but
will allow greater flexibility in the selection of deliverable bonds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house which was caught rigging
US treasury bond auctions last summer, has suffered a wave of staff
defections from its London equity operations.
The annual meetings of the worldwide senior management of Salomon Brothers,
which started in New York last week, will this week discuss staff
compensation, following worries about how to stem staff losses.
Departures include Mr Nick Bedford, head of equity sales; Mr Chris
Mitchinson, head of equity research and strategy; Mr Ian Hannam, head of
international equities syndication; and Mr Rainer Frey, also from equities
syndication.
Salomon has also lost two European equity traders, a senior Eastern European
expert who worked on the firm's international equity offering for Fotex, and
the head of its Paris office.
Mr Jim Massey, head of Salomon Brothers' international business said: 'We
have lost a few people in London whom we did not want to lose.'
He added that the shake-up in the equities business 'wasn't a major
restructuring . . . we had some weak links, and these have been expunged'.
Mr Massey 'categorically denied' that Salomon Brothers is cutting back its
international equity business.
A spokesman for Salomon Brothers said 'everyone who goes will be replaced,
there will be no net loss' although the firm admitted that several of the
jobs remain vacant.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Economics Notebook: A time to look to the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER by coincidence or design, the approach of pre-Budget purdah for the
chancellor and Treasury officials has been marked in recent years by an
intensified debate about the conduct of British fiscal policy.
This year is no exception. Leaving aside the pre-election war of words over
income tax rates, the past week has seen an important proposal from Mr John
Smith, the shadow chancellor, to end the UK's curious practice of splitting
the revenue raising and public spending parts of the annual budget process
between Budget Day in March and the Autumn Statement in November.
Fiscal policy was also high on the agenda of last week's meeting of Neddy,
the National Economic Development Council. There, for the first time in
years, the Trade Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry
agreed on economic policy.
Today Arthur Andersen, the audit and business advisory group, makes a
contribution* to the debate on fiscal policy with a suggestion that UK
governments should pay more attention to maintaining fairness between
generations in their spending and borrowing policies.
The authors of the report - Stephen Hailey, Brian Currie and Chris Osborne
of Arthur Andersen - contend that Britain's existing cash-based system of
public expenditure accounting and control discourages investment and fails
to give adequate recognition to the importance of long term commitments in
the planning of government spending. A system that paid more attention to
inter-generational equity would take the short-termism out of British
government spending plans.
Cash-based planning has been central to British government spending policy
since the mid-1970s when it was introduced in an attempt to prevent run-away
government spending stoking inflation in the economy.
It was refined in the 1980s and finds its expression each year in protracted
negotiations between the Treasury and individual spending departments.
Although some aspects of spending - such as social security outlays - are
demand-determined, discretionary spending is controlled through the
imposition of cash limits.
Partly because of this system, the ratio of spending to gross domestic
product in Britain fell from 47.5 per cent in the early 1980s to around 40
per cent by the end of that decade. The ratio has since risen under the
impact of the recession and is expected to reach 42 per cent in the coming
1992-93 financial year. But according to the Arthur Andersen report, it
remains the lowest in the European Community.
But Arthur Andersen also notes that the UK government has spent less on
investment as a share of GDP than its EC trading partners. As a share of
economic output, capital expenditure in the public and private sectors
combined is also lower than in France and Germany.
The study avoids any contentious debate about the quality of Britain's
infrastructure or transport system. But it points out that 'there is room
for concern that existing policies may be preventing appropriate levels of
investment from taking place'.
At times of pressure on the government finances, spending ministers and the
Treasury have often found it easier to keep within cash limits by deferring
capital spending rather than by cutting current spending. In more normal
times, cash based planning can fail to recognise the beneficial consequences
of spending which yields results in a time period considerably later than
that in which the spending is made.
The report therefore urges the UK government to focus more on
inter-generational equity when formulating its spending plans. It does not
advocate an end to the present cash-based planning system. However, it
suggests that government departments, when formulating their spending plans
each year, should ask which current expenditure would yield significant
benefits in future periods, and what significant commitments have been
placed on taxpayers in future periods by current policy decisions.
The answers to these questions would reveal the broad shifts in
inter-generational equity that have occurred through government spending
plans. If the gains and losses to future generations of today's spending
decisions were divided into time blocks of, say, five years, governments
would have a better idea of how to split the financing burden between
taxation and borrowing.
In the case of public investment, the present generation would be passing on
benefits to future generations. Borrowing to cover that investment would
ensure that the generation that receives the benefits carries its share of
the costs rather than heaping all on to today's taxpayers.
This principle is already established practice in other countries. Germany,
for example, links the amount of government borrowing that is allowed to the
level of investment by the state.
Looking at Britain today, the Arthur Andersen report suggests that such an
analysis could justify increased government borrowing to finance investment.
Such a move might also be justified by the relatively low burden that future
generations of UK taxpayers face as a result of existing commitments.
Britain's tax and benefits system does not face the same sort of pressure
caused by a rapidly ageing population as do those of Japan and some other
industrialised countries. Britain also spends proportionately less than
other countries on social costs, so that increases in social costs that will
arise from changes to the dependency ratio should not be as severe as in
other countries.
So does the Arthur Andersen analysis mean that the present government, or
whichever political party wins the general election, should relax cash
limits on spending and consciously step up borrowing to boost investment?
One expert on public spending policy sounds a note of caution. Andrew
Likierman, professor of accounting and financial control at the London
Business School, points out that cash planning was introduced in response to
the very high inflation of the 1970s.
More recent history has shown that Britain remains an inflation-prone
country. Even though inflation has fallen sharply in the last 15 months and
the UK is subject now to the discipline of the European exchange rate
mechanism, the government would have to 'look very carefully' at the
implications of moving from the existing system of public expenditure
planning, he says.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Big ideas in the small world of machine tools: A significant
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be few big industrial sectors where a company can turn itself into
the biggest US producer, and the fourth largest in the world, and still have
annual sales of less than Dollars 700m (Pounds 384m).
But in the world machine tool market, such a company is one of a handful of
giants among thousands of minnows. And in an era of megadeals, all it took
to bring about one of the biggest takeovers in machine tool history was a
Dollars 70m acquisition.
For that modest sum, Giddings &amp; Lewis bought fellow US machine tool maker
Cross &amp; Trecker, once the world's largest machine tool maker, in November.
The deal may have been a pinprick in takeover terms, but for Mr William
Fife, the large chairman and chief executive at Giddings &amp; Lewis, there are
big issues at stake: America's continuing role as a manufacturer, the future
of a US machine tool industry trying to rebuild itself after a long
battering from Japanese and European competition, and the lure of the
European market, which accounts for 40-45 per cent of world machine tool
consumption.
Mr Fife, fortunately, is used to tough assignments. He is one of the few
executives in the boardrooms of US manufacturing who have built their
careers literally from the ground up - after leaving the Navy he became a
sweeper on the midnight shift at Inland Steel.
It is fitting, though, that he and his team from the small town of Fond du
Lac, Wisconsin, should have begun their task of integrating the two
companies in a year which saw the strategic importance of machine tool
manufacture underlined as never before. The Gulf war exposed the dependence
of US aerospace and defence industries on foreign equipment, such as gears,
made on foreign machine tools, giving a boost to campaigners for greater US
government support of strategic industries and turning their future into a
trade issue.
Just after Christmas, President George Bush authorised negotiations with
Japan and Taiwan to extend for two years voluntary restraint agreements
(VRAs) on exports to the US of certain computer numerical controlled (CNC)
machine tools. But the VRAs are to be phased out gradually during that
period, giving US machine tool makers, says Mr Fife, 'the opportunity and
the incentive to continue our successful rebuilding to help make all
American industry more competitive'.
In the early 1970s, the average US machine tool company was small- or
medium-sized, primarily serving the domestic market with a single product
that faced little foreign competition, and conducting very little research.
As recently as 1982, there were 1,400 active US machine tool makers. But
very few seemed to realise that their market was changing - customers wanted
multiple product lines and a much closer working partnership with the
machinery manufacturers. Machine tools were becoming part of ever more
complex machining centres and flexible manufacturing systems, and customers
demanded solutions that could raise their productivity in increasingly
competitive global markets.
Now there are probably fewerthan 600 active US machine tool makers - still
far too many in an industry where fragmentation has caused chronic financial
weakness.
Worse still, the US share of world machine tool consumption has fallen from
around 20 per cent to 10 per cent over the past decade while the world
market has doubled in size to about Dollars 43bn - a symptom of US
industrial decline. And, over the same period, imports have doubled their
share of the US market to 47 per cent last year, nearly half of which were
from Japan.
Most observers say that the Japanese, with their relentless product
development programmes and marketing power, and the Europeans, with their
commitment to spending on research, have responded better to the changes in
the US and world marketplace.
Mr Fife certainly thinks so, but since taking the top job at Giddings &amp;
Lewis in 1987 after a spell at Cross &amp; Trecker, has been trying to buck the
trend.
Artificial divisions between product lines have been removed, a significant
investment made - albeit rather belatedly - in a company-wide computer-aided
design (CAD) network, and research and development spending lifted sharply
to 10 per cent of sales, three times the US industry average.
While the sales of Giddings &amp; Lewis' sales have nearly doubled from Dollars
125m in 1987 to Dollars 242m last year, producing earnings of Dollars 20m,
the performance at Cross &amp; Trecker has been very different. It has clocked
up losses of Dollars 100m over the last four financial years while sales
have fluctuated around Dollars 420m-460m.
The David-and-Goliath deal created the sole US representative in the world
machine tool top 10, and a company of around 5,000 employees, but exploiting
and maintaining this position will not be plain sailing. Mr Fife has three
aims from the deal - product range expansion and extension, and global
presence. A wider presence in the European market is a crucial element in
the deal - C&amp;T's strengths on the continent should complement the Giddings &amp;
Lewis UK presence, said Mr Paul Lugara, Arbroath-based group vice-president
for European operations.
In Mr Fife's favour is his continued willingness and ability to invest in
research and development. That is due in part to tight cost controls forced
by public company status - Giddings &amp; Lewis was spun off from AMCA
International, a Canadian manufacturer, in a 1989 public offering.
Giddings &amp; Lewis will also have to move quickly to lift morale at C&amp;T, which
had been depressed by its recent performance.
Already, a small UK factory at Telford has been closed with the loss of 27
jobs, and Mr Lugara says some further cost reductions and elimination of
duplication will be necessary. But he denies reports that four senior UK
executives at C&amp;T have been dismissed: 'There may be some changes of
position, but we need their expertise,' he adds.
There have been rumblings in the trade press, too, about the speed with
which the Giddings &amp; Lewis name has supplanted much-loved names of C&amp;T
subsidiaries such as Warner &amp; Swasey. But Mr Lugara says the change have not
been a problem for customers or employees.
'We want to get across that we are one-stop shopping for factory
automation,' says Mr Lugara. Only then can the Giddings &amp; Lewis deal create
a unified bulwark against European and Japanese competition - giving the
takeover a significance that few Dollars 70m deals could claim.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Kevin Maxwell 'signed invalid transfer'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kevin Maxwell's signature appeared on an invalid transfer of Pounds 32m
of shares from Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed much of the
Maxwell pension funds, according to a preliminary report made by BIM's
auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.
The shares in EURIS, a French investment trust, are being held by Banque
National de Paris as security for a loan to a private company in the Maxwell
empire. BIM has received no payment for the transfer, the report said.
Mr Kevin Maxwell alone authorised the transaction whereas two signatures
were required, the Coopers report said.
Details of the transfer, and others from the Pounds 727m of assets managed
by BIM for Maxwell pension funds, emerged as Mr Kevin Maxwell was due to
appear before the Parliamentary Select Committee on Social Security this
morning to explain the disappearance of assets from pension funds.
Coopers prepared the report in its role as auditors to BIM shortly before
Robson Rhodes was appointed as provisional liquidator of BIM in early
December. The report says Pounds 428m was lent in cash or shares to Robert
Maxwell Group, one of the main private Maxwell companies.
Robson Rhodes says it has yet to trace Pounds 327m missing from BIM and it
is uncertain who owns Pounds 400m it has found.
The Coopers report also identifies when shares that were being used as
collateral for so-called 'stock lending' from BIM to Maxwell private
companies began to disappear. BIM began a stock lending programme in 1989,
administered by London and Bishopsgate International, another private
Maxwell entity.
Stock lending is a market practice encouraged by the Bank of England. In
July 1991 management of the stock lending programme passed to Maxwell
Central and East European Partners, another Maxwell entity, with LBI acting
as joint agents for Robert Maxwell Group.
At the start of 1991, BIM received collateral mainly in the form of Maxwell
Communication Corporation and Berlitz shares.
In June Mr Robert Maxwell 'took control of the collateral', the report says,
'except the Berlitz shares which were held in a safe in his secretary's
office.'
Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a former director of BIM, told Coopers that at the
end of September the collateral was adequate but after Robert Maxwell died
on November 6, the safe was checked and no collateral was found.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Thinking about a possible recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Currency dealers, faced with the sudden surge in the dollar at the end of
last week, gave their standard imitation of the police chief at the end of
Casablanca who ordered: 'Round up the usual suspects'. Their explanations
were widely assorted, and often mutually contradictory. The dollar rose
because Mr Bush said he felt fine. It rose because the Japanese had failed
to endorse an expected devaluation of the dollar, or because the Group of
Seven was expected to push it up. It rose because US unemployment had risen
(on the principle that bad news leads to Fed easing, and is thus good news),
or because employment had risen.
The only reliable lesson is one which experience taught me many years ago;
never ask a dealer to explain prices, because he is much too close to the
action. The only entirely convincing answer I ever heard came from a man
reputed at the time to be the shrewdest operator in London when he said he
knew what was what on a particular occasion: 'Because I was getting more
bids than I could handle on my book.' The wisdom-after-the-event, or
chartist, version of this is also quite convincing this time round: 'Because
the dollar is oversold.'
All else is speculation, but at least on this occasion there is something to
speculate about. For some time now, the Wall Street equity market and some
of its more impressive gurus have been suggesting that the next big event in
the US economy will be not only a recovery, but one that will be quite
vigorous and will start quite soon.
The new optimists are still a minority, but they include some of those who
gave the most accurate warnings of the strength and duration of the
recession, including, from opposite ends of the financial spectrum, the Bank
Credit Analyst, which concentrates on the financial economy, and Robert
Brusca, of Nikko Securities, whose readings of the official indicators of
the real economy have been notably uncoloured by dogma or wishful thinking.
When these two agree, there is at least something for the rest of us to
think about.
Their two bullish views have a common thread: that the structural
adjustments which have caused the US downturn are now well advanced, so that
normal business growth can resume. On the financial side, the severe
over-leveraging which made the market so fragile has been substantially
reduced, while the massive reduction in short-term interest rates has made
the remaining debt burden quite manageable. Above all, perhaps, the
restoration of banking margins should have revived the confidence of banking
lenders. Abandoning growth for growth's sake is one thing, but turning your
back on profitable business quite another.
This financial restoration, however, merely removes a major barrier to
recovery; something more than a six per cent real growth rate in exports is
required to start solid growth in this largely closed economy. Here it is
the adjustment in the real economy which is encouraging, if you are in any
mood for encouragement. It points to rising domestic sales, despite flat
incomes.
The consumer-debt-to-income ratio is now about half way from its peak to its
normal level. Inflation is low and still falling, to the benefit of real
incomes, and job losses have slowed down sharply, if you believe the
seasonal adjustments, which should lead to some revival of consumer
confidence. Most important, the first stirrings of revival are already
visible in the consumer market.
Turnover in the market for existing houses has been quite solidly up ever
since midsummer, and now the downturn in new buildings seems to be over,
though growth is feeble so far. This should lead to a matching revival of
sales of household equipment and furnishings. Finally, there is something of
a famine in recent used cars; as trade-in prices harden, sales of new cars
should at last revive.
This catalogue seems to me to establish that there is a bright side to the
US economic picture. The latest employment figures are almost certainly a
false dawn, because they owe everything to the seasonal adjustment of
government employment, and almost nothing to the market economy. Further,
the optimistic picture leaves out some forbidding details - defence cuts, a
low savings rate which suggests continuing financial strain, and renewed
weakness in surveys of industrial sentiment.
All the same, the optimists have some current evidence to cite, and rely on
no wishful thinking about fiscal kick-starts. A consumer-led revival in US
demand is at least possible, if not yet probable; one can see why the
markets may be excitable (if it has not just been a Bush rally). And
thinking about a US upturn at least provides a check-list of factors which
could justify the British Treasury's obstinate faith in a similar recovery
here.
To start with the bright side, real income growth here has remained strong,
and the current price war in the retail side should make it it still
stronger. The high personal savings rate suggests prudence, not strain. The
very low stock levels at all stages of production and distribution mean that
any revival in sales should feed through very quickly to orders for current
production - or imports (and probably both). Meanwhile, export growth does
provide some basic support - slower than for the US, but more important in a
more open economy. The real economy could justify some nervous optimism -
nervous mainly about the balance of payments.
It is the financial picture which is remains as forbidding as ever. This is
not so much because of the record bankruptcy rate, which makes people
insecure in their jobs but could be consistent with an upturn. Although when
one hears, as I did last week, of accountants failing because more than
three quarters of their clients cannot pay, we have clearly reached grim
altitudes. It is the consumer debt ratios being still at their peak, a
housing market stuck in nervous debility and the funereal tone in which
bankers still discuss their prospects which show how far we still have to
go.

FT  13 JAN 92 / BT prices to come under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT may have to cut its prices more sharply than at present after a far
reaching review which starts this month.
The review will be the most comprehensive examination of the
telecommunications group's prices since it was privatised in 1984.
Other issues to be examined include which of the company's prices should be
controlled, how fast they should fall each year and whether there should be
an immediate large cut.
BT is currently required to cut the average price of a basket of its main
domestic and international services by 6.25 per cent a year after inflation.
Oftel, the industry regulator, plans to publish a consultative document to
start the examination at the end of this month. The document will be more
wide ranging and longer than a similar document produced four years ago when
BT's prices were last comprehensively reviewed.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director general, will be conducting the review
in a more highly charged political atmosphere than in 1988. Following a
Financial Times analysis last November, the Labour Party called for cuts in
BT's prices. The analysis showed that the company could reduce its charges
by Pounds 1bn a year and still make profits comparable with those of
telephone operators elsewhere in the world.
Sir Bryan, however, is expected to come under pressure from BT and its
competitors, such as Mercury Communications, to keep prices high. It is
easier for BT's rivals to compete if its charges are not reduced too
sharply.
Small investors who bought shares in the government's Pounds 5.6bn BT sale
last month will also have an interest in the prices staying high. Sir Bryan
may feel that they were adequately warned of the price review by his
statement in the BT prospectus.
The document, which is in an advanced stage of preparation, is understood to
address all issues which directly or indirectly affect the company's prices.
It will look at whether BT should be allowed to increase charges to
residential customers while reducing business tariffs and whether its
profits are excessive.
Issues which indirectly affect BT's prices include whether prices should
vary with the quality of the company's services and whether BT is investing
enough in upgrading its network. Oftel will also consider whether BT's
diversification into non-core businesses should be controlled to protect
customers from potentially unprofitable ventures.
Sir Bryan intends to be more open about the way in which he reaches his
conclusions than in previous price reviews, following criticism that earlier
reviews were negotiated behind closed doors.
The document will indicate Sir Bryan's preferences on some main issues. For
example, he believes that the broad principle of regulating prices rather
than profits is correct because this gives BT an incentive to improve its
efficiency.
After consultation, Sir Bryan will try to negotiate an agreement with BT. If
he is unable to reach agreement, he may refer the matter to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, which can impose a solution.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Fawlty idea of service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A New Year article of mine on the appalling standards of service in too many
British shops (Nightmare on Oxford Street, December 30) drew more
appreciative comment than any other piece of mine for years. I also received
useful tips on places which were an exception to the prevailing mediocrity.
So I shall now follow up with some comments on hotel service.
These articles are not a diversion. A distinguished economist named Albert
Hirschman wrote a book entitled Exit, Voice and Loyalty. Exit is the vital
weapon for dissatisfied consumers and workers in a competitive market. Voice
is, however, an important supplement. Loyalty comes last and has to be
earned.
The first sign that I should contemplate 'exit' is when I find only
thief-proof hangers. Words fail to describe the inconvenience of these
devices, which can only be moved with great effort and on which it is
impossible to hang clothes comfortably. How much extra would it add to room
costs to make an allowance for the likely loss of proper hangers to hanger
fetishists? In the last resort, why not provide as an alternative wire
hangers, which cost almost nothing? Nowadays, I normally carry a few, just
in case.
Another wrong assumption is that because there is a television set (normally
unplugged and difficult to operate), radio does not matter. Television
addicts may themselves find radio more convenient when getting up in the
morning or getting ready for bed. And even when a radio is provided (after I
complain to a so-called assistant manager, herself usually a bewildered girl
just out of training college) one is almost never able in the UK to get
Radio 3, and sometimes not even Radio 4.
Rooms are so often too hot or too cold, with no visible means of adjusting
the temperature. And sometimes when I do open a window, the structure is so
fragile that the glass panes break, thus exchanging equatorial for arctic
conditions. Supposedly more modern hotels often have windows which only open
by swinging an inch or two from the top. Almost as bad are the windows which
are meant either to open this way or to open out fully by a vertical turn,
but where it takes much learning and even more elbow grease to move from one
mode to another.
Many annoying defects merely represent fashions among hotel architects.
Somebody in the Bauhaus 70 years ago must have made a remark in favour of
flat surfaces, which has resulted in the banishment of useful devices like
hooks or even bathroom shelves.
One good rule of thumb is that the staff at the desk know nothing about the
locality, but regard their period there as a temporary and unwelcome exile
from the metropolis. A glance at a train timetable is a rare favour. As for
buses, one is looked on as mad for being remotely interested in such
vehicles. But it is simply untrue that everyone always arrives everywhere by
car.
I suppose that to expect enough light to be able to read or write is like
asking for the moon - or rather the sun. And there are rarely a chair and
simple table at which to write.
The worst hotel I have ever stayed in is in Munich. After having painfully
negotiated a later departure time there than the 11am one inflicted on
visitors, I found that this information was not communicated to the floor.
My belongings were packed without any attempt to find me or warn me, and -
most unforgivable of all - my telephone was cut off.
Behind this behaviour is a detestable habit of mind which expresses itself
in sentences such as 'Most people do not mind', or 'Most people don't ask
for'. What makes such behaviour possible is that such hotels do much of
their trade with business customers, who are out early and in late, and do
not spend much time in their rooms. But even such travellers would have a
better time if they were not treated as items of merchandise.
Consumers of the world unite: You have nothing to lose but a few rude words
and baleful stares.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Letter: Headhunting, the delusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUMPHREY STURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I found your report on Timothy Clark's study on headhunters and
recruitment consultants misleading ('Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted',
January 7). We are told that 'psychological tests' are good at predicting
job performance and that interviews and references are bad; also that
recruiters are finding the wrong candidates for top jobs.
Why then do recruiting consultants gain repeat business and why are the
executives they introduce not fired or transferred?
Perhaps because the recruiters do a good and necessary job. The assessment
of suitability is just one link in a chain which stretches from assessing
and advising on client needs and defining the job and model candidate to
checking on the progress of the candidate after appointment. Psychological
testing may have a part to play but this is more likely to be in
ascertaining aptitude or skills for junior and middle-ranked positions. For
a successful senior executive an aptitude test will be insulting, an
assessment centre group procedure destructive of confidentiality, and a
personality inventory, while yielding points on style, will not help in
determining whether the person will perform well in the job.
This key question is the one that the recruiter will seek to answer by
looking at the candidate's achievements in positions making comparable
demands. The curriculum vitae and the interview story must be checked (by
telephone) with the former employer(s). The reference is also needed to
reveal 'showstoppers' such as alcoholism, which tests and interviews
typically do not. Talks with former colleagues and subordinates should add
other useful information.
The time and skills needed to do a thorough recruiting job justify the
headhunter's fee and to pretend there is a short cut is to foster a
delusion.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Letter: CEOs are economically crucial - so pay the
successful ones even more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LEO HERZEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Hurry home, Mr Bush' (January 8), you quite
properly caution against Japan-bashing in the US. You then go on to
criticise chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in the US as too high
in comparison to CEO salaries in Japan, as follows: 'The fact that the
average US CEO earns 125 times the annual remuneration of a manufacturing
worker, compared to just 16 times in Japan, is one indication of the
contrast.'
The reasoning behind this criticism appears to be that Japanese
manufacturing companies are more successful in global markets than US
manufacturers; CEO compensation in Japan is lower than CEO compensation in
the US; therefore, lower CEO compensation in the US would be better.
This is a highly doubtful recommendation for the US and probably also for
the UK. It is true that unsuccessful CEOs in the US are paid too much and,
even more important, are allowed to stay on too long. On the other hand,
there are good reasons for believing that successful CEOs in the US usually
are paid too little. The problem in the US is that CEO compensation and
retention in employment generally do not respond enough to performance.
Some simple examples should make these points clearer. Top opera stars,
virtuoso violinists and orchestra conductors are paid huge amounts because
even very small differences in performance can result in very large
differences in economic outcomes for music promoters.
CEOs, because of the economically crucial nature of their jobs, have a much
more important effect on society. Stockholders and society in the US and UK
probably would benefit enormously from paying successful CEOs more and
eliminating unsuccessful ones more quickly. A similar point of view is
presented in more detail with some highly revealing statistics on the
subject in CEO incentives - it's not how much you pay but how, by Michael C.
Jensen and Kevin G. Murphy in the Harvard Business Review, May-June, 1990.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The beginning of a Balkan endgame: The war in Croatia may be
at an end, but that does not necessarily spell peace in what used to be
Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This Wednesday, European Community governments will decide whether to
recognise the four out of six Yugoslav republics that have applied for
recognition as independent states. After Germany's decision to recognise
Slovenia and Croatia before Christmas, it is likely most EC countries will
follow suit. The Community may even extend recognition to the
ethnically-mixed republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia.
Recognition of any of the republics will mean a number of things. First,
Yugoslavia as a state of diverse ethnic groups, religions, alphabets, and
languages that were welded together after the second world war, will de
jure, as well as de facto, cease to exist. Second, recognition will open a
new phase in the country's civil war, in which the gaps between the
republics - in terms of economic development and political stability - will
widen substantially. Third, it will highlight the increasing problems within
Serbia, the republic that set out to take control of what used to be
Yugoslavia and has ended up sowing discord throughout the former federation.
Recognition of the republics goes hand in hand with two processes aimed at
bringing lasting peace to the country. On the one hand, the Community is
persisting with its peace conference on Yugoslavia, despite last week's
shooting down by the Yugoslav air force of a helicopter carrying EC
ceasefire monitors in which five of them died. On the other, the United
Nations is preparing to send 10,000 peace-keeping troops to Croatia if the
latest ceasefire - the fifteenth since the civil war began last summer -
holds.
The chances that the ceasefire, arranged by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, 10
days ago, will hold are high. Unlike on previous occasions, when all sides
had an interest in continuing the fighting on Croat territory, some of the
participants at least may now have a stake in trying to make it stick.
Croatia, having broken many previous ceasefires, has abided by the latest
one partly because it wants to speed up recognition. Serbia has supported it
because Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the republic's president, faces a growing
anti-war movement at home. The army has backed it, not because it no longer
has the stomach to fight, but because, as officers now admit, it has lost
the struggle to keep the old Yugoslavia together.
All sides in the conflict have even agreed to the deployment of UN
peace-keeping troops. But are these developments genuine grounds for
optimism about a lasting peace? The key to stability lies in guaranteeing
what used to be the internal borders of the old Yugoslav federation. These
could be undermined from three quarters: Mr Milosevic, Serb nationalist
leaders outside Serbia, and the army. The current lull could still be the
prelude to a final storm.
For the first time since his rise to power in October 1987, Mr Milosevic
appears vulnerable. He is losing credibility among Serbs because he has
turned his republic into an international pariah; he is presiding over a
near-bankrupt economy; and the war that is in part his creation is
increasingly resented, particularly by the younger generation.
Observers in other republics, who have obsessively analysed Mr Milosevic's
every move in recent months, sense he is in real trouble. 'Everything
Milosevic touches, he destroys,' said Mr Jelko Kacin, Slovenia's minister of
information. 'He has destroyed the country which he wanted to dominate,'
agrees Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
By trying to make Serbia the dominant force in Yugoslavia, Mr Milosevic
precipitated not only the independence moves by Slovenia and Croatia, but
the violent disintegration of the Yugoslav federation. By using the army to
defend the ethnic Serbs in Croatia, and stem Croatia's independence, he has
turned the professional, non-nationalist wing of the army against him.
Moreover, except through repression, he has failed to control the ethnic
Albanian dominated province of Kosovo which he forcibly re-integrated into
Serbia two years ago. He now faces a rebellion from the region's 2m
Albanians. In other words, in the process of trying to reawaken Serb
nationalism, he has simply fomented hatred between Serbs and the other
ethnic groups.
'But do not be deceived,' said Mr Kacin in Slovenia. 'We are dealing with
the Balkans where nothing is predictable. Milosevic is mercurial. We have
written him off too many times in the past, and before we know it he is
scheming again.'
The most recent version of Mr Milosevic's grand design is to make Serbia the
core of a successor state to Yugoslavia. This state would include the tiny
republic of Montenegro, the region of eastern Slavonia in eastern Croatia,
and even parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina. As part of that plan, Mr Radovan
Karadzic, head of Bosnia's 1.3m Serbs, last week declared a republic of
Serbs in Bosnia after Moslem and Croat communities applied for recognition
by the EC.
'All Serbs should live together,' said Mr Karadzic, who is a close ally of
the Serbian president. 'We do not want to live in an independent republic.
We want to have a state for the Serbs, even if it means living in a smaller
Yugoslavia.'
Mr Karadzic, and leaders in Serbia, say this state could be created by
changing Yugoslavia's internal borders. In a letter written to the
arbitration commission that was set up by the EC peace conference to examine
the status of Yugoslavia's internal borders, Mr Branko Kostic,
vice-president of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav presidency, described the
country's internal boundaries as 'purely administrative', implying they can
be changed.
'It has never been established who actually drew up these borders,' Mr
Kostic wrote in a letter to Mr Robert Badinter, president of France's
constitutional court, and a member of the arbitration commission.
'They do not meet internationally recognised, legal, constitutional and
legitimate conditions for gaining the status of borders of independent and
sovereign states.'
Mr Kostic even warned that unilateral recognition of the borders of Croatia
and Bosnia-Hercegovina by western governments 'would solve nothing but would
only serve to exacerbate further relations and would result in fresh armed
clashes and the escalation of the existing conflicts.'
For its part, the arbitration commission has argued that the internal
borders are state borders, and it is only those boundaries which will be
recognised by the EC. It says that in law no one state has the right to be
the successor to Yugoslavia.
Mr Mahmutcehajic, Bosnia's deputy prime minister, says that any change in
the former federation's internal boundaries would lead to more instability.
He argues that a redrawing of Bosnia-Hercegovina's borders would mean a
possibly violent break-up of the republic, the most ethnically mixed of them
all: the west of the republic, inhabited by many Croats, would want to unite
with Croatia, and nationalist Serbs living in the northern swathe of the
republic would want to unite with Serbia. And that would leave a large
number of people politically homeless.
'The Moslems, (which make up 44 per cent of the 4.3m population) would be
without a republic,' said Mr Mahmutcehajic. 'How can you realistically carve
up Bosnia when mixed ethnic communities are scattered throughout the
republic? It would lead to terrible bloodshed.'
Any redrawing of the republic's borders would also affect Macedonia, whose
sizeable Albanian minority might be tempted to unite with Kosovo, while
Greece and Bulgaria could become embroiled over historic claims to the
republic. Even Montenegro, which wants more access to the sea, has staked an
historic claim to the Croat peninsula of Prevlaka on the Dalmatian coast.
Bosnian officials believe Mr Milosevic will persist in trying to create this
new Yugoslavia, provided he has the support of the army. General Blagoje
Adzic, the new defence minister who was appointed last week in the wake of
the EC helicopter incident, may back the president's plan. He is a hardline
Serb nationalist who still harbours a deep personal resentment against
Croatia - all his family were killed by the Nazi-backed Croat forces, the
Ustashas, during the second world war.
Moreover, since Yugoslavia has now ceased to exist, the army is seeking a
raison d'etre - and it is finding it in Serb nationalism.
'The army is now relying on Serbia. The army has been humiliated. If
Milosevic does not look after it, the military could turn against him,' said
Mr Hido Biscevic, editor of Vjesnik, the influential Croat daily.
Mr Stjepan Kluijic, leader of Bosnia's Croats, believes steps must be taken
to stop the army. 'It must be prevented from carving up Bosnia-Hercegovina,
and from assisting Mr Milosevic in trying to make Serbia and its allies the
successor to Yugoslavia. That is why we need the UN troops to be stationed
in Bosnia.'
Fears that the army and Mr Milosevic will turn their attention away from the
northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia to the southern republics explain
why Bosnian and Macedonian officials are lobbying in western countries for
recognition.
The EC's decision on Wednesday on whether to grant it will have a big
influence on what happens next in the war. Recognition of Bosnia and
Macedonia would legitimise their borders with Croatia and Serbia, and would
strengthen their hand in securing help from the UN. But recognition might
also provoke Serbia into stepping up its intervention in Bosnia itself.
'The war in Croatia may be coming to an end,' said Mr Mahmutcehajic, 'but we
must not delude ourselves into believing Mr Milosevic, or the Serbian army
will quietly retreat. We must not delude ourselves into believing peace has
arrived.'

FT  13 JAN 92 / Letter: Time has come for the purpose of NEDO and other
British quangos to be re-examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You should not be surprised that the National Economic Development
Office sends the policy debate to sleep. That is what the present government
wants it to do.
The party which was supposedly opposed to quangos has kept some (British
Overseas Trade Board and NEDC/NEDO) and actually created others, including
the absurd Training and Enterprise Councils. They are created by and/or
turned into creatures of the government, so that they feed back its
prejudices rather than tell it what industry really thinks. There was clear
pressure on NEDO to do so while I was its industrial director, although at
that time (1980-84) we did manage to resist. But the pressure was later
increased and government has used this feed-back to promote the idea that
industry supports its policies.
The purpose of these quangos should be re-examined. Other countries which
are more economically successful manage the relationship between government
and industry through independent trade associations and chambers of industry
and commerce, and any government which really wanted to listen to industry
rather than wag its palsied finger at it would do so.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Letter: International audit comparison falls into trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN R MCNEIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, International comparisons offer notorious elephant traps. Andrew Jack's
article, 'UK auditors charge more but take longer to report' (December 28),
based on a published survey, is guilty of not comparing like with like.
The survey provided data on audit fees for only 10 countries, whereas full
information was available on the length of time companies take to report.
Thus the comparison of fees excludes, inter alia, the US, Canada, Japan and
the whole of Europe (except for the UK and the Irish Republic). A comparison
of audit fees charged in G7 countries would be much more telling than the
one we are offered between developed and developing economies.
On the comparison of reporting lags, it is the company, not the auditor,
that is responsible for the reporting process and therefore for the
timetable. The implication of the article, that companies produce their
financial statements and then wait with varying degrees of patience for the
auditors to start work, is incorrect. An indication of the delay that the
audit process builds into the reporting process would indeed be interesting,
but is probably not measurable and is certainly not available.
Audit fees are based on a complex mix of factors, such as the intricacy of
the company's business, the strength of its controls, the quality of the
staff needed to carry out the audit, and so on. Mr Jack's article omitted
one of the most interesting conclusions of the survey: that in Australia and
the UK - the largest industrialised countries in the fee sample - companies
in similar industries tended to pay 'very similar' audit fees. 'The audit
services industry is very competitive in large industrialised countries,'
the survey concludes.

IBM's drive to become meaner and leaner is not confined to its marketing and
research.
The group's employees in Canada have just learned they are soon to lose one
of those little perks that helped Big Blue to build its legendary reputation
for cradle-to-grave paternalism. The 50-year-old IBM Country Club north of
Toronto has been put up for sale.
Once a buyer is found, it will be farewell to an 18-hole golf course, pro
shop, bowling green, baseball diamond, soccer field, tennis courts,
children's playground and even gardening plots which have helped to keep the
IBM family together over the years. At present about 15,000 IBM workers and
retired staff in Canada enjoy the subsidised amenities.
According to chief executive Bill Etherington, the sale 'should send another
clear signal that IBM Canada is determined to create a more competitive,
aggressive company.'
At the cost, perhaps, of having a bunch of grumpy, unfit employees.

Stand down Concorde. The good news is that Lord White's court appointment in
Colorado in just over a fortnight need not stop him from attending Hanson's
annual general meeting the same day. The district attorney's office in Aspen
says White's attorneys can re- present him first time out.
The less good news for White is that Jim Wilson, Aspen's deputy DA, still
hasn't made up his mind whether to push on with assault charges. Tom
Dalessandri, number two in Aspen's police department, is continuing
investigations.
True, White's young girlfriend Victoria Tucker has retracted the
allegations. But Colorado takes domestic violence issues seriously - which
is why the DA's office, and not the victim, has responsibility for deciding
whether or not to proceed with a case.
Although the sporty lord is no stranger to the gossip columns, even he would
not relish having to defend his private life in a US court. So he can hardly
be sleeping easier for the thought that an ambitious DA might decide to
proceed against him.
What's more, a counter-suit against the Aspen police department would only
prolong the embarrassment.

Meanwhile French state-owned car-maker Renault is beefing up its image with
a heavier look to its logo. From now on, the Renault lozenge will be in
three dimensions, rather than two, and be given a thick chunky appearance,
which the group trusts will convey an 'ideal of quality, efficiency and
value.'
The changed badge will make its first appearance with the launch of the
company's new executive model, the Safrane, and all offices and showrooms
will adopt the reshaped emblem in due time.
Why all the bother? The aim is to show the 'change of soul and image of the
company,' says its chairman Raymond Levy in an internal memo.
It could also be something to do with Renault's 1990 alliance with Volvo,
Sweden's maker of chunky family cars. The pair have always denied planning a
common car. But it seems, at least, that the French partner is bringing its
image more in line with its Swedish friend's solidity.

On the other hand, an ex-colleague of Iacocca takes a different view of the
trade question. Gruff Bob McCurry, now executive vice president of Toyota's
US motor-sales operations, observed that whenever he went to Washington in
these Japan-bashing days, he felt like the subject of an advertisement he'd
seen in his local paper.
It read: 'Lost dog. One eye, three legs, no tail, neutered. Answers to

Grace before lunch took a somewhat unconventional form at the Detroit
Economic Club's celebration of this weekend's opening of the city's motor
show. The club chaplain began the proceedings with a short prayer for
increased production and profits.
It proved an apt appetiser for a fighting speech by Chrysler chairman Lee
Iacocca, fresh off the plane from Tokyo, urging protection for the US motor
industry, which won him a standing ovation.
'Hell, I didn't go to Japan to help open the rice market. The last time I
looked, we don't grow any rice in Detroit,' declared the head of the
smallest of America's big three car-makers.
'When Detroit gets stiffed on autos, then America gets stiffed on trade -
period,' he went on. 'That's because cars are America's rice. Any argument
for protecting Japan's rice farmers is an argument for completely shutting
Japan out of our auto market.'
Even so, he did not want to go quite that far. 'I'm really a free trader.
The thing I want to protect is free trade. And the way you do that is to
retaliate against those who don't believe in it. And if there's anyone here
who thinks Japan practises free trade, I've got some S&amp;L's I'd like to sell
you.'
There were no takers.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Mass higher education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE mid-1960s Britain had 32 universities and 220,000 full-time students.
On current projections, it will end the century with 80 universities and 1m
students. In the 1990s alone, student numbers are set to rise by almost
two-thirds, with the proportion of 18-year-olds proceeding to higher
education rising from 19 per cent to 32 per cent. It is an educational
revolution, by any standards.
Ignore the prophets of doom predicting dilution and disaster: they said much
the same in the 1950s, were dismissed at the time, and have been proved
wrong since. But it would be no less misguided to ignore the serious
implications of expansion for the higher education system. Two stand out:
the emergence of a new university hierarchy, and the issue of funding future
growth.
Ending the so-called 'binary divide' between polytechnics and universities
will not produce a unified higher education system. On the contrary, taken
together with current changes in the direction of research funding, it will
herald a new and deep division between institutions engaging in teaching and
research, and those charged with teaching alone. Only some 15 universities
can expect to be in the new 'ivy league' of elite institutions: the rest
will be essentially teaching colleges, whatever their titles.
For all the likely cries from the dispossessed, this is to be welcomed. It
will relate research funding more closely to research quality, and ought to
encourage the 'ivy league' to devote more attention to graduate courses,
which remain distinctly under-developed in Britain. However, some leading
universities may need persuading, through stronger funding incentives, that
their contribution to university teaching should be more than serving as
finishing schools for bright sixth formers.
Funding problem
Funding is altogether more problematic. Crudely, higher education spending
for the current year will total about Pounds 4.5bn, of which nearly Pounds
1bn will go on student financial support for fees and maintenance. If
spending were to increase in line with student numbers, it would rise by
some Pounds 1.6bn (at today's prices) by 2000, with an extra Pounds 350m on
student maintenance. Research funding could be held down and repayment of
loans will reduce the last figure somewhat, but that is the order of
addition on current trends.
Does higher education justify that much extra - roughly equivalent to the
entire budgets for prisons and overseas aid? Put differently, how favoured
should universities be in the scramble for extra education cash? Other
public services are clamouring for more funds; within education, demands at
the nursery and 16-19 level are acute - and popular with the electorate.
Greater efficiency
There is, of course, room for greater efficiency all round. Polytechnics
have led the way in working existing assets harder, while many universities
now generate large sums from private sources. Institutions could raise still
more of their own cash; their lecture halls could be opened longer and
filled fuller; even the sacred long vacation could, perhaps, be turned into
an extra term to spread the load.
But such methods alone will not support a mass system. They will, on the
other hand, impose a greater strain on academic staff, and increase pressure
to raise their pay - which, in relative terms, fell sharply in the 1980s.
School teachers now have an independent pay review body. The case for
extending it to lecturers is almost unanswerable - but will only further
increase higher education spending.
That leaves students. By international standards, state financial support
for British students is exceptionally generous. The government's loans
scheme may not be the best way to encourage greater student contributions to
their studies. But those opposed to it need to be frank about the extent of
their prospective largesse on behalf of the taxpayer, particularly if fees
are to continue to be paid in full by the state. Unless, of course, prisons
and overseas aid are to be abolished.
This is the last in a series on British education policy.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The little things that mean a lot: Inadequate provision of
childcare remains one of the biggest obstacles to women's career
opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr John Major, the prime minister, recently used the term 'social
revolution' to describe the changed role of women in the UK workforce, he
was not exaggerating. While mothers in the 1950s were widely expected to
stay at home to look after the children, today nearly two-thirds work. The
difficulty for these women is that there has been no corresponding
revolution in the provision of childcare.
Relatively few men consider that combining career, marriage and children
will pose dilemmas, said Mr Major last October at the launch of Opportunity
2000, the business-backed initiative to improve the position of women in the
workforce. But for women, he said, 'these three simple human ambitions are
still hard to combine'.
What makes them tough to reconcile for some women is the difficulty of
finding affordable and reliable childcare. Ms Jane Oakley, a former
high-flying civil servant and the mother of an eight-year-old and a
six-year-old, gave up full-time work when arrangements for the care of her
children broke down. She is now looking for a part-time job that will fit in
with her children's school hours. 'But what sort of 9.30-2.30 job am I going
to get that will be challenging and interesting? Filling shelves in a
supermarket is all that seems to fit the hours.'
The loss to the civil service of her skills, and the wasted expense of
training, is mirrored throughout industry as mothers take part-time, local
jobs that fail to make best use of their qualifications and abilities.
The economic advantages of greater public investment in nurseries and
after-school care have been strongly argued by the Institute for Public
Policy Research. This left-leaning think tank calculates that the cost to
the state of providing childcare facilities would be outweighed by increased
tax paid by mothers on higher earnings. An added advantage would be cuts in
social security benefits because single parents, in particular, would return
to the work force.
A further consideration is that, in addition to these economic benefits, the
improvement of childcare could help advance the role of women in the work
force.
According to Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC): 'Lack of childcare remains one of the major barriers to equality of
opportunity for women, inhibiting their access to training and good
employment prospects.'
The position is particularly acute in the UK, where state support for
childcare is minimal compared with the public contribution made in other
European Community countries (see panel). The difficulties for women in the
UK are compounded by the level of paid maternity entitlement which is,
again, among the lowest in the EC.
Regulated daycare is available for less than 8 per cent of children under
five in the UK. Instead, women rely on a mass of ad hoc arrangements. Women
like Ms Rosemary Lindley, a primary school teacher, who swaps care for her
three children with a neighbour who also works part-time. 'When I'm not
working, I'm carting around a load of kids - my own and someone else's.
There's absolutely no break,' she says.
Relatives, mainly grandmothers, are the mainstay of the system, although
there are signs that even these arrangements are beginning to break down.
The extended family may be dispersed geographically, and grandmothers
themselves are increasingly likely to want to work.
Outside the informal network of friends, neighbours and relations, the
options are limited by availability or cost:
Nannies and private day nurseries, where they exist, eat up disproportionate
amounts of women's earnings in all but the highest-income households. The
cost of a daily nanny is likely to be Pounds 100-Pounds 200 a week,
depending on location in the UK. A full-day place at a private nursery in
London may cost Pounds 150 a week. State and voluntary-sector provision,
where it exists, is either part-time or restricted to those children
considered by social workers to be 'in need'.
Nursery schooling, provided free by local education authorities, is the main
plank of public provision, with about a quarter of the UK's three- and
four-year-olds now in nursery education. While this may sound encouraging,
it should be remembered that there is virtually no public provision at all
for children under the age of three. Moreover, most nursery schools offer
only half-day sessions, lasting two and a half hours at most, for the
limited school year.
Childminders provide the most readily available form of childcare, apart
from relatives. Registered minders provide places for an estimated 5 per
cent of children up to the age of four. The National Childminding
Association recommends a minimum weekly fee of Pounds 50, although there are
local variations.
Registration of childminders is supposed to be by the local authority social
services department, although IPPR calculates that at least one in five
minders is not registered. Long waiting lists for registration are reported,
as are failures by many local authorities to provide satisfactory
monitoring.
Playgroups, parent-and-toddler groups and creches usually require parental
involvement and tend not to cover the sort of hours required to enable a
parent to go out to work.
The problem is not solved as children reach school age. Schools finish in
the middle of the afternoon; and for 175 out of 365 days, schoolchildren are
on holiday. 'Latch-key kids' among the older age group may have to fend for
themselves during the school holidays and in the time between the end of the
school day and the return of a parent from work. Some estimates put the
proportion of unsupervised primary school-age children as high as 30 per
cent.
Women like Ms Celia Muldoon - who works a full day as a secretary and leaves
her nine- and 10-year-old boys alone for an hour after school - says paying
for childcare would eat into her earnings. 'It's tough. I just have to take
the chance that they'll be alright in the house on their own,' she says.
It could be argued that what she and others like her need is increased
flexibility in working hours rather than increased provision and
co-ordination of childcare on a national level. Indeed, in his Opportunity
2000 speech the prime minister made no mention at all of childcare but
pleaded, instead, with employers to increase the number of part-time jobs
and facilities such as career breaks.
More flexible hours and part-time working would certainly be welcomed by
women. However, without fundamental changes in attitudes by society to the
status of part-time workers, it is doubtful whether any significant
improvements could be made in women's earnings or promotion prospects if
this route is chosen. In most organisations, few things are more likely to
kill a career than moving from full-time to part-time work. There is still
widespread belief in industry that no position of any responsibility can be
held by anyone other than a very full-time worker.
If public, private and voluntary sector childcare remains skeletal, what
about employers' provision? Government statements and recent press reports
might give the impression that workplace nurseries are flourishing -
springing up from employers' fears about projected labour shortages and
being nurtured by government tax concessions. This impression would be
mistaken.
Certainly, employers in the late 1980s had intended to take practical steps,
including providing childcare, to recruit and retain women. But the
recession has intervened. The latest survey by Working for Childcare, the
voluntary group, found that there are just 350 workplace nurseries in the
UK. Even the leader in the field, Midland Bank, which pays for some places
at 130 nurseries, has had to cut back its original goal of involvement in
300. Other employers have simply abandoned or postponed their plans for
nurseries.
One reason is that many companies have found the costs of setting up and
running nurseries prohibitive. Littlewoods, the retail group, for example,
has announced that it is to be part of a joint venture to establish a
40-place nursery near its headquarters in Liverpool. Mr John Moores, a
Littlewoods director, calculates that it will probably be necessary to
charge about Pounds 50 a week for a place at the nursery - a hefty
proportion of a shop worker's weekly wage of about Pounds 150.
Mr Moores told Mr Major at the launch of Opportunity 2000 that he, like
other employers, wanted to increase the number of childcare places but
needed a financial contribution from the government.
The EOC argues that the consensus of opinion is swinging around to favour a
systematic approach to the care of young children in the UK. Says the EOC:
'Parents are clearly ready to contribute within their means, as are
employers, although . . . employers are generally not in a position to, and
are not going to, foot the bill alone.
'Everyone is waiting for a lead from government.'

The UK's laissez-faire stance on childcare means it has more in common with
the US than with its neighbours in Europe, according to an Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development study, writes Diane Summers.
In both the UK and the US, there is limited public provision, aimed
primarily at 'welfare' targets - for example, single mothers and
disadvantaged children. For the rest of the population, childcare is seen
largely as a private affair. One important difference is that in the US -
and not in the UK - parents can offset a proportion of childcare costs
against their income tax.
At the opposite extreme of provision - and cost to the public purse - are
the Nordic countries, which view childcare policy as an area of state
responsibility. The overall objective is for childcare to be available to
all who want it.
In these countries the private sector also plays an important part in
providing childcare services. In Denmark and Norway, 40 per cent of all
centres are private ventures. These are closely regulated, and the state
pays between a third and a half of the costs.
Within the European Community, tax relief is allowed for about a third of
countries, according to the European Commission. The Netherlands has
abandoned relief and diverted funds instead to boosting public provision.
The UK and Ireland, the European Commission notes, are exceptional in the EC
for not including the children of employed parents as priority groups when
it comes to access to publicly provided services, and for limiting these
services to 'at risk' children.
Apart from Denmark, which has by far the highest public provision in the EC,
France and Belgium are the EC leaders. There is least provision in the UK,
Ireland and the Netherlands.
Throughout the EC, the part played by private and employer-run nurseries is
small, providing places for fewer than 2 per cent of children under the age
of three, according to a Commission survey.
Overall, the Commission concludes, there is 'evidence of substantial unmet
need for publicly funded services throughout Europe, mainly for children
under three and outside school hours care for over-threes'.

If you prefer factual programmes tonight's the night. Horizon (8.10 BBC2)
investigates the increasing use of natural predators and parasites in pest
control in preference to the chemicals which have been so heavily used in
the past 50 years. Not only do pests develop resistence to chemical
controls, but the poisons often reach human consumers. However, as
Australia's plague of cane toads demonstrates, not all man's attempts at
exploiting predators are successful.
In Britain feral mink, the subject of Wildlife On One (8.30), are loathed
almost as much as cane toads in Australia. Originally imported from the US
to be farmed for the fur trade, they have returned to the wild, colonised
most of the country, and are now reputed to be our most ferocious mammal. In
a postponed programme World In Action (8.30 ITV) reports how the Japanese
are logging all the hardwood out of Borneo while protecting their own
timber. Channel 4 begins what is claimed to be the definitive series on The
Falklands War in four parts (9.00). Panorama (9.30 BBC1) looks at death in
the workplace in Britain and the way that managements almost invariably
emerge unscathed.

Occasionally, very occasionally, things get better.  This celebrated English
National Opera show, probably the most widely admired and influential Handel
opera staging of the 1980s, has returned after a three-year interval for its
latest revival - and affords three-and-a-half hours of purest delight, a
pleasure and a boon which in the grey days of January only the most
determined puritans will be able to deny themselves.
The Nicholas Hytner production, an infinitely ingenious and sophisticated
meeting of late-1730s taste and late-20th-century theatrical legerdemain, is
expertly revived by Julia Hollander. Far from having dimmed or dated, as
yesterday's chic successes are wont to do, it gleams and glistens with wit,
intelligence, comic sparkle and a deep sympathy with the absurd intricacies
of human passion. The work, a late-Handel mixture of musical-comedy
lightness and opera seria depth, comes across as a sui generis masterpiece,
Mozartian, Shakespearean and Handelian all in one go.
The slight air of archness which the production carried when new, in 1985,
has completely disappeared. This must be because the original cast members
(Ann Murray, Christopher Robson, Jean Rigby, Christopher Booth-Jones) have
sunk themselves wonderfully deep inside their words and their music, and the
newcomers (Yvonne Kenny, Rosa Mannion, Norman Bailey) are all absolute
experts in this delicate mesh of vocal and dramatic style.
Anyone who assumes Mr Bailey can only do noble veterans is in for the
happiest of surprises - his red-faced, thigh-slapping military man is a
perfect silly-ass cameo, and agilely sung to boot. One despairs, indeed, of
doing justice to the cast - each member merits long hymns of praise. Miss
Murray (Xerxes) speaks volumes with the subtlest of glances and vocal
inflections (but she's a little short on chest-register power in her final
showpiece). Miss Kenny (Romilda, in utterly ravishing, heart-melting voice)
and Miss Mannion (Atalanta) are enchantingly well-constrasted as fair elder
and deceitful young sister.
Mr Robson's penetrative countertenor and bluff, frank manner make a bold
match with Arsamenes's emotional upheavals. And though Miss Rigby's rich
mezzo sounded a touch clouded (an unannounced cold?), her faithful,
tender-hearted Amastris seems warmer and lovelier than ever.
The conductor is Ivor Bolton; this is his house debut. The touch is gentler,
softer, more leisurely and lingering than that of his sparkling predecessor,
Charles Mackerras. On Friday not every slow tempo seemed ideally judged or
sustained. Yet the unique flavour of the opera and the production was
communicated with marvellous acuteness. In a word, unmissable.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Arts: Tchaikovsky as artist and man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND JOHN WILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Tchaikovsky: The Final Years 1885-1893 (Gollancz 1991, 527 pp Pounds
45), David Brown completes the most extensive survey of that composer's life
and works yet written in English. In bulk, Brown's four volumes fall short
of Modeste Tchaikovsky's massive Life of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, issued at
the turn of this century, but Brown far outstrips the composer's brother in
musical insight and evenhandedness.
Brown's scholarly virtues continue to enliven the latest volume with his
sensitive integration of life and art, and acquainting the reader with
Tchaikovsky's neglected capital works. His discussion of the opera The
Enchantress is exemplary in this respect, one of several analyses richer and
more thoughtful than those found in the earlier volumes.
For the most part Brown eschews extraordinary interpretations of
Tchaikovsky's personal life and deals with evidence from available sources
as it stands. He sees Tchaikovsky's later years as full of constant
interruptions from compositional pursuits, which in turn bespeak the
extraordinary discipline and energy behind the creation of the Fifth and
Sixth Symphonies, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Queen of Spades.
From this vantage point the composer emerges more charitable than
self-centered - financing a village school, arranging for the adoption of
his niece's illegitimate son, using his prestige and money on behalf of
other artists. Tchaikovsky's acquaintances with the young Richard Strauss,
Gustav Mahler and Ferrucio Busoni clarify his place in the continuity of
western music, here in a clearer and more satisfying way than in other
accounts.
Since Volume I of his Tchaikovsky appeared in 1978, Brown has surely
experienced and obviously resisted pressures to yield to the latest fashions
of historiography. He appeals to readers who like their Tchaikovsky in the
grand tradition, untainted by deconstruction, Marxism, feminism, or those
analysts for whom historical context is irrelevant and the works' autonomous
greatness a fiction. Psycho-sexual interpretation is a part of this nouveau
vague, replete with hints of the sensational, judging from a young
musicologist in Chicago recently who argued that Schubert's 'Unfinished'
Symphony was a record of its composer's being raped as a child by his
father.
While not so extreme as this, Alexander Poznansky's Tchaikovsky; The Quest
for the Inner Man (New York: Schirmer, 1991, 679 pp, Dollars 39.951) is a
counterpoint to Brown's book which seeks to put the record straight on the
long-known and occasionally controversial topic of Tchaikovsky's sexuality.
Poznansky's premises are unassailable: that a scrutiny of this kind is
pertinent and overdue, and that sundry hands have attempted to purge
Tchaikovsky's correspondence of references to homosexuality.
We learn from the book that Poznansky was born in Russia, graduated from
Leningrad University, and is now living in the US. There is no mention of
his specialty, leaving open to question the relationship of his credentials
to those of professionally trained psychoanalysts, such as Maynard Solomon
and Alan Tyson, who also study the lives of composers. This question aside,
Poznansky's book reflects a diligent scrutiny of published sources,
including Tchaikovsky's rare Letters to Relatives.
Poznansky's is an exhaustive account of Tchaikovsky's life consisting mostly
of the composer's quotations, which he glosses to highlight the details of
Tchaikovsky's sexual urges. This is the book's major preoccupation, as if
the inner man were not formed as well by religious belief, worldly fame,
artistic sensitivities and friendships based on considerations other than
sex. Poznansky relies heavily on his own interpretations of words in the
texts he quotes,his conjectural restoration of expurgations, and outright
speculation, most of which are persuasively presented if unverifiable.
Yet Poznansky offers some fine insights. Whatever the folly whereby
Tchaikovsky thought his marriage might succeed, the bulk of his marital
agony derived as much from the fact that his wife was deranged as from any
fear of exposure. Poznansky also corrects the impression of some widely
misinterpreted alphabet letters in Tchaikovsky's diaries, thought to refer
to homosexual urges but probably connoting the near-irrepressible anger
which sometimes came over Tchaikovsky while playing cards.
For all its virtues, the book is myopic and far-flung, wavering
uncomfortably between somewhat inconsistent vantage points. We are asked to
accept that Tchaikovsky was neurotically afraid of his homosexuality being
exposed, but also that Russians of all social strata in Tchaikovsky's day
treated homosexuality as an open secret. In this connection Nadezhda von
Meck becomes an almost Russellesque caricature, whose puritanical views
about sex would bring an end to Tchaikovsky's subsidy if he were discovered.
Yet in reality it seems unlikely that a woman who endured 18 pregnancies,
ran a multi-million-rouble business, patronised art and travelled widely,
would be quite such a prude.
Poznansky does not allow the Tchaikovsky-Meck friendship to stand on its
merits, a remarkable blend of practical earthly generosity and idealistic
escape from earthly travail. But he concedes, in retrospect, that Meck
probably knew about Tchaikovsky's sexual orientation for many years while
this extraordinary flirtation was being carried on.
On one point - Tchaikovsky's death - Poznansky and Brown exchange places.
Brown persists in advancing the psycho-sexual hypothesis that Tchaikovsky's
death was a suicide forced upon him when a homosexual liaison threatened to
be exposed. The traditional view, that he died of cholera after drinking
unboiled water, is part of an elaborate conspiracy to disguise the facts.
Poznansky, who has refuted this interpretation elsewhere, accepts that
Tchaikovsky died from cholera and dismisses the conspiracy as one of many
unfounded and bizarre speculations. What is indisputable about Tchaikovsky's
death is that the facts are unknown and the implications of his final
illness murky. What is notable in these accounts is the retrenchment of
their authors from more vehement stands taken in earlier publications.
Perhaps this contentious point is imploding upon itself, a sign that
disparate strands of Tchaikovsky's biography are moving towards an uneasy
consonance.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Arts: The death of a visionary - Architecture / The work of
the late Roger Ferri
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a city where one in every 53 of the population is now deemed to be HIV
positive, the recent death of one young architect may be seen as a blip on
the hospital computer screens. New York now 'lives with AIDS' and last week
it was my grim duty to speak at a memorial service and attend a requiem mass
for the soul of an architect friend, Roger Ferri, who has died of AIDS aged
only 42.
AIDS is reaping a rich and untimely harvest, particularly among the
'artistic community' in many countries, but it does seem to have had the
most devastating results in New York. There are, of course, hundreds of
unrecorded deaths from this plague, but it is the tally of workers in the
arts and architecture that especially concerns me.
For an architect to be stricken with AIDS there are especial problems. In
many cases there is a conspiracy of silence made necessary to ensure the
continuation of a flow of work into the office. When the reputation of an
office or studio depends on the design talent of one person - which is often
the case - and that person is affected by the virus, all work can easily dry
up. Roger Ferri almost needed to wear a disguise as his condition worsened
over four years and he struggled to maintain a flow of work. The stress of
this way of living (and dying) is hard to imagine.
What was it that made Ferri's short career so remarkable? From the beginning
his training marked him out as an unusual kind of architect. It was the kind
of training that is slowly being adopted again as architects are forced to
realise the artistic poverty of much of their work. After an orthodox
architectural training at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Ferri studied figure
drawing, anatomy and painting at the Art Students League of New York. It
must have been this solid background of artistic training that made Ferri's
drawing style so remarkable. He realised that drawing was the key to
architecture, even in these mechanistic days.
It was his drawing skill that gave him his first serious break. The curator
of architecture and design at New York's Museum of Modern Art invited him,
with others, to explore in drawings the answer to the question: 'What would
you do if you were free of all emotional and intellectual commitment to
modern architecture?' This was a loaded question designed to encourage a
response that would move architecture beyond mere functionalism.
Ferri's imagination was fired by this question to produce not simply an
unusual new design for a building, but to suggest an approach to design
which he called 'A proposal for an American architecture and urbanism in the
post petroleum age.' With all the energy and bravado of the young (this was
in 1979) he proposed that architects should return to nature as the source
of their inspiration. Nature could provide all the roots of ornament and
structure, at the same time as it provided a referential framework that had
real meaning. This is best understood in some of the drawings that Ferri
produced for the Museum of Modern Art - and they remain in the Museum's
permanent collection.
These drawings show a plan for an imaginary city set in the plain with clear
boundaries between town and country. At the heart of this pedestrian city
there is a great domed hall - somewhat in the tradition of Ledoux. It was to
be called the Hall of the Three Races and giant figures representing Europe,
Africa and Asia spin in the dome against a spiralling galaxy. Around the
dome and spreading throughout the city are a series of hypostyle courts.
These courts are halls of columns; each column rises up some forty feet and
at its top bursts into bloom in the form of a lily. Each curved petal of the
lily joins to form the lines of a vaulted roof. It may sound strange and
unworkable but it was entirely feasible. As one critic wrote at the time:
'Ferri shows how to butt the flowers on the domes of Buckminster Fuller.'
These visionary drawings showed nature as a source of Divinely ordered
geometry. Ferri was to go on and prove that this vision was entirely
workable. In more receptive times he would have been demonstrating his
talent by using geometry to create Baroque churches probably in the manner
of Guarino Guarini's masterpieces in Turin. In fact he was able to build a
small number of remarkable houses and spread his influence through
theoretical projects.
One of these projects, a skyscraper for Madison Square, showed a fusion of
nature and architecture by turning the skyscraper into a mountain with trees
and goats and running streams. The 'mountain' was in fact a series of
terraces and hanging gardens planted and landscaped around the core of an
orthodox modern tower. It was entirely feasible and was later to be
developed as the 'Spiral Tower', where the actual structure of the tower
curved heavenwards only to burst into bloom like a giant tree as it reached
the sky.
On a more modest scale many of Roger Ferri's ideas were condensed into a
weekend house at Ligonier, near Pittsburg. The fortunate owners of this
house occupy the equivalent of a house in the American tradition of Frank
Lloyd Wright of harmony between landscape and architecture. This house also
showed that Ferri's work encompassed the design of interiors, furniture and
decorative objects which he hoped would spark off a revival of American
craftsmanship.
Roger Ferri's untimely death removes one of the few visionaries on the
architectural scene. His drawings and archives are to be preserved at the
Avery Library at Columbia University in New York with the hope that students
of architecture will continue to be inspired.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Economics: Eyes on both sides of Atlantic scan figures for
indications of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WELTER of figures from the US and UK will be watched keenly this week for
hints that economic recovery is on the way.
Little cheer for the flagging US economy is expected from industrial
production and retail sales figures for December. The retail sales figures
are predicted to reflect the weakness of demand in the run up to Christmas,
which may lead to further retrenchment in the business sector. Both sets of
figures will be watched closely for signs that the Federal Reserve will
attempt to revive the economy by cutting US borrowing rates again.
The main news in the UK will be the release of December's unemployment
figures. Economists expect a rise of about 30,000, less than November's
sharp increase of 38,000.
A fourth consecutive monthly increase in the UK retail prices index would
suggest that inflation was not being squeezed out of the economy as quickly
as the government predicted.
Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of city forecasts in brackets
from MMS International, a financial information company, include:
Today: UK, final figures for retail sales in November (up 1.2 per cent),
credit business for November (unchanged); US, November housing completions;

index for January (unchanged on month, down 1.6 per cent on year).
Wednesday: US, November business inventories; Germany, GNP for 1991 (up 3.2
per cent on year); France, December consumer price index (up 0.1 per cent on
month, and 3.1 per cent on year); Spain, December consumer price index;
Italy, vote on budget privatisation measures.
Thursday: UK, December unemployment (up 30,000), December vacancies,
November average earnings (up 7.25 per cent); US, December consumer price

RESULTS DUE
CONGLOMERATES may be out of fashion, but Tomkins is expected to deliver a
healthy interim profit increase of perhaps 35 per cent today.
With Philips Industries, acquired in August 1990, in for the full six
months, pre-tax profits are estimated to have risen from Pounds 31.2m to
about Pounds 42m. Two thirds of the group's sales are in the US. Murray
Ohio, maker of lawnmowers and bicycles, may have performed well.
Stockbroker analysts in the City expect TSB, the sixth largest UK banking
group, to announce a pre-tax loss of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 60m for
1991, when its annual results are published on Thursday. TSB may have to put
aside about Pounds 665m in provisions against bad loans. A year ago TSB
posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 312m, but heavy losses by Hill Samuel, its
merchant banking arm, drove it into a Pounds 150m pre-tax loss at the
half-way stage.
Asda, the hard-pressed grocery chain, is due to announce a ghastly set of
full-year results on Wednesday.
The food retailing industry has recently been affected by a worrying fall in
sales volumes and Asda has suffered more than most. Small shifts in sales
can have a huge impact on profits because of grocers' high operational
gearing and analysts have therefore forecast a wide spread of profits
estimates ranging from Pounds 5m to Pounds 35m. Last year, Asda made Pounds
58.6m at the half-year stage.
Stakis, the hotel and nursing homes group of which Sir Lewis Robertson took
over as chairman last March, produces its full year results on Tuesday. At
the half year stage, Stakis lost Pounds 45.1m, including Pounds 44m
write-offs as part of Sir Lewis's rescue, which included the sacking of
Andros Stakis as chief executive.
Analysts are forecasting a full year pre-tax loss to the end of September of
between Pounds 47m and Pounds 50m, varying according to their assessments of
how badly Stakis has traded in the second half, during which it has sold its
pubs but not its casinos.
First Leisure is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 30m on Wednesday from its interests in ten-pin bowling, holiday
attractions, discotheques and theatres.

BRITAIN, it is considered good practice to put an oil tray under a machine
to collect drips, but in Germany trays are not needed because machines do
not leak.
This observation is contained in a new survey which confirms that corporate
purchasers in the UK are a walk-over. They are least likely among those in
the big four European economies - Britain, Germany, Italy and France - to
fulfil the role of 'demanding customers'.
The study, undertaken by London Business School researchers on behalf of
Korda &amp; Company, the London-based consultants and venture capitalists, was
based on responses from 37 companies in four industries: woodworking
machinery, broadcasting equipment, high-technology engineering and specialty
chemicals.
Some 87 per cent of all respondents said they believed businesses benefited
from demanding customers while a total of 76 per cent believed that they
benefited from having demanding customers in their own home market. Overall
the study reaches three main conclusions
Just over half of all respondents agreed that customers in some countries
were more demanding than in others.
Where country differences were perceived, German customers were seen as the
most demanding for quality, technical innovation and customer service.
UK purchasers were the least likely customers to put pressure on suppliers
to upgrade product quality or introduce innovative features.
Both the bias against long-term relationships and the relative lack of
interest in quality and innovation work against UK purchasers.
The researchers say this means British suppliers need to look outside the UK
to form beneficial relationships with demanding customers.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Management: Mandela's mandarins - A course for civil
servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The task of transforming South Africa into a multi-racial society was taken
up in London last week when 10 black South Africans began a course at the
Civil Service College (CSC).
The six-week programme, sponsored by the UK government's Overseas
Development Administration, grew out of a request last July from Nelson
Mandela, president of the African National Congress, for help in training
civil servants.
Of the participants, six have been nominated by the ANC, two by the Pan
Africanist Congress, and one each from the Azanian People's Organisation
(Azapo) and the non-political Institute for Multi-Party Democracy.
The purpose of the programme is to provide first-hand knowledge of a western
government's civil service to prospective black senior officials. Employment
within South Africa's civil service is roughly split between blacks and
whites but as Sindiso Mfenyana, an ANC member, explained: 'All the
responsible positions are manned by whites.' One supervisor described the
first day as 'a humbling experience' as the participants described their
life-histories, and set out what they expected from the course.
They are all more than 40 years old but none has civil service experience.
Josiah Jele of the ANC trained at the military academy of the former Soviet
Union, was a freedom fighter in Mozambique, and as a former director of ANC
Broadcasting, was in charge of propaganda.
The changes within South African society are mirrored by the personal
transformation of Jele from someone who 'hated authority' to being 'very
much interested in local government'.
He says of the programme that the participants will 'take those parts that
are relevant to our situation', and hopes that 'it will help us to empower
the disadvantaged in our country'.
Zithulele Cindi of Azapo is a former inmate of the notorious Robben Island
prison off Cape Town and considers trade unionists the ideal future civil
servants. 'We should adapt what is appropriate (from the CSC programme) and
design a civil-service which is development-oriented,' he says.
The course includes formal lectures and training courses, as well as
attachments in which participants will shadow senior officials and sit in on
policy commissions and departmental committee meetings.
The training courses will include financial management, accountability,
business planning, team building and interpersonal skills. In the first week
lectures included the role of the British government, parliament and civil
service.
Course supervisors insist that their intention is not 'to sell' the
Westminster political model, but to explain the framework within which the
UK civil-service operates.
The six-week course is a drop in the ocean of what is required for South
Africa, which has 748,000 employees in the civil service.
The country also has its own problems which make the task of creating a
multi-racial civil service even more daunting. Not only must antagonism
between the entrenched senior white civil-servants to new black colleagues
be restricted but the civil-services of the 10 homeland governments must
also be integrated into a unitary structure.
A spirit of compromise and negotiation is likely to be stressed in the
formal lectures, and also be in evidence in the everyday business of
government departments visited.
Indeed some observers believe the programme was designed to smooth relations
between Britain and the ANC, so ruffled by Margaret Thatcher's description
when prime minister of some ANC members as terrorists.
Whether the British Civil Service will be used as a role model for the new
South Africa has yet to be seen. But as Marianne Neville-Rolfe,
chief-executive of CSC, noted: 'South African government institutions do
have a Whitehall pedigree. A lot is transferable.'

FT  13 JAN 92 / Management: Going to work on the unemployed - Executives
behind one initiative / Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are we being radical enough in our approach towards training, demanded
Edward Roberts, chairman of Central England Training and Enterprise Council?
Roberts, chief executive of a medium-sized spring manufacturer, was
presiding over the regular monthly board meeting of Reddich-based Centec.
A couple of years ago Roberts, an enthusiastic businessman committed to
training in his own company, Heath Springs, knew little about the
government's training scheme for unemployed adults and young people. Now he
is one of a commited band of private sector executives trying to push the
scheme forward.
Centec, one of 82 Tecs in England and Wales, last April took over from the
Department of Employment the running of publicly funded training schemes and
shouldered responsibility for the stimulation of 'enterprise'.
The agenda of its three-hour board meeting, held in the evening and attended
by eight of the 14 senior executives who are its members, gives a glimpse
into the challenges and problems of running a Tec.
With little preamble, the members settled down to well-informed discussion
of the main aspects of a Tec's work.
The need for more government cash was apparent and concern was repeatedly
expressed over Centec's management of some training schemes inherited from
the government last April. Links with local employers, crucial to the
success of Tecs, were seen as relatively weak and relationships with
organisations such as chambers of commerce were also revealed to be less
than perfect.
However, the tone of the discussions showed a strong commitment by the board
and some real optimism that Britain's poor training record could be
improved.
Centec is asking for Pounds 1.5m more public money for 1992-93 than last
year, when it received Pounds 11.6m. 'We are having to ask for more in order
to do all the things you have decided you want to do,' Roddy Skidmore, chief
executive, told the board. 'We have not massaged the figures. We are telling
the government that this is what we need.' Given that the government does
not want to increase its spending on training, the board was aware that any
requests needed to be well presented.
Richard Lacy, chief executive of the Independent Mortgage Corporation,
wanted to know why 50 per cent of the budget was spent on Youth Training.
Other board members questioned a proposed 22 per cent increase in
administration costs for stimulating local companies own training
programmes.
Like most other Tecs, Centec applied for funding for training credits - a
pilot scheme in which individuals receive a 'credit' - on average Pounds
1,500 - which they can exchange for training with a local employer or a
training company. The objective is to give individuals greater
responsibility for their training.
Centec's application was rejected, and a post-mortem took place. Terry
Morgan, managing director of Land Rover Vehicles, impatiently asked: 'Why
did we not succeed when it was something we desperately wanted to do? What
should we do differently next time we apply?'
Skidmore suggested two reasons for the failure. First, Centec was still too
orientated to Youth Training through training intermediaries and was not
sufficiently involved with local employers.
Second, some Tecs that had been successful may have been over optimistic in
what they said they could deliver. John Turnbull, chief education officer of
Hereford and Worcester council, suggested that the scheme itself might be
flawed.
Nobody on the board spoke well of the scheme inherited from the Department
of Employment, in which long-term unemployed adults sign on for training
that bears no relationship to local job vacancies. Take-up of the scheme in
the Centec area was low, the board was told. 'A lot of unemployed people
consider it a way to remove them from the unemployment statistics,' muttered
one board member.
Centec is experimenting with training tailor-made for specific employers who
guarantee the individual a job interview. Ten placements have been found.
Centec decided in its early days that it should be a facilitator, not a
provider, of services. In practice this meant pulling together existing
organisations and giving them a sharper focus. But now it has discovered it
needs to be more flexible. Skidmore proposed that Centec lead an employment
project in Chelmsley Wood, a 1950s housing estate on the edge of Birmingham
with one of the highest unemployment levels in the country. Skidmore said he
believed existing initiatives in the area were not meeting the need and that
the Tec should pursue an offer of sponsorship and appoint a full - time
manager on the site who would concentrate on developing small businesses and
skills.
'We are changing our tack,' said Scampion, who believed the Tec should not
take the practical lead in the project. He asked whether the Tec was not
losing its strategic direction. 'Not at all - we are seeking to meet local
needs,' said Roberts.
Centec has responsibility for the Management Charter Initiative (MCI) which
seeks to improve the quality of management training. Centec asked local
chambers of commerce to run the scheme for it.
At a previous board meeting it had been agreed that the MCI needed to be
speeded up, and doubts were expressed over whether chambers would be able to
do this.
Skidmore told his board that chambers now had seized the initiative. A new
head had been appointed and positive results were expected in the future.
Skidmore said: 'The key to the MCI is getting the management of it right. We
need to drive the scheme through with big companies and then we will have a
cascade effect on smaller ones.'
It was a comment typical of Skidmore, a former army officer who brings an
engaging enthusiasm to his new job. Likewise his board, while coming from
very diverse backgrounds, all demonstrated a strong grasp of the strategic
issues coupled with an understanding that the haul would be a very long one.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Appointments: 'Nuts and bolts' for Bemrose
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BEMROSE, the Derby-based security printers, will miss the glamour of its
association with Sir Gordon Brunton, who has reached 70 and is retiring
after 14 years as the company's non-executive chairman.
As well as owning the horse that won the gold cup at Ascot last June at odds
of 25:1, Sir Gordon, brought in by Sir Max Bemrose, great grandson of the
founder, has made some very imaginative contributions to the business, says
Roger Booth, who has just been made group chief executive. 'He was tough
when he needed to be,' such as in the early 1980s when the company had to
fight off Robert Maxwell's attentions.
But Sir Gordon, a former head of International Thomson, comes from another
world, says Booth, who explains that what the company now needs in its
battle with recession is 'nuts and bolts' men. Hence, David Wigglesworth,
61, retiring from group chief executive, becomes chairman.
Booth himself joined Bemrose at the end of 1988 when it purchased Henry
Booth, the family printing company of which he was managing director and the
majority shareholder. Far from having the top job in his sights at the time,
he says he had enough difficulty persuading his new colleagues to allow him
on to the board.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: River crossing in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The USDollars 500m (Pounds 267m) Jamuna Bridge project in Bangladesh has
been given the go-ahead by the World Bank after a further internal review of
the economic return of the project.
Tender documents are expected to relate to a bridge designed for road, but
with the potential to be adapted to road plus rail at a future date and at
minimum extra cost.
This evaluation was in broad agreement with the conclusion reached earlier
by the bank's consulting engineers, RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON together with
Dutch consultants NEDECO and BANGLADESH CONSULTANTS.
The bridge will be the first fixed transport link across the Jamuna river in
Bangladesh. The river forms a 15km barrier, separating the western side,
with its fertile north-west zone, from the eastern side containing the
commercial centre, Dhaka and the country's primary port, Chittagong.
The only fixed crossing of the river to date in Bangladesh is the power line
interconnector supported on caissons 110 metres deep, believed to be the
deepest in existence and for which RPT were the engineers. The crossing will
comprise a bridge structure about 5km long, major river training works and
road embankments on the flood plain between the river training works and the
high banks.
Mobility of the river banks is such that the final location of the 2,700
metre long guide bunds, and hence the length of the bridge can only be
determined at the time of construction. Cost estimates, design and the
proposed contract documents have been set down to accommodate this somewhat
unusual situation.
The bridge is 4,800 metres long, bounded by the guide bunds of the river
training works. The substructure will be 80 metres long, 2.5 metres in
diameter raking steel piles in bents of two or four. These will support a
composite steel box girder and concrete slab superstructure in spans of 100
metres.
An alternative design including a segmental pre-stressed concrete box girder
of similar span will be included in the tender documents.

Two west Midlands companies are teaming up again in a Pounds 16m office
development in Telford, Shropshire.
Richardson Developments has chosen TARMAC CONSTRUCTION to design and build
two multi-storey office blocks in the Telford Plaza project in Telford's
town centre.
The two companies have been responsible for many developments around the
west Midlands including the Merry Hill retail and business complexes in
Brierley Hill.
Telford Plaza will be situated in an existing office area of Telford town
centre, close to junction five of the M54. The Enterprise Zone development
was one of the last to be given planning approval by Telford Development
Corporation before it was disbanded.
Design work has already started on the first phase of the project with
construction work scheduled to begin this spring and to last 16 months.
This phase will include an 11-storey lozenge-shaped tower providing a total
office area of over 90,000 sq ft. The second phase will include an elongated
six-storey block providing over 70,000 sq ft of space.
The two offices will be set either side of an extensively landscaped plaza
including water features.
The external facade of each building will feature silver reflection glass
complemented by expressed vitreous enamel metal cladding panels which will
give the buildings a three dimensional look.

As director of property development, Vesty is unlikely to see quick results
from her new job, though she is likely to make faster progress than in her
previous task of directing policy at the London Docklands Development
Corporation, which has been particularly badly hit by recession.
Vestey, who was responsible for the development strategy and installation of
the Pounds 240m advance infrastructure in the Royal Docks since 1985,
oversaw a project which is unlikely to come to fruition for many years.
British Gas's largest potential project is a predominantly residential
development covering 296 acres in east Greenwich.
*****
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which operates the nuclear
stations of England and Wales, has also recruited a development specialist
to deal with its surplus buildings and sites.
David Hall, a chartered surveyor, is to take up the newly-created post of
head of property development. He is a director of Chesterfield Properties
and until recently was managing director of MEPC Development.
The largest building that Hall will deal with is Sudbury House, by St Paul's
Cathedral, which will be sold once planning permission has been gained for
redevelopment. He will also have to deal with a clutch of other buildings no
longer needed by the nuclear industry.

FT  13 JAN 92 / CBI looks into company fears over planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry is to set up a task force to
investigate how to speed up and improve the planning system, which many
industrialists regard as a handicap to business growth and competitiveness.
The group, to be chaired by Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive of
Bass, the brewer, is being organised jointly with the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors (RICS). It will prepare a report for the CBI national
conference in November.
The initiative will be concerned with strategic planning issues for business
development. More immediately, it will contribute to the government's review
of the structure, role and functions of local government, which has
important implications for the future of the planning system.
Land use and the planning system have been of concern to companies for some
time and the inquiry will consider the planning implications of road and
rail links, the location of plant and buildings and the needs of the
extractive industries.
Mr Prosser said yesterday: 'Many firms believe that we are faced with
planning decision-making which has been overtaken by the mix of requirements
of modern life and is ill-suited to business needs in the 1990s and to the
development of the internationally competitive transport infrastructure that
will be essential in the single European market.
'Our first step will be to identify exactly what the problems are by
consulting the CBI's 13 regional councils. RICS views will be taken into
account at this stage.'
The purpose of the task force, which comprises 20 business leaders and
chartered surveyors, is to improve the use of the development planning
system and reduce the delays in planning decisions while also securing
environmental improvements.
At present it can take up to 12 years to plan and build a new road. Of that
time, only two to three years are spent on construction.
Mr Ted Watts, president of the RICS, said that the economic effects of
planning decisions were of great concern to chartered surveyors.
He said he was confident that the task force initiative could draft
constructive and practical measures designed to help British business to
compete more effectively in European and world markets.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of UK homes with satellite television dishes will exceed 3m this
year - one in seven households - according to a new forecast, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
The prediction from Continental Research, an independent market research
group, is that a further 1.1m satellite dishes will be installed in 1992 as
satellite television expands in its core market - families with young
children.
Last year Continental forecast that dish installations would reach 2.2m by
the end of 1991.
According to the FT Satellite Monitor produced by Continental, 116,000
installations in December brought the total at the end of the year to 2.13m.
The first three weeks of December were particularly strong, with the weekly
average rising to 33,000 compared with 27,000 in November.
The December figure was the highest since the introduction of satellite
television in the UK.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Tories to renew attacks on Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Tories yesterday shrugged off an opinion poll giving Labour a 5
percentage-point lead and prepared for the latest of the political
offensives the party has planned for the approach to the general election.
Although rejecting Labour claims that the election campaign has already
begun, Conservatives plan a concerted offensive against Labour's defence and
foreign policies. They will use tomorrow's Commons nuclear defence debate
for this purpose. More attacks on Labour tax and education policies will
follow.
Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, yesterday set out the broad thrust of the
Conservatives' election themes in a message to his Colchester South and
Maldon constituency association.
The choice was between 'sound and responsible stewardship of a low-tax
economy, strong defence and firm leadership from the Conservatives', and
'higher taxes, economic ruin and a weak, vacillating Britain' from other
parties.
Conservative ministers believe their tactics so far this year have dented
Labour confidence and are determined not to overreact to the opposition's
intensive campaigning or to be panicked by one opinion poll.
'We don't want to look frantic and frenzied like Labour,' said one cabinet
minister who believed recent opinion polls showed Labour and the Tories
'neck and neck'.
Another minister conceded that the result of most general elections was
decided well beforehand. 'This one is obviously more interesting.'
Extra staff have been brought into Conservative Central Office to ensure the
swiftest possible reaction to Labour offensives.
The release of further details of the Tory election manifesto is being
controlled for maximum effect. They are certain to include help for working
mothers, more privatisation, deregulation, lower taxation, environmental
protection and support for training and education.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, attacked the pledge
yesterday by Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, to use the tax system to
redistribute income as 'the politics of envy'. He said Labour policies
'would send our economy into a permanent tail spin'.
The NOP poll in the Independent on Sunday newspaper put Labour on 45 per
cent, Tories on 40 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 12 per cent.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Decline in business confidence reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE among UK companies about the business outlook has fallen in the
past three months, according to a survey published today, increasing concern
about a possible further leg to the UK recession.
The quarterly survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group,
found that six out of 10 companies saw no immediate improvement in the
outlook for sales or new orders. Expectations were some way below the levels
seen in July 1990, at the start of the economic decline.
The study is more optimistic about the prospects for exports and profits,
but its tone is likely to depress government ministers who - in the approach
to the election - are looking for evidence that the economy is on the mend.
Publication of the survey will do little to reassure currency investors
about the prospects for sterling. Concern about the UK economy has been one
of the facts pushing the pound close to its effective floor in the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The survey, conducted last month among 1,800 managing directors, found that
41 per cent of companies expected sales in the first quarter of this year to
be above those of a year ago, as against 34 per cent that thought turnover
would go down.
The balance of 7 per cent expecting an improvement compares with a balance
of 11 per cent in September 1991. Even though the latest figure is more
encouraging than the highly pessimistic soundings in the first nine months
of last year, the result raises the possibility that the recession might
linger.
A similar picture emerges from the replies to questions about new orders,
where the balance expecting an increase has declined to 7 per cent, from 13
per cent in September.
Those indications about a weak economic outlook come after Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, ended a weekend meeting with Treasury ministers and
officials to discuss options for his Budget. There has been speculation that
the Budget might contain measures such as tax cuts to improve confidence and
boost the economy.
This week Mr Lamont, who has admitted that his earlier growth forecasts for
this year were over-optimistic, will review government figures that may
provide clues about a possible upturn. The run of data starts today with
consumer credit, which has been extremely weak recently.
The government might face further turbulence affecting the pound, which
closed at DM2.84 in London on Friday night, 11 pfennigs below its DM2.95
central rate in the ERM and only just above its effective floor set by the
peseta, the strongest currency in the system.
More positive news for the government from the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey came
with a balance of 14 per cent of companies expecting that overseas demand
would improve, against a balance of 1 per cent in September. The outlook for
employment remains weak, although it has improved slightly since the
September survey.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Sterling expected to keep ERM level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST FUND managers expect sterling to make it through 1992 without a
realignment within the European exchange rate mechanism, according to a
survey by Smith New Court, the securities house, and Gallup, the polling
organisation.
Sterling has recently been at the bottom of its ERM range, prompting fears
that the government might be forced either to devalue the pound or raise
interest rates to defend the currency.
A total of 75 per cent of the fund managers polled do not expect a
realignment during the year, with only 3 per cent predicting a devaluation
before the general election. If Labour wins the election, 4 per cent expect
an immediate realignment and 17 per cent believe there will be a
post-election devaluation, regardless of who forms the next government.
Nor do the fund managers appear to expect a rise in base rates from the
present 10.5 per cent. The fund managers' average expectation for base rates
is 10.2 per cent after three months and 9.5 per cent after 12 months.
There is only mild optimism about the UK economy in 1992, with just 14 per
cent of interviewees expecting the economy to get 'a lot better'. A total of
77 per cent think the economy will get 'a little better', and only 1 per
cent expect it to get 'a lot worse'.
Over the next 12 months, the balance of fund managers favour building up
their UK, European and Japanese equity positions and winding down their
holdings of US equities and cash.
The survey was conducted on January 6 and 7, with 10 institutions taking
part, managing funds totalling Pounds 533bn.

FT  13 JAN 92 / MPs voice fears over investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSTANTIAL percentage of backbench MPs believes that planned levels of
infrastructural investment are inadequate, according to a poll of 100 MPs
carried out for the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
Asked about investment plans over the next three years, 58 MPs thought
spending plans for railway infrastructure were inadequate, and 44 believed
the same for road spending plans.
Sewage treatment and water supply investment plans were classed as
inadequate by 47 and 39 MPs respectively, while 35 thought energy
infrastructure plans were insufficient for Britain's needs.
The survey was carried out by Access Opinions in November and December, and
based on the standing of the parties in the present House of Commons - 58
Conservatives, 35 Labour and seven others.
Spending plans in all categories were regarded with less concern on the
government's backbenches than on the opposition's. Even so, one-third of the
Tory MPs polled thought planned investment in railway infrastructure was
inadequate for Britain's needs.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Estimates of global warming scaled down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESTIMATES OF global warming over the past century due to greenhouse gases
may have been 'somewhat exaggerated', according to a draft report to be
presented to a meeting of scientists tomorrow.
The report, by the science group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), also says its original forecast of the pace of global warming
due to industrial activity may need modifying.
But it says that the main conclusions of its 1990 report remain unchanged:
emissions from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouses gases.
The document updates the 1990 IPCC report on global warming in the light of
new research from more sophisticated computer models.
The IPCC was established by governments to investigate global warming in
preparation for the Earth Summit conference in Rio de Janeiro in June.
The science group, led by Sir John Houghton, former head of the UK
Meteorological Office, meets in Guangzhou, China, tomorrow to finalise the
report.
It stands by its original conclusion that if business and industry continue
operating as usual, global temperatures would increase by 0.3 degrees
Celsius per decade, within an uncertainty range of 0.2-O4C.
The new scenario sees a rise below 0.3C but still within the range of
uncertainty.
The report says that by reducing the ozone layer, CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)
have offset the effect they have as greenhouse gases. 'Consequently
estimates of warming over the last century due to increases in greenhouse
gases made in the original report may be somewhat exaggerated.'
However, the report says there is more evidence of warming taking place.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush's trip to Japan came under renewed attack yesterday, with
Democrats dismissing claims that the bilateral trade talks would create jobs
to revive the sluggish US economy.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate finance committee, said he
would summon business leaders and administration officials who took part in
the trip to appear at hearings later this month.
This could prove embarrassing for Mr Bush, since the chief executives of
Ford, General Motors and Chrysler all expressed dissatisfaction with the
results of the trip - undermining White House efforts to brand it a success.
Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, put a brave
face on the talks yesterday, but conceded that the emphasis on the motor
industry had distracted public attention from broader goals such as US-Japan
co-operation in the post-Cold War era.
On balance, he said, it had been a good idea to invite US business leaders
because of the need to establish a dialogue.
Mr Scowcroft made light of Mr Bush's collapse at the state banquet in Tokyo
which overshadowed the 10-day Far East tour. 'The president was trying to be
too nice. He did not feel well. But he did not want to spoil the prime
minister's party.'
On Wednesday, Mr Bush will visit New Hampshire, the state which holds the
first primary election of the 1992 election campaign. Political observers
are watching closely to see whether the president defies public scepticism
and continues to insist the Japan trip was a success.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Intel overtakes rivals in integrated circuit sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF Europe's leading semiconductor manufacturers fell behind Intel, the
US company, in sales of integrated circuits to the European market last
year, according to an annual rankings list released today by Dataquest, the
market research company.
Intel overtook both Siemens of Germany and SGS-Thomson, the French group, to
become the second largest supplier last year after Philips Components, the
Dutch group, in the European market for ICs.
However, in the total European semiconductor market - which includes devices
such as micro controllers and opto-electronic components - all three
European manufacturers retained their positions as the top three suppliers
to Europe.
Philips led the rankings followed by Siemens with SGS-Thomson coming in
third.
But Intel beat Texas Instruments (TI), another US group, to fourth place. TI
is the European leader in bipolar standard logic technology, a sector which
fell 13 per cent last year.
Intel, which is the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips, saw the
strongest growth among the top 10 semiconductor companies in Europe, of 22
per cent in dollar terms. This compares with 6.6 per cent growth for the
European semiconductor market to Dollars 11.37bn (Pounds 6.2bn) on a dollar
basis and 10.3 per cent to Ecu9.29bn (Pounds 6.57bn) as measured in European
currency units.
The US group's achievement stemmed from its strong hold on the European
market for IBM compatible microprocessors, where it enjoys a 35 per cent
market share.
Intel's strength was underpinned by the move last year by computer
manufacturers to higher performance and higher priced microprocessors, a
sector in which Intel enjoys a strong lead. Microprocessors were not hit by
price erosion as in other sectors of the market.
Europe's top three semiconductor manufacturers, on the other hand,
experienced sluggish growth in 1991 as the main markets they supply were hit
by recession.
All three European manufacturers suffered from a heavy dependence on markets
which declined last year.
In worldwide semiconductor market share, the Japanese companies retained the
top three slots, with NEC taking an 8.5 per cent market share followed by
Toshiba with 8.2 per cent and Hitachi with 6.7 per cent. Their strength was
supported by resilience in the Japanese consumer electronics market,
particularly in camcorders.

<TEXT>
PORTUGAL will press for closer links between the European Community's trade
and industrial policies during its current six-month EC presidency,
according to Mr Luis Fernando Mira Amaral, the Portuguese industry and
energy minister.
He said in an interview that Portugal fully supports moves by Mr Jacques
Delors, the EC Commission president, to introduce measures in the
Community's next financial package to improve the competitiveness of
European industry against a sharpening challenge from the US, Japan and
newly industrialised countries.
This was made more urgent by the trade liberalisation envisaged in the
Uruguay Round negotiations. Such moves had to be accompanied by measures to
strengthen Europe's industrial competitiveness.
'There is no idea of returning to protectionism,' he said, emphasising that
existing agreements between the EC and Japan for the motor industry already
implied the development of to help Europe's car industry. This should be
extended not only to sectors such as aerospace and electronics, but also to
traditional industries such as textiles.
A Community policy to boost industrial competitiveness was a logical
'internal' counterpart to its external trade policy, he said.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Inconsistencies in handling civil claims across the EC
condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCONSISTENCIES in the handling of civil claims across the European
Community are preventing consumers from benefiting equally from community
laws, according to a report* published today.
The report by City solicitors Davies Arnold Cooper, for Tokio Marine &amp; Fire
Insurance, says differences in procedures in the civil courts of member
states will continue to undermine the purpose of EC directives in terms of
both the speed at which they are implemented by EC countries and the way
they are enforced.
The average time between issuing a writ and obtaining judgment varies from
six months in Greece and Germany to 42 months in Italy. 'How can it be fair
within an economic community for litigation to drag on for as long as five
years in one country and only for six months or less in another?' the report
asks.
The authors are also critical of the variation in eligibility for legal aid
in EC countries, which it says cannot be justified by local factors.
These inconsistencies, when combined with inconsistencies in the level of
damages in personal injury cases, suggest the EC is unwilling to ensure that
important community measures are consistently applied.
A study carried out by Davies Arnold Cooper in 1990 showed average damages
for a fatal accident varied from Pounds 420,000 in Germany, where it takes
on average six months to litigate, to Pounds 120,000 in Denmark, where a
civil claim takes an average od two years. 'If the single market is to mean
anything, Europe's legal systems and levels of damages must be
standardised.'
The authors call for:
an EC working party with senior judges from each member state to look at
standardisation;
interchange of EC judges;
harmonisation of time limits for starting cases and the type of recoverable
legal costs;
published guidelines for EC lawyers' fees;
and standardisation of legal aid funding and administration.

FT  13 JAN 92 / GATT: Dunkel goes for final Gatt sprint - A device to
sidestep Uruguay Round collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the huffing and puffing in Brussels, last month's draft package of
Uruguay Round trade accords looks set to receive conditional endorsement
when senior officials from the 108 governments taking part meet in Geneva
today.
Billed before Christmas as the decisive meeting that would determine the
success or failure of the five-year-old round, today's gathering of the
Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) will now be rather low-key.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt), will ask countries merely to indicate whether they are
prepared to enter the final sprint on the basis of the draft final act. This
leaves the door open for limited changes to the 436-page text.
He expects a consensus, including the European Community, in favour of
pressing on, with the aim of completing the round by mid-April. This is
probably the latest date possible if the final agreement is to come into
effect next January as planned. However, it also means the package will be
presented to the US Congress during campaigning for the November
presidential election, increasing the risks of rejection.
The Washington lobbies are already in full cry against plans to liberalise
textiles trade and alleged inadequacies in the accord on protection of
patents, copyright and other forms of intellectual property.
By carefully avoiding a demand that governments adopt or reject the draft
accords presented to them on December 20, Mr Dunkel has staved off the
immediate threat that EC objections on agriculture could sink the round.
Other countries with reservations on the draft, including Japan and the US,
will also breathe a sigh of relief. So too will the many smaller nations
still working through the implications of the package.
While governments now have a few more weeks to settle outstanding
differences, they are keenly aware that too much meddling with the text
could upset the fine balance it strikes among the interests of all 100-plus
participants.
For this reason a number of countries have told Mr Dunkel they oppose any
renegotiation. Australia and Brazil, two key members of the Cairns Group of
14 farm exporters, have publicly endorsed the draft.
Despite its description as the Dunkel package, the vast bulk of the text -
upwards of 85 per cent - was negotiated and agreed. This left just a few,
admittedly controversial, issues to be decided by negotiating group
chairmen: notably that on anti-dumping.
Only the draft on agriculture could truly be described as a Dunkel text,
following the failure of the US and the EC to come to terms after weeks of
intensive talks.
Mr Dunkel's formal pretext for playing down today's meeting is that
governments cannot judge the results of the Uruguay Round until they know
the outcome of two sets of negotiations yet to be completed - the detailed
country-to-country bargaining over tariff cuts for goods, including farm
products, and on opening markets to foreign services.
For many countries, these negotiations will be the crucial ones when the
time comes to sell the Uruguay Round deal to legislators, lobbies and
voters.
Developing countries will be looking for concrete demonstrations of the rich
world's professed willingness to lower trade barriers to farm produce,
commodities and textiles. The US has said repeatedly that, to get the
Uruguay Round package through Congress, it must win substantial improvements
in access to foreign markets for its services companies.
Over the next three months the draft final act will be scrutinised by a
legal and drafting committee for sense and consistency. However, most
interest will centre on the channel, supervised by Mr Dunkel as TNC
chairman, by which governments may be able to secure changes to the draft
accords. The seven groups that negotiated the draft final act have been
disbanded.
Mr Dunkel said on Friday that he would accept any changes agreed by all the
participants, but that it was up to dissatisfied governments first to
discuss their problems with trading partners.
To what extent countries will decide to press amendments, given the risks of
damaging the package, remains unclear. Until today, only the Community has
said unambiguously that the draft package is unacceptable and must be
modified. Its core objection centres on the way the agricultural text
excludes from the permitted subsidies the compensation payments envisaged
under EC plans to reform its Common Agricultural Policy.
Many pitfalls remain to upset the round. The US has expressed reservations
on the agriculture text, while Japan and South Korea oppose proposals to
open their closed rice markets. Outside agriculture, there could be moves to
reopen talks on anti-dumping, intellectual property rights, textiles and
services, if countries start demanding payment for changes made elsewhere.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Swedish coalition keeps its economic nerve: Domestic risks
of the new government's budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST budget of Sweden's non-Socialist coalition government, unveiled
last Friday, may carry high domestic political risks - its enemies on the
left label it a call to class war. But it has won the apparent approval of
business opinion at home and overseas.
Not only did the Stockholm bourse index rise strongly last week in response
to leaked budget details, but market interest rates fell as well. The budget
should end speculation that the krona is to be devalued.
Mrs Ann Wibble, the finance minister, must be pleased by this reaction to
her tough proposals, which will cut government spending by SKr24bn (Pounds
2.3bn) next year. Foreign observers grew accustomed over the past 20 years
to seeing Swedish governments attempting to solve their country's economic
ills by currency manipulation and public sector spending sprees.
Sweden's economy is more dependent than ever on the outside world since
foreign exchange controls were scrapped 2 1/2 years ago, the krona was
pegged to the Ecu, and Sweden applied to join the European Community last
summer.
Mrs Wibble signalled in her budget that the government would not be blown
off course by the recession and intended to stick to its ambitious
medium-term free-market strategy - announced when it took office last
October - to make the Swedish economy more competitive and productive
through structural reforms to encourage private initiative. This is what has
ensured overseas confidence and calmed the markets.
The aim of Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, and his colleagues is ambitious:
to transform Sweden into a high-growth, enterprise economy by the time it is
expected to join the EC on January 1 1995.
Such an objective continues to give the non-Socialist minority coalition a
cohesion, elan and self-confidence that has surprised many observers who
feared the four parties in government would spend much of their time
squabbling. The aggressive style of the government belies the fact that it
lacks a parliamentary majority and must rely on the support of the populist
right-wing New Democracy party to ensure that its policies are implemented.
The relative success of Mr Bildt's first 100 days can be judged by the
exaggerated reaction to the budget from the main Social Democratic
opposition. Its leader, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, called it a 'national
catastrophe'.
The Social Democrats seem to be abandoning the market-oriented strategy they
also pursued in their last two years in government, before losing last
September's general election. 'Their analysis was similar to our own before
they left power,' says Mrs Wibble. There is more continuity between Mrs
Wibble's budget and that of the Social Democrats in 1991 than either side
cares to admit.
But Social Democratic dislike for Mr Bildt seems greater than the party's
wish to remain consistent. In fact the present government proposes to spend
more on labour market programmes than the Social Democrats ever did, while
public spending as a proportion of gross national product will go up to 64.2
per cent next year from 61.7 per cent in 1990. This is hardly a sign Mrs
Wibble has embraced the ideology of Thatcherism, as her opponents suggest.
The real test of the new government's resolve is likely to come 12 months
from now as registered unemployment climbs from 3.4 per cent to 4.5 per cent
and perhaps beyond, a figure which is high for Sweden although smaller than
almost anywhere else in western Europe. If opinion polls show by then that
support for the non-Socialist parties is ebbing, pressure for a change in
economic direction may break the coalition.
Time is not on the side of the Bildt-Wibble economic strategy. Sweden has
general elections every three years and the government must face the voters
again in September 1994.
This will make it hard for the government to show positive results for its
free-market approach before the next polls, especially if the world's
recovery from recession is delayed. The government is hoping for an
export-led industrial revival next year; it expects 0.2 per cent negative
growth this year and a modest improvement of 1.3 per cent in 1993.
An even more dangerous threat could yet derail the Bildt-Wibble approach.
Leading Social Democrats are warning that the government will endanger
Sweden's bipartisan approach to EC membership if people believe its economic
policies are a necessary precondition for EC entry.
Mr Bildt fears that in opposition the Social Democrats might behave as the
British Labour party did in the early 1970s over Europe, and renege on their
EC commitment to preserve internal unity.
Such a U-turn still looks unlikely, but Sweden will hold a national
referendum in 1994 on whether to join the EC on the terms negotiated with
Brussels. This could yet split the country.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Bundesbank chief turns on industry critics

<TEXT>
MR Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday rounded on
German industrialists, rejecting claims that the central bank's monetary and
interest rates policies were 'strangling' the country's economy and stifling
investment.
The Bundesbank was not in the business of manipulating economic cycles, he
said in a radio broadcast, and put the blame for any downturn on pay
negotiators and industry's decision makers.
'It is not our responsibility to compensate with our policies for mistakes
made by others - over-generous pay rises, for example - or reduced
investment which should be attributed to other causes.'
The independent central bank has attracted growing criticism at home and
abroad since it unexpectedly raised lending rates by half a point to 9.5 per
cent just before Christmas.
The bank president's rebuttal followed a warning on Friday from his deputy,
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, that German interest rates would have to stay 'relatively
high' for the foreseeable future, and that industry's international
competitiveness would be damaged by high wage awards.
Mr Schlesinger noted yesterday that longer-term rates had fallen since
December and capital market rates were at the same level as at the start of
1990. In that year Germany recorded 4.5 per cent economic growth.
Meanwhile, steel industry negotiators have started their eighth round of
talks on union claims for a 10.5 per cent increase this year.
Employers have so far offered only a two-stage increase worth 4.54 per cent
over 12 months, while unions have warned of strike action.
The main banking union, offered 4.5 per cent in the face of its 10.5 per
cent claim, yesterday called for nationwide warning strikes on Thursday.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, joined the public debate yesterday,
declaring that all settlements must be held below 6 per cent.
In an interview in Der Speigel, a news magazine, published yesterday, Mr
Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, gave an unusually gloomy outlook for
economic growth this year.
While the lower limit of most recently revised forecasts is 1.5 per cent, he
projected a rise of between 1 and 2 per cent in the government's annual
economic outlook paper, to be published shortly.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Super-Bere lights pension touchpaper: Pierre Beregovoy's
reform plan could ignite an emotive issue despite backing from French
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHENEVER French stockbrokers gather to grumble about the lacklustre state of
the Paris markets, one topic is virtually guaranteed to cheer them up -
private pension schemes.
The prospect of an expansion in private pensions, which are rare in a
country where almost all pensions are administered by the state, has long
been regarded as the best way to provide an influx of investment for the
French stock market, thereby solving its long-term liquidity problem.
It is against this background that a brief reference to plans for pension
reform in a conference speech given last Thursday by Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
the French finance minister, was enough to send the CAC 40 index soaring.
All Mr Beregovoy, or 'Super-Bere' as the French press calls him when
particularly impressed by his rigid economic policy, said was that he hopes
in early April to produce proposals to reform the fonds salariaux, the
corporate pension schemes used by a small number of senior French
executives, and to introduce a tax-efficient personal equity plan. This news
was interpreted by the Paris financial markets as confirmation that the
long-awaited reform of France's pension system was under way.
The prospect of pension reform may be cheering news for the financial
markets, but for the bureaucrats in Mr Beregovoy's ministry it presents one
of the most complex challenges they could encounter.
At present almost all French pensioners, with the exception of the minority
belonging to the fonds salariaux, receive their pensions from the state. The
system is administered by the Caisse de Retraite, a state body paying out
pensions from the money it receives from the employed.
This system worked well in the 1950s and 1960s when France had a large pool
of young workers and proportionally fewer pensioners for them to support.
But in recent years, as the population has aged and the number of young
people moving into the labour market has fallen, the system has come under
pressure.
This problem seems set to intensify as the population ages further. Most
demographic forecasts suggest that by the year 2020 there will be more
people of pensionable age in France than there will be working to support
them, threatening to throw the system into chaos.
The obvious solution is for France to follow the precedent set by other
countries, notably the UK and the Netherlands, by encouraging the use of
private pensions.
But such a course is fraught with potential problems.
First, there is a short-term political hurdle in the hostility of the
powerful trade union lobby to the concept. There is also the logistical
difficulty that, until the first tranche of private pensions comes to
fruition, those people in work will not only have to continue contributing
to the state system - to provide pensions for their elderly compatriots
still dependent on the state - but will also have to pay for their own
private pensions. Such a package would be difficult for France's embattled
Socialist government to sell to the electorate.
Mr Beregovoy and his advisers also have to devise a means of encouraging
people to invest in private pensions - which will almost certainly involve
offering tax concessions - without running the risk of forfeiting too much
government revenue at a time when budgets are already under strain.
Pension reform would almost certainly create a potentially lucrative new
market for the banks, insurance companies and other finance houses that have
been waiting eagerly to launch pension and savings products.
More important, the development of private pension funds should, eventually,
provide a sorely needed source of investment for the equity and bond
markets.
The French equity market in particular has long suffered from a lack of
liquidity; the absence of the large private pension funds that bolster the
London market is seen as one of the chief causes of the problem.
The emergence of such funds could also have far-reaching consequences for
the whole French corporate scene, which tends to be dominated by established
industrial interests and the big banks.
The new breed of private institutions should be able to take up the cudgels
on behalf of other shareholders who, as the recent rows over the takeover
bids for Source Perrier mineral water and Au Printemps retail groups attest,
frequently feel that their interests are neglected.
As a result the French markets ought to be able to look forward to a future
in which they not only become more liquid but also more orderly, if
Super-Bere and his bureaucrats succeed in solving the thorny pension
problem.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Tax break plan for Russian investors
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALL capital investment in Russia, foreign as well as domestic, may become
exempt from tax.
Mr Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the Russian parliamentary commission on
taxation, budget and prices, told the Interfax news agency he was asking
parliament and the Russian government to amend the country's law on profits
to exempt capital investment from taxation.
His statement follows strenuous protests by Russia's enterprise managers.
They and Moscow business leaders met last Thursday to tell Mr Gavril Popov,
Moscow's mayor, that business activity would decline unless taxes were
reduced.
Under current law, businesses must pay 32 per cent profit tax - while those
enterprises earning hard currency must exchange 40 per cent of it at half of
the current market rate.
Meanwhile, at separate meetings of Russian and Ukrainian business people,
the policies of the new governments of these states were denounced as
anti-capitalist and the breaking of links between the republics was blamed
for catastrophic drops in production.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is likely to address the parliament this
week on the economic situation - after meeting a barrage of complaints over
high prices during a trip last week to the Urals and Volga regions. Prices
have risen by up to 15 times in Russia and in other republics in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, while shops have remained bare,
stimulating protest demonstrations organised by neo-Communist hardliners in
Moscow and St Petersburg and other cities yesterday.
In Ukraine, the parliament has demanded the resignation of the government
because of 'incompetence' in freeing prices, while municipal councils in
eastern Ukraine, where most ethnic Russians live, are holding emergency
meetings. At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities are being squeezed by
the new capitalists demanding lower taxes.
Associations bringing together business people, exchange managers and
brokers have written to parliament protesting against a draft bill which
would, they say, result in trading enterprises and exchanges paying a 65 per
cent tax.
A gathering on Saturday of Russia's big enterprise managers under the
leadership of the called on the state governments to end the 'artificial'
trade barriers blamed for destroying production.
Mr Yeltsin told the gathering that privatisation would be limited 'for the
present', with no plans for a 'forced privatisation' of big enterprises.
Tass news agency reported last night that Commonwealth leaders will meet in
Minsk on January 24 to discuss economic issues, including the pace of
economic reform.

FT  13 JAN 92 / Fears grow of Soviet nuclear brain drain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST half a dozen countries are thought to be eager to employ nuclear
specialists from the former Soviet Union to help develop nuclear weapons,
David White and Clive Cookson write.
According to western nuclear experts and military analysts, the potential
head-hunters include Arab countries which had close military links with the
Soviet Union: Iraq, Libya, Syria and possibly Algeria, which has recently
been at the centre of a controversy over a reactor it is building with
Chinese help.
On the other side of the Middle East conflict, Israel's active weapons
programme could benefit from the emigration of Jewish nuclear scientists
from the Soviet Union. India, Pakistan and Iran are seen as other likely
destinations.
Last week a senior Russian scientist at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic
Energy in Moscow said at least two of his colleagues had recently received
offers from Libya to work on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The two turned
down the proposals, which offered salaries of Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,100) a
month - high by Russian standards but only a quarter the salary of a senior
nuclear warhead designer in the US.
Some countries would be ready to pay 'astronomical' sums, according to Mr
Owen Greene, a specialist in international security at the University of
Bradford.
Mr Victor Mironov, a 60-year-old Russian expert in plutonium processing,
claimed last month that Iraq had offered him Dollars 100,000 in 1990 to join
its nuclear programme. He refused, he said in a television interview, but 'a
young specialist did go and there are a lot of cases like that.'
Western analysts estimate that 3,000 to 5,000 Soviet scientists have direct
experience of plutonium production and uranium enrichment, two of the most
sensitive proliferation activities. About 2,000 are involved in nuclear
weapons design.
In total, there are tens of thousands of people in the former Soviet Union
who could assist in nuclear proliferation in some way. It would probably be
possible to keep track of the few 'big fish' capable of designing a whole
nuclear programme, Mr Greene said. But would-be proliferaters would also be
keen to get technicians with laboratory experience.
Many analysts believe that foreign recruitment of Soviet scientists is a
greater proliferation threat than the sale of nuclear materials. 'All the
plutonium and highly enriched uranium is in a few secure facilities in
Russia,' says Mr William Walker of the Science Policy Research Unit at the
University of Sussex.
'Smuggling out the material is not easy, although there have been a few
scare stories about it recently. On the other hand people are very mobile.
Movement of people has had a big effect on the history of nuclear
proliferation.'
Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, warned in London last week: 'I'm
not certain that we can successfully stop those kinds of transfer.'
The main Soviet nuclear laboratories and production facilities are in
Russia. They employ mainly Russians and, to a lesser extent, Ukrainians.
Very few scientists from the Moslem southern republics - regarded as the
likeliest recruits for Arab nuclear programmes - belonged to the Soviet
nuclear elite.
However Mr William Potter, director of the Centre for Russian and Soviet
Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California,
has learned from his Soviet contacts that there were also uranium enrichment
facilities in Uzbekistan and Kirgizia.
Even so there is still little evidence, even anecdotal, of scientists being
tempted to leave the former Soviet Union. Mr Wolfgang Panofsky, chairman of
the US National Academy of Sciences Committee on International Security and
Arms Control, said his Russian contacts had given no indications about
scientists being approached. 'To the best of our knowledge, they're staying
where they are,' he said. But he added: 'It's a clear problem.'
Mr Henry Plater-Zyberk of the Centre for Defence Studies in London said an
immediate exodus was unlikely. Most employees engaged in nuclear weapon
production lived in purpose-built towns. 'For the time being they are
probably being provided with the minimum,' he said. But they would face a
combination of economic disarray and a decline in nuclear spending.
'These are people whose future is intensely insecure,' said Mr Greene, who
along with some other observers is proposing that the west should pay the
scientists and technicians to remove their incentive for going to Third
World countries.
US proliferation specialists including Mr Potter are urging the Bush
administration to 'put Soviet nuclear experts to work cleaning up the
enormous environmental damage caused by 40 years of nuclear weapons
production.'

FT  13 JAN 92 / Lithuanians turn attention to economy: Leyla Boulton returns
to Vilnius a year after witnessing the clashes at the TV tower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE YEAR after Soviet troops killed 13 people in a failed crackdown on
Lithuania's independence movement, barricades still surround the Baltic
republic's parliament.
Despite winning independence last September, Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the
tenacious Lithuanian leader, says the barricades will remain until the last
vestige of Soviet power - the army - leaves.
But 12 months after unarmed Lithuanians confronted tanks at Vilnius's
television tower, much of this nation's dramatic heroism - commemorated in
mournful ceremonies in the early hours of this morning - has given way to
the painful task of rebuilding a country after half a century of Soviet
occupation.
'Everybody is tired and complains about how difficult life is nowadays, but
nobody wants to go back to the way things were before,' said Saulius, a
surgeon whose burning desire a year ago was for independence.
Now his main struggle is coping with the effects of price liberalisation on
a monthly salary of Rbs1,500; petrol, for instance, has increased tenfold to
Rbs4 a litre, even before Russia begins to charge the Baltics the
international market rate for oil.
Once accused of devoting too much energy to battling Moscow at the expense
of economic concerns, Lithuania has over the past year embarked on a
wide-ranging programme of market reforms.
But, as one of the newly appointed western ambassadors (who are one of the
more tangible signs of Lithuania's independence) pointed out, basic problems
remain in implementing changes. Not least of these problems is a lack of
qualified staff.
Lithuania is already receiving substantial technical assistance - a
western-style banking system, for instance, is being built up with advice
from Switzerland and the European Community - and there are promises of aid
to develop transport and telecommunications infrastructure.
Although Lithuania is still nervous about the continued presence of 60,000
troops which it wants out this year - leaving behind weapons to help
Lithuania build its own defence force - the republic's main worries are
economic.
Mr Gediminas Vagnorius, the prime minister, said Russia was supplying only
40 per cent of the oil it promised to sell Lithuania this year. If no deal
was reached, Lithuania would switch off electricity supplies to nearby
Kaliningrad, the former German enclave which is now part of the Russian
Federation.
While he was ready for a switch to trade in hard currency at world prices,
he said Lithuania was waiting for trade levels with Russia to settle before
introducing its own currency, the litas.
Meanwhile, Lithuania can only benefit from further delay in putting the
litas in circulation. For instance, it needs help accumulating Pounds 110m
worth of reserves to back its currency - but significant financial
assistance from the west is likely only after July, when the republic
expects to join the International Monetary Fund.
Despite the uncertainties of living with the rouble, a start has been made
on privatising the state-owned economy. Each adult has been given a voucher
entitling him or her to Rbs10,000 worth of housing, shares in factories or
stakes in small businesses.
But Mr Vytenis Aleskaitis, appointed as minister for foreign economic
relations to try to attract and help investors, says foreign investment is
vital for Lithuania's survival as an independent state.
The government hopes foreign investors will take over and re-equip many of
the larger enterprises, bringing badly needed managerial and marketing
skills to the hard-working and cheap labour force.
This is why Mr Aleskaitis is asking parliament to approve a revamped
investment law offering a five-year tax holiday for foreign investors who
stay that long, and the right to lease land for 99 years or to buy it
outright.
The government recently produced a list of 114 factories, shops and
restaurants which are for sale in hard currency. Nobody has bought anything
so far, but the government is pinning its hopes on tourism, textiles,
furniture and some high-technology plants inherited from the Soviet defence
industry.
Mr Aleskaitis also plans a closed tender for 20 companies to bid for a
concession to exploit Lithuania's Genciai oilfields. These and other
reserves were first exploited during Moscow's energy blockade of the rebel
Baltic republic two years ago - but it will be some time before they can
reduce Lithuania's dependence on oil imports.
Finally, the minister is seeking better access to foreign markets lost after
Lithuania was cut off from the world by Stalin.
'It is very easy to lose markets but very difficult to get them back,' he
said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILITARY council which seized control of Georgia after the flight of
President Zviad Gamsakhurdia met parliamentary deputies of the republic
yesterday to discuss transferring power back to a civilian government.
Mr Gamsakhurdia fled the country a week ago after a violent two-week siege
of Tbilisi's government building in which latest estimates say that 113
people died, with 420 injured. He was still in Armenia this weekend, in a
mountain retreat outside Idjevan, 40km from the Georgian border.
Mr Levon Ter-Petrosian, the Armenian president, said on Saturday he was
offering Mr Gamsakhurdia and his family and personal guard temporary asylum
in his republic, but all other supporters were being made to give up their
weapons and leave the republic.
In Tbilisi, the leaders of the ruling military council agreed in principle
to a swifter-than-expected handover of power, but this was delayed by the
failure of a meeting of Georgia's parliament on Friday to reach a quorum.
Only 57 deputies attended; 90 were required.
If parliament continues without a quorum, deputies have suggested it may be
replaced by a national assembly composed of representatives of all parties,
trade unionists, students, ethnic minorities, and local government
officials.
Further violent incidents were reported in western Georgia, where support
for Mr Gamsakhurdia remains strong. Railway services in the area have also
been severely disrupted because of a strike by railway workers.
Tass quoted a local report that 7,000 passengers were trapped in about a
dozen trains destined for Tbilisi and Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
Fighting also occurred outside Akholtseki, on the border between Armenia and
Georgia, when 60 Gamsakhurdia supporters trying to return home clashed with
local police.
Claims by the former Georgia opposition now trying to consolidate power,
that Mr Gamsakhurdia was trying to set up a dictatorship, were backed the
human rights group Helsinki Watch. The group documented what it called
'severe violations of human rights on the part of the Gamsakhurdia
government'.
These included violations of freedom of speech, freedom of teh press and the
right to free assembly, as well as the imprisonment and ill-treatment of
political opponents.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (22): Takeover battle a rousing but
untypical climax - Mergers and acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OLD-FASHIONED Anglo-Saxon takeover battle brought the 1991 European
mergers and acquisitions scene to a rousing but untypical climax.
BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate ranked 22nd in the FT500, won its Pounds
1.55bn hostile bid for Hawker Siddeley, one of the most famous names in
British engineering, which was ranked 186.
However, hopes that BTR's return to the takeover trail marked a resurgence
in UK takeover activity proved unfounded - as did speculation that Hanson's
taking of a 2.8 per stake in Imperial Chemical Industries would lead to a
bid for the giant.
The hostility with which Lord Hanson's stake-building was greeted by
politicians demonstrated just how much the commercial climate has changed in
the UK since the deal-driven 1980s.
The combination of recession, shortage of bank finance and uncertainty
caused by the Gulf war all helped reduce cross-border M&amp;A activity to its
lowest level since the crash of October 1987. According to the accounting
group KPMG, the value of cross-border deals in the first nine months of the
year fell by 60 per cent, to Dollars 34.8bn
Takeover activity in Europe fell less steeply, mainly because of the
continuing drive by companies to consolidate and strengthen their position
ahead of the unified market.
Financial services saw some of the greatest concentration. In the
Netherlands, the merger of the country's two largest banks,
Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank (Amro Bank) and Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN Bank),
formed ABN-Amro Holding, ranked 84 in the FT500.
Then Nationale-Nederlande, the leading Dutch insurer, merged with NMB
Postbank, the country's third-biggest bank, to create the Internationale
Nederlanden group, which is ranked 72nd.
One company's focusing often gave a rival an opportunity to buy market
share. AEG, part of the Daimler-Benz industrial group of Germany, sold its
cable business to Alcatel Alsthom of France as part of its strategy of
concentrating on its main activities.
AEG Kabel said the business would have required too much investment to make
it a big enough competitor on the European market. The purchase lifted
Alcatel Cable's share of the German market from 10 to nearly 25 per cent.
This process of concentration often posed regulatory questions. The EC's
merger task force, which began routine investigations in January 1991
approved the SKr16.25bn (Dollars 2.8bn) bid for Alfa-Laval, the Swedish
dairy and food processing equipment company, by Tetra Pak, the Swiss
packaging group. Both companies had promised not to make sales of packaging
machinery dependent on orders for processing machinery. They also undertook
to make equipment compatible with competitors' products.
Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, allowed Fiat to take a
controlling interest in Alcatel Alsthom's battery operations, though on
condition the Italian group sold most of its stake in a large French battery
maker.
However, Brussels banned a proposed takeover of de Havilland, the ailing
Canadian offshoot of Boeing, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy.
The EC said the proposed takeover would have created 'a powerful and
unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop (commuter)
aircraft'.
Occasionally changes in government regulation speeded the restructuring of
markets. Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, and
Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, plan to merge their UK brewing interests in a
Pounds 510m joint venture. The deal marks a further consolidation of the
British brewing industry after the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission's
unsuccessful attempt to loosen the national brewers' grip on pub retailing.
According to KPMG, French companies overtook UK groups as the biggest
acquirers abroad during the first nine months of 1991, although French M&amp;A
activity was also down on the previous year.
Much of the French activity was in the US, with Schneider, the electrical
equipment company, taking over Square D, the electrical distribution group
for Dollars 2.23bn. Axa, France's second largest insurer, took a FFr5.8bn
(Dollars 1.07bn) stake in the Equitable Life Assurance Society, and Alcatel
Alsthom, the engineering and telecommunications group, paid FFr3.8bn for the
transmission equipment division of Rockwell.
On the domestic front, however, France is debating how its two-year-old
takeover legislation reforms are working. Under the rules, a shareholder who
raises his stake in a firm's capital or voting rights to above one half must
bid for full control.
But a shareholder who takes his stake above one third can get away with
raising that to a minimum of just two thirds. In those cases, critics say,
minorities left with the remaining one-third are discriminated against, as
there is no guarantee they will be able to sell their stock at the bid
price.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's finance minister, said recently he did not
rule out the need to modify the regulations, but felt there was no consensus
for change.
In Germany, the collapse of talks between Continental, the tyre-making
group, and Pirelli of Italy rekindled fears of a 'Fortress Germany', from
which foreign bidders would be excluded by a combination of banks,
cross-holdings of shares and voting right limits.
Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, chief executive of Continental, admitted the
collapse of the talks could have a negative effect on the German M&amp;A scene:
'It wasn't our intention, but the whole thing could be rather discouraging
for others contemplating mergers or acquisitions.'
The UK continues to be worried by a draft EC directive which would harmonise
takeover practices throughout the Community. The British would, of course,
welcome a more liberal regime, encouraging more aggressive takeovers.
However, the UK's Takeover Panel is concerned that any EC directive would
threaten the self-regulatory and non-statutory basis of the UK approach,
which has the advantage of keeping companies out of the courts.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (19): Bumpy drive for the car makers
 -Motor vehicles and components / The performance of the leading groups in a
year when profitability nose-dived and competition intensified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S publicly-quoted car makers and automotive components suppliers lost
favour with investors last year, as profitability nose-dived, competition
intensified and some vehicle producers fell into loss.
Virtually without exception the ranking of motor industry groups represented
in the FT500 list has deteriorated with the leaders of the western European
new car market, Volkswagen of Germany and Fiat of Italy, suffering two of
the biggest drops.
Fiat, which has the broadest spread of automotive operations of any of the
European producers, has suffered a significant fall from grace dropping from
15th place in 1990 to 53rd in 1991.
The Volkswagen group of Germany, now the clear leader of the western
European new car market, fared little better in investor sentiment, however,
as it plunged from 32 to 78 in the FT500 list. Its growing sales volume has
failed to remove financial analysts' scepticism about its underlying
profitability and the magnitude of the investments it is planning during the
next five years.
At the same time Peugeot of France, which includes Citroen, has also lost
ground, slipping from 59th to 83rd in the FT500. Along with Fiat its
European sales faltered badly during 1991. In the western European new car
sales league it was overtaken by General Motors and Ford, the two US car
makers and slipped from third to fifth place.
The Fiat group now includes virtually the entire Italian car industry with
the Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Innocenti marques - it holds a 49
per cent stake in Maserati - as well as the Iveco commercial vehicle
operations and a majority stake in Magneti Marelli, one of the biggest
European automotive components suppliers.
It staged the weakest performance of the big six volume car makers in the
European new car market last year with a drop in sales volume of some 9 per
cent. This depressed its market share to around 12.8 per cent from 14.1 per
cent a year earlier.
Fiat has come under heavy attack in the domestic Italian market. It is more
dependent on its home market than any of its rivals among the big six volume
car makers in western Europe and appears to be one of the European car
makers most vulnerable to the growing Japanese presence in Europe.
In the first 11 months of 1991 the Fiat group captured only 46.9 per cent of
the Italian new car market compared with 53.2 per cent in the corresponding
period of 1990 and 58 per cent in the same period of 1989.
The operating income of its car operations declined to L907bn (Dollars 739m)
in 1990 from L2,300bn (Dollars 1.9bn) a year earlier, and the group's
profitability declined sharply again last year.
In Europe, the German vehicle makers fared best in 1991, as they were buoyed
up by the extraordinary surge in new car sales in the domestic market in the
first half of the year fuelled by reunification. Important new models have
been launched including from Volkswagen a new generation Golf, Europe's
best-selling car.
In the past two years demand patterns have diverged sharply in different
European markets, as sales in several key volume countries such as the UK,
France and Spain have nose-dived, while sales in Germany surged to a record
level.
According to industry estimates western European new car sales in the first
11 months of 1991 at 12.714m were virtually unchanged with an increase of
0.3 per cent from the same period a year ago. However, registrations were
lower than a year ago in each of the four months from September to November.
The dramatic surge in German new car sales, which was the main prop to
western European new car demand in the first seven months of the year, is
abating, while key markets elsewhere, such as the UK and France, have
remained in deep recession.
The big jump in German new car sales last year masked the sharp fall
elsewhere. Excluding Germany, sales in the rest of western Europe in the
first 11 months at an estimated 8.764m showed a drop of some 9.1 per cent.
Groups such as Fiat and Peugeot, whose main strengths are in southern
Europe, suffered accordingly, while the producers with a strong presence in
Germany - including General Motors (Opel) and Ford - all gained ground.
The same pattern could be seen among the European executive and luxury car
producers, although they faced the added problem of the recession in the US.
Daimler-Benz still fell from 5th to 10th place in the FT500, however, while
BMW dropped from 81 to 99.
Volvo, the Swedish car and truck maker which has slipped from 92 to 109 in
the FT500 list, suffered an operating loss of some SKr1.5bn (Dollars 260m)
on its car operations in the first nine months of last year and had an
overall group operating loss of SKr1.26bn in the same period.
After a false start early in 1991, European car stocks appeared to be
returning to favour with investors in the late autumn last year amid
suggestions that the earnings of most manufacturers would turn upwards in
1992. However, the prospects still remain uncertain.
Until 1991 European car makers had had a rough ride since their peak in
1986. According to James Capel, the London stockbrokers, European car shares
outperformed their respective markets by 19 per cent in 1986, but then
underperformed by 17 per cent, 3 per cent, 6 per cent and 25 per cent in the
following four years.
The sector rebounded at the start of 1991, but sentiment weakened again
later in the year.
The outlook for 1992 remains problematical. According to the latest forecast
from DRI Europe, the London-based automotive analysts, the western European
market is forecast to fall by 2.4 per cent to 13.15m in 1992, largely
reflecting an expected 19 per cent drop in German new car demand to 3.3m.
Excluding Germany, the demand outlook is more favourable, with western
European sales elsewhere growing to 9.8m next year from 9.3m in 1991.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (21): Collapse of the Maxwell empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST spectacular change affecting a ranked company since the FT500
snapshot date of September 30 is the collapse of Maxwell Communication
Corporation.
The unravelling started on November 5 with the death at sea of Mr Robert
Maxwell. Details flowed out about MCC's debt, which totalled about Pounds
1.3bn, and about the transfer of cash from the pension funds of MCC and its
sister company Mirror Group Newspapers to private companies in the Maxwell
empire.
Other investigations focused on share transactions in MCC. Its shares were
suspended on December 2 at 35p, little more than a fifth of their value on
September 30 when MCC ranked 262 in the list.
Later in December, MCC obtained protection from its creditors in the US
under Chapter 11 legislation and went into administration in the UK.
Other companies in the FT500 will not be there next year for more regular
reasons.
Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group, was acquired by the industrial
conglomerate BTR in a Pounds 1.55bn deal. The bid accounts for Hawker's
sharp rise to 185 in the rankings.
Ultramar, the oil and gas group ranked at 316, narrowly lost its
independence to Lasmo, the oil exploration company. The Pounds 1.1bn
acquisition turned Lasmo, ranked 258, into one of the largest oil explorers
in the world.
Racal Electronics escaped a Pounds 700m-plus hostile bid from Williams
Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, just before Christmas. Racal will,
however, go ahead with the demerger of its Chubb securities division.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (20): Recession the watchword -
Country Analysis, The UK / Some companies slipped deeply into the doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION has been the watchword for UK companies this year as the economy
continued to contract in the first six months. There was a slight rally in
the third quarter, thanks to the oil sector.
Yet, because the London stock market looks several months ahead - in this
case to recovery - the value of UK stocks in the survey tended to rise from
their cheap levels on the way into recession, compounded by the Gulf crisis.
Taking the snapshot dates for the FT500, the FT-SE 100 index rose by more
than 10 per cent between the end of June last year and September 30 this
year, although it then fell back.
The rise helps to explain the additional 16 UK companies in the top 500,
taking the total to 181 (not counting double listings such as the survey
leader Royal Dutch/Shell). This is almost three times the representation of
France and Germany, where far fewer companies are quoted and the
takeover-based trends towards multi-nationalism and concentrations within
industries are far weaker.
Yet whatever the hopes for recovery in some sectors, others slipped deeply
into the doldrums and this is reflected in their declining rankings. The
testing conditions also vindicated a few theories about recession-resilience
and highlighted the quality of some individual managements.
Perhaps the worst affected family of sectors was property and building, with
repercussions to insurance through the underwriting losses on mortgage
indemnities.
Even Land Securities, the largest and most robust property company in the UK
and one of the very few to manage an interim profits increase, drifted down
from 94 to 101.
Ladbroke, the hotel and leisure group, and Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation, which is also involved in construction, were vulnerable not only
through their property divisions, but through stretched balance sheets. Both
had rights issues - another theme for the year.
The previous annual record of nearly Pounds 7bn raised in 1987 was surpassed
within the first eight months of this year. Companies took advantage of
rising share prices to repair balance sheets or to strengthen their hands in
bids for struggling targets.
By December, about Pounds 9bn had been raised. But not all the calls were
well received, particularly as heavily tapped institutions became more
selective. Most ignominious was the less than 5 per cent take-up of British
Aerospace's Pounds 432m issue.
Construction companies were fairly well represented in the rights issue
roll, but the leading house builders were not among them after a bad year on
all fronts - including their share prices.
Tarmac and Wimpey, duly fell down the rankings as private housing starts
sank to about 130,000 this year, about 90,000 - or 40 per cent - fewer than
in 1988.
Meanwhile, the insurers of over-mortgaged individuals lost a lot of money -
Royal Insurance announced underwriting losses of Pounds 173m for the nine
months to the end of September.
While it was clearly easy for companies and individuals to defer buying
property, some aspects of life went on regardless. Those stocks dealing in
such non-discretionary items as food and health duly proved their
resilience.
Glaxo, the drugs company catering for ailments as prevalent as ulcers,
asthma and migraine, rose from 10th to third and Wellcome also progressed
impressively from 64 to 27.
Drugs companies have proved to be good examples of several positive factors
valued by equity analysts: they operate in growth markets and have extensive
international earnings. The increasing sophistication of treatments
justifies higher prices and the specialist products are, by definition,
aimed at niche markets.
This provides all the ingredients for that lucrative cliche 'high added
value' and it can be seen in Wellcome's pre-tax profit margin of nearly 25
per cent in its latest set of interim results.
Food has also provided a haven for many an investor this year. J Sainsbury
and Tesco, two aggressive expanders of their supermarket chains, have both
jumped more than 20 places to 33 and 47 respectively. But they still lag
behind Marks and Spencer, which has applied both the value for money and
added value formulae to a wider range of goods.
Other retailers dealing in the modern versions of staple goods, such as
toothpaste and toilet rolls, follow a similar pattern, with Boots as an
obvious example.
Food manufacturers also did well - Northern Foods, for instance - and the
makers of alcoholic drinks were largely unaffected by the conditions, with
Guinness as a prime example. Allied-Lyons, spread across drinks, food and
retailing, benefited accordingly. There was even a positive spin-off for
companies tranporting the necessities, such as NFC.
It could almost be called the year for essentials when the rises of
companies associated with heat, light and water are added in, following in
the wake of longer-established brethren in the oil sector.
British Gas rose from 14th to 7th, close to British Petroleum in ranking but
still less than two thirds of its value. The water companies, new to the
index last year, rose strongly headed by Thames at 197 (254). Southern and
Welsh were new entrants.
But the most prominent performance was the entry of a dozen electricity
concerns, following this year's privatisations. National Power came in at
87, the second highest new entry behind Vodafone at 65, in the growth market
of mobile communications, which demerged fully from Racal Electronics in
August.
Vodafone's parent, on the other hand, was the biggest faller, from 96 to
351. Its vulnerability sparked a bid from Williams Holdings, a rapid riser
through its exploitation of acquisition opportunities.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (18): Picture is almost universally
negative - Engineering / The financial effect of the downturn is hard to
gauge, as so much of the industry remains in private hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a tough year for the European engineering industry, with a deep
recession that began in the UK in the middle of last year spreading
gradually to the continent, reaching Germany - albeit with reduced vigour -
by spring this year.
The downturn in western European demand has combined with a much-needed
sense of realism about the long-term needs for capital goods in reunified
Germany and eastern Europe, choking off some of the initial euphoria.
The financial effect of the downturn on European engineering is hard to
gauge, as so much of the industry remains in private hands. Inevitably,
therefore, important but predominantly private industries such as machine
tools, which by this summer were having a hard time virtually everywhere in
Europe, and construction equipment, which is being buoyed by German demand,
have little impact on the FT500.
Nevertheless, the big publicly-quoted steel, metals and engineering
companies that are in the index do give a reasonable indication of investor
perceptions across a broad cross-section of industry, and the picture
presented is almost universally negative.
Virtually all such companies saw their position in the rankings slip this
year. At the top end Siemens, with its significant transportation and power
generating equipment interests, slipped from seventh to ninth, while ABB
Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, dropped from 16th to
31st.
Further down the list, it is the same story, with solid engineering names
such as Linde, Sandvik, Siebe, TI Group and Sulzer all registering declines
of varying intensity. One of the most famous names in UK engineering,
Vickers, only just managed to stay in the rankings, dropping from 432nd to
499th, having warned towards the end of September that its final dividend
depended on an improvement in outlook for Rolls-Royce motor cars.
There are some notable departures, most of which were pushed out by
non-engineering companies rather than by the more honourable exit route via
acquisition. The biggest takeover in the engineering industry this year saw
the absorption of Alfa-Laval, the Swedish food, dairy and industrial
equipment producer ranked 185th last year, by Tetra Pak, the privately-owned
packaging company.
Among eight further names to have dropped out are Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz
(414th last year), which is expecting flat profits this year, Dowty (459th),
the UK aerospace and electronics group caught up in the defence downturn,
and FAG Kugelfischer (460th), the German bearings group.
The one entrant to the rankings, at 220th, is Pechiney International, a
recently-established, separately-quoted subsidiary of Pechiney, the French
state-controlled aluminium and packaging group which retains a 75 per cent
stake. It comprises most of the group's foreign activities, including
American National Can.
It should be pointed out that there are structural as well as cyclical
reasons for the general decline, along with the shortage of new entrants. In
the engineering industry, this has not been a big year for the kind of
mega-merger activity which would have an impact on the FT500.
The restructuring in mechanical and electrical engineering at the end of the
1980s was not only prompted by overcapacity in many important sectors, but
by the closely-linked desire by companies to get mergers out of the way, and
new structures in place, well ahead of the 1992 European Community Single
Market reforms.
There is, however, a reasonable amount of takeover and joint venture
activity of the kind that by definition impinges on the FT500 rankings
slowly or indirectly. However, the Gulf war caused as much uncertainty over
long-term planning in the engineering industry as elsewhere.
It is also important to note that, although the declines in rankings are
pervasive, business conditions and prospects vary widely. The gloomiest
sector is almost certainly the steel industry, where the three big
publicly-quoted producers, Thyssen, British Steel and Hoesch, all suffered
sharp falls in their European 500 positions.
In spite of a decade of restructuring, a majority of European steel plants
are either making losses or just breaking even, according to a confidential
survey prepared for the European Commission this summer. Prices have been
cut as national markets such as the UK, hitherto the preserve of British
Steel, have become more open to foreign competition.
As it happens, this survey of the industry's costs put both British Steel
and Thyssen in a low-cost group, with Hoesch and its recent suitor Fried.
Krupp in the medium-cost group. A stock market quotation has clearly spurred
British Steel to increase efficiency, but its financial health, and perhaps
its European 500 ranking - down from 84th to 105th this year - might improve
with further thorough restructuring among its German rivals.
Indeed next year's rankings could reflect that, if Krupp completes a planned
merger with Hoesch which would create a new power in the steel and
engineering industries. Krupp is not publicly-quoted.
Elsewhere, the slip down the rankings by leading engineering groups has
almost certainly been checked by the cushioning effect of their varying
internal business cycles. ABB, for example, has been stressing all year the
disparity between such 'standard products' as electrical installation
equipment for housing, which have been hit by recession, and infrastructural
businesses such as power generating equipment which is much more influenced
by longer-term buying trends.
As for machinery companies, the outlook may not look too bright, but one of
the more thoughtful observers of the European capital goods scene, Mr Edward
Hadas of Morgan Stanley, believes the future looks much better for selected
companies if they can benefit from a virtuous circle of low production costs
accompanied by higher product prices, while superior quality leads to
increased market share.
'After many years of struggle, an increasing number of companies in Europe
find themselves going round the first turns of this happy curve,' he says.
Furthermore, he says, the impact of eastern Europe on the machinery industry
should be more significant than for the western European economy as a whole,
and come quite soon.
Among quoted companies, he believes the best beneficiary of the forthcoming
upturn will be Mannesmann - down in this year's rankings from 68th to 91st -
partly because of leadership in several key machinery sectors.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (17): Arms cuts intensify the
difficulties - Defence / The process of concentration has become becalmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISTS can still be found in the defence industry but they are having a
hard job convincing investors.
Restructuring was already under way in the European defence sector by the
time the Berlin Wall was breached two years ago. It had become apparent that
national defence spending was becoming tighter, that there were in many
areas too many companies competing for a decreasing number of contracts, and
that even the bigger ones were ill-equipped to compete with US rivals unless
they pooled efforts to develop new weapons and systems.
But if difficulties were anticipated, they descended on defence companies
much faster than anyone could have expected. The ending of the Cold War, the
collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the erosion of Soviet military power have
provoked a rush of military expenditure cuts by governments throughout
western Europe, outstripping the pace of negotiated arms reductions.
Equipment purchases are being reduced or cut short and some projects
abandoned. The remaining growth markets for exports, mainly in the Middle
East and Asia, are increasingly competitive.
The process of concentration that was already under way in the industry  -
aimed to secure markets and cover the spiralling cost of remaining in
high-technology military sectors - should logically have accelerated.
Instead it has become becalmed. So sharp has the setback to the business
been that there are few willing buyers for defence businesses.
All this is not immediately transparent from changes that have taken place
in the FT500 listings. Defence cuts affect a wide range of companies, most
of which carry out the bulk of their activities in other sectors. The single
exception to this in this year's FT500 is Thomson-CSF of France, which has
80 per cent of its turnover in defence. But then, only that quoted company
is listed, rather than the state-owned Thomson group, its majority
shareholder.
Many companies have been trying to reduce their reliance on military sales.
The Netherlands-based Philips group has almost withdrawn from defence,
selling the bulk of its military interests to Thomson-CSF in early 1990.
Racal and Thorn EMI of the UK both tried to sell their defence activities
without finding a buyer willing to meet their price. Thorn went on to take
over Philips's British subsidiary MEL and then to sell MEL's communications
division to Thomson-CSF.
At the other end of the spectrum from Philips, Thomson-CSF is resigned to
staying in defence, even if the business declines. 'Lower sales are not
really a cause for concern,' Mr Alain Gomez, its chairman, said recently.
'What counts isn't so much market size as market share.' He believes that
defence activity will pick up by 1995 and that by then 'there will have been
a shake-out in terms of competition.'
Conversion into civilian sectors is no easy proposition for defence
companies, although groups such as GEC are trying to build on the
non-military applications that have already been found for defence-related
technologies such as microwave systems. Aerospace companies were counting on
growth in the civil aviation market to reduce their dependence on defence,
but were hit by the fall in airline activity at the time of the Gulf crisis.
British Aerospace's recent troubles stemmed from difficulties in its
civilian activities rather than in defence, which accounts for more than 40
per cent of sales. It slipped from 210 to 266 in the FT500.
Daimler-Benz's subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace - formed in 1989 to include the
airframe company MBB - has a similar reliance on defence, expected to take
up 46 per cent of sales this year. But it aims to reduce the figure to 25
per cent by 2000.
The concentration of German defence interests under Daimler-Benz is the most
pronounced example of a European trend over the past four years. Takeovers
and mergers have taken place principally within national borders. These
include GEC's absorption of Plessey's naval and avionics activities and a
large part of Ferranti International, and the pooling of avionics businesses
between Thomson-CSF and France's state-owned Aerospatiale .
There have been some cross-border initiatives such as the step-by-step
creation of a Franco-German helicopter company, Eurocopter, between
Aerospatiale and MBB. On the other hand, an ambitious joint missile venture
between Thomson-CSF and British Aerospace failed to materialise.
The industry remains fragmented along national lines. Up to now defence
supplies have fallen outside the scope of European Community rules. Although
international competition in the main European markets has increased, it
principally affects components rather than whole weapon systems such as
tanks or warships.
The number of defence contractors in the FT500 has shrunk. Several companies
have dropped out, including Saab-Scania (taken back into private ownership)
and Nobel Industries of Sweden, Matra of France, the Swiss armaments company
Oerlikon-Buehrle, the German frigate maker Bremer Vulkan, Dowty of the UK
and the Anglo-French software group Sema, which has placed its defence
interests in a joint venture with BAe.
Twenty companies remain in this year's FT500 with significant involvement in
defence. But only three have made marked improvements in their rankings by
stock market value: Thomson-CSF, moving from 209th to 164th, the avionics
producer Smiths Industries (up to 342 from 401), and - a company with more
of a tradition than current activity in defence - Hawker Siddeley, recently
prey to a takeover by BTR. Alcatel Alsthom, another group with only marginal
defence interests, GEC and Thorn EMI have moved up a few places.
The other 14 have all slipped. These include Daimler-Benz, Siemens (which
bolstered its defence side by buying parts of Plessey). Fiat, Ericsson,
Philips, Mannesmann (which controls the German tank maker Krauss-Maffei) and
Thyssen. British defence suppliers that have dropped in the rankings are
Rolls-Royce, Pilkington (which has sold a half stake in its military
electro-optical activities to Thomson-CSF), British Aerospace, Lucas, GKN,
Smiths Industries, Racal and Vickers.
To what extent any of these changes are a reflection of companies' defence
prospects is hard to know. But there are certainly no defence contractors
among the new entrants to the list.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (15): Pharmaceuticals enjoy good
health - Chemicals / The rise of the drugs companies has been almost
miraculous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES in performance between the dynamic European pharmaceuticals
companies and their more sluggish chemical counterparts are all too apparent
from the results of this year's FT500.
Buoyed by ageing populations and increasingly expensive and sophisticated
drugs, the pharmaceuticals groups have proved to be inoculated against the
insidious slowdown of the western economies.
The rise of the pharmaceuticals companies has been almost miraculous. While
other industries have been struck down by the recession, most top European
drugs companies have reported sales growth averaging about 13 per cent over
the past 12 months. These have been the ultimate counter-cyclical stocks.
Any fund manager without pharmaceutical stocks in their portfolio during
1991 is now feeling pretty sick. The capitalisation ratings given by
European markets to the drugs companies reflect their charmed status. Many
are positioned far higher in the FT500 than chemical giants with sales many
times their turnover.
Glaxo, for example, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group and the world's
number two, has clambered up the table from 10th to third - an impressive
achievement for such a large company. Over the past year Glaxo's market
capitalisation has doubled to Dollars 35.4bn while sales increased 6.9 per
cent to Dollars 4.9bn. Meanwhile, sales at ICI were Dollars 22.2bn - four
times greater than Glaxo's - but its capitalisation was only Dollars 16.2bn.
Other pharmaceuticals groups benefiting from the markets' approval include
Wellcome, the fastest-growing company in the fast-growing British
pharmaceutical sector. Wellcome recorded one of the sector's most impressive
leaps this year, doubling its market capitalisation and moving from 64th to
27th. This autumn, the company posted a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits for the year to August 31.
Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham moved from 23rd to 17th after its
pharmaceuticals sales offset disappointing performance in consumer products.
Roche, the Swiss group, remained steady in 18th position compared with 17th
last year. And Astra, the highly-rated and rapidly-expanding Swedish group,
clambered from 48th to 37th. There is no company above Astra in the FT500
with a lower turnover.
Although pharmaceuticals companies and their chemicals counterparts share
the same scientific base, their industrial and financial performances could
hardly have proved more different.
Bulk chemical companies have had a dreadful year. Margins have been squeezed
as demand fell, prices collapsed and environmental costs soared. Meanwhile,
new capacity ordered during the boom times of the late 1908s continued to
come on stream, depressing prices further.
Some groups managed to escape through the performance of their
pharmaceutical divisions. At ICI, for example, pharmaceuticals generated 75
per cent of the company's pre-tax profits last quarter. That sort of
achievement, together with the company's rationalisation programme and a
little bit of bid froth whipped up by Hanson's 2.8 per cent stake, allowed
ICI to move from 19th to 16th place.
Similarly, Bayer, the highest rated of the big three German chemical groups,
now generates about half of its profits through pharmaceuticals. Mr John
Doree, chemicals analyst at Hoare Govett, believes this has helped the
company's shares gain 25 per cent over the past 12 months compared with a 10
per cent rise in the Dax index.
But Bayer's achievements are in marked contrast with those of BASF and
Hoechst whose shares have gained only 8 per cent and 6 per cent respectively
during the past year. Not surprisingly, Bayer moved up in the FT500 from
31st to 28th, while Hoechst fell six places to 45th and BASF also dropped
six places to 46th.
New entries to the FT500 included Institut Merieux of France and Gehe of
Germany. Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals and defence group slipped
out of the ratings as did UCB, the Belgian company and EMS-Chimie of
Switzerland.
Over the next 12 months, analysts will be looking carefully for any sign of
recovery in the world economy. The question is whether an upturn will be
sufficient to overcome over-capacity problems in the chemical industry. If
it is, then the bulk chemical companies, with their highly cyclical
exposure, could prove useful investments. Similarly, the pharmaceuticals
stocks could start underperforming the market. Timing will prove crucial.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (16): United European front looks
doubtful - Electronics / The future for Europe's electronics companies seems
to lie in deals with stronger partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE options for Europe's struggling electronics companies are closing fast.
Collaboration on a grand scale to share research, development and marketing
costs and present a united front against US and Far Eastern competition is
looking increasingly doubtful either in semiconductors or computers.
Siemens of Germany, for example, announced in mid-year that it intended to
collaborate with International Business Machines of the US in the design and
fabrication of the next generation of semiconductor memories.
The deal effectively put paid to hopes that Europe's three large
semiconductor makers - Siemens, Philips of The Netherlands and the
French-Italian combination SGS-Thomson - could be persuaded to join forces
to create a company with the resources to compete on a world scale.
With the loss of the UK computer manufacturer ICL to Fujitsu of Japan last
year and the sale by Philips of its minicomputer interests to Digital
Equipment hopes finally died that a European-owned computer giant could be
formed from the indigenous suppliers, Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany, Olivetti
of Italy and Groupe Bull of France.
The commercial logic behind such a merging of computer interests has always
been doubtful. None of the European suppliers - with the possible exception
of Siemens - has ever been strong enough to have a guaranteed future
unaided. Now all are losing money heavily.
Siemens, which fell two places in the FT500 to ninth, has seen a renaissance
in computers in recent years. Two years ago it was making small but
consistent profits. Its agreement to merge its computer interests with those
of the loss-making Nixdorf Information Systems, however, resulted in a
company awash with red ink. Returning the company to profit is likely to
take much longer than chief executive Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig anticipated at
the time of the merger.
Groupe Bull lost more than FFr6bn (Dollars 1.11bn) last year and is not
expected to return to the black for at least a further 12 months after
drastic cost cutting and reorganisation - the 'Transformation Plan' put in
place by chief executive Mr Francis Lorenz.
Olivetti (dropped in ranking from 178th to 375th) slipped into loss this
year after some years of steadily declining profitability. The company has
been struggling, unsuccessfully, to persuade the Italian government to
modify its employment laws to accelerate the rate at which it can cut staff.
In the past few months Olivetti chairman Mr Carlo De Benedetti, credited
with having turned the moribund typewriter manufacturer into the leading
European office systems company in the 1980s, has announced he is returning
to take day-to-day control of the company in an effort to turn its fortunes.
A conclusion must be that merging the interests of weak companies will only
accelerate their decline. The wind has changed in Brussels, moreover. The
European-owned group can expect little financial help from the Community.
Industry ministers meeting in Brussels late last year promised support for
Europe's electronics companies but shied away from endorsing direct
subsidies.
The Commission is looking hard at French proposals to provide FFr6bn to help
Groupe Bull carry out its Transformation Plan and update its technology. ICL
of the UK and Siemens of Germany are particularly critical of such subsidies
which, they believe, distort competition.
What the Commission is essentially promising is to create fair conditions in
which European companies can compete at home and abroad. Mr Michel
Carpentier, director-general for the informatics industries, told a
conference last year: 'We consider it essential that European companies have
equitable conditions of competition and market access for products,
investments and technologies. We strongly favour an open, multilateral
international trade system . . . where necessary, however, the Community
will have recourse to bilateral measures and will fall back on its custom
regulations and trade policy instrument if equitable conditions are not
achieved.'
The future for Europe's electronics companies seems to lie in deals with
stronger partners. The future for Europe's electronics companies seems to
lie in deals with stronger partners. The merger between Fujitsu of Japan and
the UK's ICL is one model. Its purchase by Fujitsu left it a European-based
company, managed autonomously and with its research and development
facilities intact.
It has been consistently profitable over the past few years. The reason it
seems not to have suffered the same fate as its European competitors is that
its well-publicised problems in the 1970s forced it to slim down earlier and
look for market niches where it could grow and prosper. It is now a world
leader, for example, in retail systems. More than half its revenues come
from software and computing services rather than hardware.
Another model is Siemens's collaboration with IBM in semiconductors; the aim
is to produce the next generation of silicon memory chips, each capable of
storing 16m individual bits of information. Memory chips are a fundamental
component of most electronic systems; furthermore, the discipline of
manufacturing high capacity memory gives a company the skill to innovate in
other kinds of semiconductors.
SGS-Thomson, which is state-controlled, is still seeking a partner; this
year it concluded a chip development agreement with GEC Plessey
Semiconductors of the UK and another agreement with Philips, but there is
now, seemingly, no hope of a merger with either the Dutch company or with
Siemens. One possibility is a strategic alliance with a US company such as
Hewlett-Packard, the electronics giant.
Groupe Bull is talking to a number of potential US partners including IBM,
Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard.
The problems of the hardware sector, however, tend to distract attention
from software and services where Europe is comparatively strong. Most
companies in this sector are small. The only computing services company
large enough to feature in the FT500 is Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS) of France
which, with revenues of more than Dollars 1.5bn, towers over its
competitors.
Computing services companies are moving towards systems integration, taking
prime contractor role in large hardware and software projects. It is a role
which requires size and capital. Mergers between Europe's computing services
companies to achieve the critical mass for systems integration should ensure
that CGS will not be alone in the ranking for long.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (14): Stormy year for non-life
companies - Insurance / Like their UK counterparts the French companies were
also hit by the 1990 weather, but that is hardly apparent from theirfigures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Europe's leading insurance companies, especially those with heavy exposure
to general business, had a bleak year in 1990.
The storms of January and February produced heavy claims for direct insurers
 -such as Allianz, Generali and Union des Assurances de Paris, Europe's top
three non-life companies - and reinsurers such as Munich Re, denting
profits. Allianz saw a fall in profits to Dollars 1,146.1m compared with
Dollars 1,256.5m in 1989, while profits were flat at Munich Re, which has a
cross shareholding agreement with Allianz, rising marginally to Dollars
107.1m in the 12 months ending June 30 compared with Dollars 106.4m in the
previous year.
Generali, Italy's number one and Europe's number two, suffered a 15 per cent
fall in profits to Dollars 431.1m. The impact was heavier on the UK
companies, which labour under a harsher tax and reserving regime, and were
also hit by the impact of subsidence and recession-related claims.
BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, saw profits cut by
half to Dollars 1,661.8m, with the pre-tax losses in 1990 of Eagle Star, its
general insurance subsidiary, largely responsible. Sun Alliance, Royal
Insurance, Guardian Royal Exchange and General Accident all made pre-tax
losses.
The losses seem to be one of the main reasons for the decline in the ranking
of top insurers. Allianz Holding fell two places to sixth, BAT Industries
two places to 15th, and Generali 12 places to 24th. Other UK companies,
which invest more heavily in equities than their European competitors, also
suffered: Sun Alliance, the strongest non-life company, fell 14 places to
103rd, with a capitalisation of Dollars 4,645.9m, while Royal Insurance and
Guardian Royal Exchange, the weakest two of the UK's five composite
insurers, fell 49 places to 159th with a capitalisation of Dollars 3,042.8m
and 43 places to 179 with a capitalisation of Dollars 2,713m, respectively.
Scandinavian insurers also had a bad year. Baltica and Hafnia of Denmark
made losses of Dollars 311m and Dollars 77.8m, respectively, with Baltica
falling 78 places to 328 and Hafnia 122 places to 498 in terms of
capitalisation. Skandia of Sweden saw profits fall by Dollars 200m and sank
11 places to 205. Two Finnish insurers, Pohjola and Sampo, ranked 351 and
475 last year in Europe, both fell out of the top 500.
In terms of capitalisation Allianz, which during 1990 acquired Fireman's
Fund, the US industrial risks insurer, and the east German, formerly
state-owned insurer, Deutsche Versicherungs, is still by far the biggest of
Europe's insurers, a dominance which is accentuated further if its links
with Munich Re, and its quoted life insurance subsidiary, Allianz Leben, are
taken into account. Indeed, bringing those connections into the picture, the
Munich group is more than twice as big as its nearest rival, even when the
size of Generali's life insurance subsidiary, Alleanza, is included in the
Generali figure.
The Prudential Corporation (with capitalisation of Dollars 8.2bn) and BAT
Industries (which owns the highly profitable Farmers Group of the US and
Allied Dunbar, the UK life insurer) also figure in the top 10.
The most striking feature this year, however, is the inclusion of France's
leading insurers, which join the FT500 for the first time after the rules
were changed to cover companies with 25 per cent of their shares in the
hands of the public. The government privatised 25 per cent stakes in each
company in 1989.
Like their UK counterparts the French companies were also hit by the 1990
storms, but that is hardly apparent from their figures, which reflect the
strength of their reserves and the importance of government backing. Union
des Assurances de Paris, the 52nd biggest company in Europe, with a
capitalisation of Dollars 7,720.1m, is the third biggest direct insurer
(behind Allianz and Generali), but rises to second place  - above Generali -
if the broader constellation of interests around it are taken into account.
Together with Liberty Life of South Africa, UAP controls the UK life
insurer, Sun Life (capitalisation Dollars 1,317m). It has a 37 per cent
direct interest in Belgium's biggest insurer, Royal Belge (capitalisation
Dollars 1,752.3m) and a 34 per cent stake in Groupe Victoire, which is part
of the Compagnie Financiere de Suez financial conglomerate.
Groupe des Assurances National is 63rd in Europe (with a capitalisation of
Dollars 6,707.2m) - the figure takes into account the acquisition of the UK
life insurer, General Portfolio, at the end of 1989. Assurances Generales de
France is 95th (with capitalisation of Dollars 4,921m). Axa, the private
group whose listed subsidiaries are controlled by a mutually-owned holding
company, is 88th in Europe (with capitalisation of Dollars 5,108m).
All four companies have been increasing their market share in the
competitive industrial risks market, especially in the UK, where Axa is said
to have been an especially active player.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (13): Simplicity pays in a
challenging year - Banking / Of the 68 banks listed in the FT500, 42 move
down the rankings compared with their positions in 1990
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FEW European bankers can recall a year as challenging as the past one, when
many of them suffered big losses on loans while confronting a raft of
strategic issues.
Banks in the UK and Scandinavia were forced to make record provisions to
cover the risk of loss on loans to companies and individuals. In France and
Italy, fears escalated that their banks will soon face losses of a similar
magnitude.
Meanwhile, most European bankers were forced to face up to three key
strategic questions:
How should they broaden the range of services they offer?
How should they take advantage of the single market to be formed at the end
of this year in the European Community?
Should they expand into eastern Europe?
The problems faced by banks are clearly reflected in the FT500. Of the 68
banks listed in the table, 42 move down the rankings compared with their
positions in 1990.
Nonetheless, there is a net increase of five in the number of banks listed.
Gota Bank, the Swedish Bank hit by loan losses, drops out. Two Dutch banks,
Algemene Bank and Amro Bank, also lose their separate listing, because they
merged to form ABN Amro Bank.
The new merged bank is listed as number 84 in the league table and is the
15th biggest publicly-listed bank in Europe. Other newcomers to the FT500,
in descending order of size, are:
Banco Lariano, the Italian bank controlled by the San Paolo group
Berliner Bank, the bank based in Berlin and part owned by the municipality;
Safra Republic, the highly successful Luxembourg-registered private banking
group, set up by the multimillionaire Mr Edmond Safra;
Schroders, the UK merchant bank which specialises in corporate advisory
services;
Banco Toscana, the Italian bank controlled by Monte dei Paschi di Siena;
Hambros, the UK merchant banking group offering a diverse range of corporate
and personal services.
It is also arguable that the Dutch financial group, Internationale
Nederlande - which was formed in March by the merger of the insurance group
Nationale Nederlande with the savings bank, NMB Postbank - should be
regarded as a bank, though it is not classified in the FT500 as such.
The creation of Internationale Nederlande was the most spectacular example
of a trend which touched the whole of the European banking industry - the
fusion of banking and insurance.
Banks realised that many insurance products - especially life policies  -
were in essence savings products and could therefore be slotted comfortably
alongside their traditional banking products. At the same time, insurance
companies recognised that banks' networks of branches gave the banks a
competitive advantage in selling savings products.
So a number of banks and insurance companies formed close links. In the UK,
National Westminster Bank formed a joint venture with Clerical Medical, a
mutual life company. Another British bank, Abbey National, bought a small
life office, Scottish Mutual.
However, other European banks, such as Deutsche Bank in Germany and Credit
Agricole in France, have had a notable success by creating their own
insurance operations from scratch.
Meanwhile, there were no big mergers of banks across borders within the EC.
Banks recognise that there is an opportunity to make incremental profits by
selling services throughout the EC - taking advantage of the single European
market - but to date they have tended to make only small acquisitions in
other EC countries or have formed loose alliances with foreign peers.
Barclays, the biggest UK bank, bought Europeene de Banque, the Paris-based
private bank. Meanwhile, Dresdner, Germany's second biggest bank, and Banque
Nationale de Paris, the second biggest French bank, began talks to form a
link, with each bank taking a 10 per cent stake in the other.
Nonetheless, for all their need to focus on long-term strategy, most
European bankers had their hands full preventing the worldwide slowdown in
economic growth from prompting unsustainable loan losses.
A recession and property slump which has lasted four years prompted the
Norwegian government to organise a rescue of its entire banking system.
There is not a single Norwegian bank in the FT500, which reflects the degree
of state ownership of the banks there and the sharp fall in their market
values. Swedish and Finnish banks also plummeted down the rankings, as they
made severe losses on loans to their property and finance sectors.
Meanwhile, UK banks are about to enter their fourth successive half-year of
record loan losses. UK banks have been making provisions to cover possible
credit losses equal to more than 2 per cent of the value of their domestic
loans - which is a rate of provisioning never seen since the banks started
to disclose their profits.
UK banks have been hurt because they granted far too much credit in the the
mid to late eighties, both to companies and to individuals. There have been
some spectacular collapses of big companies - the late Mr Robert Maxwell's
private companies are the latest example. But in 1991, the decimation of
small- and medium-size businesses did the most damage to UK banks'
profitability.
Analysts are concerned that French banks may be about to suffer big losses.
Like their UK peers, they expanded their loan books by around 20 per cent a
year in the late eighties and acquired significant exposures to the UK and
US property sectors, now in recession, and to international companies with
big borrowings.
So where are Europe's stronger banks? They tend to be in Germany,
Switzerland and Spain, where domestic markets have been fairly closed to
outside competition, where economies have remained relatively buoyant and
where banks have a conservative lending culture.
Swiss banks have not had a happy experience when venturing overseas.
In Spain, where the banking market was for decades wholly protected from any
competition, there are signs that liberalisation may erode the astonishingly
high profitability of the banks.
So what is the lesson for bankers of 1991? Banks that have done best - such
as Abbey National in the UK, Svenska Handelsbank in Sweden or Banco Popular
in Spain - have concentrated on serving their traditional markets while
keeping their overheads low. In other words, simplicity pays.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (12): An awesome task lies ahead -
Eastern Europe / There is a realisation that the economies of these
countries are fragmenting faster than their political arrangements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE original assumption that the 420m people living in that vast area
between the Elbe and the Pacific Ocean constituted the last megamarket has
given way to a sense of awe at the complexity of the task ahead, and sober
realisation that the economies of most of these countries are fragmenting
even faster than their political arrangements.
In 1991, direct private investment in eastern Europe was no more than
Dollars 3bn and just over half of that flowed into Hungary, which has
emerged as the tip of the eastern ice-breaker. Clearly, investment on this
scale is not sufficient to have any discernible effect on the FT500. But in
the longer run some of the European companies now taking the plunge, or at
least dipping their toes, in this extraordinarily complex area have made
strategic choices which will ultimately strengthen their role as global
players.
It is too early at this stage to spot eastern European companies which might
emerge after privatisation as future members in their own right of the
FT500, although the most likely candidates could be the new, vertically
integrated, oil and chemical companies which are supposed to emerge in
Russia with the abolition of the old ministerial monopoly structures.
It is also conceivable that some of the Soviet megafactories, such as the
Kamaz truck plant in Tartaria, could find their way into the FT500 as they
forge links with western companies willing to trade injections of capital
and know-how for ready-made access to the Russian and post-Soviet republican
markets.
But the speed with which this huge area spawns new private companies is
dependent upon an infinite number of unpredictable political and other
variables. One crucial variable is the rate of progress towards the
privatisation of state-owned companies. Here, as in so many other areas, the
frontrunners are the three central European countries of Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia which became associate members of the European Community in
December.
But even among the frontrunners, as Mr Jacques Attali, president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pointed out recently, the
slow pace of foreign investment is directly linked to the slow pace at which
privatisation of large companies is taking place. This, in turn, is a result
of the enormous legal and organisational problems involved in establishing
clear ownership rights. Other problem areas include the accounting,
evaluation and actuarial difficulties involved in establishing the value of
assets.
Sorting out these problems has provided a huge growth area for western
accountants, bankers, and other professional firms who are the busy foot
soldiers in the gigantic enterprise of changing the management culture from
that of the former command economy.
Meanwhile, a few areas have emerged where leading European companies are
making the strategic investments designed to bolster their global position.
The targeted industries include the automotive industry, telecommunications,
power generation equipment, chemicals, anti-pollution equipment,
construction materials - especially glass and cement - and pharmaceuticals.
The biggest single investment has been connected with Volkswagen's purchase
of a 70 per cent stake in the Czech automobile company, Skoda, and its much
smaller investment in the small Bratislava-based BAZ plant in Slovakia.
However, only a relatively small portion of the nearly Dollars 7bn to be
invested in making a new VW-Skoda model and upgrading the business will come
from VW directly, as the bulk will be raised from local and foreign banks.
Volkswagen's decision to invest in a new, low labour cost production centre
was part of its Europe-wide competition with Fiat for number one slot in the
European car market.
Fiat, with its long-standing involvement in the Polish and Soviet motor
industries, took a similar decision to invest Dollars 1.36bn in Poland,
buying a 51 per cent stake in the FSM company in which Fiat has invested
heavily to produce the new Cinquecento model for Europe-wide sale. Fiat has
also been involved in negotiations for a stake in Autovaz, the largest
Soviet car maker, which has been producing Fiat models at Togliatti for more
than two decades.
But it is in the electrical engineering field that some of the canniest
manoeuvring has taken place as Siemens of Germany, the Swiss-Swedish ABB,
GEC Alsthom, the UK-French group, and others have focused on a sector with
perhaps the greatest growth potential in coming decades. In November,
Siemens emerged as the victor from a year-long competition with ABB and
Westinghouse for a wide-ranging co-operation deal with Skoda Pilsen,
Czechoslovakia's heavy nuclear and conventional engineering company.
ABB, which has taken over a clutch of companies employing more than 10,000
people, has specialised in investments involving relatively small amounts of
capital but large injections of management know-how linked to large-scale
re-training of local staff up to the general levels of competence of the
rest of the group.
Meanwhile, recognition that average real incomes in the region are likely to
decline further has influenced the investment plans of other consumer
sectors. Most investments have been small-scale, cautious and altogether
insufficient to have a significant effect on any European company's relative
standing in the FT500. But they reflect the fact that the past two years
have seen emergence of a growing market for western consumer products as
wages and incomes have started to diverge significantly after decades of
egalitarianism which kept overall wages low and wage differentials small.
The growing class of new-rich traders, entrepreneurs and professional people
are demanding high-class imported products, and even ordinary people are
making sacrifices to acquire the individual high-quality item.
The hunger for a wide range of branded consumer goods, demonstrated most
vividly in the display of imported goods at newly-privatised retail outlets
and markets in Poland and Hungary, has attracted investment in areas such as
processed foods and detergents where the multinationals have been busy
seeking local partners to form a basis for expansion.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (11): Mergers transform financial
sector - The Netherlands - Trend towards concentration gathers pace among
insurers and banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

<TEXT>
THE two biggest Dutch companies in this year's FT500 (excluding the
Anglo-Dutch giants Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever) are newcomers to the
annual rankings, yet they are also very much part of the Netherlands
corporate establishment.
This seeming paradox is easily explained: both entries '
Internationale-Nederlanden Groep (ING), the financial services company, and
ABN Amro, the country's biggest bank ' are the product of two recent, huge
corporate mergers between four of the Netherlands's best-known institutions,
underscoring the rapid and radical transformation of the Dutch financial
sector.
The birth of ING is a compelling illustration of just how quickly the trend
towards concentration has gathered pace among Dutch insurers and banks over
the past two years. NMB Postbank, the country's third-largest bank which
merged with the Netherlands's biggest insurer Nationale-Nederlanden to
produce the new combine in early 1991, was itself the product of a merger
just a year earlier.
The emergence of ING also testifies to another new trend in the Dutch world
of finance ' the development of the 'All-Finanz' concept, in which insurers
and banks combine to create a financial services 'supermarket' in the hope
of attracting the consumer to a wide range of financial products.
Of the Netherlands's three leading insurers, only Aegon has yet to forge a
link with a bank. Amev, the third-largest Dutch insurer, earlier took over
VSB, the Netherlands's biggest savings bank group, before merging with the
Belgian insurer AG to form Fortis, which enters the FT500 for the first time
this year in 167th place.
Apart from the creation of Fortis, the recent series of big mergers has not
involved cross-border link-ups, belying earlier expectations in the
Netherlands that there would be a wave of European corporate marriages in
the run-up to 1992 and the EC single market. A clear preference for local
partners has emerged, at least in the short term, though the long-term
rationale behind most of the financial-sector mergers has been a desire to
create a springboard for European acquisitions.
This tendency to seek out local rather than foreign merger partners is best
illustrated by the merger between ABN Bank and Amro Bank, now called ABN
Amro. Before entering negotiations with ABN, Amro had been involved in an
ill-fated attempt to arrive at a full link-up with its Belgian counterpart
Generale de Banque. This proposed bi-national merger foundered on cultural
differences and the lack of common European corporate legislation.
Still, the Netherlands may yet see a big European link-up, one which would
bring substantial changes to future FT500s. In late 1991, KLM, the
Netherlands's flag carrier, confirmed that it was engaged in talks on a
far-reaching partnership with British Airways. These talks, if successful,
could result in the creation of a formidable European mega-carrier.
An outright merger is less likely than a construction which would enable
both KLM and BA to retain their separate legal identities and stock market
listings. If this indeed proves to be the case, KLM and BA will be following
in the successful Anglo-Dutch traditions of Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever,
ranked first and fifth respectively in the FT500.
The Dutch companies in this year's rankings provide a good mini-portrait of
the Netherlands's corporate sector. The Netherlands, which was late to
industrialise in the 19th century, is strongest in trade, services and
agriculture-related activities. Of the 16 purely Dutch companies included
this year, the only industrial concerns are Philips, the electronics
company; Akzo and DSM, the chemicals companies; KNP, the paper group; and
Buhrmann-Tetterode, the packaging and graphic equipment company.
In addition to these companies, the financial sector groups and KLM, other
entries include two Dutch publishing houses with strong international
connections, Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer, as well as Heineken, the brewery
group, and Ahold, a food retailer which generates half of its sales along
the US east coast. A new entry at number 494, the food company Nutricia, is
due in part to the good performance of the food sector on the Amsterdam
stock exchange in 1991.
The inclusion of two property investment groups, Rodamco and Wereldhave,
testifies to the Netherlands's long-standing involvement in overseas
investment, an area forced upon it by the severely limited size of its home
market. Rodamco, part of the Rotterdam-based Robeco investment group, saw
its ranking plummet to 132nd place from 77th in 1990.
The sharp drop is a consequence of Rodamco's sudden decision in September
1990 to suspend its previous policy of making daily purchases and disposals
of its own shares on the Amsterdam bourse to ensure that its share price was
always equivalent to the prevailing net asset value of its property
portfolio. By retracting this guarantee, Rodamco effectively transformed
itself from an open-end into a close-end fund. Since then, its shares have
traded at a discount of 20 per cent or more to net asset value, accounting
for the steep decline in Rodamco's market capitalisation between mid-1990
and mid-1991.
Although the FT500 offers a capsule view of the corporate sector, its
measurement of companies by market capitalisation means it does not include
family-owned concerns or those organised along co-operative lines, such as
Rabobank, the Netherlands's second-largest bank. Like its bourse-listed
rivals, Rabobank was also converted to the concept of 'All-Finanz' when it
took full control over Interpolis, a co-operatively-owned insurer, in 1990.
Because of the strength of Dutch agriculture in particular, co-operatives '
ranging from dairy organisations to flower and plant auctions ' play a large
role in the economy. Their structure, however, makes it difficult for
co-operatives to issue shares that can be traded on the stock market.
Later this year, OPG, a pharmaceuticals purchasing co-operative owned by
more than 2,000 Dutch chemists, hopes to become the first Dutch co-operative
to get around this problem and launch a share flotation in Amsterdam. OPG's
solution is to establish a trust company and make it an extraordinary member
of the co-operative. The trust company, in turn, acquires participation
certificates in the co-operative (including a right to future dividends) and
uses these as a basis for issuing shares to the public.
In the absence of any substantial state holdings in industry left to
privatise, this formula, if successful, could potentially become one of the
Amsterdam bourse's most important vehicles for attracting new listings in
the 1990s.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (9): Denmark bucks the downward
trend - Nordic Region - The majority of companies experienced a substantial
fall in market capitalisation, particularly those in Finland and Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE majority of Nordic-based companies listed in the FT500 experienced a
substantial fall in market capitalisation, particularly those in Finland and
Sweden. Only Denmark bucked the overall downward trend with a relatively
impressive performance, reflecting the country's economic achievements.
Most of Sweden's leading companies experienced severe troubles during 1991
with declining production, investments and profitability. Eight disappeared
from the FT500 - NCC, the construction group, Nobel Industries, the office
equipment company Esselte, Gota bank group, the cement company Euroc, and
Cardo, the investment company.
Saab-Scania, the motor and aerospace company, left the bourse after all its
shares were acquired by the Wallenberg family-dominated investment
companies. In November, it was announced that Investor and Providentia were
to be merged into one company early this year. The other large company to
leave the bourse was the dairy company Alfa Laval as a result of its
acquisition by the Swiss-based packaging firm Tetra Pak.
Four new corporate entrants appeared from Sweden - Gambro, the
pharmaceuticals company, the newly-floated Wallenberg industrial group
Incentive, and the Wallenberg investment companies Investor and Providentia.
It is indicative of Sweden's dismal industrial scene that only three of the
29 Swedish companies in the FT500 improved their relative positions during
the year.
The successful pharmaceuticals company Astra climbed from 48th to 37th to
become the highest placed Swedish company. In the first nine months of the
year its profits rose by 40 per cent to SKr2.58bn (Dollars 447m), due mainly
to the continuing rise in demand for its anti-ulcer drug Losec.
The food and pharmaceuticals conglomerate Procordia - owned jointly by Volvo
and the Swedish state - rose nine places from 58th to 49th. Its earnings
rose by 23 per cent in the first nine months of 1991 to Skr3.08bn.
The only other Swedish company to climb up the table was the insurance
conglomerate Trygg-Hansa SPP, which was formed after a merger earlier in the
year. The new conglomerate rose impressively to 321st from its 1990 ranking
of 417th when Trygg-Hansa first entered the table after its flotation on the
Stockholm bourse in December 1989. Its profits for the first eight months of
the year totalled Skr1.5bn, a quadrupling of its figure in 1990, mainly
because of the improved performance of its investment portfolio.
By contrast, a number of Swedish companies suffered sharp falls in relative
market capitalisation during 1991. The troubled state-controlled Nordbanken
dropped the largest number of places from 200th to 476th. This reflected the
market's response to its mounting credit losses that look likely to total
nearly SKr10bn for the year, ensuring the bank has a group deficit of around
SKr4.6bn.
The largest construction company in the Nordic region, Skanska, also dropped
back to 169th position from 93rd in 1990. Its profits declined to SKr1.19bn
from SKr1.71bn for the first eight months of the year, reflecting the fall
in real estate prices and slump in the building trade.
The mineral and industrial conglomerate Trelleborg - one of Sweden's
corporate success stories of the 1980s - declined as well, dropping to 422nd
from 312th.
The corporate picture was even more dismal in Finland during 1991. This
reflected the country's worst recession since 1917 with the virtual collapse
of its once-important Soviet trade, a cyclical trough in the paper and pulp
industry, soaring bank credit losses, and a slump in engineering production
and investment. The combination of these adverse economic factors forced the
Helsinki bourse into a sharp decline.
Fewer than half the Finnish-based companies listed in the 1990 FT500
re-appear this time. Out go the state-controlled forestry group Enso
Gutzeit, the shipbuilding company Wartsila, the industrial group Rauma
Repola, Sampo and Pohjola insurance companies, the wholesalers Kesko Oy and
Partek, the building materials group.
As a result only five corporate entrants remain from Finland - the forestry
groups Repola (after the merger of United Paper Mills with Rauma-Repola) and
Kymmene; the industrial conglomerate Nokia; and two banks, Union Bank and
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP). Of those only Repola recorded an improved its
position - climbing from 485th to 325th.
By contrast, Denmark enjoyed a highly satisfactory corporate year. The
country may have an industrial structure where small and medium-sized
companies predominate but as a favourable sign of its economic success story
this year the country can boast 12 companies in the FT500, three more than
in 1990 with not one falling out of the table.
The most impressive arrival was A P Moeller, the merchant shipping company
in the form of its strange, divided structure which consists of twin parent
companies D/S af 1912 and A/S D/S Svendborg. As newcomers to the table they
appear at 141st and 142nd positions respectively. Berendsen (Sophus), a
diverse industrial company that is the parent of Rentokil was also a
newcomer to the FT500 in 1991.
Novo Nordisk, Denmark's leading pharmaceutical company which is the world's
leading producer of industrial enzymes, also performed well in 1991,
climbing 92 places to 208th position from 317th. As a producer of insulin
and diabetic care products, it now has 40 per cent of the world market in
those products. In the first nine months of 1991 the company's profits
climbed by 22 per cent to a healthy Dkr1.11bn (Dollars 181m), an indication
of the successful merger of 1989 that brought Novo and Nordisk Gentofte
together.
While corporate Denmark flourished in 1991, Norway's companies stagnated in
an economy over-dependent for its growth on the level of oil and gas prices
but with severe mainland structural problems and a banking crisis that
worsened dramatically during the year. As a result the stock market was in a
jittery and depressed mood for most of the year, reflected in its generally
low market capitalisation figures.
There were six Norwegian-based companies listed in the FT500, all of them
the same as in 1990. But only two - the pharmaceutical company Hafslund
Nycomed and Saga Petroleum - improved their relative standing in the table
rising from 286th to 227th and from 272th to 241st respectively. The others
fell down the table. The paper products group Orkla Borregaard declined to
463rd place from 411 while Bergesen dy group, the shipowners, fell back to
323rd position from 281.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (10): A new Incentive for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCENTIVE is a newcomer, in 232nd place, to this year's FT500. It is a
highly diverse Swedish industrial and investment group which was floated on
the Stockholm bourse last July for the first time after its creation out of
Asea's Swedish holdings independent of the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant
Asea Brown Boveri.
Mr Mikael Lilius, chief executive and president, has been given a clear
remit by the company's dominant Wallenberg owners - to transform Incentive
into an industrial company with its core activities based in engineering.
'We must have new habits, new traditions and a new culture,' he explains,
keen to assert that the name may be the same but the new Incentive will be
different from the old one, though even the company's own employees have
trouble understanding this.
Mr Lilius is in his element in transforming industrial companies. Before
being hand-picked for the top post by Mr Curt Nicolin, the legendary
lieutenant of the Wallenberg empire and Incentive's chairman, Mr Lilius
worked for Huhtamaki, the Finnish company, where he pushed through an
important restructuring of its activities.
His strategy for Incentive has been spelt out for everybody to appreciate.
As many as seven companies in the old Incentive group with total sales of
Skr7bn (Dollars 1.2bn) and accounting for around a quarter of its profits
are to be sold off. These include Orrefors, the high quality glassware
concern; Gense, specialists in the design and manufacture of table utensils;
and AKA the maker of environmental niche products.
'Some of our best activities are being divested,' admits Mr Lilius. 'But
these do not fit into our core strategy.' But he is in no hurry to
relinquish them and believes it will take up to two years to complete their
sale.
At the same time Incentive's remaining operations are to be concentrated in
five designated business areas - transportation; construction and
environment; materials handling; process industries; and the world famous
photographic concern, Hasselblad.
'We are strong, with total revenues of around SKr10bn,' asserts Mr Lilius.
'We are therefore in a position to grow now in our core products without
taking any major risks. You could say at the moment we have more money than
good ideas for expansion.' Although highly confident about Sweden's
industrial future once the recession is over, he believes Incentive's growth
will take place mainly abroad through acquisitions and direct production.
But the company is not going to be exclusively industrial even after the
completion of its core strategy. From a capitalisation viewpoint,
Incentive's investment portfolio will remain important. Of its shareholder's
equity capital totalling SKr17bn, as much as SKr12.5bn is at present derived
from its stock. In the first half of 1991, 70 per cent of the company's
SKr671m profits was earned from its share-holdings.
Incentive will remain the dominant share owner in Asea, where it holds 25
per cent of voting rights and share capital, in Electrolux with 48 per cent
of voting rights and 11 per cent equity, and in the world's biggest welding
company Esab, with 49 per cent voting rights and 44 per cent share capital.
Mr Lilius hopes Incentive's own industrial activities will account for an
increasingly larger part of its earnings in the future. By the mid 1990s the
company could become another aggressive Swedish player on the wider European
stage, further proof that the Wallenberg empire is not going to fall apart
in the face of increasing corporate challenges.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (8): Uncertainty constrains
performances - Italy / Share prices reflected adverse internal factors and
poor economic conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS INVESTORS and stockbrokers face up to Italy's 'big bang', now getting
under way with the demise of traditional stockbrokers, the birth of
securities intermediation firms and the start of continuous screen-based
trading, they can derive little satisfaction from the performance of shares
listed on the Milan market.
Activity has been racked by uncertainty over the past two years. Sentiment
has been depressed. Trading volumes have been low and share price indices
have reflected a combination of adverse internal factors and poor general
economic conditions. It is against this background that Italian
representation in the FT500 should be read.
At the end of September 1991, Milan's MIB general share index, which is
reset to 1,000 at the start of each year, stood at 1,042. However, this
modest improvement on the year's beginning was more than wiped out by
December, although the drop did not match the mauling that share prices
suffered in 1990, with the MIB general index closing at 750 on the last
trading day of the year.
The MIB performed particularly badly in the second half of 1990. After
peaking at 1,113 in mid-June, it fell sharply and gains made in 1988 and
1989 were lost. Capitalisation of shares quoted on the Milan board totalled
L168,135bn (Dollars 141bn) at year-end 1990, a drop of 21.9 per cent
compared to L215,244bn on December 31, 1989.
Share prices had already started to slide when the Gulf crisis broke in
August 1990. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait helped the downward movement that
started in July when the MIB fell by 3.1 per cent after registering advances
in four successive months. The 11.8 per cent drop in August was followed by
further falls of between 5 and 6 per cent in each of the next three months,
with 1990's low of 725 being touched on 27 November.
However, the Gulf crisis was not the only adverse factor affecting the Milan
stock market and Italian share prices in 1990 and 1991. Though long
expected, the introduction of legislation to tax capital gains also
contributed to the depressed tone.
'The taxation of gains arising from equity trading, implemented through a
decree law in autumn 1990, was a new disturbance for the Borsa. It led to
further reduction in trading levels and encouraged Italian operators to work
increasingly on foreign stock markets,' says Attilio Ventura, chairman of
the Milan stockbrokers' executive committee. He notes that after a long
wait, the market had expected the legislators to produce a much better
drafted bill.
Leading broker Paolo Azzoni considers that the Gulf crisis and the saga of
Italy's capital gains tax were only part of the reason for Milan's poor
showing. 'The capital gains tax decree affected trading volumes,' he says,
pointing to falls of 14, 11 and 16 per cent that were recorded in September,
October and November 1990.
'But prices have been hit more by economic fundamentals. By autumn 1990 many
operators were concerned that the Italian economy would not escape
recession. Lower dividend earnings were expected. In addition, Italy's
situation is aggravated by a budget deficit problem that keeps interest
rates high. Monetary policy cannot be eased to alleviate the recession,'
comments Mr Azzoni.
Already facing a severe set of negative factors, confidence in Milan's stock
market was dealt a further blow with the failure of Lombardfin. This led to
a week's delay in September 1990's settlement. Earlier that year, the
failure of Commissionaria Oggioni had held up March's settlement for 10
days. More recently, the difficulties of two brokers and Commissionaria
Misafin caused the August 30, 1991 settlement to slip to September 10.
Movements in the prices of leading industrial stocks reflected an
increasingly gloomy business climate in 1990 and a worsening in 1991.
Turin-based Fiat, Italy's largest private sector corporation, has suffered
badly. With more than half of turnover generated by automobile sales and
approximately a further quarter from buses, trucks and components, Fiat is
vulnerable to downturns in these sectors.
A combination of erosion of domestic market share by imported cars and
fiercely competitive international markets hit Fiat. Its net revenues from
automobiles declined in 1990 and operating profit in this sector slumped by
nearly two thirds. With prospects giving no cause for optimism, the price of
Fiat ordinary shares fell by more than one half in 1990, dropping from
L11,135 to L5,351. At the end of September 1991, Fiat's shares stood at
L5,200. Its FT500 ranking has plummeted; from 15th place Fiat falls to 53rd.
Office automation equipment maker Olivetti, another prestigious name and
industrial blue chip on the Milan board feeling the effects of the worldwide
crisis in the computer industry, has suffered an equally sharp setback.
Starting 1990 at L7,415, the price of Olivetti ordinary shares lost 57 per
cent to finish at L3,220. The decline in 1991 took the price to L2,920 at
September 30. Olivetti's place in the FT500 rankings falls from 178 to 375.
Olivetti chief Carlo de Benedetti experienced similar disappointments
elsewhere in his business empire. The price of shares in Compagnie
Industriali Riunite (CIR) crashed from L4,970 to L2,512 in 1990, slipping
further to L2,285 at the end of September 1991. CIR's FT500 ranking drops
from 207 to 435, while Cofide falls out of the list.
Pirelli and Company also left the FT500, having previously been ranked at
363. In common with its sister company and other Italian industrials, shares
in Pirelli SpA took a beating in 1990. But Pirelli SpA stays in the
rankings, though at 362 it is significantly lower than the previous year's
257.
Shares in Italy's financial sector and utilities generally fared somewhat
better than industrials, but have nevertheless received harsh treatment.
The price of shares in Generali Assicurazioni, the Trieste insurer which is
the country's most capitalised corporation and heads Italy's presence in the
FT500, started 1990 at L33,151, rose to a maximum of L41,000 and then fell
sharply to L27,400 at year-end. The fall continued in 1991, and the price
stood at L25,800 at the end of September. Generali slips from 12th place to
24th in the FT500.
Performance of bank shares reflected the dull business environment.
Shareholders in merchant bank Mediobanca saw the value of their investments
decline significantly during 1990, as the price of shares dropped by 28 per
cent from L18,500 on the first day of trading to L13,260 at year-end. Though
the price recovered to L15,020 at the end of September 1991, Mediobanca's
place in the FT500 slips from 73 to 117. Leading retail bank Banca
Commerciale Italiana also lost ground and its FT500 ranking drops from 133
to 166.
The prices of most quoted companies were down in 1990, and there was little
progress in the first nine months of 1991. With the MIB index recording an
overall retreat that compares unfavourably with other main European markets,
the FT500 consequently registers a decline in the placings of Italian
companies. Excluding eight newcomers, only four Italian companies improve
their positions, while 22 fall back.
How does Italy stand in the rankings? Taking into consideration the seven
companies that slipped from the list, its representation remained at 33.
Clearly the number of ranked quoted companies remains anomalously small for
a leading European country. Italy has no companies in the top 10 and, with
Generali Assicurazioni the largest at 24th place, only one in the top 50. In
the new rankings only three Italian companies appear in the top 100, against
five previously.
There were no significant changes over the year, and the features that
characterised the Milan stock market and Italy's presence in the FT500 12
months ago remain. With only 220 quoted companies, the Borsa lacks depth. It
is also incestuous, with numerous companies interlinked through
cross-holdings, and dominated by a few family groups and state-controlled
companies.
It is estimated that there are several hundred companies whose shares are
suitable for quotation. But even where cultural difficulties concerning
family ownership and management are overcome, potential newcomers are
deterred by the market's volatility and poor reputation.
The Borsa is small and, as the FT500 clearly reveals, the companies quoted
on it are themselves small when measured against a continental scale. This
year's FT500 reflects poor performance of the Milan index relative to share
price indices in other European markets. But, beyond this, the rankings show
that building globally-sized companies is proving hard for Italian business.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (7): Acquisitions give companies a
lift - France / The leaders in Europe's third largest stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S top quoted companies have continued their steady march up the FT500
league, partly reflecting their position as some of the busiest acquirers in
Europe, in some cases leading the concentration of their industrial sector.
In part, they were also helped by the relatively strong performance of the
French stock market in 1991, which led to an overall performance between the
two FT500 cut-off points that outstripped rival markets, notably Germany and
Italy.
By the end of October, the French main market included 556 domestically
incorporated companies, down from 578 a year previously and 229 foreign
listings, up slightly from 226 at the end of October 1990, according to the
Societe des Bourses Francaises.
It is Europe's third largest stock market with a capitalisation of
FFr1,879bn (Dollars 340bn). However, it is still small in relation to the
size of the French economy and the market in many of the top companies'
shares can be very limited due to the often large stakes - so called noyaux
durs - held by loyal shareholders.
On the takeover front, British companies were the biggest European buyers
abroad in 1990, according to a recent study by KPMG, the accounting group,
but the French slipped into the lead in the first nine months of 1991. They
spent Dollars 5.9bn abroad in the nine months to September, Dollars 1bn more
than their British counterparts, says KPMG.
Among the most notable cross-border deals are the FFr12.5bn unsolicited
takeover of Square D, the US electrical distribution group, by Schneider,
the French electrical equipment company, and the FFr3.8bn takeover of the
transmission equipment division of Rockwell International by Alcatel
Alsthom, the telecommunications and engineering giant. Also falling into the
period covered by the FT500 is the partial merger of Sanofi, the
pharmaceuticals subsidiary of oil group Elf Aquitaine, with Sterling Drug of
the US.
In two of these three case, these deals have been reflected in a further
rise in the buyers' rankings. Elf rose seven places to take 13th position,
where it consolidates its position as the largest French quoted company in
the FT 500, with its market capitalisation of Dollars 17.4bn, also
reflecting a strong profits performance.
It is followed by Alcatel, which changed its name during the period from the
unwieldy Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, and moved up four places to 23rd.
Schneider, by contrast, tumbled from 196th to 269th, a reflection of the
continuing impact of economic downturn on its construction and engineering
subsidiaries.
France was relatively late in joining the buoyant acquisition markets of the
late 1980s, but has made up for it with a hectic burst of activity which has
started to show through in a growing internationalisation of the French
economy. Just over 40 per cent of the staff of France's 10 top companies now
works abroad, and five of the top 10 make more than half of their sales
outside France, according to a recent survey by the Direction de Relations
Economiques Exterieures.
These include Michelin, the world's largest tyre maker, which climbed from
267th to the 210th slot, reflecting the surge in its share price as it began
to digest its 1989 takeover of Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre group, and as
the market began to accept that Michelin was prepared to take an axe to its
own and Uniroyal's costs.
There is also Thomson-CSF, the state-controlled defence electronics group
which has climbed from 209 to 164, and has made a whole range of
partnerships with other European defence suppliers. Saint-Gobain, the glass
and pipes concern which last year bought Norton, the US abrasives group, has
had less luck, down from 65th position to 79th, reflecting the drop in
earnings and share price cause by the fall in demand in the building,
automotive and industrial supplies businesses.
The big change in this year's French listings in the FT500 is the inclusion
for the first time of companies which have at least 25 per cent of their
shares in the hands of the public. Ther previous cut-off point - 30 per cent
 -had excluded most of the state sector, with the three exceptions of Elf,
Total, the other state-controlled oil group, and Thomson-CSF. The change
reveals the real importance of French state industry.
It also coincides with the government's decision to allow sales of minority
stakes to private investors, so putting an end to President Francois
Mitterrand's freeze on privatisations and nationalisations. So there could
well be new entrants from the French state sector next year.
Now the original trio is joined by the three state insurance companies:
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), which comes in at 52, with a market
capitalisation of Dollars 7.7bn; Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN)
(63rd); and Assurances Generales de France (AGF) which makes its debut at
95. The other important new face from the state sector is Pechiney
International, the 75 per cent subsidiary of Pechiney, the state-controlled
aluminium and packaging group, which comes in at 220.
In the private sector, some of France's best known names have continued to
climb the ladder, in sectors which have shown comparative resilience to the
economic slowdown. They include LVMH the luxury goods group, up from 34th to
25th, where it is the third largest French company, followed by BSN, the
leading foods company, up from 47th to 39th.
Other reshuffles in the domestic rankings reflect takeovers and mergers,
like the link-up between Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water distribution group
and construction company Dumez, which jointly weigh in this year at number
110, or - on a smaller scale - the Pinault timber and paper group's takeover
of Conforama, France's largest furniture retailing chain.
Since the FT500 lists closed, Pinault (416th), has bid for Au Printemps, the
department store at 410. The two-thirds bid was controversial, but received
clearance from French stock exchange authorities, in spite of minority
shareholders' allegations that they were not being treated fairly. So
Pinault can be expected to climb a few more rungs this year.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (6): Breathing space after a rough
ride - Profile, Continental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE managers of Continental, the German tyre company which is the fourth
largest in the world, breathed a huge, collective sigh of relief late last
year. Its unwanted suitor, Italy's Pirelli, finally went away after a
14-month campaign aimed firstly at persuading the company and its
shareholders to agree to merge and, when that did not work, to enter into a
co-operation agreement.
Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, Continental's chief executive, did not crow about
its successful fight to remain independent. If Pirelli itself had not fallen
into financial difficulties, some form of co-operation could well have been
agreed. But he did make clear that the way was now open for the German
company to concentrate on its own homework, namely eliminating losses,
raising efficiency, and speeding up the pace of innovation.
After carrying the costs of closing down a loss-making plant in Canada,
acquired when it purchased General Tire of the US in 1987, and after setting
aside funds for future restructuring, it made a loss in 1991. But it expects
to return to profit this year. In 1990, net income slumped by 59 per cent to
DM93m (Dollars 59m) and the dividend was halved. No dividend will be paid on
last year's result.
In view of the rough ride that all tyremakers have suffered, it is hardly
surprising that Continental had an uncomfortable slide down the FT500 list.
From 301st place in the previous year, it went to number 377. Part of the
problem is the dire state of the US market, where recession has blighted
demand for new cars. Tyre companies have suffered accordingly.
Continental bought General Tire of the US in 1987 to expand its
international spread. But because of the weakness of the US automotive
industry, GT now makes heavy losses, likely to exceed Dollars 100m in the
past year. Mr von Grunberg stressed after Pirelli's withdrawal that turning
round GT was a top priority.
The German company hopes break-even point can be reached for the US
subsidiary in 1993, with GT emerging into the profit zone towards the end of
that year. But before that, Continental should benefit from an improvement
in Europe.
Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker, sees a good chance of better times. 'As a
result of cost-cutting and a more disciplined approach to prices, at least
for replacement tyres, margins in the European tyre industry will improve
considerably in 1992 and 1993.'
This will also be pleasant news for rivals such as Michelin of France, now
the biggest tyre group in the world with its US interests. It gained 57
places in the FT500 list and now ranks 210th.
Sales of winter tyres, in which Continental is strong, have risen by more
than a fifth this season; the company has also been able to raise prices.
Led by Michelin, the industry has raised prices of replacement tyres
generally by around 10 per cent in the past year.
But the companies are still subject to an intense squeeze from the motor
producers on new vehicle, or original equipment, business. Tyremakers are
not earning money on this, with prices down by more than 30 per cent over
the past four years. Thus for Continental and its rivals, the going will
remain bumpy, though the bumps may start to flatten out.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (5): New opportunities on a bigger
stage - Germany / The move down the table basically reflects the downturn in
the stock market after the euphoria which greeted unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN SPITE OF their industrial weight and solid finances, Germany's top
companies have slipped down the rankings of the FT500 and now have one place
fewer in the top 10. Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance group, Siemens, the
electrical and electronics concern, and Daimler-Benz, the diversified motor
manufacturer, all lost ground, while Deutsche Bank was edged right out of
the top ten.
Yet all of these companies did more business and employed more people.
Daimler and Siemens again led the job rankings, both with labour forces of
well over 350,000 people. Moreover, unification has increased the size of
the stage on which German companies operate and given them new business
opportunities.
The move down the table basically reflects the downturn in the German stock
market after the euphoria which greeted the ending of the division between
east and west. Between June 1990 and end-September 1991 (the cut-off date
for the FT500 rankings), the DAX share index in Frankfurt fell by around 15
per cent to 1607.
Germany's stock markets had an impressive run in 1990 as domestic and
international investors, notably from Japan, piled into shares which they
thought could benefit from unification. Since the whole east German economy
was in need of repair, it seemed there was almost no sector of west German
industry which would not benefit.
East Germans' appetite for goods which had previously been denied them gave
retailers a golden opportunity. Car makers did their utmost to try and
satisfy the pent-up demand for western automobiles. The reconstruction needs
in both the private and public sectors prompted west German building
companies to move eastwards in a big way. Banks and insurance companies,
too, invested heavily in new branch and sales networks in east.
But there was another side to the reunification coin - the cost of bringing
together two countries which had diverged so sharply over the past four
decades, politically, economically, and socially. As it emerged that little
of East German industry was in a fit state to survive the coming of the
D-Mark, the introduction of the free market, and the collapse of Comecon,
estimates of the size of financial support needed from west Germany rose
sharply.
For electoral reasons, the ruling conservative-liberal coalition in Bonn
understated the likely costs of unity last year - though, no-one could say
what these were for certain - and gave the impression that east German
citizens would be no worse off after unity. Since then, taxes have risen and
the state of the east German economy has been cause for grave concern,
although latest statistics indicate that the worst point has been passed.
Because of the western German largesse towards the five new states in the
east, as well as high wage settlements across the country, inflation has
passed 4 per cent. The Bundesbank has grown concerned and told Germans to
grit their teeth for a continued tight monetary policy; this means high
interest rates are here to stay for a while. Moreover, the west German
economy is weakening. The stock markets like none of this. Hence the
continued weakness in share prices and the drop in German companies' FT500
rankings.
Some of the most prominent German companies do not appear in the rankings at
all. This is not because they are owned by the state. Both Bertelsmann, the
country's biggest media concern with interests in publishing, records, and
television, and Robert Bosch, the world's biggest motor components
manufacturer, are owned by foundations.
Of those German companies which are quoted, many still retain control in
family or other hands by making only preference shares available to the
public or a minority of voting stock. The takeover is not a common feature
of German corporate life. Certainly, there are friendly mergers or
acquisitions like that of the Salzgitter steel company by Preussag, the
energy and metals company. But the hostile bid remains foreign to Germany.
There have been attempts to change this, though recent predators have
insisted that their intentions are amicable. Pirelli of Italy failed
miserably in its efforts, first to take control of the Continental tyre
company and then, when this would clearly not work, to engineer a
co-operation agreement. One obstacle was the German company's voting
restrictions, a hurdle which other German companies have also erected. These
are not insurmountable, but hardly represent an encouragement to outsiders.
The Pirelli-Continental saga lasted more than a year. Continental, which has
suffered from the harsh conditions of the tyre industry but expects to
return to profit in 1992, fell 76 places in the FT500 list to 377. More
recently, the Krupp steel and industrial group bought a quarter of the
shares in Hoesch, which operates in similar areas, and said it wanted to
merge. Hoesch, taken by surprise, said it would talk, but made clear that it
would much rather stay independent. Krupp is also owned by a foundation, but
its steel subsidiary is quoted.
One reason that Krupp was able, with the help of its banks, to acquire its
holding in Hoesch, which dropped in the FT500 to number 367, was that the
latter's share price was so low in relation to its size. 'We were surprised
at how easy it was,' says Mr Gerhard Cromme, Krupp's chief executive. What
may be less easy is obtaining the agreement of Hoesch's management and
workforce to any amalgamation, especially if significant job losses are
involved.
Germany's tight labour laws and its system of co-determination give trade
unions more influence on corporate policy than in many other countries.
Labour representatives sit on the non-executive supervisory boards, which
make key management appointments and approve other important decisions such
as new investments or plant closures. Companies also have to keep local
works councils informed about policy and progress.
Sometimes, companies get into such deep water that no amount of arguing and
influence-wielding can save them. One of the saddest of recent cases is that
of Nixdorf, the computer company which once could do no wrong in the eyes of
investors and then suffered grievously from management over-confidence and
the ravages of the industry. Having slid down the previous rankings to 435,
it disappeared altogether last year after Siemens rescued it from possible
oblivion.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (4): A tale of two different
companies - The profits performance of European industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE profits performance of two very different companies tell part of a
revealing story of how European industry has performed in the past year.
One of the worst profit falls came at Philips, the Dutch electronics group
now undergoing an overhaul of its business.
Its profits fell from Dollars 663m the year before to a Dollars 2.148bn
loss. Philips was not alone; most of Europe's electronics groups were in
trouble. Profits at Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group, were
down 16 per cent, while at Olivetti, the Italian computer group, they fell
from Dollars 280m to zero. Nokia of Finland bucked the trend with a 17.7 per
cent increase to Dollars 172m.
The electronics industry is being buffeted by fierce competition led by Far
Eastern producers. The performance of the Europeans is inseparable from the
international competition they face.
One of the steepest profits increases came from a company which is protected
from competition, working in a purely domestic market. North West Water, one
of the recently privatised British water companies, pushed its profits up to
Dollars 370m from Dollars 130m the year before. Its performance was
indicative of the entire British water industry which turned in some of the
strongest profit increases in Europe: profits were 92 per cent up at Severn
Trent and 97.7 per cent up at Yorkshire Water.
Indeed, privatised UK companies make up a significant minority of the groups
which have recorded the biggest profits improvements in the past two years.
BT, the telecommunications group, British Gas, and the electricity companies
Powergen, Midlands Electricity, Eastern Electricity and Yorkshire
Electricity all figure among a select band of companies which increased
profits by more than 25 per cent.
Partly helped by accounting conventions, British companies are
overwhelmingly predominant among industrial and commercial companies,
excluding banks, building societies and insurance companies, which make a
return on capital employed of more than 25 per cent.
British companies account for seven of the 10 largest European companies
with a return on capital employed of more than 25 per cent: Glaxo,
SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome in pharmaceuticals, Unilever and Guinness,
the food, drink and consumer goods groups, BTR, the conglomerate, and J
Sainsbury, the retailer.
No fewer than 56 British industrial and commercial companies reported a
return on capital employed of more than 25 per cent, stretching from
retailers such as Body Shop to conglomerates such as Williams Holdings, food
groups such as Northern Foods and Cadbury Schweppes to well-established
industrial groups such as Smiths Industries.
Only a handful of German groups make a similar return on capital, for
example Hoechst, the pharmaceuticals group, 10 French companies and six
Swedish companies led by Astra, the drugs group, and telecommunications
maker Ericsson.
They are joined by three Dutch groupings and one company from each of
Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands.
The extent of the disparity in performance measured by return on capital is
highlighted by the contrast between Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering
group, and its German counterparts. Hawker Siddeley was taken over last year
by BTR, the industrial conglomerate, in spite of making a rate of return of
24.3 per cent. This contrasts with a rate of return of 7.5 per cent at Man,
the trucks group, 14 per cent at Mannesmann, and 10.5 per cent at Thyssen.
Apart from the British predominance of companies with a high rate of return
on capital, the other trend is the strong performance of pharmaceuticals
groups across Europe - Astra of Sweden, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham in
Britain - no matter what their country of origin.
Among the companies which made a rate of return of less than 10 per cent
were some of the best known names of European industry, Fiat, Pirelli and
Olivetti in Italy, Michelin and Valeo in France, British Aerospace, Hoesch,
the German steel group, and Nokia in Finland.
National factors have exerted some influence over profitability. British
companies, particularly those linked to construction and consumer markets,
such as British Steel and Forte, the hotels group, figure prominently among
those which saw profits fall by more than 20 per cent.
The benefits of German unification do not seem to have led to enormous
increases in German corporate profits. Daimler Benz, the automotive,
electronics and aerospace group, saw its profits fall by 62 per cent while
Siemens, the electronics and engineering combine, enjoyed a 1.3 per cent
rise. At Mannesmann profits rose by just 4 per cent.
The other clear regional trend is the plight of Scandinavian companies - and
Swedish companies in particular - such as Electrolux, profits down 61 per
cent, Volvo down 105 per cent, Skanska a 16 per cent decline, and SKF, a 29
per cent fall.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (3): Figuring out the differences -
The quality of corporate data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK

<TEXT>
ANYONE trying to analyse the accounts of companies in the different
countries across Europe should be issued with a strong government health
warning: attempts to make comparisons are likely to cause severe headaches.
As the deadline for the single European market approaches at the end of this
year, one issue still sorely lacking in standardisation is financial
reporting. Users of accounts face enormous variations in the disclosure and
treatment of information.
A survey published at the end of 1991 by the US-based Centre for
International Financial Analysis and Research (CIFAR) concluded solemnly:
'In spite of worldwide efforts . . . to harmonise financial reporting
practices, the form and substance of published annual reports varies
significantly.'
CIFAR rated the accounts of 1,000 leading companies in 44 countries by the
presence or absence of 90 items classified under seven headings: disclosure
of general information, income statements, balance sheets, funds flow
statements, accounting policies, stockholders' information and special
items.
The resulting 'international financial reporting index' ranks the non-EC
countries of Scandinavia above many of their EC counterparts. Sweden scored
highest of all, followed by Singapore and the UK. At the lower end of the
scale, Austria ranked 31, Luxembourg 38 and Portugal 42.
The same pattern emerges from individual companies. Ericsson of Sweden has
the highest overall index score, followed by the Bank of Scotland, Shell
Canada and Union Bank of Finland. Swedish businesses comprise five of the
top 10 industrial scores, while those in the UK have four of the top seven
among companies in the financial sector.
The small number of large companies in some of the countries covered may
well introduce distortions which make the index unrepresentative. However,
the general findings are borne out by other recent pieces of research as
well as more general anecdotes.
A report just produced for the European Federation of Accountants (FEE), for
example, showed wide divergence in topics such as the flow-of-funds
statement, the treatment of assets for valuation and disclosure of pension
provisions.
Mr Scott Cormack, managing partner of KPMG Peat Marwick's European Business
Centre in Brussels, says some of the principal issues treated in different
ways across borders which will need to be addressed in the future include
accounting for goodwill, foreign currency translations and tax accounting.
Many of the variations reflect the fact that accounts produced in different
countries are intended to serve different audiences. In the UK, the aim is
to provide a 'true and fair view' for investors. Elsewhere, it is often the
tax authorities that hold most sway.
Mr Cormack distinguishes two basic styles. The 'Anglo-Saxon' philosophy
stresses the profit and loss account, especially dividends and earnings,
since it is driven by short-term returns. The alternative, which is
prevalent in countries such as France and Germany, focuses on the balance
sheet. This reflects a longer-term view from more stable financiers and
others that companies should build up wealth.
In the UK, the semi-independent Accounting Standards Board, whose members
are drawn primarily from the accountancy firms, is taking a strong line in
developing new guidelines in the former mould. Elsewhere, the regulator is
often the national legislature with an eye firmly on tax revenues.
Nevertheless, there has been considerable convergence in financial reporting
in Europe over the past few years. Partly, Mr David Cairns,
secretary-general of the International Accounting Standards Committee,
argues, this is a function of the increasing search for international
capital, which has helped boost Anglo-Saxon-style reporting. Many companies
now produce two sets of accounts: one to meet local requirements and the
other for international consumption.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (2): The 500 biggest European
companies by market capitalisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS is the 10th year in which the FT500 has been published.
The main table ranks the 500 biggest European companies by market
capitalisation. A second table ranks the top 500 UK companies on the London
Stock Exchange.
A company's capitalisation is the number of its shares multiplied by the
price of its shares, and therefore measures the value of a company in the
eyes of investors.
Capitalisation is chosen as a yardstick because it has a number of
advantages over other methods. It is a good guide to performance over time;
it gives a proper weighting to banks, whose positions are distorted in
tables based on turnover; and it takes proper account of loss-making
companies, which disappear from lists based on profits.
The stock market is particularly important in the UK, whereas in Germany the
banks play a larger role in corporate finance,and in France and Italy many
of the biggest groups are
state-owned. To take account of these factors, a separate list is
included of the top 200 European concerns, whether publicly or privately
owned, ranked by turnover.
Rankings: The rankings of the European and UK Top 500 tables are based on
market capitalisation at the end of September 1991 average exchange rates.
Preference capital has been excluded for this calculation.
Companies that have 75 per cent or more of equity held by one other concern,
or that have only a minimal proportion of their capital openly traded on the
market, have been excluded. Sources for the capitalisation figures include
Datastream International, local stock exchanges, and the FT World Actuaries
Index. The ranking of companies having the same capitalisation has been
determined by reference to their turnover or, where necessary, their profit.
Figures in the European tables are in dollars, using September 1991 average
exchange rates. For ease of comparison turnover and profit figures for last
year are shown at 1991 average exchange rates. UK 500 figures are in
sterling.
Accounts: Consolidated accounts have been used whenever possible. When
parent company accounts only have been reported, these figures have been
used and annotated. Turnover is shown net of sales taxes and inter-group
sales. A ranking based on the latest year's figure is also given.
Profit is disclosed profit before tax and minority interest. For the UK
companies, it is also before extraordinary items.
Return on capital employed (ROCE) is based on capital employed at the
beginning of the financial year divided by pre-tax profit plus interest. For
banks, capital employed = shareholders' funds.
UK Investment Trusts: The rankings are based on market capitalisation at the
end of September 1991. The shareholders' funds figure is based on the number
of shares in issue and the stated net asset value. This table has been
compiled with the assistance of County NatWest Wood Mackenzie.

FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (1): UK companies are the big
winners - The absence, this year, of the currency factor means that moves up
and down the rankings are more 'genuine' than ever before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year's FT500 is a historic one: by its date of compilation, September
30, 1991, almost all the big European economies were linked by formal or de
facto membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary
System.
So for the first time in the FT500's history, the factors which decide
whether companies move up and down the rankings largely exclude the currency
factor which has been such an overwhelming influence in the past.
The FT500 ranks companies by stock market value (that is, shares outstanding
times share price). It therefore avoids the differences between national
accounting standards that bedevil rankings based on profitability; and
avoids the inconsistencies between industries that bedevil rankings by
revenues.
Of course, such a listing can only include publicly-quoted companies. Those
economies where there are many large privately-owned industrial empires
(such as Germany) or those where the state controls significant corporate
power (such as France or Italy) are under-represented. The FT500 is a
snapshot of the relative values investors put on Europe's big
publicly-traded companies - rather than an overview of industry as a whole.
The absence, this year, of the currency factor means that moves up and down
the rankings are more 'genuine' than ever before: they represent true
changes in the values attached to individual companies' businesses rather
than the pattern of exchange rates at the moment the survey was taken.
No individual company is ever able to throw off the influence of its
domestic stock market. Thus, in a snapshot taken as the UK market reached a
peak in September this year, UK companies are the big winners at the very
top of the list. In this year's top 10, for example, Glaxo and British Gas
all move up in ranking, as does the partly-British Unilever.
Another Anglo-Dutch company, Royal Dutch/Shell handsomely retains its lead
at the top of the rankings. It is not surprising that Anglo-Dutch companies
did well: the UK (with the FT-SE index up 10.4 per cent in the period since
the last FT500 cut-off date at the end of June 1990) and the Netherlands
(where the market index was up 3.4 per cent) were the only two of the
leading European markets to show a rise. Others fell, some sharply: Italy
was down 28.5 per cent, Germany 14.5 per cent and France down 7.6 per cent.
The 15-month period used on this occasion reflects the desire to make the
FT500 more up to date at the time of publication. Stock market performances
during the period contrast markedly with the results in the 12 months to
September 1991 shown above.
Nonetheless, the rise from 10th to third in the rankings of Glaxo Holdings
of the UK represents a significant shift in the market's valuation of the
company itself.
In Italy, the weakest major stock market during the period, the biggest
casualties included two of the country's biggest industrial stocks, Olivetti
(down in rank from 178 to 375) and Compagnie Industriali Riunite (down from
207 to 435). They have another factor in common: they are both run by Carlo
De Benedetti, the Italian entrepreneur, whose magic touch has deserted him
for the moment.
In last year's FT500, the big news was the way in which German companies had
at last started to use takeovers as a way to gain size and climb up the
rankings. This time, German takeovers were again in the news. Germany has
yet to see a successful hostile takeover bid, but 1991's developments
demonstrated a variation: the hostile but ostensibly 'friendly' takeover
bid.
Pirelli's attempt to push Continental, the German tyre-maker, into a merger
was clearly failing before the end of the FT500's cut-off period. The
performance of the various Pirelli entities in the FT500 - Pirelli
Internationale fell from 269 to 333 in the ranking, and Pirelli SpA fell
from to 257 to 362 - was an augury of Pirelli's decision to abandon the bid
last December.
Of those industry sectors which contain more than a handful of companies,
four in particular stand out for strong performance. The 10 diversified
manufacturing companies which featured in this ranking and last year's rose
an average of 44 places; the 10 drugs companies rose 24 places on average;
the 16 food processing companies rose 11 places; and the 22 electricity and
water utilities (a sector with a heavy UK bias) rose six places on average.
The biggest loser among sizeable sectors was diversified holding companies,
a group with 28 members and an average drop in the rankings of 39 places.
Other poor performers were the 20 building materials companies, which
dropped 29 places on average.
State-owned companies that have 25 per cent of their shares in the hands of
the public are now eligible for inclusion in the FT500, a change from the
previously required figure of 30 per cent. This brings a number of big
French groups into the rankings, such as the French insurer UAP (ranked 52).
Austria's state oil company OeMV comes in at 288 and in Germany, Lufthansa
comes in at 188.
A similar change of ruling applies to subsidiaries of big groups as long as
25 per cent of stock is in the hands of outside shareholders. Thus Allianz
Lebensversicherung, the life insurance arm of the bigger Allianz Holding
group (ranked 6th) comes in at 104. One of Sweden's key Wallenberg holding
companies, Incentive, joins at 232. Gemina, the Fiat-controlled financial
services group, comes in at 286. Other joiners include the TF1 television
channel in France (348), controlled by the Bouygues construction group;
Italy's family-controlled property group Italmobiliare (107); and the UK
electricity utilities, privatised during the period.
Some companies joined by virtue of growth: Sims Food Group, a little-known
but rapidly growing British meat supplier, came in at 330. Two companies
still in a nascent state, Eurotunnel and Euro Disneyland, both did well.
Euro Disneyland, which opens this spring, rose from 159 to 121, and is
valued at nearly Dollars 4bn.
There were a number of other notable performances. The list of big gainers
was dominated by UK companies, including the specialist materials group
Courtaulds, which rose more than 50 places (from 205 to 152) in spite of the
recession. Willis Corroon, the insurance broker formed by a merger between
the UK's Willis Faber and the US's Corroon &amp; Black, rose from 431 to 224. A
few of the biggest losers were also British. Asda, the food retailer,
dropped from 217 to 461. Racal Electronics dropped from 96 to 351, thanks to
demerger of its Vodafone cellular phone subsidiary, which joined the
rankings at 65.
As in earlier years, a number of famous names disappeared from the list.
Swiss chocolate-maker Jacobs Suchard (formerly 125th) has dropped from the
rankings after its takeover by Philip Morris.
Italy's Montedison has left and come back again: the original company,
formerly ranked 140th, was merged into Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria. That
company then changed its name, to Montedison, and is ranked 231.
There were two notable disappearances in the UK. STC, formerly number 202,
sold its ICL subsidiary to Fujitsu in November 1990 then sold itself to
Canada's Northern Telecom and vanished from the rankings. And Polly Peck
International, which was ranked as high as 158th in last year's lists, is
now in administration, with its shares suspended.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold leads precious
metals higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD LED precious metals prices into greener pastures this week after an
early fall revealed solid support below Dollars 350 a troy ounce.
A wave of investment fund selling, which started in Japan, was blamed for
Monday's Dollars 3.65 fall to a four-month low of Dollars 348.50 an ounce.
That did nothing for sentiment on the platinum market, which was also
suffering from worries about the US economy and the international motor
industry. The white metal's price tumbled Dollars 6.25 to Dollars 330.75 an
ounce, the lowest level for nearly seven years. Meanwhile silver lost 5.6
cents to close in London at 392 cents an ounce.
But that fall had pushed the gold market into a technically oversold
situation, and with good physical demand emerging the price first steadied
and then rose strongly, helped by US investment fund and Middle East buying.
By yesterday's close the price was Dollars 357.75 an ounce, up Dollars 5.60
on the week.
The more bullish sentiment naturally spilled over into the platinum market,
where news of a strike at Impala's Bafokeng North mine in South Africa added
to the upward momentum. Yesterday afternoon the London platinum price was
fixed at Dollars 341.75 an ounce, up Dollars 4.75 on the week.
Silver also joined in the fun, ending the week 12.50 cents up on balance at
412 cents an ounce.
At the London Metal exchange the aluminium market put in a stronger
performance, in spite of the continuing build-up in exchange warehouse
stocks, which last week passed the 1m-tonne mark. The cash price gained
another Dollars 6.50 yesterday to end Dollars 30 up on the week at Dollars
1,137 a tonne.
um's price rise had been dampened by a strengthening in the US dollar
towards the end of the week. But that factor helped to fuel a rally in the
LME's sterling-denominated copper contract.
A sharp fall in the first half of the week pushed the three months copper
price down to Pounds 1,140.50 a tonne, the lowest level since August 1988,
before the trend was reversed on Wednesday by news that a strike was
threatened by miners in Chile, the world's biggest copper producer, in
protest at government privatisation plans.
The three months price closed yesterday at Pounds 1,203.75 a tonne, up
Pounds 24 on the week. That was Pounds 63.25 up from Wednesday's low, but in
terms of the US currency the rally amounted to a much more modest Dollars
32.50.
The nickel market continued to be buoyed this week by talk of production
cuts by Falconbridge of Canada, despite the announcement of a sizeable rise
in LME warehouse stocks. The cash price closed yesterday at Dollars 77,320 a
tonne, up Dollars 142.50 on the week but Dollars 35 below the seven-week
high reached on Monday.
Zinc prices began and ended the week with sharp falls, but rises in between
meant that the cash price ended only Dollars 8.50 lower on balance at
Dollars 1,136.50 a tonne. Price movements mainly reflected the ebb and flow
of the fears about nearby supply tightness that had been boosting values in
recent weeks. This was highlighted by the fluctuations in the cash premium
over three months metal, which peaked at Dollars 37.50 a tonne on Thursday
before ending at the week's low of Dollars 28.50. Early last week this
premium, known as the 'backwardation', reached Dollars 59.50 a tonne.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange the coffee market was another
beneficiary of the dollar's strength. The March delivery price ended Pounds
41 up on the week at Pounds 566 a tonne, but the currency factor accounted
for about Pounds 13.50 of that rise. The rest was attributed to what dealers
described as 'a generally constructive mood' and concern over nearby supply
tightness. The latter factor resulted in the January position's Pounds 3
discount against March turning into a Pounds 10 premium during the course of
the week.
The cocoa market rallied strongly yesterday after being on the slide for
most of the week. The May position's Pounds 22 rise on the day, which
traders said was 'a bit of a correction' to an oversold position, left the
price Pounds 2 up on the week at Pounds 760 a tonne. But after allowing for
the currency factor that worked out as a Pounds 17.50 fall.
A rise in sugar futures prices was trimmed in mid-week after FO Licht, the
German statistics agency, cut its estimate of 1991-92 world output by a
smaller amount than traders had been expecting. But in late trading
yesterday nearby values were still about Dollars 2 up from the end of last
week.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: Upheaval at the British Museum - Patricia Morison
talks to Robert Anderson, the new director who took up his post this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MUST be a warm feeling to stand on the steps of the British Museum and
think: 'All this is my domain - plus another 40 per cent.' Dr Robert
Anderson has been director of the British Museum for just over a week. He
inherits the world's first and greatest public collection, and with it an
expansion programme which will put the Museum through the most profound
upheaval of its 139 years.
Anderson, 47, spent six years previously as Director of the National Museums
of Scotland. He is fortunate to have left Edinburgh when he did, given the
fierce squall which blew up last August over the proposed extension to the
Royal Scottish Museum. Anderson was on the panel which chose a modernist
scheme, thus prompting the Prince of Wales to resign from being the museum's
patron.
Before the affair of the Edinburgh carbuncle, Anderson was not a figure
known outside the museum world. Among museum people, however, he is regarded
as someone with common sense and considerable tact. Academically, he is
something of an oddity in his new post. He is the first director of the BM
to be a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemists.
Anderson's academic career began with a doctorate in physical chemistry at
Oxford. The exact title of his thesis he does not recall, but it was about
'the scattering of slow neutrons.' And that, he decided, was as far as he
wanted to go with scientific research. Instead, he went to the Royal
Scottish Museum as the curator in charge of scientific instruments.
The switch from laboratory to museum was not as unexpected as it might seem
because, despite an intense dislike of autobiographical revelations, the new
director does admit to a childhood in which visits to museums played a major
part. His chief love was the Victoria and Albert museum, which ran an
imaginative children's club. He recalls that by the age of nine he would
travel on his own each Saturday by bus from Finchley to South Kensington.
'Art school students would take us in groups to draw objects, Tang horses
and so on, and tell us about their history. It was a really imaginative
experiment.'
Anderson is at pains to point out that acquiring an appetite for museums was
not precocious, nor even unusual, for a London child of his generation. In
those days, entry to all the national museums was free: Anderson's fierce
opposition to the principle of museum charges has much to do with his
childhood experience.
It was also one of the factors which won him the post of BM Director. The
former director, Sir David Wilson, now retired, is a Viking scholar. During
his 15 years as director, he fought with a ferocity worthy of the Vikings in
defence of free entry to the Museum, and its role as a major research
institution. Anderson's appointment was, therefore, greeted with relief by
those who can be called the conservatives within the museum fraternity, and
also without much surprise. One curator described it to me as 'the classic
insider's appointment'.
Anderson will certainly be holding the line on the importance of research.
He cites with glee a recent Museums and Galleries Commission report, which
warns that any national museum which fails to carry out research 'would
ultimately forfeit its claim to be regarded as a national museum.' From the
public's point of view, this is good news because it means the BM will
continue its commitment to major scholarly exhibitions.
Anderson admits to feeling dismay that there were national museums which did
not hold out against the pressure to go overboard in the hunt for outside
sources of funding. 'During the 1980s, some museums adopted the culture of
more commercial attitudes and made sudden changes of direction. What
happened during that period cannot now be reversed. For many non-national
and independent museums, things will be very bad.'
At the BM morale is said to be high. You will hear curators complaining that
both they and their objects are dreadfully cramped. They also grumble about
a ponderous administration. But the first problem, at least, is going to be
solved. Starting next year, the British Library will move north to the
dismal St Pancras site. The people at the Museum are delighted to see the
back of this difficult daughter and besides, it will gain them that
staggering extra 40 per cent in space.
Last year, the BM published a handsome booklet to tell us all of the costly
delights in store, such as the plans to renovate the dilapidated King's
Library, and to restore the Round Reading Room to its original blue-and-gold
decoration and turn it into the BM's own reading room. As anyone who has
been to the BM in the last decade will know, existing galleries have been
renovated to an extraordinary extent, 46 of them so far. The pace has been
forced by the coming internal expansion, when the Museum of Mankind will
finally rejoin the BM. Changes are due to be more or less complete for the
250th anniversary in 2003.
Anderson's major problem will be finding the money for these ambitious
changes, in the region of Dollars 80m. He speaks about it with considerable
calmness. 'I'd like to see the government being rather more flexible in
providing money for exceptional circumstances. The British Library moving
out just has to be called exceptional.'
So far, there appears to be no sign that the Treasury will be offering the
BM anything extra to pay for the expansion plan. 'We will be trying very
hard to raise money from outside sources. However, there just is not going
to be money from sponsors for the behind-the-scenes kind of things.'
There is still plenty of time for Anderson to wear out his shoe-leather in
the eternal search for moneyed admirers of the BM. Meanwhile, he has some
months to get to know his staff, Ginger the Mummy, and Pete Marsh, also
known as Lindow Man. Nor is the new director completely severed from his
scientific roots. Unknown to the public, there is in the BM 'an extremely
good collection of scientific instruments.' We can expect to be seeing more
of that in the coming years.

THE EDUCATION OF LITTLE TREE by Forrest Carter Rider Pounds 14.99, 231 pages
DRINK TO THE BIRD by Benedict Kiely Methuen Pounds 14.99, 180 pages
A WRITER'S past is a half unreal world: things that happened woven into
things which might have happened, or should have happened. Its geography and
climate are subtly re-arranged as the writer's recall changes with the
coral-like accrual of his or her life's experience. Truth is a Protean thing
at the best of times. Never more so than in the case of childhood
recollected in maturity. Therefore, unless a memoir is of historical or
political significance, it is best judged on purely literary merit. On this
score, each of the two memoirs under review is a gem.
Little Tree, alias Forrest Carter, is half Cherokee. Orphaned at the age of
five, he goes to live with his grandparents in the mountains of east
Tennessee. Grandma was full-blooded Cherokee, called Red Wing. Grandpa was
half Scotch, half Cherokee, and was named Wales. Grandma is the literate
one, who can make out the number of the right bus, a skill, which along with
reading, she imparts to Little Tree. Grandpa fetches books from the library
in the nearby town, which Grandma reads out to them. So, writers, including
'Mr Shakespeare', set landmarks in Little Tree's developing mind.
But his real education is in 'The Way' - the Indian's perception of Man's
place in Nature and its concomitant ethics.
Grandpa, who makes a living brewing whisky which he sells in town, teaches
Little Tree how to hunt: only what one needs - the smaller, weaker deer,
allow the better ones to grow; how to attune his senses to the moods of the
mountains and the woods. How to accept death as natural passage in nature's
cycle.
As a part of his growing up, Little Tree learns about the Cherokees' forced
exodus from their land: 'Government soldiers rode before them, on each side
of them, behind them . . . The Cherokee men walked and looked straight ahead
and would not look down, nor at the soldiers. Their women and children
followed in their footsteps and would not look at the soldiers . . . Far
behind them, the empty wagons rattled and rumbled and served no use. The
wagons could not steal the soul of the Cherokee. The land was stolen from
him, his home; but the Cherokee would not let the wagons steal his soul.'
Deceptively simple, the language is in harmony with the experiences it
narrates. How much of the latter is factually accurate is irrelevant, for
here is poetic imagination fired by evocation, which has its own undeniable
truth.
Forrest Carter grew up to become Storyteller-in-Council to the Cherokee
Nations, and author of Gone to Texas, the basis of Clint Eastwood's classic
western The Outlaw Josey Wales.
In Drink to the Bird poetic imagination allied with sheer, delectable Gaelic
gift of the gab, turn what might otherwise have sounded like a fairly
ordinary account of boyhood and manhood in Ireland in between the two world
wars, into a literary feast.
'Sound' is an operative word here, because this book should be read aloud.
Memory speaks, sings, recreates scenes and characters. Anecdotal,
hilariously funny, and replete with verse, this memoir has the cadence of a
discursive outpour and Joycean resonance. Moreover, you can open it at any
point and happily read on without regard for sequence. In the opening page,
Mr Kiely gives a hint of what is to come: 'The meticulous reader may detect
digressions.
'But the mind, such as it is, may surely, in this business of remembering,
be allowed to meander. Even take off for a while to fly, say, to Atlanta,
Georgia, or the Blue Ridge mountains, or the hoarse Trinacrian shore of
Oregon. Francis Drake, who was no Ariel, got as far as that in a little
wooden boat.'
Here there is a huge diffusion of people, places, and events, with the
narrator sitting back, as it were, pointing out the directions.
Kiely, who was raised in County Tyrone, lives in Dublin, and nearly became a
priest, probably has had a happy life so far. But he is able to register
poignantly Ireland's unhappy violence. His humour is generous. It is
immediately evident that here is an experienced writer of outstanding
accomplishment.

A PASSION FOR FRIENDSHIP: SIBYL COLEFAX AND HER CIRCLE by Kirsty McLeod
Michael Joseph Pounds 20, 180 pages
'IF I dine with you, I shan't sleep; if I don't sleep, I cant write. You say
this dont matter a straw. I quite agree with you. But my next year's income
depends on sending a book to America in August. It aint half done, owing to
dining out. So theres no more to be said.'
The date is 1931. The handwriting - with its odd lack of apostrophes - is
that of Virginia Woolf. The recipient? Lady Sybil Colefax.
On receiving a refusal couched in those terms, most people would be inclined
to delete the writer's name from future guest-lists. Sibyl's reaction was
the opposite - to send Virginia three further invitations for other
dinner-parties. Eventually Virginia caved in and became a friend of hers.
A friend? Yes, but the kind of friend you make fun of behind her back to
your real friends, the kind of friend you do your best to put off when she
invites herself to stay with you in the country:
'Dearest Sibyl, Yes delighted Thursday 8th but, (1) View is ruined (2) No
room for chauffeur in house (3) The smallest possible doghole for you (4)
Village char is cook Let me know if you are daunted. If not, whether we
shall meet a train: if so, which. Yours in haste (not hate) Virginia No
clothes but nightgowns worn here.'
Poor Sibyl] But if her friends often were bitchy about her, biographers have
been kinder, pointing to the heart of gold beneath the absurdities, to the
core of loyalty in friendship, masked by Sibyl's indefatigable collector's
instinct for the famous. Brian Masters had a judicious chapter on her in his
book Great Hostesses (1982) where Sibyl emerged as positively saintly beside
the likes of Mrs Ronnie Greville and Emerald Cunard. Now Kirsty McLeod has
filled the portrait out more fully.
Sibyl Halsey was born in 1874, daughter of an Indian civil servant. The
first great man Sibyl encountered was Lockwood Kipling, Rudyard's father.
The Kipling connection remained firm after Sibyl had grown up and become a
great hostess of London society. A young woman of her ambitious temperament,
desirous of moving in the world of celebrities, might have been expected to
marry a genius, or a perhaps a title, but Sibyl was shrewder than that. She
found her fate in Arthur Colefax, a grammar school boy who became an eminent
lawyer, then an MP, and was knighted for his work running the scientific
side of the manufacture of munitions in the First World War.
They occupied a grand house in the King's Road, Chelsea, where Sibyl
entertained almost everyone of any eminence. At the height of her career in
the 1930s her regular guests included HG Wells, Maynard Keynes, JL Garvin,
Oswald Mosley, Robert Bruce Lockhart, John Gielgud, Edward Lutyens, Gerald
Berners, Artur Rubinstein, Roger Fry, Noel Coward, Andre Maurois, Alfred
Beit, Desmond MacCarthy, Gertrude Lawrence, Brendan Bracken, Mrs Churchill,
Alexander Korda, Lord Beaverbrook, the Duke of Buccleuch, Rebecca West, the
Mountbattens, the Dufferins, the Jebbs, the Wellesleys - to list but a few
of the names in Sibyl's Visitor's Book.
Sibyl's success may in part be ascribed to her persistence, to the immense
trouble she took, and to her flair for invariably producing the man or woman
of the moment - 'Paul Valery will be in London on Tuesday. Do come along and
meet him' - but one gathers there was more to it than simply her ability to
deliver the goods. Sibyl had great courage. She was fiercely
anti-appeasement. Above all she was someone in whom you could safely
confide.
When the King's mistress, Mrs Simpson, had to decide whether or not to
abandon her beloved, it was to her friend Sibyl that she turned for support.
The full correspondence between Sibyl and the Duchess of Windsor has not yet
been published. After it was all over, Osbert Sitwell, one of Sibyl's
enemies, lampooned her in his poem Rat Week. 'Coalbox' was what the
malicious Sitwells always called her.
At the same time Sibyl suffered serious private adversity. Her husband's
increasing deafness, coupled with unwise investments in the US, led to the
almost total loss of their income. Now Sibyl showed her pluck and
resilience. Following the lead of other women in society like Syrie Maugham,
Sibyl set herself up professionally as an interior decorator. She joined
forces with the furniture-maker John Fowler to found the firm Colefax and
Fowler which still exists today.
A smaller house in Westminster proved less satisfactory for her parties, but
she carried on regardless. Even another world war could not stifle her
compulsion to entertain. By now a widow, Sibyl made the Dorchester Hotel her
wartime centre of operations; she would send each of her guests a bill to
meet his share of the evening's cost. Everyone paid without a murmur.
Sibyl's Ordinaries - as these parties were called - were one of the more
bizarre manifestations of well-bred defiance to the rigours of the London
blitz.
Sibyl survived the war, but died of cancer in 1950. Kirsty McLeod certainly
convinces us in this short readable book that Sibyl deserved more than the
footnote biographers usually give her.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fidelity's short-term blip - The Fund
Managers / The investment record of a performance-driven company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A while in the 1980s, there seemed to be no stopping Fidelity
Investments. Its aggressive, performance-driven management style attracted
plenty of funds and some of the brightest fund managers.
But Fidelity has fared less well in the more depressed markets of the last
two or three years; its UK funds have been disappointing and the image seems
a little faded. Is this a temporary blip or a terminal decline?
Dick Haberman, chief investment officer of Fidelity Investments in the UK,
admits that the company 'has not produced the results we would have liked in
the UK' recently, but says the style will not change.
The Fidelity approach is not to sit behind a desk looking at sector
allocation. The emphasis is on being out in the field, visiting companies,
talking to management and picking stocks. Managers have great leeway and the
support of in-house analysts. They are rewarded generously when they perform
well, but mediocrity is not tolerated. This kind of approach is unlikely to
produce either a relaxed atmosphere or middle of the road performance.
Fidelity first started managing money in Boston in 1964. Its UK operation,
also an independent company owned by its executives, was started in the UK
in 1979. The US company currently has some Dollars 143bn (Pounds 78.5bn)
under management.
In the UK, funds under management are Pounds 3.3bn, of which Pounds 1.8bn is
in unit trusts. These are run by nine managers in the UK, two in the US and
two in the Far East. Fidelity has 30 analysts in the UK and 100 in the US.
The weakest spot in Fidelity's portfolio is its UK income and growth funds.
Haberman admits 'we have to do some work' on Growth &amp; Income, which has been
rather disappointing for the last three years. The performance of the higher
yielding Income Plus fund has also been below average.
The most noticeable laggard is Special Situations, which enjoyed a meteoric
rise at the end of the 1980s - indeed, it is fourth out of 63 UK growth
trusts over seven years. However, its run appears to have come to an end;
over the last three years, it has been 105th out of 126 in the sector.
The trust tends to buy cheap, unfashionable companies which are usually in
the higher risk/reward category, and these often perform worst in times of
recession and nervous stock markets. Recovery's performance slipped over
1991, for similar reasons.
Both funds include several companies which have heavy borrowings and
Haberman believes that 'the banks are pulling the plug on them much faster
than they used to because they are worried about non-performing loans.' This
again affects sentiment and all highly geared companies tend to get marked
down together.
Fidelity's Pounds 440m European fund had a bad time over most of 1991.
Manager Anthony Bolton attributes this to being too cautious about economic
growth in Europe. However, there has been a recovery and the fund is still
top in the European sector over five years.
Sally Walden manages both the smaller 1992 and European income funds, which
have very similar records over three years. European Income invested heavily
in financial stocks last year, and the fund benefited from its relatively
defensive stance. Only about 20 to 30 per cent of the fund is in fixed
interest stocks. The Opportunities fund invests in companies (including the
UK) which are supposed to gain from de-regulation or mergers and takeovers
as a result of the single market.
Moneybuilder and Managed International are run along slightly different
lines. Manager Bruce Russell has to take less of a 'bottom up' approach and
concentrate instead on asset allocation. The responsibility for choosing the
actual stocks in the funds rests with individual managers. Managed, which
invests in shares in several countries, has done well over both one and
three years, but Moneybuilder, which invests in Fidelity unit trusts, has
been disappointing, owing to holdings in the European and Special Situations
trusts.
In the US, the American Equity Income fund is in the bottom 25 per cent of
its sector on both a one and three year view. It is hoped that moving the
manager from London to Boston will help, as Boston's income funds have a
good record. Nevertheless, Haberman admits 'the jury is still out', although
he claims some underperformance was predictable since defensive income
stocks have been out of favour in the US.
In contrast, smaller companies have bounced back, and this has been
reflected in a strong performance by the US Special Situations fund in 1991.
The larger, American growth fund is in the top 25 per cent of its sector
over three years. These funds are also run from Boston, although by
different managers.
In the Far East, the record is mixed. The Japanese smaller companies fund
has done well over three years and the Far East Income fund is top of its
sector over two years; the other trusts have achieved below average
performances. Fidelity puts quite an effort into the region and has built a
team of local analysts and managers who should be at an advantage in
appreciating and understanding the complexities of the Far East.
Far East income's performance owes much to being underweight in Japanese
equities over the past year. About half of the trust is in yen bonds and
some 5 to 10 per cent in convertibles, the rest equities.
Much of Fidelity's recent underperformance can be attributed to misreading
the economic scenario and its value-based stock-picking style, which fares
badly in depressed markets.
If you buy Fidelity unit trusts, you are taking a risk, but historically
this has paid off. Over the long term, when equities usually outperform
other forms of investment, Fidelity's approach has worked. The group's
Special Situations fund, for example, has the sixth best performance of all
unit trusts over 10 years.

CONGLOMERATES may be out of fashion, but Tomkins is expected to deliver a
healthy interim profit increase of perhaps 35 per cent on Monday.
With Philips Industries, acquired in August 1990, contributing to the full
six months, pre-tax profits are estimated to have risen from Pounds 31.2m to
about Pounds 42m. Two thirds of the group's sales are in the US and Murray
Ohio, maker of lawnmowers and bicycles, is thought to have performed
particularly well.
Stockbroker analysts in the City expect TSB, the sixth largest UK banking
group, to announce a pre-tax loss of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 60m for
1991, when its annual results are published on Thursday.
TSB may have to put aside about Pounds 665m in provisions against bad loans.
A year ago TSB posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 312m, but heavy losses by
Hill Samuel, its merchant banking arm, drove it into a Pounds 150m pre-tax
loss at the half-way stage.
Asda, the hard-pressed grocery chain, is due to announce a ghastly set of
full-year results on Wednesday. The food retailing industry has recently
been affected by a worrying fall in sales volumes and Asda has suffered more
than most. It is believed that sales at some of its older stores have been
running more than 8 per cent down on last year, causing a heavy erosion of
margins.
Small shifts in sales can have a huge impact on profits because of grocers'
high operational gearing and analysts have therefore forecast a wide spread
of profits estimates ranging from Pounds 5m to Pounds 35m. Last year Asda
made Pounds 58.6m at the half-year stage.
Stakis, the hotel and nursing homes group where Sir Lewis Robertson took
over as chairman last March, produces its full year results on Tuesday. At
the half year stage Stakis lost Pounds 45.1m, including Pounds 44m
write-offs as part of Sir Lewis's rescue, which included the sacking of
Andros Stakis as chief executive.
Analysts are forecasting a full year pre-tax loss to the end of September of
between Pounds 47m and Pounds 50m varying according to their assessments of
how badly Stakis has traded in the second half, during which it has sold its
pubs but not disposed of its casinos.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The key questions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How much you are prepared to contribute?
Maximising your pension is important, but other commitments - such as
mortgages - require a share of your income.
This leads to a central problem in pension planning. The time when you could
gain the most growth from an investment, below the age of 50, is also when
you are least able to save.
Simon Philip, of Chantrey Financial Services, suggests it is best while you
still have heavy commitments to set a small proportion of your income for
AVCs, and stick to it as a form of self-discipline. If you are not able to
say goodbye to the money until you retire, do not put it in an AVC.
How great a pension are you aiming to achieve?
Inflation makes this a hard question to answer, and virtually any pension
illustration can mislead in some way.
But some calculations help. Family Assurance, a friendly society, has
launched a pensions guidance service which provides quotations on the level
of AVCs you will need to deliver the pension you want.
It does this by assessing the pension rights you have accrued in your
company scheme, and converting this into a regular pension, in today's
money. It then calculates the amount you would need to pay in AVCs to make
this figure up to the pension you are aiming for. The service is free,
although Family does take the opportunity to recommend its own FSAVC
contract, which is called Freestand.
This makes it easier to work out how much you should contribute. Remember,
illustrations must make assumptions about the rate of growth of your AVC,
and about inflation. Also, with luck, your salary will rise before you
retire.
How good is your in-house scheme?
Staying with your in-house AVC will give you a quieter life, and should cost
you less than an FSAVC. You therefore need to be unhappy with their
arrangements before you opt for an FSAVC.
According to Simon Philip, there are two main advantages you could achieve
with a free-standing AVC - diversification and improved investment
performance.
He suggests that if you have amassed more than Pounds 50,000 in the company
scheme, taking out a separate AVC might be good, just for the
diversification it would bring.
If the in-house scheme offers a poor choice - and some only offer one
building society account - then an FSAVC looks better. But some in-house
AVCs offer a wide range of funds and allow free transfers between them.
What is your tax position?
Brian Symonds of Sun Life points out that top-rate taxpayers have a stronger
incentive to stay with an in-house scheme. Claiming top-rate tax relief is
easier and quicker this way, and can be done immediately, while you have to
claim relief via your annual tax return for an FSAVC.
Will you stay with your current company until you retire?
If not, the portability of an FSAVC grows more appealing. You could treat an
FSAVC as a personal pension, and continue making contributions even if you
became self-employed, says Symonds.
If you are considering early retirement, but do not want your bosses to know
this, an FSAVC could make sense. Sudden heavy donations into an in-house AVC
might raise questions, which you could avoid by using an FSAVC.
Which Free-Standing AVC is the best for you?
Valid performance statistics are not available, as AVCs are long-term
investments, and the longest-lived policies have been going for less than
five years. The best you can do is choose a group whose unit-linked or
with-profits performance in other funds is strong.
But you can find out what the charges are. On unit-linked and unitised
with-profits AVCs. A 5 per cent bid-offer spread and 1 per cent annual
charges are typical. Keep your charges low. Also, avoid AVCs which restrict
your ability to shop around for an annuity when you retire.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Three initials that spell a pension
profit - AVCs offer people in company schemes an extra option. John Authers
looks at their advantages and disadvantages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU probably already know how to give your investments more PEP.
But if you want to boost your pension, three other initials might also spell
a strong and tax-efficient investment - AVC.
Any member of a company pension scheme - but not personal pension plan
holders - can make Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Money paid into AVCs carries full tax relief at your top rate of income tax.
This effectively means your contributions when invested in the fund
automatically grow by a third, if you pay 25 per cent tax, and by two thirds
if you pay 40 per cent tax.
Many people do not realise this. A survey by Family Assurance of 20,000 of
its members found that less than one in ten knew how to make Additional
Voluntary Contributions.
Perhaps this is not surprising. AVCs sound technically baffling, and their
name implies that they are an integral part of company pensions.
But since the pensions market was liberalised in 1987-88, with the
introduction of personal pensions and changes to the rules on contracting
out of SERPS, it has been possible to use AVCs as free-standing investments
in their own right. They provide a vital tool in improving your pension
beyond the basic amount your company will provide.
PEPs can do this as well, of course, but as end-of-year tax-planning
approaches, boosting pension contributions must be considered in the same
context as sheltering equity investments from tax.
Virtually all AVCs - with the exception of a few public sector pension
schemes - are invested in funds separate from the main scheme. So the fact
that you are already committed to a company scheme does not limit the broad
range of possibilities facing you when choosing an AVC.
Far from forming an integral part of a company scheme, the AVC could be more
simply described as a personal pension plan for people who are already
committed to a company scheme.
But the rules are limiting. The maximum you can invest in an AVC in one year
is 15 per cent of your gross earnings.
If your company makes all the contributions into your pension scheme, then
you are free to put a full 15 per cent of your gross income into an AVC.
However, many company schemes require you to make contributions. A typical
figure might be 5 per cent of your gross salary. In this case, you would be
allowed to put up to 10 per cent of your gross income into an AVC.
Another rule introduced for the new breed of AVCs makes them more of a
headache - all the money from an AVC fund started since April 7 1987 must be
used to buy an annuity when you retire. The annuity payments are then taxed.
You cannot take any cash in a lump sum. There is no such limit on your
freedom to spend the proceeds of a PEP.
However, Brian Symonds, of Sun Life, points out that an AVC can still
increase the size of the cash lump sum you receive when you retire. Your
main company scheme may not be prepared to give you the maximum lump sum
allowed by the law if you have not built up full pension rights within the
fund. The trustees might think it more responsible to put more of your money
into the annuity.
If you can show that you have a guaranteed income from the AVC annuity, the
trustees are more likely to give you the lump sum.
This can be overlooked, but the restrictions on what you can do with an AVC
are still a problem. Also, bear in mind that annuities paid in future would
be taxed at the rates prevailing at the time. Buy a PEP or a TESSA, and you
must do so out of income which has already been taxed, but it will act as a
shelter against future taxes.
Another barrier to understanding AVCs is their division into two forms of
AVC contract - freestanding AVCs, and in-house AVCs.
The differences between the two contracts are described in the box (below
right), but note that neither is directly related to your salary. Both will
build up a fund, and then buy as much income as possible with that.
The law forces company schemes to offer AVCs.
AVCs can be invested in a full range of funds; unit-linked, with-profits,
unit-trust linked or building society funds are all available. This gives
AVCs an advantage over PEPs, which can only be invested in equities.
In the long term, equities give the best chance of capital growth. But if
you are close to retirement, a broadly based AVC is more secure.
There is a full choice of methods of paying contributions. You can pay by
regular premiums, or make a one-off single lump sum contribution into a
fund. Most plans are flexible.
The Labour party, which could win the election due this year, is committed
to raising taxes for those on the highest income. This is an incentive to
buy a PEP which will deliver a tax-free lump sum no matter what taxes
prevail when the plan is closed. It also gives PEPs an advantage over AVCs,
because the annuities are taxed as income, and so would not offer any
shelter against new taxes.
But this does not mean that AVCs do not have an important part to play for
many people, or that the choice between PEPs and AVCs is mutually exclusive.
Money in an AVC is irretrievable until you retire. In a PEP it will make
little sense to try to retrieve it for at least five years.
Those in their 30s or 40s, with fairly tight commitments, might limit
themselves to a high-yielding PEP, and wait to see how the markets perform
over the next few decades.
But if retirement is a little closer, do not forget the range of
tax-efficient investments open to you through AVCs.
One final advantage, pointed out by advisers Towry Law, is that AVCs are
invested in tax-free funds. Qualifying endowments, also popular as shelters
against a Labour tax regime, invest in taxed funds.

FT  11 JAN 92 / British Gas fights to avoid inquiry: Company at odds with
OFT over deal to reduce its industrial market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas was last night fighting a desperate rearguard action against the
threat of a far-reaching investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission into its dominance of the industrial gas market.
The company appeared to soften its position on an agreement it reached with
the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) late last month to halve its share of the
industrial gas market by 1995.
However the two sides remained at loggerheads after British Gas revised its
conditions for accepting the deal, which includes hiving off its pipeline
division.
The OFT has told British Gas that the Commission will launch an inquiry into
the company unless it agrees to the deal without conditions. The OFT has
given the company until next Thursday to agree to the deal, which was due to
be concluded yesterday.
The deadline was extended because Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas,
is abroad.
The row is rapidly becoming the most acrimonious dispute yet between a
privatised utility and the regulatory and competition authorities. It has
brought British Gas into sharp conflict with not just the OFT but also
Ofgas, its regulator, and the government.
British Gas has backed down from its earlier insistence that it would have
to raise domestic prices to offset the impact of the OFT's proposals for the
industrial gas market.
However the company said it would only abide by the deal if the MMC
arbitrated in potential disputes over pricing with Ofgas. This proposal
seems certain to worsen the company's already stormy relations with Ofgas
which rejected it as unacceptable. Mr Malcolm Keay, deputy director general
of Ofgas, said: 'There is no legal basis for the MMC to act as final
adjudicator.'
British Gas is still pressing for a review of a tough new pricing formula
which Ofgas is due to introduce in April.
The company betrayed its deep mistrust of its regulator by calling for the
MMC to arbitrate in any disputes created by such a review. British Gas said
this would ensure fair play in any dispute.
But the OFT is unhappy with the attachment of any conditions to its
agreement with British Gas. Talks between the company and the OFT will
continue next week and British Gas remains optimistic. Mr Cedric Brown,
senior managing director, said: 'We are within a whisker of reaching
agreement, but also within a whisker of an MMC inquiry.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK builders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's admission from Raine Industries that late last summer it bought
a 3 per cent stake in fellow builder Y J Lovell is instructive indeed. From
one angle it looks like a disappointing stumble by a company which hitherto
had proved commendably sure-footed in the recession. Raine's shares, after
all, have kept pace with the market as a whole and outperformed the sector
by 220 per cent over three years. There is certainly room to question the
judgment of those who signed off the Lovell rights issue document last
April, on which Raine apparently based its decision to invest. But given
Lovell's now fragile condition - its shares are roughly a sixth of Raine's
average purchase price - there is no escaping the Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m loss
which will have to be taken as an extraordinary item in Raine's interim
figures.
On a wider front, it is worth noting that Raine's move was partly prompted
by Taylor Woodrow's equally ill-timed stakebuilding in Lovell. The sector's
most conservative blue chip representative and one of its most admired
second-liners have therefore both had their fingers burned at the same game.
At the very least, this is a reminder for investors that hostile bids for
contractors are fraught with danger and cannot be taken for granted even at
this dire stage in the cycle. Takeover hopes for Lovell are certainly wide
of the mark. It also raises a question over general management ability in
the sector at a time when it will be badly needed. Perhaps it is no accident
that the new year has started as gloomily for the builders as the end of
1991.

FT  11 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's surge in Allied-Lyons' share price - up 13 per cent at one
point, before closing up 4 per cent - shows the remarkable persistence of
bid speculation about the company. The latest rumour, concerning Seagram
this time, was no more obviously substantial than usual. But the market
evidently has the stubborn conviction at the back of its mind that Allied
deserves to be broken up.
It is not immediately obvious why. Granted, Allied's return on capital is
much lower than GrandMet's - though not Guinness's - despite the fact that
it does not capitalise its brands. But in the most clearly comparable area
of wines and spirits margins it does not do too badly, with 20 per cent last
year compared to GrandMet's 19 per cent and Guinness's 31 per cent. It has
also done well enough in share price terms, outperforming the market by 140
per cent in the past 10 years and 35 per cent in the past five.
Here perhaps lies the snag. Despite the provisional welcome extended to the
new management, the market does not value Allied as highly on fundamental
grounds as it does GrandMet. Yet Allied is on 15 times current year
earnings, GrandMet on 13. In terms of its own logic, therefore, the market
had better be right about a bid arriving sooner or later.

FT  11 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Ratners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A term immortally associated with Mr Gerald Ratner himself might well sum up
Christmas trading in his jewellery group. But though the market responded
yesterday by marking the shares 9 per cent lower, it is not clear that the
provisional trading statement leaves investors much the wiser.
A 15 per cent fall in sales in the crucial six week period up to December 25
was certainly worse than expected, as was the break-even trading forecast
for the year about to end. The key issues, however, are Ratners' financial
position and its relationship with the banks. In this latter respect the
message of support from Barclays and Midland was hardly overwhelming, being
chiefly confined to welcoming the appointment of a Scottish chartered
accountant as Mr Ratner's boss. As for the balance sheet, Pounds 217m of net
debt is a rather lower figure than might have been feared, and one that
suggests the process of squeezing out working capital is reasonably well
advanced. Borrowings nevertheless are seasonally depressed. And though the
looming put option on the convertible bonds is mainly provided for, it will
still cost around Pounds 55m in cash come October.
Though Ratners gave no information about its lending covenants yesterday,
one can only assume in the current climate that the banks hold the key. For
the moment a Saatchi-style restructuring does not look to be necessary. But
mention of Saatchi is a reminder of a general truth; when they fall this
far, they generally do not come back.

FT  11 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling's paper adversary
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FT-SE Index: 2,477.9 (
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
20.0)
There has been a good deal of talk this week about sterling dropping below
its ERM limits. This did not happen, nor is there any immediate danger of
it. It is worth recalling some details of the system to explain why. All
that matters for sterling at present is its rate against the Spanish peseta,
since it is comfortably within its limits against the other currencies. The
rules say that the Bank of England has a perpetual obligation to buy
unlimited amounts of sterling for pesetas at a floor rate of Pta 180.59,
while the Bank of Spain has a corresponding obligation to sell pesetas for
sterling. Since the Bank of England has never been offered sterling under
these rules, the floor has by definition never been breached.
The reason is simple enough. The peseta is far less heavily traded than
sterling; the market therefore believes that if intervention were triggered,
the peseta would take the brunt. When sterling reaches its floor - as it did
several times yesterday - it simply drags the peseta with it. The floor
seemed to have been breached repeatedly this week outside the ERM's hours of
8am to 4pm London time. But outside these hours the peseta is not traded, so
the calculation is bogus.
The real trouble for sterling comes when it hits a currency its own size.
The nearest is the D-Mark, where sterling's absolute floor is DM2.778.
Yesterday's rate of DM2.835 therefore gives almost 6 pfennigs of leeway. But
it would not do to be complacent. Sterling has been independently weak this
week, losing 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark even as the D-Mark lost 3.5
pfennigs against the dollar. The UK money markets have lost their fear of an
interest rate rise, with three month money just  1/8 th of a point above
base rate. The D-Mark floor wants watching just the same.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Japan buys into the west's shop windows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT the Japanese have gained control of Aquascutum and Daks Simpson,
they have decided they need the right kind of shop window dummies to display
their newly acquired robes and reinforce the British image in their shops.
Yoshichu Mannequins, one of Japan's leading manufacturers of mannequins and
display products, is acquiring the Rootstein Hopkins Group, a leading UK
mannequin designer and manufacturer.
The acquisition will take Yoshichu into virtually every high street in
Britain. Rootstein Hopkins models are on show in department stores and
clothes shops throughout the UK and the rest of Europe, as well in Japan.
Indeed, Rootstein Hopkins was responsible for one of the most significant
recent innovations in the mannequin market. Traditionally Japanese
mannequins had western features and it was only after Rootstein Hopkins
produced a dummy modelled on a famous Japanese fashion model 10 years ago
that mannequins with oriental features became acceptable in Japan.
The privately owned Rootstein Hopkins, based in London, is known for its
high quality mannequins, 95 per cent of which are modelled on real people
including figures such as actress Joan Collins.
The decision to sell by Mr Richard Hopkins and Mrs Adel Rootstein, the
husband and wife founders, was made after they had difficulty finding a
successor.
The Japanese company, which produces Rootstein Hopkins mannequins under
licence, emphasised the cultural as well as the commercial benefits of the
acquisition.
'You might say that the east and west are joining hands in an artistic
collaboration,' said a Yoshichu spokesman.
The deal, the value of which was not disclosed, underlines the Japanese
taste for quality products and well known brand names. It also reflects a
growing interest among Japanese companies in establishing a toe-hold in the
European retailing market.
Yoshichu hopes ownership of Rootstein Hopkins, which has manufacturing
facilities in the UK and the US, will help it develop an international
operation. Rootstein Hopkins exports about 90 per cent of its products
manufactured in the UK, which contributed about Pounds 6m to sales last year
of about Pounds 8m.

FT  11 JAN 92 / US jobless figure hits highest level in five years
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush returned to Washington from his Asian trip yesterday
to be greeted by a jump in unemployment to the highest level for five years.
Furthermore, a New York Times/CBS opinion poll showed that eight in 10
Americans believe the economy is in 'bad shape'.
The Labor Department said the unemployment rate had risen to 7.1 per cent
last month compared with 6.9 per cent in November and 5.3 per cent at the
start of the recession 18 months ago.
Financial markets took the jobs statistics calmly, although share prices
were set back - albeit fairly modestly - for the first time since
mid-December.
The deparment's figures for payroll employment were better than feared but
it revised downwards its estimate for November to show an even larger
decline - 265,000 rather than 241,000.
Speaking at Andrews air force base, Mr Bush said he was 'disappointed' by
the rise in unemployment but claimed his efforts to open markets in Asia
would stimulate growth and create more US jobs.
The opinion poll, however, indicated that fewer than a third of Americans
believed Mr Bush's Asian trip would create jobs. Mr Bush's overall approval
rating fell from 51 per cent to 48 per cent. Voters appeared evenly divided
when offered a choice of re-electing Mr Bush or supporting an unspecified
Democrat.
Mr Bush is expected to attempt to rebuild his popularity by unveiling an
ambitious growth plan in his State of the Union address on January 28.
Yesterday Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, said economic data
did not support the degree of gloom expressed. The economy was stalled
rather than falling sharply. The unemployment rate remained low by the
standards of previous downturns.
The Fed would take whatever steps were needed to ensure 'sustainable
economic expansion', he said, but warned Congress that fiscal measures to
stimulate the economy were 'premature'.

FT  11 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Denmark provides relief for gloomy
Nordic year - Robert Taylor looks back on 1991, a year investors in
Scandinavian equities would rather forget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Nordic stock markets (Copenhagen apart) 1991 was a year they would
prefer to forget, even though their overall performance improved on 1990,
when the FT-Actuaries Nordic index fell by 25 per cent. Last year it rose by
10.5 per cent, but this was below the 14.4 per cent increase in the
FT-Actuaries World Index, and investors suffered a lot at times.
A 1991 Nordic overview hides significant differences between the region's
stock markets. During the first half of last year, in the aftermath of the
Gulf war, all of them appeared to recover from their lacklustre performances
in 1990. But from mid-summer onwards the picture darkened outside
Copenhagen.
The worst performer in 1991 was Helsinki where the FT-Actuaries Finland
index dropped by 13.7 per cent in local currency, and 24.4 per cent in
dollar terms. Turnover fell 60 per cent to its lowest point since 1987. The
year started well with a 20 per cent rise in the index during the first
quarter but after that, the decline was remorseless, except for a a
short-lived upturn in July and a temporary stabilising in the late autumn.
The Helsinki bourse reflected the deterioration in the Finnish economy in
1991 as production plummeted and unemployment rose. Fewer than 20 out of the
63 listed companies made a profit last year and total combined losses
amounted to over FM13bn (Dollars 3.2bn). Market capitalisation fell from
FM160bn to FM64bn.
The banking sector was the hardest hit as credit losses escalated. Kansallis
Osake Pankki, the country's second-largest commercial bank saw it share
price more than halve, while Union Bank's shares suffered a drop of
one-third. Finland's paper and pulp companies were not in much better shape
either and they face little prospect of a sustained recovery before 1993.
The virtual disappearance of trade with the Soviet Union added to the
worries of many manufacturing companies.
For most of the year, Helsinki was plagued by speculation about the markka's
devaluation. Persistent government denials that this would not happen failed
to reassure investors. Not even the decision to link the currency to the
European Currency Unit in June settled the argument. As foreign confidence
ebbed away and interest rates soared to over 20 per cent, by November the
government was forced to agree to a 12.3 per cent devaluation as the only
way out.
The Oslo exchange also suffered a severe setback in 1991 with a NKr22.7bn
(Dollars 3.8bn) drop in share values and a decline of 11.2 per cent in the
FT-Actuaries Norway index. There was a widening gap between the performance
of shares linked to the mainland economy which remained in recession and the
offshore oil and gas sector which prospered.
The trouble lay in the Norway's banking and financial sector where mounting
credit losses threatened the existence of many leading banks and forced the
government to intervene in the autumn with a NKr11.5bn rescue package to
save them from collapse. The domestic banking index nosedived by 78.5 per
cent during the year as NKr8.58bn was wiped off share values. The worst hit
were shares in den Norske bank which suffered a 94 per cent fall in 1991.
Stockholm's performance was equally dismal. The 5.5 per cent increase in the
Affarsvarlden General index for the year was an improvement on the 29.7 per
cent fall in 1990, the bourse's worst performance this century, but it was
still a disappointment.
Between January and July, the index recovered by 40 per cent, triggered by a
number of large deals, including the acquisition of Saab-Scania by
Investor/Providentia and Tetra Pak's purchase of Alfa Laval. Confidence was
also growing that the recession was over.
But the optimism proved to be misplaced. Between mid-summer and the end of
the year the index fell by 24 per cent as it became clear that Sweden's
economy was still in a downturn. The halving in property prices ended the
boom in Swedish real estate, and many companies revealed profit declines or
even losses in their autumn interim reports. With leading banks announced
huge credit losses, the Swedish government had to bail out the country's
largest savings bank and rescue Nordbanken.
Interest rates stayed high in an attempt to convince sceptical overseas
investors that the krona was not about to be devalued. The Swedish decision
to peg the krona to the European Currency Unit in May did not quell foreign
speculation that the authorities might still manipulate the currency to
improve competitiveness.
However, a six-point rise in the Central Bank's lending rate to banks to
17.5 per cent in December to stem the outflow of foreign capital helped to
calm nerves. The abolition of the 1 per cent turnover tax on share trading
in the same month helped the bourse to make a year-end rally.
Copenhagen was the only bright light with a 16.2 per cent rise.
Traditionally a stable, defensive market dominated by domestic investors in
family-controlled foundations and institutions, it aroused considerable
foreign interest. The strong performance of the Danish economy added to the
optimistic climate.
It seems unlikely that Copenhagen will set an upward trend for the other
Nordic markets this year. Much depends on what happens to the world economy.
But observers believe that steps to further open Nordic bourses to foreign
investors should boost liquidity and stimulate some revival, even if the
region's economic outlook remains grim.

FT  11 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's long surge set into
reverse by jobless data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS ran into their first genuine setback since mid-December yesterday,
as disturbing employment news sparked heavy selling across all markets,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.07 at 3,199.46,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.51 lower at 415.10.
Even the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, the star
performer of recent days, succumbed to sellers, dropping 4.10 to 615.70.
NYSE turnover was 238m shares, and declines clearly outnumbered rises by
1,088 to 653, an indication of the downward pressure.
At first glance, the employment data for December were ambiguous. Although
the headline unemployment rate rose a sharp one-fifth of a percentage point
to 7.1 per cent - the highest since 1986 - the number of people employed on
non-farm payrolls rose last month, by 31,000.
Although analysts had expected a sizeable fall in payrolls, the figure was
not as promising as it looked, because the bulk of the rise in employment
was restricted to government agencies. Private sector employment actually
fell by 35,000, and it was this that weighed heaviest on investors' minds.
Part of the selling, however, was a natural reaction to strong recent gains,
and few analysts argued that yesterday's declines were a prelude to a major
correction in equity prices.
Among individual stocks, a rare blue-chip gain was recorded by Sears,
Roebuck, the giant retailer, which climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 3/8
on comments from the company claiming that it saw 'encouraging' signs of
consumer activity in recent sales.
The day's biggest decline was in Employee Benefits Plan, which plummeted
Dollars 30 1/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 in turnover of 3.5m shares after the
company reported fiscal second quarter profits well below analysts'
expectations.
Thiokol jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 15 3/4 after investors reacted
positively to a 'buy' recommendation from Bear Stearns, the Wall Street
broking house.
Two of the big three car manufacturers tumbled at the end of a week which
saw dreadful 1991 sales figures and a difficult trip to Japan by top
management in seek of concessions on trade, although both recovered some of
their lost ground in late trading. General Motors fell Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 31 3/4 and Ford slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 30.
On the over-the-counter market, Aldus slumped Dollars 8 1/2 to Dollars 33
1/2 after the company estimated fourth quarter profits at between 27 cents
and 32 cents a share.
Canada
TORONTO closed higher in another busy session, ending a hectic first full
week of the new year.
The 300 composite index gained 12.79 points, about 0.35 per cent, to close
at 3,593.39. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 328 to 271. For the week,
the index gained about 76 points, or about 2.2 per cent.
Volume was a heavy 42.97m shares, the ninth highest in the exchange's
history, but was down from yesterday's 49.01m shares. Trading value at
CDollars 564.7m was down from yesterday's CDollars 691.0m.
Ten of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the conglomerates group, up 1.6
per cent. Financial services gained 1.4 per cent and consumer products were
also higher.
The gold group had the day's biggest decline, off 1.4 per cent. Energy group
fell 1.0 per cent.

FT  11 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses run into profit-taking
after recent strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental bourses saw some profit-taking yesterday after a generally firm
start to the year, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose on hopes that steelworkers, due to talk to employers again
tomorrow, could settle for 5.3 per cent. The Bundesbank's average bond yield
dropped another 7 basis points to 8.18 and steels and engineering shares led
the equity market up.
The FAZ index put on 7.18 to 652.51 at midsession, almost unchanged on the
week, but the DAX closed 25.95 higher at 1,615.71, up 0.8 per cent on the
week. Volume rose from DM4.7bn to DM6.2bn.
However, some question were raised after hours. Mr Michael Geiger of County
NatWest said that steels could be brought back to earth next week by the
Thyssen Stahl press conference which was likely to shed more light on the
depressed state of the industry. Furthermore, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy
president of the Bundesbank, forecast high interest rates for the
foreseeable future.
PARIS failed to build on Thursday's gains, as profit-taking emerged after
the market's recent rise. The CAC-40 index rose 3.58 at 1,837.44, up 3.8 per
cent on the week, in turnover of FFr3.8bn after FFr4bn.
Elf continued to weigh on the index, losing FFr8.60 to FFr355.90 in the
day's heaviest turnvover of 767,100 shares. The stock fell 5.7 per cent on
the week on lower oil prices and reports of earnings downgrades. There were
also rumours that the government would force Elf to buy into the ailing
Groupe Bull.
The drinks company Remy made a rare appearance in the most actives list, as
it fell FFr3 to FFr210 in 328,600 shares. Dealers attributed the high volume
to an internal crossing of treasury stock.
Credit Local de France continued its quiet recovery. The stock fell as low
as FFr190.10 after its flotation in December but yesterday it closed FFr3.80
higher at FFr209.80, just below the issue price of FFr210.
MILAN was encouraged by the near-certainty that the general election would
be held in the first half of April. Dealers also attributed the firmer tone
to short-covering ahead of Monday's expiration of the monthly options.
The Comit index rose 8.24 to 531.76, a rise of 4.7 per cent on the week.
Turnover was estimated at near Thursday's L102.6bn. Turnover has doubled
since the start of the year, reflecting the new requirement that all trading
on behalf of third parties must be conducted on the bourse.
Generali touched L30,000 before closing up L600 or 2.1 per cent at L29,550.
ZURICH was inspired by interest rate hopes as the Credit Suisse index rose
3.6 to 465.7, slightly higher on the week, in good volume. MADRID saw lively
trade, turnover rising from Pta16.5bn to Pta22bn, but profit-taking left the
general index 0.12 lower at 253.09, up 3.9 per cent on the week.
BRUSSELS continued to focus on retailers, with Colruyt closing up 4.1 per
cent or BFr200 at an all-time high of BFr5,100 after the company announced a
62 per cent rise in six-month profits late on Thursday. The Bel-20 index
closed up 6.06 to 1,107.00, little changed on the week, in heavy turnover of
BFr1.07bn.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by the dollar and a cut in domestic interest rates.
Dealers detected interest from international investors, since Amsterdam has
lagged behind the rest of Europe. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 116.2,
up 2.3 per cent on the week.
The photocopier and office systems maker Oce-van der Grinten soared Fl 3.50
or 5.5 per cent to Fl 67 as the company's forecast of an 18 per cent gain in
1991 net profit to Fl 101m surprised the market.
STOCKHOLM advanced for the fifth consecutive session in heavy trading, but
was worried by specific proposals for drug prices in yesterday's budget.
Astra A fell SKr15 to SKr580 as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 7.8 to
954.0, up 3.5 per cent on the week. HELSINKI gained 2.2 per cent on the day
and 6.1 per cent on the week as the Hex index closed 18 higher at 829.9.

FT  11 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage deals push
Nikkei down 3.2%

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT TRUST and futures-linked arbitrage selling pushed the Nikkei
average down by 3.2 per cent yesterday, to the lowest level since the Bank
of Japan's December 30 official discount rate cut, writes Neil Weinberg in
Tokyo.
The index closed 731.34 lower at 22,381.90, 2.6 per cent down on the week,
after a day's high of 23,018.24 at the opening, and low of 22,203.03. Volume
rose from 198m to 230m shares. Advances led declines 816 to 134 with 146
unchanged, the Topix index of all first-section issues fell 39.25 to
1,660.16 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.78 to 1,247.57.
Prices fell sharply in the morning, under pressure from losses in March
index futures prices, and there was continued selling from investment trusts
facing widespread redemptions prior to their March 31 book-closing. City
banks are bailing out of investment trusts and offsetting the losses with
bond dealing gains, said Mr Yoichi Kamina, director of Japanese equity sales
at SG Warburg Securities.
Word that the Finance Ministry was holding discussions with various
securities houses about the influence of futures arbitrage trading on the
stock market also sparked concern that new restrictions could be forthcoming
next week and further depressed the market, another trader said.
High technology issues were broadly lower, with Toshiba down Y23 at Y612 and
NEC Y40 at Y1,180. Drug companies were also off, with Daiichi Pharmaceutical
losing Y80 to Y1,560 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical Y60 to Y1,440.
NTT ended at the record low of Y720,000 touched twice last year. Kyocera
gained Y110 to Y4,070 on prospects for lower losses than previously
expected.
Honda lost ground for the fourth consecutive day on a weak earnings outlook,
ending off Y30 at Y1,390.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 370.25 to 23,661.41 on volume of 21m
shares.
Roundup
THE REGION offered a mixed, but muted reaction to Tokyo's fall.
HONG KONG registered another all-time high, gaining 14.38 to 4348.2 for a
rise of 1 per cent on the week. Turnover climbed from HKDollars 1.44bn to
HKDollars 2.15bn.
Brokers said that fund managers were restructuring their portfolios by
buying laggards such as Hutchison Whampoa and New World and dumping the
over-bought banks. The heavy volume was attributed to good turnover in the
active blue-chips, and overseas buying.
AUSTRALIA's metals, mining, gold and resources shares, all relying largely
on foreign exchange for their earnings, were aided by a fall in the
Australian dollar and a stronger price for gold bullion.
Industrials were little changed and oil and gas stocks lost ground in line
with weak oil prices, but the All Ordinaries index still rose 6.0 to
1,668.0, 0.5 per cent higher on the week. The NEW ZEALAND dollar rose
against its Australian counterpart and this left the NZSE-40 Index 1.21
lower at 1,518.35.
SINGAPORE closed above the day's lows, but the Straits Times Industrial
index still ended 2.44 lower at 1,488.07, fractionally higher on the week in
quiet trading. SEOUL dropped 2.8 per cent on the day but just 0.8 per cent
on the week as the composite index fell 17.64 to 619.47 after reports of
foreign selling.
TAIWAN saw profit-taking in heavy trading, and fell after eight rising
sessions. The weighted index closed 20.69 lower at 4782.82 for a rise on the
week of 5.3 per cent. Turnover rose from TDollars 38.4bn to TDollars 42.4bn.
MANILA was encouraged by Thursday's rise in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone on the American Stock Exchange in New York and the composite index
advanced 11.74 to 1,219.83, fractionally down on the week.
BANGKOK took losses in most shares but Bangkok Bank was heavily bought for
the second day and its gain pushed the stock index to a higher close.
Bangkok Bank rose Bt2 to Bt522 with Bt1.29bn of shares changing hands, equal
to 26.5 per cent of the total market turnover. The SET index ended 1.93
higher at 727.63 on turnover of Bt4.84bn.

FT  11 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bid hint at Allied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRINKS group Allied-Lyons rose sharply in early trading on renewed
speculation that the group might be taken over by a consortium of Seagram,
the Canadian drinks group and Philip Morris, the US food conglomerate
The shares rose as much as 80p in a burst of early trading but then pulled
back to close 35 up on the day at 667p on heavy turnover of 6.1m. There was
also unusually heavy activity in the London Traded Options market.
Allied-Lyons had no comment to make on the rumours.
Speculation firmed on the back of a freelance journalist's inquiries
according to Mr Chris Wickham, analyst at Lehman Brothers International.
Allied was also tipped in the press recently as one of the four British
stocks most likely to be taken over in 1992.
Allied-Lyons was viewed as vulnerable last year when it reported poor
results, in part from foreign exchange losses. But its moves to restore
investor confidence, including a management shake-up have helped to restore
its image.
Analysts said a bidder would need Pounds 8bn to buy Allied-Lyons, taking
into account its market capitalisation of about Pounds 6bn and a Pounds 2bn
bid premium. And a bidder would be taking on about Pounds 2bn in debt, they
pointed out. Philip Morris has hinted that it might make a large acquisition
in Europe, but Allied-Lyons has not been considered its top choice.
Cadbury-Schweppes has more often been mentioned as its likely European
target. Cadbury rose 5 but closed a penny off at 439p. United Biscuits was
also affected and gained 11 before closing 4 up at 414p.
BT downgraded
Volume in the two classes of BT (formerly British Telecom), was more than
double that of the next heaviest traded stock. Some 27m BT 'new' shares
changed hands, while turnover in the 'old' topped 10m shares.
Analysts involved in the Government's sale were precluded from issuing
alterations to their forecasts until one month after the market debut of the
new shares and the end of the stabilisation process which occurred at the
close of business last Monday.
Dealers said both the stocks had held up well in the face of determined
selling by institutions, which had begun to take notice of a series of
profits downgrades by brokers associated with the flotation of a 26 per cent
stake in BT. The flotation left the government with a 22 per cent holding in
the group.
The general consensus among leading analysts was that pre-flotation
estimates of BT's pre-tax profits for 1992, mostly in the region of Pounds
3.2bn would have to be pulled back to Pounds 3.1bn and those for 1993 back
to around Pounds 3.2bn.
Kleinwort Benson said it had reduced its estimate for 1992 to Pounds 3.125bn
and for 1993 to Pounds 3.25bn. BZW shifted from Pounds 3.15bn to Pounds
3.1bn for 1992 and from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 3.3bn for 1993, while UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew is forecasting Pounds 3.1bn for 1992 and Pounds 3.175bn for
1993. BT 'old' shares eased 1 1/2 to 328 1/2 p and the 'new' held at 125 1/2
p, having been up to 126 1/2 p. The stock goes 'ex' the 5.7p interim
dividend on Monday.
Oils hit again
Shearson Lehman was the latest broker to cut its forecasts for oil prices
and oil company earnings. Mr Jeremy Hudson at Shearson moved to the bottom
of the market forecast range in lowering his current year estimate for Brent
crude to Dollars 18.50 a barrel and predicted 'substantial' weakness during
the next eights weeks. He downgraded his current year estimate of
replacement net income for BP by 40 per cent to Pounds 635m and that for
Shell by 20 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn. His bearish stance was illustrated by
his advice to clients to 'buy both stocks some 5 to 10 per cent lower down.'
BP settled 1 1/2 off at 282p on turnover of 6.5m while Shell dipped 3 to
473p on 6.9m traded. Lasmo, still responding to a series of broker buy
recommendations, rose 4 to 238p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 4m. Smith
New Court described Lasmo as 'significantly (15 to 20 per cent)
undervalued,' while Kleinwort Benson labelled the stock its premier 1992
selection in the E&amp;P sub-sector.
Motors weak
Motor stocks were weak after securities house Smith New Court took a stark
look at the sector and cut its profit estimates for the coming year.
Smith's new motors analyst Mr Peter Deighton remains a seller continuing
with the house line that the sector is 'best avoided'. He has reduced his
1991 forecast for T&amp;N by Pounds 18m to Pounds 42m and his 1992 figure by
Pounds 15m to Pounds 55m. He also raises a question mark over the 1992
dividend. Both profit figures are at the bottom of the range of analysts'
estimates and the shares fell 10 to 102p. The house cut its 1991 and 1992
forecasts for GKN by Pounds 10m to Pounds 80m and Pounds 115m and the shares
dropped 15 to 283p. Lucas Industries, also part of the forecast review, lost
7 to 102p.
Raine Industries eased to 102p with analysts expected to alter their
estimates for the group, which confirmed it had built up a 2.9 per cent
stake in Lovell, the troubled construction group.
Smith &amp; Nephew was firm after news it had settled its US legal case with
Polteco for Dollars 37.5m, sharply cutting a damages award from Dollars 96m.
The shares gained 1 3/4 to 143p on heavy turnover of 9.4m.
Motor group Inchcape continued to improve on the back of the 89.3 per cent
take-up of its rights issue. The shares gained 9 to 404p.
Asda shares were heavily traded (18m changed hands) and dropped to 28p
before stabilising at 28 1/2 p, a net fall of 4 1/2 p, after news of the
change of the group's finance director.
Asda is scheduled to report interim figures on Wednesday when profits are
expected to be sharply down on last year's Pounds 60m. Estimates range from
Pounds 10m to Pounds 30m.
Bearish noises from AB Foods' annual meeting left the shares 16 weaker at
447p and affected other milling and bakery stocks such as RHM, 8 off at
236p, and Dalgety, 9 lower at 376p.
Heavy trading in Burton saw the stock retreat 1 1/2 more to 34p on turnover
of 14m; dealers said a Smith New Court sell note had triggered much of the
activity in the stock. Ratners eased 2 to 21p on turnover of 13m after the
statement on Christmas trading and the management changes.
Principal chemical stocks were weakened by a change of stance from
securities house Smith New Court. The house, is preparing a 20-page strategy
document on the sector and analyst Mr Charles Lambert said yesterday: 'The
whole sector is overvalued'.
The Smiths analysts spoke to their sales team yesterday morning and clients
were being advised to take profits principally in ICI, which fell 10 1/2 to
1167 1/2 p and Courtaulds which lost 20 to 499p.
A positive note from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew on textile stocks in general and
Coats Viyella in particular encouraged buyers. The stronger dollar and a UBS
forecast on the US currency was behind the forecast change. Coats Viyella
rose 8 to 176p.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rise no help to sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar surged on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, but this did
little to ease the pressure on sterling, which remained pinned close to its
floor within the European exchange rate mechanism, writes Simon London.
The dollar retreated slightly overnight in the Far East following a
substantial surge in New York on Thursday which took the US currency to a
close of DM1.5605 and Y125.82. By the close in Tokyo the dollar stood
slightly lower against the D-Mark at DM1.5593 and little changed against the
yen.
However, once European trading resumed, the US currency continued on an
upward path. Further impetus was added by the release of unexpectedly strong
US labour market statistics.
The figures showed an increase in non-farm employment of 31,000 during
December. Analysts had predicted a decline in employment of between 50,000
and 100,000.
The data were interpreted as a sign that the US economy may not be entering
a second recessionary phase and decreasing the chances of another early cut
in US interest rates. Fear of lower interest rates has been overhanging the
dollar this week.
The US currency rose through the afternoon session to close at DM1.5825 and
Y127.00, near its highs against both currencies, while sterling weakened to
Dollars 1.7940.
The US currency also benefitted from negative sentiment surrounding the
German economy, which tended to drive funds out of the D-Mark.
Analysts pointed to concern surrounding the outcome of wage negotiations
between the employers and the large metal workers union, which has been
pressing for a pay increase substantially ahead of inflation.
The strength of the Spanish currency against the D-Mark raised sterling
effective 'floor' within the European exchange rate mechanism to around
DM2.8330 during the day, although by the close the lower permitted limit had
fallen back to DM2.8310, similar to Thursday's level.
The UK currency responded with a firmer tone in the morning session, for a
time sustaining a position above DM2.84. However, during the afternoon
sterling fell back, several times dropping to its lower limit against the
D-Mark before a late rally once continental European markets had closed saw
sterling rise to close at DM2.84.
That a surge in the dollar did not help sterling surprised many analysts.
However, some suggested that a poor US employment figure and a subsequent
weakening in the dollar could have hurt sterling. The UK currency may be in
the difficult position of being dollar-linked when the dollar is falling,
but not when the US currency is rising.
The Australian dollar continued to loose ground following Wednesday's
1-point cut in interest rates to 7.5 per cent. By the close in London, it
stood at Dollars 0.7365, just off its low of Dollars 0.7340 and from Dollars
0.7345 on Thursday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST Chicago, the holding company for First National Bank of Chicago,
posted a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 15.1m, or 40 cents per share,
compared with earnings of Dollars 57.1m or 75 cents per share a year ago.
Annual earnings for 1991 were Dollars 116.3m, or Dollars 1.15 per share,
down by more than half from Dollars 249.3m, or Dollars 3.32, in 1990.
The fourth-quarter results were hit by a Dollars 150m provision for credit
losses, primarily for two loans in retailing and communications. Another
Dollars 30m was set aside as loss provisions for other real estate assets.
Non-performing assets fell by Dollars 300m at the end of 1991 from their
peak of Dollars 1.6bn. The bank reduced its quarterly dividend to 30 cents
from 50 cents.

FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Insurers' report leaves cause of death open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRELIMINARY report prepared for insurers reaches no conclusions about the
cause of the death of the publisher, Mr Robert Maxwell.
It is understood that the report, which has been drafted by Dr Iain West,
the Guys hospital pathologist, was circulating in the London insurance
market yesterday.
Dr West is working on behalf of a number of insurers who underwrote a Pounds
20m policy insuring against Mr Maxwell's accidental death. The policy will
pay out if Mr Maxwell died accidentally or was murdered. It would not cover
his death from either suicide or natural causes.
Dr West's work has been delayed by his failure to obtain a copy of an
earlier 500 page report prepared by Spanish pathologists. Insurers will base
their decision on Dr West's final report which he is expected to complete
after studying the conclusions of the Spanish document. The burden of proof
is on the Maxwell companies that took out the policy and are the
beneficiaries.
Dr West was a member of a team of British and Isareli doctors who performed
an autopsy on Mr Maxwell in Israel. He has dismissed claims by the magazine
Paris Match that a video tape of the autopsy showed Mr Maxwell had been
beaten before he died.
Mr Carlos Lopez de Lamela, director of the Las Palmas Forensic Institute who
was part of the Spanish team who did the first autopsy, said yesterday that
he totally rejected any suggestion that Mr Maxwell had sustained injuries.

says chairman
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Shaffer, who is chairman of the Macmillan publishing group and was
last week named by a New York bankruptcy court to manage the US assets of
Maxwell Communication Corporation, told MCC's bank creditors that
Macmillan's business had felt little impact from the scandal surrounding the
collapse of the Maxwell empire.
Mr Shaffer sought to reassure MCC's bank creditors in New York on Thursday,
at a meeting also attended by Mr Mark Homan, the Price Waterhouse partner
who is one of the UK court-appointed administrators of MCC.
MCC filed last month for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law.
Under a transatlantic agreement announced on January 3, Mr Shaffer will
manage the US assets of MCC and consult with UK administrators. The New York
court agreement is subject to review next week.
In addition Mr Shaffer said yesterday that he wished to correct a statement
he made in an interview earlier this week concerning the holders of shares
in Berlitz, the language school subsidiary of Macmillan.
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr Shaffer said that Swiss Bank Corporation was
among the five groups that received Berlitz stock from the Maxwells as
collateral on loans; yesterday he said that it was Credit Suisse and not
Swiss Bank Corporation he intended to mention.
The Daily News, the loss-making New York paper that was part of the Maxwell
empire and which has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11,
said that it had retained Salomon Brothers as its financial adviser.

FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: US operations take toll on Quiligotti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON-FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUILIGOTTI, the USM-quoted manufacturer and installer of terrazzo floors
based in Stockport, has incurred an attributable loss of Pounds 1.11m after
paying compensation of Pounds 371,000 net to its previous family directors
in the wake of an Pounds 8m management buy-in last September, writes Ian
Hamilton-Fazey.
In November the company said there would be a trading loss of Pounds 444,000
in the six months to September 30, because operations in the US lost Pounds
860,000 and more than wiped out profits of Pounds 672,000 in Britain and
Ireland, and because of Pounds 256,000 bad debts provision.
However, the full interim figures announced yesterday revealed a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 646,000 (profit Pounds 1.08m) after an exceptional Pounds
202,000 for reorganisation of the UK business. To this is added compensation
for the Quiligotti family - founding father and two sons - which is charged
in the accounts as an extraordinary Pounds 371,000 net of tax; gross
payments being nearly Pounds 571,000. The buy-in team initially hoped to
work with the family.
Losses per share were 2.53p (earnings 2.41p) and the interim dividend is
passed (0.76p).

Pre-tax profits for the year ended September 28 rose 18 per cent to Pounds

Earnings per share were 12p (8.8p). The final dividend is a proposed 3p for

Clarke Foods, the USM-quoted ice cream manufacturer, yesterday unveiled its
Pounds 6.8m cash call and announced details of its Pounds 12m purchase of
Lyons Maid from Allied-Lyons, the brewing and foods group.
The 2-for-3 rights issue was pitched at 60p. Clarke's shares have been

resume on Monday.
Mr Harry Clarke, the man who made the Klondike bar America's best-selling
novelty ice cream, said institutions had been happy with the rights price.
The Clarke family, which holds about 33 per cent of the company, will take
up part of its entitlement, leaving it with 27 per cent of the voting
rights. Hillsdown Holdings, which holds 16.75 per cent of Clarke and from
which it bought its first three ice cream companies, will also take up its
rights in full.
Clarke will pay Allied-Lyons Pounds 8.6m on completion of the deal for Lyons
Maid and the balance in 30 months. The company will also assume Lyons' trade
creditors.

FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Blackland Oil shares suspended at 12p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading in the shares of Blackland Oil has been temporarily suspended at 12p
at the company's request, pending shareholder approval of re-organisation.
The directors of this USM-quoted oil exploration and production company
stated that they had noted the adverse movement in the share price and
rumours of a rights issue. They announced that the company was in 'advanced
discussions' that might lead to a 'major acquisition by the company in the
near future, which would involve raising new equity finance for the expanded
group'.

FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: First Spanish net asset value lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value at First Spanish Investment Trust fell from 85.2p to 72.2p
over the six months to November 30. However it was higher than the 68.3p of
a year earlier.
Sir William Harding, chairman, said the fall was due to the poor performance
of the construction sector, in which the portfolio was heavily invested.
Net revenue for the half year to end-November was Pounds 270,000 (Pounds
347,000) for earnings per share were 0.76p (0.98p).

FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Increased loss for British Bloodstock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 412,000 were announced by the British
Bloodstock Agency for the half year to September 30 compared with a loss
last time of Pounds 309,000.
The USM-quoted wholesaling, agricultural materials and livestock group, had
achieved a significant reduction in overhead expenses Mr Michael Wates, the
chairman, said, but the deepening of the recession in bloodstock markets had
outweighed the savings.
He added that the sale of Thormanby Stud in December and two smaller
properties had produced more than Pounds 500,000 which would reduce
borrowings and interest charges.
Although gross revenue fell to Pounds 8.52m (Pounds 14.6m) turnover moved
just ahead to Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.85m). The loss per share increased to
10.1p (8.1p) and again there is no dividend.

FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pena perks prompt parting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAN PENA, president and chief executive of Great Western Resources, has
quit the beleaguered oil, coal and gas group. Payments totalling Dollars
1.45m made to him by the company, which it classifies as loans, will be
deducted from his compensation package.
Mr Pena's departure follows significant shareholder dissatisfaction with his
performance and that of the company, the shares of which have fallen from
242p more than a year ago to last night's 8p, down 1p.
Shareholders were also dissatisfied with expenses claimed by Mr Pena, which
once included Dollars 10,000 to transport his dog Driller to Houston by
private Lear jet. Mr Pena has since repaid the expense.
Mr Pena's departure removes the immediate pressure for a Class Four circular
which would have sought retroactive shareholder approval to reclass payments
made to him during the 1991 fiscal year as loans.
The decision on Mr Pena's departure was taken at a board meeting on Thursday
morning, UK time. Mr Howard Wolf, who was brought in by shareholders to
replace Mr Pena as chairman last month, said any compensation would 'not be
material' after deducting the loans and other expenses.
Had the circular come out, it would have shown that GWR made loans of
Dollars 700,000, Dollars 600,000 and Dollars 150,000 to Mr Pena.
However, he received a total of Dollars 2.65m during 1991, including his
Dollars 600,000 annual salary. Most of the payments arose from the expenses
of moving Mr Pena from Los Angeles to Houston, where the company is based,
in 1990.
Some Dollars 600,000, which will not be deducted from his pay-off, comprised
Dollars 150,000 moving expenses and Dollars 450,000 interest on bridging
loans for Mr Pena's new Dollars 4m house in Houston.
Great Western also purchased a Dollars 1.1m penthouse flat in Houston to
house Mr Pena and his family, rent and expense free, while work was done on
the Houston house. From yesterday the company is charging the Penas rent, to
be deducted from the pay-off.
Of the loans, Dollars 600,000 was used to meet part of the repayment terms
of Mr Pena's Houston home. The company took up the obligation, and
attributed it to the potential loss on the value of his California home,
which was never sold.
A further Dollars 700,000 was for moving expenses and tax payments claimed
on these charges by Mr Pena. The final Dollars 150,000 arose from
refurbishment costs for the Houston house - including antiques and fittings
 -which were invoiced to the company.
Mr Pena also holds life insurance policies, paid for by GWR, with an annual
premium of Dollars 144,000 and cover of about Pounds 10m. GWR now intends to
stop the policies and retrieve any residual cash value.
Mr Pena, who holds a little more than 10 per cent of GWR, remains on the
board. However, Mr Wolf said he did not expect Mr Pena to be presented for
re-election at the annual meeting next month.
Mr Wolf also said yesterday that GWR planned to present details of the legal
battle with its largest customer, South Carolina Public Service Authority,
in the annual accounts. The group has had severe financial difficulties
since SCPSA filed a suit against it in November 1990.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Bell tolls for change: Lloyd's reforms will not meet
everyone's hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expectations are running high that a task force set up by Lloyd's of London
will recommend far-reaching changes to the insurance market in the wake of
its first losses for more than 20 years.
'I hope to God that it isn't a damp squib,' says one insider at the
Corporation of Lloyd's, which provides the market's regulatory and back-up
services. 'Enormous attention is being focused on this.'
On Wednesday, the task force is scheduled to publish the most comprehensive
proposals for reform of the market's antiquated business structure in recent
years. And while it may fall short of recommending a complete overhaul of
Lloyd's, it should nevertheless call for radical reforms.
One task force member said this week that emphasis in the report is on
market-driven change, adding: 'You could see a completely different Lloyd's
in the next 10 years.'
The report has been prepared by a 14-man group - chaired by Mr David
Rowland, the chief executive of Sedgwick, the insurance broker - composed of
senior underwriters, brokers and executives at Lloyd's and advised by the
management consultancy company, McKinsey.
The task force was set up last January by Mr David Coleridge, chairman of
Lloyd's, as part of efforts to find ways to reduce costs, secure the
market's future capital base and reverse the long-term decline of its share
of specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance.
But Lloyd's immediate commercial difficulties and the acute problems of many
of its Names - the individuals whose personal wealth provides the market's
capital base - have given extra urgency to the task force's work and
increased the political significance of what began as a relatively low-key
exercise.
Last June the market reported overall losses of Pounds 510m. Reflecting the
results of 1988, these losses resulted from a combination of catastrophes
such as the explosion aboard Piper Alpha, the North Sea oil rig and rising
US asbestosis and pollution claims.
The damage was concentrated among a sizeable minority of Names, with as many
as a quarter losing Pounds 50,000 each according to a survey by Chatset, the
independent research firm.
Two more years of losses are anticipated - Lloyd's expects its results for
1989 and 1990, which it will report over the next 18 months, to be worse
than those for 1988. Last year, just over 4,000 Names resigned from Lloyd's,
shaving more than Pounds 1bn from the market's capital base. Many of the
22,500 Names who remain in the market are making their membership
conditional on the adoption of reforms by Lloyd's and a quick return to
profitability.
Last November a poll conducted by Mori, the opinion research organisation,
showed that as many as three in five Names might leave if Lloyd's is not
firmly back in the black in 1992, when these results are reported in three
years' time. Many Names are opposed to retaining the principle of unlimited
liability, whereby they are bound to meet their insurance losses even at the
cost of personal bankruptcy.
But the report's recommendations are likely to fall short of some Names'
hopes. Those facing big losses from past years can expect only limited help.
'You can't wish away past losses,' said one broker close to the task force
this week. 'The cost of bailing out badly hit Names could be prohibitive.'
Any attempt to make a limit on liability apply retroactively (that is, to
business already written) could also be fraught with practical and legal
problems.
The task force also has relatively little room for manoeuvre to tackle the
heritage of long-tail liabilities (in which claims sometimes arise many
years after the original policy was written).
The report concentrates on three areas: the capital structure of Lloyd's;
the market's costs, declining competitiveness and the low levels of
professionalism of many underwriters; and the adequacy of the system of
self-regulation introduced by the Lloyd's Act of 1982.
The thrust of any changes will be to make Lloyd's a more attractive
investment for the individual Names who, it is acknowledged, will continue
to provide the market's capital for the foreseeable future. 'The primacy of
Names' interests is absolutely vital,' said the broker. 'If Names aren't
confident about supplying capital to the market we are not doing our job
properly. The market has been running for itself not for its capital.'
Among the recommendations could be:
Maintaining the system of unlimited liability alongside the introduction of
a cap limiting the scale of 'excessive losses' for Names.
Particularly large losses for individual Names would be borne by the market
as a whole and financed by a levy on all Names. The cap would have to be set
relatively high to keep its cost down and allay fears that this system of
'mutualisation', or shared losses, could damage the market's profitability
as a whole.
Demanding more favourable tax treatment from the government for the reserves
established by Names to pay for future losses. In common with the UK
insurance industry in general, Lloyd's does not have the same facility for
establishing tax-deductible reserves as its competitors in a number of other
European countries - a long-standing complaint.
Finding ways of channelling Names' capital to the more profitable areas of
the market, helping good agencies and syndicates to prosper and hastening
the demise of the least successful and efficient.
One step would be make the accounts of Lloyd's syndicates more open by a
move away from the present system of accounting - in which syndicates
account for the results of a given year after a time lag of three years -
towards a one-year accounting system.
Another could involve the development of a system whereby Names could buy
and sell their participations on individual syndicates.
Giving more freedom to syndicates and the agencies that manage them to
generate more business themselves. At present their freedom to contract
business without the involvement of a Lloyd's broker is sharply
circumscribed. More broadly, Lloyd's ability to market itself is limited by
the dual responsibility for both regulation and marketing of the Lloyd's
Corporation. Changes in both areas would be relatively free from controversy
and are likely.
Examining ways of strengthening the role of members' agents so that they can
'police' the market, thus playing a role similar to that of institutional
investors in the stock market.
In this respect the task force has been encouraged by the stronger role
played by members' agents in the latter half of 1991. In several cases,
agents made the supply of Names to syndicates dependent on the introduction
of changes to improve efficiency, such as a reduction of underwriters'
salaries and the appointment of new managers. When these did not
materialise, Names were directed elsewhere, starving the syndicates of
capital and making their closure inevitable.
Two further developments appear to be moving in the task force's favour.
First, rationalisation has been proceeding apace among agencies and
syndicates, producing leaner and fitter businesses. Second, there are now
clear signs that insurance rates - partially reflecting shrinkage in
capacity - are beginning to rise in most areas of the market, improving
prospects that business written in 1992 will be profitable.
The political climate also favours change. Lloyd's is under pressure to
implement any firm recommendations by the task force - a contrast to the
late 1960s when many proposals of the Cromer Report, the fruit of one effort
to change Lloyd's business practices, went unheeded.
Overall the reforms, backed up by some positive trends in the market, should
help stimulate some recovery at Lloyd's. The problem is that this may not
assuage the anger of many Names facing losses.
One disgruntled Name, who confronts hundreds of thousands of pounds of
personal losses, laments: 'Our main worry is that the whole focus is on the
future and that they will not deal with the problems of the past. They may
let the old Names sink.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Ticket to travel price war: Tour companies' manoeuvres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discounting is to Britain's tour operators what sun and sangra are to their
younger customers. When excess is followed by throbbing pain, everyone
promises a life of eternal moderation - until the next binge.
All the large operators say they have nothing to gain from the sort of
prolonged price war that led to the industry offering some foreign holidays
for less than Pounds 100 in the late 1980s. Average profit margins sank to
less than Pounds 1 a holiday for many companies, and customers complained
about the declining quality of facilities.
This week, however, Thomson, the UK's largest operator, cut Pounds 15m off
the cost of 300,000 summer holidays and warned rivals that, if they wanted a
price war, they could have one. Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson's managing
director, says: 'I don't want to go back to those days of low margins, but
people are trying to gain market share. That is a recipe for very aggressive
price competition. I'm not going to lose any of our market share.'
The collapse last year of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group
(ILG) helped ensure that remaining operators enjoyed large increases in
profits in 1991. Mr Newbold warns that this year might not be as buoyant:
'People made record profits in 1991 because of Harry Goodman's magnanimous
gesture in going out of business. I don't think people will make record
profits in 1992.'
The current price-cutting was sparked off by Airtours, the third largest
operator, which last September published brochures offering keenly
competitive prices for summer 1992. Owners Abroad, the second largest
operator, responded with a range of price cuts and offers of free holidays
for children.
The discounting is not an attempt to grab what remains of a
recession-blighted market. The UK travel industry has proved resistant to
the drop in consumer spending. The Association of British Travel Agents says
demand for winter breaks is up 20 per cent over last year and summer
bookings have increased by 8 per cent.
Some tour operators report an even better start to the January and February
booking season, during which they expect to sell about 60 per cent of their
summer holidays. Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad, says summer
holiday bookings for the week ending January 4 were up 63 per cent over last
year. Bookings were hit last year by the onset of the Gulf war, but Mr Klein
says they were still proceeding normally in the first week of January 1991.
Comparisons with 1990 are difficult, because of Owners Abroad's acquisition
in March that year of tour operator Redwing from British Airways. Mr George
Marcall, sales director of Airtours, says his company's bookings in the
first week this month were 35 per cent up on the same month last year and 10
per cent on 1990.
The travel industry says the gloom pervading the rest of the economy seems
to have persuaded people that it is worth investing what cash they have in a
week or two in the sun. The collapse of the housing market means that money
that would have gone into new homes, and the washing machines and
dishwashers to go in them, can be spent on holidays instead.
The real reason for the current bout of discounting, Thomson's Mr Newbold
says, is a battle between Owners Abroad and Airtours. Together with Thomson,
they account for nearly two thirds of the UK package tour market. Mr Nigel
Reed of Paribas Capital Markets estimates that Thomson had 35 per cent of
the market last summer, while Owners Abroad had 15 per cent and Airtours 12
per cent.
'You've got an almighty battle between Owners Abroad and Airtours for second
place,' Mr Newbold says. 'They're getting very aggressive on price and we
have to make sure that we protect our part of the business.'
Mr Klein insists that, while Owners Abroad welcomes any increase in market
share, its primary objective is to maintain profit margins; it is Thomson
that is over-sensitive about market share. 'I remember meeting Charles
Newbold four or five years ago and saying: 'When are you going to stop
cutting this industry's throat?' And he said, and I'll never forget it: 'We
won't lose a point of market share'.'
Mr Klein and Mr Marcall say they do not believe that Thomson's discounts
will lead to an all-out price war. They take comfort from the fact that the
reductions apply to only one in eight of Thomson's holidays.
Mr Klein argues that it has become more difficult for new tour operators to
set up, and push prices down by undercutting the majors. After the collapse
of ILG, the Civil Aviation Authority increased the financial guarantees it
requires from new tour operators. Established travel companies have to
provide a bond equivalent to 10 per cent of their revenue from package
tourists reaching their destinations by air. This has been raised to 15 per
cent for new operators.
The City is uncertain whether to believe Owners Abroad and Airtours'
insistence that the travel industry is not on the verge of a further round
of price slashing. Since Thomson announced its discounts on Tuesday,
Airtours shares have fallen 51p to close at 823p last night. Owners Abroad
shares have lost 11p to 96 1/2 p.
Mr Reed of Paribas says the travel companies always try to reassure the City
that there is no price war in the offing. 'On the other hand, they want to
make out to the consumers that never before have prices been lower, they've
got to buy now, there are never-to-be-repeated discounts on offer. It's very
difficult for these guys.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / A sense of shock: The uncertainty surrounding Algeria's
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Algeria's first multi-party elections enter a crucial stage this week, an
exercise promoted as a means of rebuilding trust between 25m people and
their rulers has turned sour. Its effects may be felt as far afield as
Morocco, Tunisia and across the shores of the Mediterranean.
In a capital city where reality and fiction are often hard to disentangle,
no one doubts that Moslem fundamentalist candidates wearing the colours of
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) could well gain two-thirds of the seats in
the future national assembly. Nothing else is certain.
Not since the Front de Liberation National (FLN) came to power in 1962 after
the war of independence have Algerians had such a great sense of history in
the making. But whereas in 1962 the mood on the streets was one of unity and
hope, today it is deeply divided.
So far, the election results have provoked little response from the
governing FLN, and stunned silence from President Chadli Bendjedid, whose
party has been consumed by damaging in-fighting, corruption and a lack of
any clear political and social reforms. Despite economic liberalisation
measures the country has been paralysed by the FLN's incapacity to reform a
heavily centralised economy in the wake of 1986's collapse of oil prices.
In contrast to the government, the FIS is conducting a confident campaign,
in which it has harnessed the resentment of many Algerians about their
declining living standards and the corruption of the ruling party. In the
first round of voting on December 26, the FIS polled 47 per cent of the
popular vote, twice as much as the FLN.
This stunning figure underlines the extent of the FLN's disarray and its
incapacity, since the riots of October 1988 broke its monopoly of power in
the streets, to reform itself. For ordinary Algerians the only visible
consequences of moves to open up a command economy have been rocketing
prices, growing unemployment and a ruling party whose leaders have indulged
in public mud-slinging. The FLN and other lay opposition parties have proved
no match for the formidable powers of mobilisation displayed by the FIS.
Several factors will be at work over the next five days: the shock felt by
the middle classes, which carries the risk of reaction particularly if the
FIS forms the next government and implements a fundamentalist programme; the
likelihood that the constitutional courts will cancel elections in more than
50 seats; the question of how the army will react as it struggles to defend
both the Algerian constitution and the will of the people.
The sense of shock is not confined to the elite. A programme of education
and redistribution of some oil wealth have brought benefits to many
Algerians, be they the professional middle classes or workers in industry
and the civil service. For many of them, their faith is a private matter and
they view the imposition of strict Islamic rule with alarm. They are also
concerned at the manner in which voting has been conducted.
Allegations of vote-rigging are widespread. More than 900,000 electoral
cards went missing and 1m ballot papers were invalid because - in a country
where 40 per cent are illiterate - the forms were too complicated for many
to complete. The government had also drafted constituency boundaries in such
a way that 3.2m votes gave the FIS 188 seats, while 1.6m votes gave the FLN
a mere 15 in the first round. This appears to have been the result, as much
as anything else, of a profound ignorance on the part of Prime Minister Sid
Ahmed Ghozali and his minister of the interior, Mr Larbi Belkheir, of
political and social realities. While the FLN's 30-year monopoly of power
has not left it immune to allegations of similar practices, this time it
made a fatal miscalculation. This helps to explain the 42 per cent
abstention rate and thus the view of many educated, middle-class Algerians
that the first round of voting did not faithfully represent the views of the
country.
The electoral process could be thrown further into confusion, forcing the
government into some kind of third round, if the constitutional courts
decide to cancel voting in more than 50 seats. The first two rounds would
then have to be held again within the next three months.
All this has contributed to the electoral weakness of those who oppose the
idea of a theocratic state. The main bulwark of resistance to the FIS is the
FLN. However, the Front des Forces Socialistes (FFS), which draws its
support from the Berber heartland of Kabylia and certain areas in and around
Algiers, could prove pivotal. They are the spearhead for a group of civil
servants and professional technocrats who could choose to resist the
implementation of FIS policies by paralysing the state. About 300,000 FFS
supporters and other lay members of the opposition marched through Algiers a
week ago, and they are active on Committees for the Safeguard of Algeria
which have sprung around the country.
The opposition groups, which exist in their scores, draw support from
professional bodies of engineers, doctors and lawyers. They also come from
the industrial working class, trades unions, private industry and women's
groups. The events of the past two weeks have convinced the opposition that
they might be forced to fight to preserve what they perceive as the
achievements of the past 30 years - hospitals, factories, roads, schools and
universities. They do not want the clock turned back.
The model for their fears is Iran, where a revolution overwhelmed the middle
classes and destroyed the army in 1979. But unlike Iran, the FIS victory so
far has come through the ballot box, and those who oppose their views are
themselves either former revolutionaries or the sons and daughters of people
who fought against France in the war of independence. They cannot match the
message offered by 8,000 of the country's 10,000 mosques which the FIS
controls.
That message is one that gives hope to the disenfranchised, who feel left
behind by modernisation. The FIS argues that the restoration of Shari'a law
(segregation in schools, not allowing most women to work, banning alcohol
and harsh punishment for thieves and other criminals) is the answer to
Algeria's problems. Restoring a strict sense of morality to public and
private life is a pre-condition for economic development, the FIS says.
One great unknown about the FIS is whether the views of its 'moderate' or
its 'hard' wing will prevail if it takes the reins of government. The
party's leaders make no secret of their attitudes. 'I respect neither the
laws nor the parties which are not based on the Koran. I trample on them.
Such parties must leave the country, they must be repressed,' said Mr Ali
Benhadj, one of the party's paramount leaders who has been in prison since
last June. 'Our fight is between Islamic purity and democratic impurity,'
said Mr Abdelkader Hachani, the provisional spokesman for the party.
Occasionally, a more pragmatic statement emerges, but the basic tenor of
remarks by FIS leaders is uncompromising. Since FIS members won a majority
on town councils in the municipal elections of June 1990, some cultural
centres have been closed and women teachers and university lecturers abused.
Will such behaviour characterise the FIS if it wins control of parliament,
or will it choose a more cautious line of avoiding confrontation with the
president, whose powers are considerable and who comes up for re-election
next year? The FIS may well calculate it can win the presidency, the supreme
political prize, if it avoids a fight with some sections of Algerian
society.
Whether this strategy is possible depends to some extent on the actions of
the army, under the defence minister General Khaled Nezzar. There have been
persistent military deployments of tanks and soldiers in the past week and
senior officers make no secret of their distaste for fundamentalism.
But where and when will that army choose to draw the red line? After today's
verdict by the constitutional courts, on how many first-round ballots are
annulled, it may call for the entire election to be called off. Or it may
encourage the president to step down after the second round if it feels he
is not defending the Algerian constitution. In the next few days, or weeks,
the army might face an agonising choice. If clashes between Algerians who
hold such antagonistic views of the country's future be degenerate into
civil strife, it will have no choice but to act.

<TEXT>
THE BEGINNING of 1992 has seen electioneering shift into a higher gear.
Implausible Conservative party assertions about Labour's hidden agenda for
taxation have clashed with equally unconvincing Labour recipes for economic
recovery. Politics as usual, is the electorate's weary response. But
politics are not as usual. This huffing and puffing conceals an
extraordinary degree of consensus, at least among the front benches of the
main parties. The main conflicts are within parties. So much, it would
appear, for the constitutional role of general elections.
The front benches share a commitment to British membership of the exchange
rate mechanism of the EMS. They share at least a rhetorical acceptance of
the market economy. Even over wage bargaining, no serious debate is joined.
Both parties are reconciled to high unemployment as the remedy for the pay
disease.
The commitment to the ERM is the fundamental constraint. With sterling below
its effective floor yesterday, the government has been brought still closer
to politically disastrous interest rate increases. Mr Lamont's agony is Mr
Smith's delight. The shared commitment to the ERM allows Mr Smith to welcome
membership and deplore its consequences in one happy sound bite.
So what issues are the chancellor and his shadow left to fight over? From
this week's debate, programmes for recovery, the level of public spending
and the structure of taxation will figure large among them. It is here that
Mr Lamont, meeting with his cohorts in Chevening this weekend, will have to
dream up the election-winning strategy.
They will find it hard. As Mr Lamont has admitted, the Treasury's forecast
of 2.3 per cent growth between 1991 and 1992 was pie in the sky. The FT's
survey of new year forecasts showed growth of 1.7 per cent, but the
consensus is now down to growth of 1.4 per cent. This does not appear an
election-winning performance.
Selective incentives
For its part, the Labour party offers some nicely wrapped baubles: a cash-
and time-limited fund for investment in small and medium-sized manufacturing
companies; enhanced first-year capital allowances for investment in
manufacturing and improvements in skills training. But the selective
incentives are doubtful in principle and will have little short-term impact.
Since a Labour party victory might lead to a sterling crisis, the immediate
prospect could well be higher rates of interest and a more feeble recovery.
In some remarkably dishonest electioneering, the Labour party has made much
of the rise in the share of taxes and social security contributions, from 34
1/2 to 37 3/4 per cent of GDP, between 1978-79 and 1990-91. Since this
occurred in spite of a decline in the share of government spending, from 44
to 40 1/2 per cent of GDP, the explanation lies in the huge fiscal deficit
bequeathed by the last Labour government.
Biggest deficit
So when the Conservative party argues that the Labour party has a long wish
list for increased public spending, it is absolutely right. But when it says
the Labour party will increase the basic rate of taxation by 10p, it is
talking through its hat. The Labour party will not increase spending as it
might like and will, in practice, try to run the biggest deficit it can get
away with.
How big a deficit that might be is anyone's guess. But it could be bigger
than the 3 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 already indicated by the Treasury in
the Autumn Statement (and itself likely to be exceeded). Given the ERM
constraint on monetary policy, a greater fiscal boost than that tacitly
attempted by Mr Lamont could even be justified. But the UK's external
position and past Labour party behaviour would also make such a boost risky.
On the structure of taxation, the Conservatives remain dedicated to lowering
the basic rate of tax, even though that tax is hardly a disincentive at
current rates and accounts for barely more than a quarter of total
government receipts. This is a shibboleth, not a policy.
Meanwhile, Labour rightly proposes to eliminate the anomalies created by the
interaction of national insurance contributions with income tax. But in the
process, it will raise taxation for everyone over the national insurance
ceiling of Pounds 20,280, as well as increase the top rate of tax to an
undesirably high level of 59 per cent.
Overall macroeconomic policy may be dictated by forces over which UK
politicians have negligible control. But levels of spending and taxation, as
well as the structure of taxation itself, remain open to debate. Here is
where chancellors and their shadows still have jobs to do. Unfortunately, as
Mr Smith observed in the FT this week, serious debate is ruined by two
peculiar customs: the presentation of two half-budgets a year, and the
Treasury's mania for secrecy. If the election campaign forces the two sides
to come a bit cleaner, it will have served at least one valuable function.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Commission payments challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMISSION payments to financial services sales agents should be replaced by
fees paid by consumers, the Law Society said yesterday.
In a submission to the Securities and Investments Board, the main investment
regulator, the society said: 'The investment intermediary with the strength
of character to ignore the fact that one investment will pay more commission
than another is bound to be rare.
'A producer can compensate for a poor investment record, and get products
sold against those with a better performance, by paying more commission.'
The submission is a response to SIB proposals to modify the sale of retail
financial services and to the polarisation rule, which requires sales agents
either to sell the products of a single provider or to sell independently
the best products of a group of providers.
Members of the Law Society who sell financial products must pass on any
commission to their clients. It admitted that the SIB was unlikely to go so
far as to ban commission payments.
However, it urged the regulator to adopt proposals to make it more clear to
potential customers whether the sales agent was working for a single company
or could provide independent advice.
It also opposed proposals to bring solicitors into the net of a single
self-regulatory organisation for retail financial services.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Forth Ports seeks share flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTH PORTS Authority, which handles most port operations on the Firth of
Forth in eastern Scotland, is to seek a flotation on the Stock Exchange.
It is the only trust port so far to choose this route for changing its
status under new ports legislation.
Forth Ports Authority yesterday received consent in principle from the
Department of Transport to privatise by way of flotation and Stock Exchange
listing. It hopes to achieve the flotation by the spring.
Forth Ports is the largest port operator in Scotland and is one of the more
profitable of the 14 main ports which have been faced with compulsory
privatisation under the Ports Act of last year. In the year to December 1990
it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.9m on turnover of Pounds 31.2m. It says
it had a good year last year.
The authority operates Leith and Grangemouth on the south side of the Firth
of Forth and Methil, Kirkcaldy and Burntisland in Fife. Cargoes include
chemicals, petroleum products, steel, timber and cement.
Mr Hugh Thompson, the managing director, said Forth Ports set its sights on
a flotation as long ago as last summer, before the doubts about trade sales
of ports emerged with the recent controversy about the sale of Tees &amp;
Hartlepool Port Authority.
Unsuccessful bidders for Tees &amp; Hartlepool are challenging the government's
decision to favour Humberside Holdings as the purchaser of the north-east
England port.
Mr Thompson said the entire equity in Forth Ports would be sold, with shares
possibly being reserved for management and employees. He expected
institutions and some members of the public to buy shares. He said he was
not worried about the possibility of the port being taken over by another
company.
Forth Ports has retained British Linen Bank, the merchant banking subsidiary
of Bank of Scotland, as its adviser on the flotation. Under the Ports Act
half the proceeds of the sale should go to the government.
Forth Ports has property holdings in Leith, which is the port for Edinburgh,
and elsewhere. In 1987 it created a subsidiary called Edinburgh Maritime
which proposed a large property development that would have involved filling
in redundant docks and reclaiming a large acreage from the Firth of Forth.
Mr Thompson said that the project, which attracted local opposition and did
not find favour with the local authorities, had been shelved. The authority
had planning permission for developments on two sites in Leith and was
awaiting an upturn in the property market.
'We are talking to possible clients and end-users,' Mr Thompson said. Other
property schemes were under consideration.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Abusers of premium phone service face cut-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CRACK DOWN on abuses of premium-rate telephone services, which customers
pay 48p a minute to use, was announced yesterday by the watchdog responsible
for the industry.
The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone
Information Services unveiled a code of practice which Mr Louis Blom-Cooper,
its chairman, described as the most comprehensive the watchdog had produced.
Premium-rate services include the heavily advertised 0898 numbers.
The code was necessary because the industry was constantly developing new
services, Mr Blom-Cooper said. Last year the watchdog dealt with 6,500
allegations of abuse.
The code, which comes into effect on February 1, deals with specific types
of abuse - some of which are described in the panel - as well as general
principles. It is tougher than the previous code drawn up in 1989.
Mr Blom-Cooper said the watchdog had tried to find a balance between taking
too lenient a line on abuses and protecting consumers excessively.
The code contains stronger penalties for those who break it. The watchdog
will be able to recommend that an offending company should be barred from
providing a particular category of service or that its premium-rate lines
should be cut off for a defined period.
Penalties will be particularly severe for companies which persistently break
the rules. Companies which are found to have broken the rules will have to
pay costs incurred by the watchdog in investigating the abuse. In a small
number of cases these could run into thousands of pounds.
The watchdog's authority stems from the telecommunications licences of BT,
Mercury Communications and Vodafone. It is able to recommend to these
network operators that service providers breaking the code are cut off. Mr
Blom-Cooper said the watchdog had received 'total co-operation' from the
operators.
He said most premium-rate services, of which there are about 15,000, provide
the public with useful infor-mation and entertainment.
The Association of Telephone Information and Entertainment Providers, which
represents the industry, said it hoped the code would not be constantly
changed.
BOGUS JOBS
An advertisement says Pounds 12,000 can be earned repackaging batteries. A
jobless person pays Pounds 6 on a call only to discover the job does not
exist or is not what it seems. Under the new rules adverts will have to
state the full cost of the call and advertisers will have to be able to
prove the jobs are real.
COMPETITIONS
An advertisement promises a holiday to winners of a telephone quiz. The quiz
lasts half an hour, costs Pounds 15, and contestants do not automatically
win, even if they answer all questions correctly. Adverts will now have to
explain how the games work and how much they cost.
FANTASY GAMES
Callers are drawn into a tantalising game looking for dragons. It is only
when they receive their phone bills that they find they have been charged
Pounds 10 for each time they played. Now, interactive entertainment calls
will be limited to 10 minutes unless callers are told how much they have
spent every five minutes.
TEENAGE LINES
A boy spends Pounds 6 listening to a recording giving advice on how to get a
girlfriend and the best ways of kissing. Services aimed at young people will
now be restricted to a maximum of seven and a half minutes, which would mean
a maximum charge of Pounds 3.60, after which they will be cut off.
SEXY DATES
A woman's name and phone number are given to a 'wife-swapping' line as a
hoax. She is pestered by people wanting dates. Now, callers to date lines
will hear a reference number, not phone numbers. To get the phone number
they will have to speak to an operator who will sift out cranks.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Sex pests suffer mild sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES who suffer sexual harassment are more likely to switch jobs than
are their harassers, according to the first survey of British management
attitudes to the issue.
The most common punishment for harassers was found to be an official or
unofficial warning. The next most common outcome was no action.
Researchers from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology found that a majority of 110 personnel directors at leading
companies favoured preventive measures. Just over 30 per cent wanted
stronger laws.
Nearly 90 per cent of employers had not issued a policy statement on sexual
harassment.
The survey's authors said victims were unlikely to report incidents unless
they were sure complaints would be dealt with seriously and sympathetically.
The researchers relate employers' apathy towards the difficulty of defining
sexual harassment. The European Commission is considering a definition, and
the researchers believe this would be helpful.
A recent survey in the US found that more than three-quarters of personnel
managers who responded said they had a formal written sexual harassment
policy.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Options market reassured on merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Geoffrey Chamberlain, chairman of the London Traded Options Market,
yesterday reassured traders on the LTOM trading floor that the planned
merger with the London International Financial Futures Exchange is to go
ahead. This is in spite of the recent difficulties in finding sufficient
firms to make markets in individual stock options.
The merger, originally set for later this month, was postponed because of a
lack of market makers and technical problems.
Mr Chamberlain said that the revised date for the legal merger is March 20,
and he confirmed that the provisional issue of 'D' shares (which will
entitle holders to trade stock options on the new exchange) will go ahead on
Tuesday.
Yesterday was the deadline for firms to confirm to Liffe which stock options
they plan to make markets in. Liffe declined to comment on the response.
The large integrated houses, such as Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Smith New
Court, have proved unwilling to act as marketmakers, as expected, but will
act as principal traders.
However, there has been some increase in the number of LTOM firms willing to
commit to marketmaking.
In addition to the four firms that have consistently underlined their
commitment - City of London Options, O'Connor Securities (owned by Swiss
Bank Corporation), James Capel, and Hills Independent Traders, two more
firms came forward yesterday.
Kleinwort Benson has agreed to continue to make markets in about 12 stock
options, while an independent trading firm, JG Bolitho, is also believed to
have committed itself to some stock option trading.
In addition, some Liffe members may commit themselves to equity option
marketmaking after the merger.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Hurd rejects pound realignment in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S determination to maintain sterling's position in the
European exchange rate mechanism at a central rate of DM2.95 was underlined
by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday.
He dismissed as 'wrong' suggestions that a realignment of the ERM - 'the
current euphemism for devaluation' - would stimulate the UK economy.
Mr Hurd told the Walsall Chamber of Commerce: 'Almost certainly a
devaluation against the D-Mark would not enable interest rates to be cut.'
Warning that 'flap and fluster' would convince no one, he said even one
devaluation would jeopardise the hard-won confidence which had been built in
the markets.
Already, he said, short-term interest rates in the UK were only about one
point higher than those of Germany and France, well below the differential
of more than 6 percentage points experienced in recent times.
Mr Hurd stressed: 'No matter how modest the devaluation, holders of sterling
would probably demand a higher differential to hedge against the risk of a
further devaluation.'
He dismissed as neither prudent nor sensible the arguments of those calling
for a reversal of the decision to enter the ERM and their claim that even if
it resulted in a plunge for sterling the ability to follow the example of
the US by cutting short-term interest rates would make it worthwhile.
Mr Hurd insisted: 'Our commitment to the ERM provides a firm foundation for
sustainable, non-inflationary growth. It has already shown significant
benefits. It would be deeply foolish to stray off this path into the marsh
of an economic policy which relied on successive devaluations.'
Ruling out this 'defeatist option' he said: 'We will hold fast to our
course. It provides certainty and confidence for business and will benefit
Britain.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Hopes of growth continue to wane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS' expectations of UK growth this year are on the slide.
The latest survey of UK forecasts by Consensus Economics, a company that
monitors economic forecasts in 30 countries, shows that growth in Britain is
expected to be only 1.4 per cent this year.
As recently as New Year's Eve the Financial Times's survey of 23 forecasters
produced a consensus forecast of 1.7 per cent growth for UK gross domestic
product this year.
Consensus Economics' survey of 34 forecasting bodies was carried out on
January 6. Its average forecast of 1.4 per cent compares with the company's
previous consensus forecast in December of 1.7 per cent growth and the
Treasury's Autumn Statement forecast of 2.3 per cent GDP growth this year.
The survey reflects growing pessimism about the UK economy among leading
economists since the start of the year.
Warburg Securities, for example, cut its projection for this year's GDP
growth sharply this week to 0.8 per cent from 2 per cent, adding that it
expected growth of only 0.4 per cent in non-oil GDP.
Consensus Economics said the lower growth expectations reflected weak
consumer confidence and demand, continued problems in the housing sector,
softer export market growth and last month's tightening of monetary policy
by the German Bundesbank, which has frustrated hopes of lower British
interest rates.
The Consensus survey also came after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
admitted that the government's Autumn Statement forecast was 'somewhat
over-optimistic'. Yesterday Mr Lamont began a two-day meeting to discuss the
economy and the March Budget with Treasury ministers and officials.
The survey indicated that economists expected some recovery this year and a
quickening of GDP growth to about 2.4 per cent next year.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Gummer attacks retailers over food imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN GUMMER, the agriculture minister, yesterday accused British
retailers of acting against their own interests by buying imported French
poultry at what he claimed were artificially low prices.
Mr Gummer was speaking to a meeting at which 100 representatives of leading
supermarkets, food manufacturers and farmers agreed to work more closely to
increase supplies of British-produced food.
The initiative, the first of its kind to attract support from all three
sections of the food industry, is intended to reduce Britain's trade deficit
on food and drink. At Pounds 5.1bn last year it was about 80 per cent of the
total current account deficit.
The deficit has attracted growing political concern. Mr John Major, the
prime minister, met industry leaders to discuss the issue last month and it
is being investigated by the Commons agriculture committee.
A central aim of the plans announced yesterday is closer collaboration
between farmers and supermarket chains.
Mr Gummer said their relationship had been 'poisoned' by the widespread
belief that retailers were too ready to buy poultry from French suppliers
who sold below cost.
British supermarkets have sharply increased such purchases since the UK
poultry industry was hit by a salmonella scare two years ago. Mr Gummer said
there was no sense in switching sourcing, because low French prices would
disappear if leading UK poultry breeders were driven out of business.
Yesterday's meeting, organised by the Safeway supermarket chain, agreed to
set up a council of senior food industry representatives charged with
identifying concrete measures to stimulate the supply of UK-produced foods.
Future activities are expected to focus on bacon and ham, dairy products,
soft fruit and vegetables.
The council will be chaired by Sir Alistair Grant, the chairman of Safeway.
Other members include the chairmen or managing directors of J. Sainsbury,
Tesco, Northern Foods and Ranks Hovis McDougall, and Mr David Naish,
president of the National Farmers' Union.

UK STEEL output fell 7.6 per cent last year from 17.84m tonnes to 16.48m,

FT  11 JAN 92 / Terrorists exploit the gaps in mainland defences: The
difficulties of countering the bombers' ever changing tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRA bomb attack in Whitehall yesterday has again highlighted the
difficulties faced by the security forces in countering one of the
best-organised and determined terrorist organisations in the world.
It was the latest incident in a long-running IRA campaign on the mainland
and in Northern Ireland that has deliberately avoided following a set
pattern. IRA tactics during the past 18 months have included firebombing
shops, disrupting railway lines and shooting military personnel, in addition
to the continual threat to any 'legitimate political target' - anyone
considered to be working for the British state.
One security expert with extensive experience of dealing with IRA terrorism
conceded last night: 'London is proving very difficult to defend because the
IRA has so many targets and a variety of methods of attack.'
From the IRA's perspective, yesterday's bomb was another coup. While
requiring some preparatory reconnaissance of the area, the small bomb in a
briefcase is the type of device that will barely have strained the
organisation's military resources. Yet it prompted political reaction and
media coverage quite out of proportion to the limited physical damage
caused.
While political reaction continues to be focused on condemnation of the IRA
and calls for increased security, yesterday's bombing has again raised
questions about the effectiveness of current security measures, and whether
the IRA can be militarily neutralised.
Since the IRA's last intrusion into Whitehall - the mortar attack on Downing
Street 11 months ago - traffic controls have been introduced, video cameras
have been installed in government buildings, and windows and doors have been
reinforced against bomb attacks.
These measures have been taken against a background of repeated police
appeals for increased public vigilance and a continuing undercover security
operation.
Such efforts may have reduced the risk of political assassinations and
large-scale injury to civilians, but they did not stop an IRA terrorist cell
yesterday identifying significant security gaps:
The bomb was found only because of a warning by the IRA which named the
small street where it had been planted.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, left nearby Downing Street after the
warning had been received but before the bomb had been located.
The bomb exploded before the surrounding area had been fully cleared or the
device tackled by bomb disposal experts.
Anti-terrorist squad chiefs believe the IRA mainland campaign involves no
more than six terrorists, probably travelling to and from Northern Ireland
or the Irish Republic. But these assessments have not been translated into
any public breakthrough in terms of arrests. Home Office figures show that
85 individuals were detained on the mainland in connection with terrorism
related to Northern Ireland in the first nine months of last year, but only
one was charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
Security experts say that police on the mainland are too stretched in
numbers and cash terms to attempt blanket protection over a far more densely
populated area than Northern Ireland.
Even if the resources were available, both the government and opposition
believe that Northern Ireland-type security measures, involving the police
and the military, would be politically unacceptable.
A meeting yesterday between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and
leaders of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party appears to
have made further progress towards re-starting 'round-table' talks on the
province's political future, Ralph Atkins writes. Yesterday's meeting was
staged by using a video conferencing link, with Mr Brooke in London and SDLP
leaders in Belfast.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Row over rich and poor trains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday attacked remarks by Mr Roger Freeman, the junior transport
minister, proposing that railway operators could run 'a cheap and cheerful
service at one moment in the day for the typists and perhaps a more
luxurious service for the civil servants and businessmen who might travel in
at a slightly different time'.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said: 'This reveals John
Major's classless society to be a sham. This is Upstairs Downstairs on
trains.'
In an interview with London Weekend Television's The London Programme, Mr
Freeman said there could eventually be a dozen different classes of commuter
travel after the privatisation of British Rail.
Commuter services would still have to be subsidised for many years to come,
although it should ultimately be possible to run them at a profit. 'There's
no reason why what I call a cheap and cheerful service which is a low fare
but high density, high occupancy of train should not be profitable,' he
said.
Mr Freeman ruled out selling off the loss-making Network SouthEast - the
busiest commuter network - as a separate entity.
Under Mr Freeman's scheme the government would retain the power to regulate
fares and prevent private operators closing essential services.

ISRAEL has asked the US to explain why it supported a resolution which

The resolution, which strongly condemned Israel's plans to expel 12
Palestinians from the occupied territories, was passed unanimously by the UN
Security Council this week. The term 'occupied Palestinian territories'
appears twice in the resolution.
Israel is extremely sensitive to international declarations which cast doubt
on its sovereignty over Jerusalem. Official US policy holds that the status
of the city should be determined in negotiations, but that it should not be
divided.
Opinion polls show Israelis willing to make territorial concessions
involving the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but not Jerusalem.

MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, warned yesterday that it
would take time before the measures agreed by him and President Bush would
diminish the imbalance in trade.
He said the president's visit, which ended yesterday, would lead to an
improvement in bilateral relations.
However, he said: 'Japan is a country with a market economy and we can't
manipulate these (trade) numbers.'
Mr Miyazawa's cautious tone, in a speech in Tokyo, was in line with Mr
Bush's own view that the economic agreements were 'a significant but interim
step' in achieving better balance in bilateral trade. The comments indicate
that the US might launch fresh trade initiatives in coming months,
especially if Mr Bush comes under more pressure to get tough with Japan.
The agreements reached during the president's visit which ended yesterday
cover various industries, including cars. Under great pressure, Japanese car
companies agreed to increase from Dollars 9bn in 1990 to Dollars 19bn in the
1994 fiscal year their purchases of US-made parts. This includes imports
into Japan and local procurement in the US. The Japanese companies also
agreed to increase the local content of their US-made cars from 50 per cent
to 70 per cent and to increase imports of finished cars from the US by up to
20,000 vehicles.
However, Japanese officials and industry executives still believe that the
US needs to make more efforts in the Japanese market. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama,
the international affairs vice-minister at the ministry of trade and
industry, said yesterday that the US had to cut consumption, increase its
competitiveness and raise its commitment to exporting.
The Japanese Export-Import Bank, a government institution, is considering
making a low-interest loan to a US company to help it export to Japan. An
Exim bank official said it was the first case of the bank lending for this
purpose.
The bank's normal role is to help exports by Japanese companies to
developing countries. The planned loan to a US company indicates how
seriously the government views the bilateral trade imbalance.
The planned recipient of the loan, believed to be about Y200m, is a
medium-sized electronics company in Florida.
A court yesterday set an important precedent for equality in the Japanese
workplace by ordering a bank to recognise that women can be the head of a
household and have an equal entitlement to family allowances, writes Robert
Thomson in Tokyo.
Sendai High Court ruled that the Iwate Bank had unfairly halted family
allowance payments to an employee - a supplement on salary for spouse and
children - after her unemployed husband found a job.
The bank argued that though Mrs Reiko Sugawara had registered as household
head, it was generally understood among Japanese that a man is the family
head.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday said he would
take whatever steps were needed to ensure a 'sustainable economic expansion'
but warned Congress that fiscal measures to stimulate the economy were
'premature'.
He told a joint hearing of the Senate banking and budget committees that
action to reduce the US's long-term structural budget deficit ought to be
the main fiscal priority. The last thing the US needed was policies leading
to further borrowing and debt creation.
Mr Greenspan's remarks followed President George Bush's pledge yesterday to
unveil an 'ambitious plan for economic growth' in the state of the union
address later this month.
Mr Greenspan said the recovery had clearly faltered and conceded that the
Fed had not yet got the monetary response it wanted from lower interest
rates. However, he expected the one-point cut in the discount rate before
Christmas to provide a 'considerable impetus' for the economy.
He said the timing of any interest rate cuts would be influenced by the need
to ensure a steady fall in long-term bond yields.
Mr Greenspan said recent economic data did not support the degree of public
concern currently expressed. The economy was stalled rather than falling
sharply. Unemployment remained low by the standards of previous downturns.
He said this implied people were mainly concerned by the poor longer-term
outlook. These 'broader and deeper' concerns were best addressed by
structural measures to increase savings and investment rather than a
short-term fiscal stimulus.

THE Philippines has provisionally agreed with the International Monetary
Fund the main points of its 1992 economic programme, except for additional
spending following the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano last year, Mr
Jesus Estanislao, finance secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Estanislao said he hoped the IMF would give approval in February. He made
clear, however, that success depended on the government's ability to
persuade the Senate to approve tax reforms to increase revenue, letting the
government meet IMF targets.
The IMF has suspended payments from a Dollars 900m loan package agreed last
year, and its refusal to endorse the Philippines has delayed other debt
rescheduling agreements.
Mr Estanislao said approval of at least some tax measures was crucial.

<TEXT>
MR Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler, said yesterday that President George
Bush's visit to Tokyo had produced 'too little, way too little' to reduce
the US trade deficit with Japan.
Mr Iacocca, who was part of the US business delegation accompanying the
president, delivered a blistering attack on Japan's 'predatory' trade
practices on his return to Detroit yesterday in a speech to the city's
Economic Club.
He warned the US Congress would now have 'its crack' at the deficit,
referring to a bill before Congress is seeking to force a 20 per cent
reduction each year for the next five years in Japan's Dollars 41bn trade
surplus with the US.
He claimed, however, that Mr Bush's decison to take a business delegation
was a 'historic' move by Washington. 'Now we can start taking care of
business like Japan has been doing for the past 45 years. . . Seeing
American government and business arm in arm for the first time sent the
Japanese a message.'
Mr Iacocca, an outspoken advocate of protectionist measures to halt the
relentless rise in the Japanese share of the US car market, said correcting
the deficit had to be done mainly in automotive trade, which accounted for
three quarters of the total trade deficit with Japan.
He claimed that the Japanese would 'fight it every inch of the way. They
have have this industry targeted, and they're not about to take us out of
their gunsights.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Bush fails to win Japanese over: The president has stirred
anti-US feelings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has left many Japanese disappointed with the conduct
of his visit, which ended yesterday.
While Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and his officials proclaimed
the visit a success, the Japanese press, at least, have judged differently.
Newspaper commentaries said the president had insulted Japan by raising
petty trade issues at a summit. There was also little reluctance to hit back
and criticise the US president and his country.
Both governments will be disturbed to see that, for some Japanese at least,
the visit seems to have aggravated latent anti-American sentiments. Though
most Japanese are embarrassed by the more extreme instances of kenbei
(hatred of the US), many have been struck by the president's failure to win
much popular support during his visit.
There was sympathy for Mr Bush when he fell ill. There was also admiration
for the president's quick recovery and the brave way in which Mrs Barbara
Bush made light of her husband's illness and blamed it on his losing a game
of tennis with the Emperor.
But this paled in comparison with anger at US officials' willingness to
attack Japanese economic policies and paying too little attention to
problems in their own backyard. A cartoon in the Yomiuri newspaper showed
the president dressed as a cowboy sitting in front of his wagon, with a
re-election slogan on his hat. However, the wagon is on fire - with Mr
Miyazawa running to it carrying a bucket of water.
Analysts are dismayed at what they see as the president's crassness in
lecturing Japan over its economic management. Mr Takahiro Ota, a columnist
with the Asahi newspaper, asked: 'Is there not a single decent individual in
the Bush government who truly understands Japan?'
But there is also a sense of pride among Japanese that their country came
out best in the comparisons made between the US and Japanese motor
industries. Perhaps mistakenly, Mr Bush singled out the car industry for
special treatment in the trade talks, insisting that Japanese companies
increase purchases of US-made cars and parts. Commentators, Japanese and
foreign alike, pointed out that US failure to sell cars in Japan was partly
its own fault.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, the vice-minister for international affairs at the
ministry for international trade and industry, said these sentiments may
have been provoked by the widely-reported criticisms of Japanese trade
practices by Mr Lee Iacocca, the Chrysler chairman, and American business
leaders who accompanied the president.
Since the mid-1980s, Japanese leaders have themselves become increasingly
willing to criticise the US.
At his joint press conference with Mr Bush on Wednesday, Mr Miyazawa was not
shy to name Aids, homelessness and declining educational achievements among
America's problems. Such bluntness before an honoured guest would have been
unthinkable a few years ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERTED intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia failed yesterday to
prevent the Australian dollar falling to its lowest level against the US
dollar in nearly three years.
Dealers said most of the selling pressure came from overseas investors
reacting to a reduction in official interest rates of one percentage point
to 7.5 per cent earlier this week. The Australian dollar's weakness came at
the same time as the US dollar was rising sharply on world foreign exchange
markets.
Investors were also concerned about speculation that the federal Labor
government would significantly increase the budget deficit soon in an
attempt to stimulate the flagging economy.
The dollar touched 73.8 US cents in early trading, its lowest since
mid-1988, but recovered to just over 74 cents at the close in Sydney, nearly
8 per cent below its level in September, when it traded at just over 80
cents.
In the US, the Federal Reserve bought Australian dollars at 74.05 US cents
in aggressive intervention yesterday. Dealers assumed it was on behalf of
the Reserve Bank.
The dollar had opened in New York at 73.66/73 US cents, the lowest since May
1989.
In London it closed at 73.6, just above a low during European trading of
73.4. The RBA is thought to have spent more than ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds
610m) to support the currency in the last two days, hoping to prevent a
rapid decline which could damage hopes of an economic recovery.
However, the authorities appeared unconcerned by the size of the adjustment.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), and Mr Bernie
Fraser, the RBA governor, have both suggested a moderate fall in the dollar
would benefit the economy.
Dealers said the decline was likely to continue over the next few weeks.
Most said the currency was likely to stabilise at 70-72 cents, but some said
it could fall as low as 68 cents.
The markets were also unsettled by uncertainty about the size of the fiscal
stimulus expected to be announced in late February or early March by Mr Paul
Keating.
Mr Keating, who replaced Mr Bob Hawke as prime minister in December, has
promised to stimulate the economy to end a two-year recession which has
pushed unemployment to a post-war record of 10.5 per cent.

THE republic of Kazakhstan yesterday threatened to form its own armed forces
and sell arms abroad, as the crisis deepened within the military structures
of the Commonwealth of Independent States, successor to the Soviet Union,
John Lloyd writes from Moscow.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president, promised the republic would
take its own measures in response to an oath which Russian president Boris
Yeltsin has said must be sworn by all members of the formerly Soviet
military.
The oath pledges allegiance to 'the Russian Federation and its people', and
appears to apply to soldiers of every nationality serving in any republic.
'All officers and men must remain loyal to the first oath that they took (of
allegiance to the USSR),' said Mr Nazarbayev.
The republic's security council yesterday decided to form a national guard
of 2,000 men; and Mr Daulet Simbayev, the deputy prime minister, said the
republic could soon start selling arms abroad.
The move came as the commonwealth's foreign ministers met in Moscow, with
control of the Black Sea Fleet high on the agenda of talks which Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said would have to deal with 'acute
problems'.
The war of words between Russia and Ukraine over the fleet continued
yesterday, as Admiral Igor Kasotonov, the fleet commander, said that
dividing the ships would upset the strategic balance of forces in the area
in favour of the US Sixth Fleet. He said the Ukrainian demands for control
of the fleet were 'absurd and untenable', and accused the Ukrainian defence
ministry of incompetence.
Lt Col Sergei Starykh, chairman of the Independent Association of Officers
of the Ukraine, said air force pilots based in the republic might soon start
repatriating their aircraft to Russian airfields because of the
'psychological pressures' put on the officers to sign an oath of loyalty to
Ukraine.
He said half the personnel in the seven air force units in the republic had
refused to take the oath.
In comments to a visiting US delegation, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian
president, has said the republic intends to remove all tactical nuclear
weapons from the territory by July this year and destroy all strategic
weapons by 1994. All 176 launch silos would be destroyed within three years,
instead of 130 within seven years as stipulated in the strategic arms
reduction treaty treaty signed between the US and the Soviet Union, he said.
Mr Kravchuk said he would soon have a 'special device' in his office to
block the launching of any missiles anywhere in the former Soviet Union
without the consent of all of the presidents of the states with strategic
missiles - Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus.
David Gardner adds from Brussels: In Brussels, EC foreign ministers
yesterday decided that new agreements were needed with the former Soviet
republics, to bind them into western Europe's free market and democratic
system.
It was agreed that traditional trade and co-operation agreements were
insufficient for states committed to democratisation and transition to the
market economy.
The Commission argued for intermediate treaties between these and the
so-called Europe agreements signed last month with Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and Poland, which refer to these countries joining the EC in future.
The object would be 'the widest possible opening of markets' and 'special
emphasis on support for institution building and the strengthening of civil
society,' the Commission told ministers.
Senior diplomats said that efforts to seek such agreements would concentrate
initially on Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
REPUBLICS of the former Soviet Union agreed in talks at Nato headquarters in
Brussels yesterday to enforce reductions in heavy army weapons and aircraft
as soon as possible and without renegotiating the 1990 Conventional Arms
Forces in Europe treaty, David White writes.
The agreement to assume Soviet treaty obligations was reached at talks
attended by officials from 10 former Soviet republics, including the three
Baltic states, as well as other members of the defunct Warsaw Pact and Nato
allies.
The Baltic states are considered as being outside the treaty, but it is
thought they may later join it.
Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, warned yesterday that the Black
Sea row might lead to a dispute about control of the nuclear stockpile. The
US was watching the situation 'very carefully', he said before leaving the
UK for Germany.
Under yesterday's agreement, Russia, Ukraine and the other newly independent
states are to share out the Soviet Union's arms cuts 'in a manner acceptable
to all parties' to the CFE treaty.
They agreed they should all ratify the treaty, which the Soviet Union failed
to do before its demise. Some updating of the treaty would be needed after
it came into effect.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Tough Serbs of Croatia stand by old rivalries: Judy Dempsey
talks to the leaders of the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE men from Knin appear as hard as the limestone in this wretchedly poor
part of south-western Croatia.
Accused of trying to scupper the UN peace plan, the leaders of the
self-proclaimed republic of Krajina, a Serb-inhabited area of Croatia, are
quick to defend their position.
'We oppose the deployment of any peace-keeping forces in Croatia,' Mr Lazar
Macura, Krajina's minister of information, said yesterday.
The UN peace plan, agreed by Croatia, Serbia, and the federal army,
envisages the complete withdrawal of the army from Croatia, the disarming of
Croat and Serb paramilitary units, and the deployment of 10,000 troops in
three regions in Krajina.
'What we object to is that the troops will only be sent to Krajina, and not
to other parts of Croatia where Serbs should be protected,' explains Mr
Macura. 'Furthermore, we and our people will not disarm, if the Croats do
not simultaneously disarm.'
Mr Macura - the right-hand man of Mr Milan Babic, a dentist, and leader of
the Krajina republic - says he has no guarantees that the Croats will not
'kill us Serbs. We have to defend ourselves against these Croats.'
The Serbs in this part of Croatia have a long military tradition. They
migrated to the region in the late 14th century, and then defended the
Austro-Hungarian empire against incursions by the Ottoman empire.
'We even killed Serbs fighting on the Turkish side in our defence of
Vienna,' says Mr Macura. 'We were loyal citizens and border guards of the
Hapsburg Empire.'
Nor will the people of Krajina give up their independence, and live in an
independent Croatia.
The population of Krajina, wedged between the Adriatic coast and the
ethnically-mixed republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, is now less than 380,000,
since the Croats, who accounted for 15 per cent of the total inhabitants,
have fled the region over the past year.
What upsets Mr Macura, Mr Babic, and other Krajina Serbs is the growing
feeling of betrayal by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia.
'We received assurances that Serbia would support us, but now Milosevic has
signed the UN agreement,' he explains. 'Yes, Milosevic has betrayed us.'
Mr Milosevic threw his weight behind Mr Babic last year in his determination
to stem Croatia's move towards independence, protect the 600,000 Serbs in
Croatia against discrimination, and create a greater Serbia. Serbia pays
Krajina's pensioners and its unemployed. But now Mr Milosevic, fighting for
his political survival, is trying to force Krajina into accepting the UN
plan.
Mr Macura believes the federal army will not betray the Serbs in Krajina. 'I
hope the army will be disobedient to Milosevic,' he says, adding that
General Ratko Mladic, the recently appointed federal army commander in Knin,
may now defend the Serbs.
Officials in the Croatian government are determined not to allow Krajina to
secede from an independent Croatia. Although the region is barren and
impoverished, Knin, the capital of Krajina, is regarded as part of Croatia's
history. It was once the seat of one of Croatia's kings.
Today, the existence of Serb Orthodox and Croat Catholic churches testifies
to the rivalry between the two ethnic communities, each of which wants to
claim Krajina as its own, now and in the future.
No ceasefire, and no UN plan, is likely to end this rivalry.

<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt), yesterday played down the significance of a meeting to gauge
governments' responses to draft Uruguay Round accords.
He told a news conference that the 108 members of the Trade Negotiations
Committee (TNC) would not be asked at the meeting next Monday to accept or
reject the 436-page draft 'final act' presented on December 20, but only to
say whether it served as the basis for concluding the round 'in the next
weeks'. He detected a 'strong consensus' among governments to 'enter the
final sprint', with the objective of completing the talks by Easter.
Mr Dunkel's formula provides a political escape route for the European
Community, which has said the agriculture text as it stands is
'unacceptable', allowing it to call for changes without scuppering the
entire package. Other countries, including the US and Japan, also want some
renegotiation of the draft, which is based on five years of talks.
EC trade and agriculture ministers, meeting last night in Brussels to decide
the 12's response to the Dunkel paper, were polarising between the German
and British argument that it provided the basis for concluding the Uruguay
Round, and France's insistence that the paper's agriculture chapter needed
to be totally redrafted.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said 'we still are close to a
Gatt agreement', provided the direct payments the Community plans for
farmers as part of its farm reform plan are made eligible for the 'green
box' for subsidies which do not distort trade.
Mr Dunkel's paper categorises this compensation for price cuts as illicit
subsidies, making the planned reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
politically untenable, the 12 said on December 23.
Mr Dunkel said governments were in no position to make a decision on the
package because they had yet to see the results of detailed negotiations on
tariff cuts for goods, including farm products, and market-opening measures
for services. Tariff negotiations are due to be completed by March 31.
There will also be some tidying-up of the draft 'final act' by a legal and
drafting committee. Meanwhile, a 'fourth track' under TNC auspices allows
for consensual changes to the December package.
Describing that package as 'mainly and fundamentally negotiated' by
participants, Mr Dunkel said governments with problems in any area should
first discuss them with trading partners. If countries agreed amendments
among themselves, they would be incorporated. But he would not be drawn on
how much change was likely or necessary.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Swedish budget cuts spending sharply

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S non-socialist coalition government announced net spending cuts of
SKr14bn (Pounds 1.35bn) in its first budget for the next financial year
starting on July 1, presented to parliament yesterday, Robert Taylor writes
from Stockholm. The cuts amount to just over 3.5 per cent of total
government expenditure in 1992-1993.
But the government still faces a budget deficit of SKr70.8bn, mainly because
of falling tax revenues and the cost of rising unemployment.
Mrs Ann Wibble, the finance minister, said a further SKr10bn worth of net
tax cuts would be needed in every financial year until the middle of the
1990s to stimulate a business recovery.
She insisted the government would maintain a 'permanently tight fiscal
policy and a fixed exchange rate'.
The highest priorities would be to secure a low inflation rate, reduce unit
labour costs and stimulate productivity through improved competitiveness.
Mrs Wibble said the budget sought to create conditions for an export-led
recovery from next year. The government also hoped to see a substantial
increase in private saving.
The Stockholm bourse reacted positively to the budget and the general index
rose by 0.9 per cent yesterday.
Sweden's tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product will fall to
52.2 per cent next year from 53.5 per cent in 1991, while state outlays will
actually increase slightly from 63.8 per cent in 1991 to 64.2 per cent next
year.
The proposals to reduce public spending include higher charges on dental
treatment and medicine, the end of benefits for the first two days of
sickness absence, a decrease in housing subsidies and removal of subsidies
from business and commerce.
The government plans to increase spending on the disabled, single parents,
infrastructure projects, education and aid to eastern Europe.
Mrs Wibble said the budget would not hit living standards. This year private
consumption is set to rise 0.5 per cent.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S inflation rate slowed to 18.8 per cent in 1991, almost 5 points
higher than the government's target, but still the lowest annual rate in 13
years.
December's monthly inflation rate was 2.4 per cent, reflecting in part a 5.3
per cent increase in transport costs resulting from November's 55 per cent
rise in leaded petrol prices.
Over the year costs of transport, education, and housing and utilities
increased by 29.8 per cent, 24.1 per cent, and 23.9 per cent respectively.
Mr Jesus Reyes Heroles, of the consultancy Grupo de Economistas y Asociados,
attributes these increases to bottlenecks in the provision of some
non-tradeable goods, and rises in government-controlled prices.
The prices of food, clothes, consumer goods and other tradeable products
rose less than the average, thanks partly to the roughly 10 per cent real
appreciation of the peso against the US dollar during 1991.
The government has made the reduction of inflation to single digits its
principal economic goal this year and plans to run a budget surplus.

THE Yugoslav Defence Ministry said yesterday an officer in the air force
high command would face criminal proceedings, and four other officers
military disciplinary action over the downing of an EC helicopter.
It said the incident, in which four Italian and a French observer were
killed, had occurred because of 'mistakes by higher organs (in the air
force) and a number of adverse circumstances caused by the exceptionally
complex situation in Yugoslav air space'.
Meanwhile the European Community yesterday decided to reactivate its
ceasefire monitoring mission in Yugoslavia on a 'day-to-day basis', and
indicated that the Twelve would recognise Slovenia and Croatia next week.
The 170 monitors in Yugoslavia are to work with the 50 UN liaison personnel
being sent in advance of 10,000 peace-keeping troops.
The UN observers are to arrive in Croatia on Tuesday. Half the observers
will monitor the ceasefire, which yesterday held for an eighth day. The rest
will be dispatched to the Croatian-Serbian border.
If the ceasefire holds, the UN troops will go to Krajina, the Serb-inhabited
region of south-west Croatia which has declared itself a republic.
Mr Milan Babic, the leader of Krajina, has said he wants UN troops deployed
elsewhere in the republic, and that his troops will not disarm unless there
was a simultaneous disarming of Croat forces.
In Brussels, EC foreign ministers lifted sanctions against Montenegro, the
main ally of Serbia, which remains the only Yugoslav republic cut off from
EC aid and credit.
The ministers looked set to recognise Croatia next week, although some
member states argued yesterday that recognition pre-empted EC peace
negotiations aimed at pinning down guarantees and self-government for the
Serbian minority in Croatia - the central dispute of the war.
Bosnia-Hercegovina's claim to recognition looked certain to be rejected, on
the grounds that its three-way population split between Serbs, Croats and
Moslems offered no foundation for consensual independence, and risked
sparking another Croatia. Macedonia's claim was being blocked by Greek
insistence that recognising it could lead to claims on Greece's province of
Macedonia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE end of the Cold War is yielding an unusual peace dividend to crime
fighters on American city streets.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigations has decided that the collapse of the
Warsaw Pact has so reduced the threat of eastern bloc espionage that it can
transfer 300 agents from its counter-intelligence forces to the war against
violent street gangs.
The policy shift will increase the number of FBI agents assigned to tackling
violent crime to 1,925, with special task forces to target gangs in
Baltimore, Dallas, Atlanta and Washington DC.
With a record 24,020 murders recorded in 1991, roughly one for every 10,000
Americans, violent crime has become a bitter everyday reality in the US.
Nowhere is the problem worse than in the urban battlegrounds where
drug-dealing street gangs fight each other to protect their turf.
The Justice Department estimates that there are 300,000 to 350,000 gang
members in the US. Some gangs are local, like Washington DC's R Street Crew
or New York's Vietnamese Born To Kill gang, but several, such as the
Jamaican Posse or the Outlaw Motorcycle gangs, have spread nationwide.
'There are 20,000 Jamaican Posse members; 50,000 Outlaw Motorcycle gang
members and associates; 26,000 Crips, 10,000 Bloods and 64,000 other street
gang members in the Los Angeles area alone,' says Mr Stephen Higgins,
director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which has teamed up
with the FBI and state and local police forces to tackle the gangs.
Justice officials say task forces have successfully beaten a number of
individual gangs: after a 1989 blitz broke the El Rukns' control of
Chicago's south side, police last October arrested more than 60 leaders of
the Vice Lords, who dominate the same city's west side.
Officials claim success against Philadelphia's OK Corral, and this week a
federal task force led a series of raids designed to break up Atlanta's I
Refuse gang.
Attorney General William Barr says state and local law enforcement agencies,
which handle 98 per cent of violent crime prosecutions in the US, do not
always have the right legal weapons to tackle the gangs.
'They do not have appropriate pre-trial detention, they do not have adequate
sentences and they do not have prison capacity to incarcerate the prisoners
once they're convicted. As a result, many jurisdictions have revolving door
justice,' he complains.
The FBI and the ATF, on the other hand, can use tough federal firearms and
drugs statutes, as well as racketeering laws, to obtain long sentences.
Prisoners in federal prisons serve at least 85 per cent of their term, while
state prison inmates can be let out for good behaviour after serving only
half their sentences.
'Our message to gang members and leaders is this: when we throw the federal
book at you, it will be a knockout blow. There will be no bail, no
probation, no parole. You will be put away in federal penitentiary for a
long time,' Mr Barr thundered.
Federal agencies can also use conspiracy and organised crime statutes, and
the attorney general wants to introduce a new racketeering law tailor-made
to catch street gangs.
But critics charge that the 300 agents will be just a drop in the bucket in
a battle that falls essentially to state and local police forces.
'They, not former counter-espionage FBI agents, have to fight most of the
violent street crime in America,' complained Congressman Charles Schumer of
New York.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Kohl sets out new year's agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday set out his agenda for 1992, declaring that
Germany must review all its priorities in the light of recent developments,
which are stretching financial and political resources.
He would not, however, surrender the federal republic's growing role in
international affairs.
With 80m people and a powerful economy, everyone could see that Germany was
a strong country, he said, just as everyone could see what the weather was
like by looking out of the window.
Speeding recovery in the former East Germany was the main task, he told his
first press conference of the year. This, in turn, depended on securing
Germany's position as a leading industrial power, and he stressed the need
for wage restraint in this year's pay round to help secure growth, jobs and
stability.
The chancellor shrugged off concerns about the increased power and
assertiveness of the united Germany. Taking a leading role in helping
eastern Europe and unifying the west was the best way of dispelling the
'historic image of the ugly German', he said.
"One must live with critics. If you only want to be liked then you end up
without influence, and in the end you are more alone than ever.'
Avoiding direct comments on the much-criticised recent increase in German
interest rates, he said long-term rates had not increased and those were the
ones that mattered.
He was happy to see Japan and the US prepared to co-operate to stimulate
economic relations, but, he said, 'this will not solve our problems.'
Traditionally careful to steer clear of involvement in industrial dealings,
Mr Kohl has become increasingly embroiled in this year's pay round as union
claims for increases of 10 per cent and more have emerged as the main danger
to the Bundesbank's price-control policy.
Chancellor Kohl's intervention, and the importance he has attached to
stability, reflect growing worries over the fragile economic recovery in the
east, and its dependence on heavy cash transfers from the weakening economy
in the west of the country.
High interest rates have hit the capital-intensive construction industry
which is the main source of growth in Germany's five new states.
Although the chancellor said yesterday that 1992 would be a 'strong' year
for eastern Germany, he warned of a sharp increase in unemployment in the
next few months, to be followed by an improvement in the second half.
Mr Kohl said the country also needed to review its industrial priorities. He
wanted first to push through a corporate tax reform programme this year.
Other factors which might have to be looked at included indirect labour
costs, over-generous pay deals and the shortest working hours in Europe,
which, he said, had made Germany into 'the holiday republic'.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, warned that German
industry's international competitiveness would be damaged if this year's
wage settlements were as high as last year's level of around 7 per cent,
writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
He also said German interest rate levels would have to stay 'relatively
high' in the foreseeable future.
Reiterating the central bank's determination to keep monetary policy tight
to avert further inflation - last month's annual rate was 4.2 per cent - he
said moderate pay deals would not mean less purchasing power, since
employees would also benefit from lower inflation.
He said long-term interest rates were lower than a year ago, with the costs
of mortgage finance also easing.

FT  11 JAN 92 / France signals reversal of nuclear weapons doctrine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE signalled a historic reversal of its national defence doctrine
yesterday, offering for the first time to discuss its nuclear capability
with its European Community partners as part of the development of a common
defence policy.
The offer departs from France's long-standing insistence that its nuclear
weapons and nuclear doctrine could only be matters of French concern.
The abandonment of this central tenet of French independence, a constant of
defence policy since General de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic 33 years
ago, could break the national consensus on nuclear strategy which has
largely protected France from anti-nuclear movements.
It will provoke controversy among the conservative Gaullist party, and is
likely to stir debate on the prospects of a European defence policy in the
rest of the EC, particularly Britain - western Europe's other nuclear-armed
state.
Launching a debate on the treaties agreed at last month's Maastricht summit,
which include a long-term commitment to the development of a European
defence policy, President Francois Mitterrand said the debate over the
defence of Europe would raise issues which had to be resolved, notably that
of nuclear weapons.
'Only two countries in the Community have nuclear weapons,' he said. 'Is it
possible to conceive a European doctrine? This will very quickly be the
major question of a common defence policy.'
President Mitterrand's question clearly implies that France at least would
be prepared to discuss the possibility of such a European doctrine.
He did not indicate what such a doctrine should consist of, but the
inference is that the other members of the 12 would be invited to take part
in the formulation of the doctrine which would in future govern French (and
no doubt British) nuclear weapons.
His proposal is quite different from the suggestion repeated yesterday by Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, that French nuclear
weapons should one day be transferred to a 'very strong European political
union'. On the contrary, President Mitterrand's proposal would appear to
combine French national control with a European doctrine.
President Mitterrand said the nuclear question needed to be tackled 'very
quickly'. This is no doubt due to the civil war in Yugoslavia, and the
political struggles between the nuclear-armed republics of the former Soviet
Union.
However, the nuclear issue may also be critical for unlocking Europe's
internal defence debate. In the past, French practical insistence on a
purely national nuclear policy has not only been poles apart from its
rhetoric over the need for a European defence policy, but has also been a
point of friction with Germany.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Brittan warns against devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE to defend the pound was joined yesterday by Sir Leon Brittan,
European Community competition commissioner, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary. Both men warned of the dangers of a sterling devaluation, writes
Peter Marsh.
Sir Leon, a former cabinet minister, said devaluation could add two
percentage points to UK interest rates, while Mr Hurd said such an option
would be 'defeatist'.
Their comments helped reduce pressure in foreign exchange markets on
sterling, which for much of this week has traded close to its effective
floor in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), partly because of
worries about the UK economy.
Sterling was also helped by currency investors switching large volumes of
funds out of D-Marks and into dollars, a development prompted by indications
that the German economy might be slowing and activity in the US picking up.
The weaker D-Mark eased strains on all other ERM currencies, with sterling
closing in London at DM2.84, up a pfennig on the day and comfortably above
its effective ERM limit of about DM2.832. The dollar closed at DM1.5825, a
rise of nearly 7 pfennigs in two days.
In New York, sterling slipped back to close at DM2.8298, while the dollar
strengthened slightly to DM1.5845.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, has ruled out a devaluation, which some
believe would aid exports and allow a cut in interest rates. However,
nagging concern among currency investors, especially in the US, about such a
possibility has been one factor stopping the pound gaining strength.
Sir Leon, speaking in Exeter, supported the government's line. He said
people calling for a devaluation were 'voices from a discredited past'. He
said that sticking with the current ERM bands was the best way to ensure a
'sound and lasting recovery'.
During the past week, sterling lost 1 1/2 pfennigs, leading to speculation
that a further slide might require the Bank of England to intervene in
currency markets.
Mr David Brown, a currency analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation in London,
said: 'The Bank has been on amber alert all week, but so far the drama
hasn't turned into a crisis.'
One factor reducing tension about sterling's fragility is that the pound's
effective ERM floor is set by the peseta, the system's strongest currency.
If investors were to sell the pound in high volumes, the limit could
relatively easily be brought down by selling pesetas, a lightly traded unit.
According to this view, alarm bells at the Bank and the Treasury about
sterling would ring only when the pound fell close to the bottom of its 6
per cent ERM band against its central DM2.95 rate - an 'ultimate floor' of
about DM2.78, some 6 pfennigs beneath last night's close.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Major sets framework for election manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday set the framework of a Conservative manifesto for
this year's general election centred on lower taxation, privatisation,
environmental protection and improving public services.
As Labour joined the Tories in promising no let-up in the feverish election
atmosphere at Westminster, the prime minister held a second day of talks
with cabinet ministers on the broad thrust and details of the party's
manifesto.
Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, will start work soon on final drafting -
although Mr Major has yet to see Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry
secretary, or Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, to discuss policy within
their departments. His detailed consultations with ministers are designed to
avoid a repeat of the disaster over the poll tax, included by Mrs Margaret
Thatcher in the 1987 manifesto.
Meanwhile, Treasury ministers yesterday met at the official residence of Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, at Chevening in Kent to discuss the Budget.
Their meeting will end today.
Ministers have been deliberately reticent so far on the manifesto's contents
and will try to control the disclosure of individual policy items in the
coming months as part of a carefully designed general election strategy.
However, it is clear that the main pledges will include the privatisation of
British Rail and British Coal, cuts in the basic rate of income tax and a
tough stance on inflation.
A promise to cut inheritance tax will be targeted at boosting support among
Tory voters in south-east England.
Public services will be improved under the Citizen's Charter while the
social security system is to be enhanced as a 'safety net' for the less well
off. Child benefit will continue to be up-rated in line with inflation.
Further trade union reforms will be made.
The government is already consulting on its plans for an environment agency,
and detailed proposals will be included in the manifesto.
Mr Tom King, defence secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, will
spearhead an attack on Labour's defence and foreign affairs policies next
week.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, is to address a rally on Sunday in York,
setting out his party's agenda for the election. Liberal Democrats hold
their own rally in London today.
Further squalls over tax policy - which have dominated the political agenda
this week - resurfaced yesterday, when Mr Hurd used a speech in
Wolverhampton to accuse Labour of being prepared to destroy incentives and
jobs to make themselves 'feel better'.
In response, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said
Chevening should be used to draw up an immediate package of incentives for
investment and training. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman,
said it would be 'politically dishonest' for the government to cut income
tax in the Budget and called for increased public investment.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Ratner steps down as chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD RATNER, who built Ratners Group into the world's biggest jewellery
company, stepped down as chairman yesterday and revealed a severe fall in
sales over the Christmas period.
The flamboyant businessman, who last year caused a furore by publicly
labelling one of his company's products as 'crap', will remain chief
executive and continue to play a central role in trying to improve the
fortunes of the financially stretched group.
Mr Jim McAdam, 61, former deputy chairman of the Coats Viyella textiles
group, will fill the position of executive chairman of the group, which
includes the Ernest Jones and H. Samuel jewellery stores.
His appointment was welcomed by the company's principal bankers.
Following a 15 per cent fall in UK jewellery sales in the vital six weeks
before Christmas, Ratners announced that it was likely only to break even in
the year to February 1. But interest payments of about Pounds 27m and
exceptional costs of Pounds 45m will drag the company into a total loss of
Pounds 72m.
The company would not confirm whether it had been in breach of its banking
covenants - as had been widely suggested in the City - but revealed that
debt at December 27 stood at Pounds 217m. No material change was expected by
the end of the financial year.
The company said no final dividend would be paid on the ordinary shares and
the payment on preference shares would 'be kept under review'.
The results were worse than the City had feared. One fund manager said: 'I
don't suppose anyone expected trading conditions to be so tough - we
certainly didn't expect Christmas to be cancelled.'
Mr Ratner was unusually taciturn as he talked about developments at his
Mayfair headquarters. But he said that Mr McAdam would be a 'tremendous
asset' to the company. 'He has got a lot of experience - in retailing as
well - and is well known by the banking community,' he said.
Ratners has been looking to appoint another chairman for almost a year and
the two men will share executive responsibilities.
Mr McAdam said tight cash management and cost controls would be enforced and
he held out the possibility that some of the company's 1,000 UK stores might
be shut. 'There is going to be no quick fix. It is going to be a long, hard
slog,' he said.
Some analysts speculated that the 246-store downmarket Ratners chain might
be run down or transformed into one of the group's other chains.
The company has accounted for some of the costs of its anticipated
rationalisation programme in the Pounds 45m exceptional charge. The other
exceptional costs relate to the 10 per cent reduction in the workforce in
the current year and bad debt provisions from Kay Jewelers, the US business
it acquired in 1990.
Ratners shares closed 2p down at 21p.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Travel: Miami: twice as nice, without vice - A haven of
civilisation on Florida's coastline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PONSFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG week-end in Florida? The suggestion whipped up apathy, with visions
of sweaty queues at Disney World, Epcot and Orlando airport. In north Miami?
Images of innocent vulgarity changed into headlines proclaiming a violent,
drug-ridden, racially-troubled hispanic sanctuary.
Then I read the small print: to the name of Turnberry Isle Yacht and Country
Club was appended: 'A Rafael Resort.' I have only met Georg Rafael once, and
that briefly. But my respect has mounted with the reputation, and some
personal experience, of the 11 superb hotels he has created in just five
years.
The handful dotted through continental Europe, such as Geneva's Hotel du
Rhone and Dusseldorf's Breidenbacher Hof, together with the Mark, on New
York's Madison Avenue, have set the tone - mostly smallish,
once-grand-and-famous establishments, restored to under-stated elegance,
discreet, little advertised yet increasingly chosen by choosy globe-trotters
who spread the word by mouth.
Turnberry Isle offered the chance to sample one of the six Rafael holiday
retreats, the others being scattered in Asia and the Pacific. Half-an-hour's
freeway drive from Miami airport, the handsome complex was wrapped around
courtyards, swimming pools and al fresco eating. The surrounding miles-long
green vistas, stretching to clutches of yacht marinas and condominiums, were
quite unrelated to the overblown, bizarre palaces lining Miami Beach, ten
miles to the south, and to the area of highest-risk streets east of the
airport.
In fact, Turnberry's semi-rural setting dispelled notions of enforced
confinement prompted by its blurb's description of 'exclusive Aventura' as
'an enclave'. In fact it occupies getting on for half of Aventura district's
785 acres, which were swampland 20 years ago before being transformed into a
haven for the affluent.
Though guards man main gates, only quiet, unfenced roads border the two vast
golf courses that encircle the hotel-cum-country-club building. These two
championship 7,000-yard courses, predominently flat with only gentle,
man-made undulations but lots of water, plus 24 tennis courts (18 lit for
night play), a spa, and a marina, beach facilities and yacht club only a
shuttle bus ride away, do indeed provide many of the customers with a
one-stop holiday.
We, however, had plans for forays downtown in pursuit of a special treat
whose flavour, but not location, I vividly recalled from many years ago -
stone crabs. That, the locals said, must have been at Joe's, and be there by
six or you will have to queue. En route to this southernmost extremity of
the Beach, there were distractions to smooth away preconceptions of Miami's
harshness.
Bal Harbour embraces, surely, one of the most stylish shopping malls in a
country that specialises in them, bringing together the cream of US and
European up-market stores and designers. Beyond, the flamboyance of the
opulent apartment blocks and hotels lining the famous shoreline gives way to
the stucco friezes, ornamental plasterwork, pinnacles and finials that
compose the Art Deco district.
Our Saturday evening at Joe's Stone Crab Restaurant turned out to be
fortuitous, for next day the restaurant was to close for Miami's off-season,
the waiters dispersing till October. The menu had an arm-long selection of
seafood, but nearly everyone seemed to order the delicious crabs which come
from the waters of the Florida Keys.
The architecture of Miami is one of its greatest delights, and not just for
the oddity of Art Deco. The main other styles, 'Cracker' and 'Mediterranean
Revival,' would be worth a day to themselves in the Coconut Grove and Coral
Gables areas. But we could not give them that. Anyway, we got diverted in
Coconut Grove by the agreeable scene at Monty's Raw Bar.
Here the convivial Sunday afternoon crowd sat in the sun, sipping and
munching, tapping their feet to West Indian rhythms, watching the deep-sea
fishing boats coming and going and little girls holding their skirts while
they bobbed in front of the guitarist. No one looked like mugging anyone or
starting a riot.
We would have liked to have soared over the Rickenbacker bridge to Key
Biscayne, sample the pavement cafes of Coconut Grove, see more of the
vernacular houses around the university in Coral Gables, stay for one of the
many festivals, visit the Playhouse Theatre, eat Cuban food, study the art
of the local artists.
A long week-end in Florida? It wasn't nearly long enough.
At Turnberry Isle, daily room rates are upwards of Dollars 245 (Pounds 134)
and suites Dollars 360-Dollars 1,350 to late May. They drop to Dollars 125
and Dollars 200-Dollars 950 in the low summer season. Everything else is
extra, including the sports facilities. Green fee and caddycar for hotel
guests: about Dollars 65 in winter, Dollars 44 in summer.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Travel: All creatures wild and murderous - Nature in the raw
in the lovely Yorkshire dales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PIP LITTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SOUND OF distress came from the other side of a dry stone wall. I peered
over to catch a slice of nature red in tooth and claw as a stoat (or was it
a pine marten?) took a screeching baby rabbit by the throat and dragged it
off for lunch.
This was my introduction to 'Herriot country,' and I am sure that if the
good veterinarian had been there he would have been able to sort out my
small-creature query. As he was not, I continued along the paths of the
Yorkshire dales, admiring what must be some of England's most beautiful and
varied scenery.
If you do not get a kick out of walking and nature it is best to steer clear
of James Herriot's back yard; on the other hand, you do not have to be a fan
of All Creatures Great and Small, nor the plodding Emmerdale Farm, to enjoy
the gaping limestone gorges, the pastoral riverside settings, the bleak,
heathery moorlands and the patchwork of dry-stone walls that criss-cross
from Wharfedale in the south to Swaledale in the north.
I took up residence for a week in the small, workmanlike town of Masham on
the eastern edge of the dales. It is not as pretty as the village of
Arncliffe on the River Skirface, nor twee like the tourist centre of
Grassington on the Wharfe, but it offers a Good Food Guide restaurant, the
Theakston's brewery and all the supplies for a self-catering cottage.
The let was an end-of-terrace house with one reasonable double and one tiny
twin bed-room, a small lounge with open fire and a decent-sized kitchen.
However, Pounds 250 for a week in May seemed high for the modest
surroundings.
One of the roads out of town to the west takes you across Marsham moor, a
striking entry to the Dales proper and an important reminder of how quickly
mists can descend and disorientate walkers. Be prepared, as well, for the
30-mile round trips from Marsham to your chosen dale and for narrow roads if
you drive by more scenic routes.
By far the best walk was in Swaledale and Gunnerside and was taken from
Pennine Way South by Tony Hopkins. I did it late in the week so it did not
mar the beautiful but less dramatic walks round the gentler areas of Upper
Nidderdale, Kilnsey Moor and Moor End Fell on the River Wharfe.
Swaledale was an important lead mining area until the end of the last
century, and Gunnerside Beck, which runs into the Swale, is littered with
the crumbling remains of a forgotten industry. You will find rusting,
small-gauge rail trucks for carring ore, a delightfully arched building for
milling and sorting, and numerous tunnels that brought the lead from deep in
the sides of the valleys. Surprisingly, few of the tunnels are sealed, but
only the foolhardy would dare to enter.
Spoil heaps dominate the valleys in the mining areas, but instead of ruining
the landscape they somehow enhance the severity of the moors and hillsides,
giving a sharper contrast to the lushness of the riverside and woodland
walks. From Gunnerside Gill there is a steep climb to a moorland scattered
with grouse butts. A rocky descent, past the waterfalls of Swinner Gill and
spectacular views of the gorge, takes you back to the Swale.
The atmospheric ruins of the 12th century Fountains Abbey near Ripon,
standing in the extensive grounds of Studley Royal Estate, are well worth a
visit. In 1132, some of the monks of St Mary's Abbey in York felt that their
Benedictine rules of piety were not severe enough. They were given land on
the banks of the River Skell and set about building their remarkable abbey
on a site 'fit rather to be the lair of beasts than human beings,' as
Archbishop Thurstan of Ripon, who donated the land, described it.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Travel: Sensual delights in a palace of illusions - Susan
Moore enjoys a night-time stroll amid the fountains and flowers of Cordoba's
magical Moorish mosque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORDOBA'S Moorish mosque is a wonder of the world - especially wondrous in
its deceit. It is the original Tardis, though its delapidated exterior
passes for a warehouse rather than police box.
Outside, in the sunshine, parties of school-children shriek like starlings.
But take one step into the chill and gloomy silence and you encounter the
edge of a forest of towering stone trees, from which spring branches of
double arches banded pink and white. Everywhere you turn there are endless
undulations of pink and white.
Its grove of purloined columns are Roman, Visigoth, Byzantine and Moorish,
of marble, jasper, breccia, porphyry and granite. This Islamic structure
tells almost the entire story of western architecture - not least since,
after the reconquest, its heart was ripped out and replaced by a Catholic
cathedral. The glittering mosaics of the mihrab, which remains the mosque's
true holy of holies, seem like stained glass windows patterned with Persian
carpets.
Once the mosque opened on to the orangery. In this cobbled patio the live
trees - probably originally date palms, echoing the columns within - sit in
a series of circular beds linked like beads on a string by narrow irrigation
channels. Any excess precious water could run like quicksilver from one bead
to another. It does not take long in Cordoba or Granada to realise that
water is the supreme delicacy of Moorish Spain. It is a building material as
effective as brick or stone, and with it the Moors realised their genius for
combining architecture and horticulture.
Murmuring, cooling fountains are the sensualist's delight. Water-filled
stone lotus flowers lie close to the ground to be appreciated from the thick
pile of carpets placed in the shade of orange trees or in the cooler loggia.
Moorish gardens are infinitely subtle. That is why the celebrated restored
gardens of the Generalife, higher up the Alhambra hill, come as such a
shock. The noise] It is a relative Niagra, with inauthentic and energetic
jets of water playing into the large pool of the Patio de la Acequia, high
kicking in unison like Hollywood dancing girls.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays during the season, the Alhambra palace and gardens
are open from 10pm to midnight. A night visit is surreal and haunting.
Passing through the oblique entrance to the Moorish Lion Court is like
approaching a party. You cannot see a soul, but as you enter the hum of
chatter becomes a roar. Drinkless guests weave their way through the
colonnades or cluster in groups; policemen lurk in the shadows. The art is
to wait like a hawk and pounce on the perfect moment, the lull between
gaggles of French and Spanish. The Alhambra demands solitude and silence.
At that moment the great Court of the Myrtles is completely still. The low
central pool is a smooth, dark sheet of water ingeniously fed to the brim
and therefore a perfect mirror to the arcades of ornate filligree
plasterwork, the gleaming tiles and the indigo sky. The burbling fountain is
just audible; myrtle scent hangs in the air.
Meandering on, the palace becomes ever more magical - but exaggerated and
distorted. Nuances are lost in the dramatic chiaroscuro. Arcades are doubled
in height by their reflections. A Banksea rose transforms a 30 ft Cypress
tree into a giant in yellow flamenco frills. The town below is a sea of
twinkling lights, with the disembodied noises of playing children, barking
dogs and hooting cars rising eerily upwards.
As we dawdled our way out through the imposing circular arcaded courtyard of
Charles V's palace, the exasperated guards finally lost their patience and
switched off all the lights. For a minute we stood in the centre of this
immense bullring-cum-coliseum, alone, dwarfed and silent in the moonlight.
It might have been Italy - or a stage set by de Chirico - but for the bull's
heads in the frieze of the colonnade.
The palace of Charles V is arguably the finest Renaissance palace in Spain,
but how odd its rusticated bulk looks. It seems an aberration, an historical
hiccup. Andalucia is magnificently raw, emotive, defiant. Classicism is far
less at home there than the astounding local versions of the Baroque.
There is nothing in the world to prepare you for the 'Churrigueresque'
sacristy of the Cartuja, or Carthusian monastery, at Granada - not least the
rest of the monastery complex. In extreme contrast is the vast and austere
16th century refectory, lined with paintings illustrating harrowing scenes
of the persecutions suffered by the Order in Reformation England.
The sacristy, which sets St Bruno in an altarpiece of marbled marzipan,
seems a tour-de-force of the confectioner's art. Exuberant over-wrought
stucco work ripples and oozes and looks less like plaster than piped icing.
It may be excessive, but in spirit it seems to belong: an 18th century
descendant of the richly detailed ornamental stucco of the Alhambra.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Big Mac cure for eastern Europe: John Willman dreams of
creating a charity which spreads capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF CAPITALISM is such a great system, why can't it do more to help those who
want to sign up for it? I ask the question because we fat cats in the West
seem unable to offer any constructive advice to the peoples of the former
Soviet Union on how they can board the gravy train.
Most western economists sound like Mr Punch's Irishman who, when asked the
way to Dublin, said that he would not start from here.
Capitalism may have defeated communism in the battle of ideas. But for the
ordinary Muscovite in the bread queue, capitalism = price reforms =
hyperinflation plus civil disorder.
Liberal democracy is unlikely to be victorious in the circumstances. If
darker forces prevail, they will have access to the Soviet nuclear arsenal -
so we all share a vested interest in encouraging wealth and happiness east
of the Vistula.
Now I am well aware that international capitalism is not a multi-national
corporation which can expand into new markets like IBM or Unilever. But some
sort of consortium needs to be assembled with extraordinary powers to direct
resources towards easing the suffering of the Soviet peoples.
Its mission statement would be to sponsor projects which improve the lives
of ordinary men and women, encourage virtuous economic behaviour and spread
understanding about the mysteries of capitalism.
For example, McDonalds might be commissioned to open a hamburger restaurant
in every city in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The demonstration
effect would be considerable for millions of Russians whose only experience
of eating out is the works canteen or Restaurant No 41.
I would expect useful spin-off from McDonalds licking the local suppliers
into shape. And the normal staff turnover in hamburger restaurants would
swiftly create a cadre of young people skilled in keeping customers happy.
Action is also needed in the energy sector to keep the oil flowing and the
lights burning. There are plenty of western oil contractors with experience
of managing oilfields and refineries in worse circumstances than yet obtain
in the former Soviet Union. I would send them in, offering incentive
payments for keeping supplies flowing and modernising installations.
Some imaginative thought is also needed to modernise internal transport
systems - especially the railways, which are the main way of moving freight.
Indian railway managers should be appointed to run the Soviet rail system.
As my colleague Quentin Peel has pointed out, they are better qualified to
run an ageing railway under adverse conditions than, say, SNCF or DBB.
Then there is the challenge of beating swords into ploughshares - switching
productive resources from the bloated arms industry to producing consumer
goods. The 70,000 General Motors staff about to be made redundant in the US
should be offered lucrative short-term contracts to convert Soviet tank
factories into making lorries, vans and other useful vehicles.
And to encourage the Soviet armed forces to stay out of politics,
International Capitalism PLC should pay their wages for the next six months.
For a modest outlay (at current exchange rates), this would give the new
governments of the independent states breathing space to establish their own
structures of law, administration and taxation.
Naturally, the offer should be conditional on all nuclear warheads being
handed over to the UN by next Wednesday.
Finally, the recession has left western computer manufacturers with
stockpiles of unsold PCs which are rapidly losing their appeal in home
markets as technology moves forward. I would snap them up at cost and give
them away free - with accounting software and spreadsheets - to schools,
research institutions and every enterprise which claims one. The sooner
every would-be entrepreneur in the CIS is playing Lounge-suit Larry on an
Amstrad, the better.
Expensive? Not in comparison with what has been spent on military
containment since 1945 - or on the likely cost if increasing misery leads to
anarchy and civil war. I would have thought that about a tenth of the NATO
budget would be enough to fund these pump-priming exercises.
The fact that some of these ideas will also produce work for western
companies is an added attraction. How better to dig ourselves out of a
recession than by spreading the capitalist message?

<DATELINE>
   I AM FAIRLY well in with the Hollywood crowd
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie, Jack, Warren, Melanie, Jane, Diane. All seek my advice.
Arnie called yesterday, worried, as ever, about box office returns and the
price of property out towards Malibu.
'Arnie,' I carolled, 'Arnie, baby, of course times are hard. Budgets are
being slashed, star salaries axed. The new word on the street is: less
equals more, small is beautiful. But that doesn't mean you, Arnie.
'With you, more equals big. That's still where it's at. Which doesn't mean
to say that a guy like you, Arnie, political ambitions, shouldn't tread
warily. You gotta watch your scripts, Arnie. And you gotta watch your
weight. But Malibu, Arnie? Who needs problems? Try Series 6 certificates or
Ecu-linked deposits. Or cocoa, Arnie. My instincts tell me cocoa. Or just
conceivably emeralds. I'll give you a number, a guy in Tel Aviv.'
About the only man in Hollywood I haven't met is Jack Valenti, president of
the Motion Picture Association of America, who sounds to me a splendid
character, at his best when under fire. Which is just as well, given the
mess in which Hollywood finds itself.
Is Valenti downcast by Hollywood's downfall? No, he is not. 'People are not
satisfied with the dreary plausibilities of everyday living,' he maintains.
'They want to be entertained. Which is why American movies are wanted and
watched everywhere on this weary, wracked planet.'
According to Jack, Hollywood's main problem is that it has neglected its
'kinship' with its audiences, offering them less than it was capable of and
less than they deserve. But Jack has a message. And the message is this:
'When competition for funding grows tense and the struggle for an audience's
favour tightens, the creative curve inevitably ascends.'
How true that is, how gleamingly insightful. Which is why, last night, I
faxed off to Jack, out there in Hollywood, the synopses of four scripts on
which I and my under-writers, my talented deputies, are currently labouring.
It is scripts like these that will save the movie industry. They are tense
with creativity and aimed at family audiences. Moreover, I know a way to
film all four for less than Dollars 800,000 - about 1 per cent of what
Spielberg spent on Hook.
These were the synopses:
The Greys and The Reds: The Inside Story of a British General Election. The
Greys are headed by a nice man in glasses, the Reds by a loquacious
Welshman. Michael Caine plays both parts. In the run-up, both sides wage an
unforgiving war of lies, insults and statistics, with five-star general
Paddy Ashram, leader of the cruelly outnumbered Third Wave party, mortally
wounded in the crossfire. But as the pundits analyse the competing promises
of the Greys and Reds, realisation dawns: the parties are indistinguishable,
their room for manoeuvre identically circumscribed.
So the Greys and Reds join forces. All minority parties are voted into
extinction and the Grey-Red party wins every seat. At once, they devalue the
pound, lower all taxes (except for the royal family, which is to be taxed
severely) and declare the rest of the year a public holiday. There is
delirium in the streets.
Saddam: The Final Reckoning. Ennobled and deeply loved, Countess Thatcher
still writhes with grief at the thought of the monster of Baghdad lurking in
his subterranean palace. 'He was my greatest challenge,' she laments, 'but
he was snatched from me.' So she pressures her chums in the oil business to
finance an expeditionary force. After weeks of bloody hand-to-hand combat,
Saddam is overthrown and Iraq liberated. 'I have confronted the Minotaur in
his labyrinth, and I have slain him,' declares the countess as the camera
pans the burning skyline.
The Man From Hyper Space. An alien visits Earth and sets himself up as a
media mogul. He buys hundreds of businesses. Also soccer clubs. He is larger
than life. Everyone is afraid of him. But then he dies, washed from his
yacht one black night. But he is not really dead. During his time on Earth
he has amassed Dollars 400bn by circulating funds between his companies at
almost the speed of light. So he climbs into his spacecraft and returns to
his own world, where Dollars 400bn is not to be sniffed at, despite
relativity.
The Impossible Dream. The story of a British boxer who wins the world
heavyweight title. Still at the early planning stage: there are major
credibility problems.
Late last night, Jack Valenti rang from Hollywood. 'Michael, baby, I love
the synopses. They have comedy, tragedy, pathos, bathos. Audiences will be
electrified. They're just what we need on this weary, wracked planet.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / All at sea in the America's Cup: The wonderland world of
international yachting politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN diplomats are not the only people agonising over what parts of the
former Soviet Union to recognise and legitimise. In San Diego, officials of
the forthcoming America's Cup are having to choose between rival entries
from Leningrad - now St Petersburg - and Moscow.
With only two weeks remaining until the first races of the three-month
challenger elimination series, the St Petersburg group have a registered,
paid-up Cup entry, but no boat, while Moscow has airfreighted its hi-tech 75
ft sloop to California but has no locus standi with the regatta's
authorities.
Tom Ehman, chief executive of the America's Cup organising committee, has
written to the two sides urging the obvious compromise. However, a nation
unable to agree on who controls its Black Sea fleet is in no hurry to
harmonise over the America's Cup.
Which brings one to the Croatian challenge. (The perfect correspondent to
cover this year's America's Cup would be Lewis Carroll). Named Zara after an
ancient Dalmatian city, the wooden boat - all other competitors have used
carbon fibre construction - has reached a boatyard in Venice, courtesy of an
Italian sailing enthusiast and fairy godfather named Marcon Cantoni.
There Zara is likely to remain. The Yugoslav war and Cantoni's finances make
that a near certainty. The America's Cup has always been an event for
dreamers and romantics, but they need deep pockets.
The actual racing begins next Tuesday when the two defender syndicates meet
for the first of dozens of races between Stars &amp; Stripes and America3. Stars
&amp; Stripes is skippered by Dennis Conner, the Cup's answer to Jack Nicklaus.
No man has won the trophy more times, or expended more time and energy on
its pursuit.
Against him is Bill Koch, a patrician East Coast oil billionaire who took up
yacht racing only in the mid-1980s. So far Koch has built three of the new
America's Cup class yachts (one in complete secrecy at a US aerospace
facility), acquired a 200-strong payroll and spent more than Dollars 50m
(Pounds 27.4m) of his own money.
Koch's obsession has become worthy of a gothic novel, in particular since he
declines to let a professional helmsman take the wheel and intends to steer
himself. It is owner participation without precedent at this level of sport.
Does the Aga Khan ride in the Prix d'Arc de Triomphe, Gianni Agnelli drive a
Ferrari at Monza?
'It's like letting Lee Iacocca race against Mario Andretti,' sighed one of
Koch's crew during a recent practice regatta. Not that the 52-year-old
skipper lacks practice, application or talent. His spare frame, clad in
habitual white shorts, polo shirt and deck shoes, has spent hundreds of
hours steering the yacht in practice races trying to lift himself from the
level of the scratch golfer to someone who can stalk the greens with Faldo
or Ballesteros.
Koch is no softie. Five years ago he fought his brothers through two Dollars
17bn-a-year Koch Industries. Unforgiveable allegations were made in court.
Bill Koch left with in excess of Dollars 600m compensation.
'The whole story would make the TV series Dallas or Dynasty look like a
playpen. It was horrible to sit in court opposite your brothers and watch
your family life disintegrate,' says Koch. He seems to use the saga as
armour against those who predict that the brutalities of the Cup could
destroy a rich amateur with his ego on the line. 'If I got through the court
case, then the America's Cup should be fairly easy.'
Of the challengers, who start racing on January 25, the Italian group Il
Moro di Venezia and the New Zealanders are regarded as joint favourites. The
series of three round robins followed by semi-finals and finals is once more
sponsored to the tune of around Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.4m) by the French
luggage company Louis Vuitton, now part owned by Guinness.
Il Moro, skippered and led by French-American sailor Paul Cayard, have built
a sequence of five yachts over the past two years. No design stone has been
left unturned and the group has remained stable and purposeful: Anglo-Saxon
characteristics that have never before featured highly in an Italian
challenge for the Cup.
Confident that he has a fast boat under his feet, Cayard is focussing on
another opponent - Catalina Eddy. This is a meteorological system that
begins over the eponymous island off Los Angeles and makes San Diego one of
the hardest places in the world in which to predict the weather. Cayard
reckons that a good many races this spring will be won or lost by a sudden
wind shift.
'What are the syndicates doing to minimise the luck factor?,' asks Cayard.
'With as much as Dollars 50m on the line, is there going to be an accurate
way to predict the wind?' Despite all the on-board computers and satellite
met data faxed to the shore base, the answer seems to be No.
According to Cayard, boats only 200 metres apart can often experience a
7-degree difference in wind direction and a one-knot difference in speed. He
calls it scary but, for the minnows in the Cup fleet, this may be their
chance to step over the highly-prepared Italians and Kiwis.
Spirit of Australia, led by Iain Murray and Peter Gilmour, who created the
Kookaburra campaign in the '86-'87 Cup, is 'poor' in Cup terms and running
on a financial shoestring. Yet Murray's design finesse and Gilmour's fine
intuitive helming must make them a good outside bet for the challenger
finals.
Of the other European teams, France is the best-funded and prepared but
appears to have a slow boat and little time to fix it. Sweden is short of
everything and Spain appears to be participating largely to celebrate the
quintocentenary.
Unfortunately, British participation consists largely of supplying gear to
virtually every syndicate, plus the input of Welsh international helmsman
Edward Warden Owen as coach to the New Zealand team.
If the Kiwis win the Cup, perhaps Anglesey will mount a challenge for 1995?

FT  11 JAN 92 / Private View: The conscientious baker's boy who used his
loaf - Philip Johnson-Laird, psychology professor at Princeton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER

<TEXT>
IF HE had stuck to his first profession of quantity surveyor he could have
gone on playing rugby for Rosslyn Park on Saturdays and jazz piano and
vibraphone for extra money in the evenings.
But he could not stand the apprenticeship. He tried to escape by
volunteering for the Fleet Air Arm, only to be told his eyesight was too
poor.
When release came, with National Service call-up, it was too late. He was
now under the influence of the early CND and of the philosopher Bertrand
Russell - every one of whose books he had read - and declared himself a
conscientious objector.
The tribunal sentenced him to two years and 60 days' alternative service. He
complied by becoming first a hospital porter and then a bakery worker.
By this time, the youth who had left school at 15 with only a 'praeceptor's
senior certificate' because his father could not afford to keep him on, was
feeling the weight of his lack of education. During his bakery lunch-breaks
he studied for 'O' levels and 'A' levels. Encouraged by an academic friend,
Sheila Jones, a founder of CND, he got into University College, London, to
read psychology and logic (Russell's influence again). He was 25.
Last year, Philip Johnson-Laird was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
London, one of the oldest and most prestigious scientific bodies in the
world.
The citation reads: 'Distinguished for his contributions to the psychology
of reasoning and language. His suggestion that the lexical meanings of words
could be treated as computational procedures supports the views that
comprehension involves the construction of mental models, and that reasoning
lies in their manipulation.'
In short, Johnson-Laird's work is to think about thinking.
But he no longer does it in England. Like about 10 per cent of the Society's
British-born Fellows, Johnson-Laird works in the US. After posts in London,
Sussex and Cambridge, he succumbed three years ago to repeated invitations
to migrate with his wife Maureen ('Mo') Sullivan and their two children to
Princeton, New Jersey, where he is Professor of Psychology.
When I first met him, the former baker's boy was tapping something into a
small computer in the front room of his neat, colonial-style house just off
the university campus. He was teaching the computer to improvise modern
jazz. He explained that he was writing a program to make explicit a theory
about how people create: the computer input consisted of symbols denoting
musical chords and the output an improvised bass line such as a jazz pianist
might lay down.
I asked him to describe his scientific quest.
'I am interested in how the mind works. I want to put forward theories about
it - what it is doing and how it is doing it - rather than what various
neurons in parts of the brain are doing.
'My topics are how people reason, how they understand and use language, the
nature of consciousness and emotions, how people create new ideas.'
It involves laboratory experiment and computer modelling. The point of the
model is to make the theory more explicit, therefore more testable and more
useful, and also more open to other scientists' scrutiny.
'The model sharpens up your theoretical ideas. It prevents you bullshitting.
If you can build a computer program of it, then you're not taking too much
for granted. We must try and escape from the web of words and pin down what,
for instance, Freud really meant by 'repression'. It's very problematic.'
Johnson-Laird doubts whether science will achieve an explanation of human
consciousness in his lifetime. He is a more hopeful of cracking the code of
creativity. There are different sorts, he said. 'It is reasonably easy to
understand how people work in some well-defined genre: composing a
Wordsworthian sonnet, for instance, or making a chemical assay - or jazz
improvisation.
'Then there is the process involved in making a new piece of science, like
the jump from Newtonian to Einsteinian mechanics, or, in painting, the shift
from Impressionism, through Cezanne, to Cubism. Nobody, in my opinion, knows
anything about how that's done. Maybe it's never going to be answered. It
could be that it's essentially magic.'
But Johnson-Laird thinks he has an answer to the controversy about whether
there are universal rules for reasoning or whether the criteria for
rationality are local to cultures in their own place and time.
'Take an African tribe that believes in witchcraft. One view is that these
people are making mistakes in thinking. Another is that you have to
investigate what their criteria are and then you discover they are not. I
think the answer is that there is indeed a universal core of what it means
to be rational. But there is not a set of working principles, so we do
actually make errors in reasoning.'
Why did you come to America?
Johnson-Laird applied a psychological test to his answer. 'What I say may be
just rationalisation. Social psychology shows that people are not aware
sometimes of the true causes of their decisions. At the time I suppose it
was a gut reaction.'
I wondered how much of his disillusionment was party political.
Did Bertrand Russell shape your youthful views? I asked.
'I went to a Methodist public school and I suppose I had imbibed standard
Tory party views about things. I remember in 1956 going to Trafalgar Square
to hear Nye Bevan, when he made his famous 'Eden must go' speech. I was
stunned by his oratory. He got 100,000 people to charge down Whitehall,
pursued by the mounted police. But why I read Russell, I don't remember.'
Did you count yourself a Left winger?
'I was sort of moving in that direction.'
What do you count yourself now?
'I would count myself a democratic socialist.'
Did you come to America because the money was better?
'Certainly it was a large salary. It would be hypocritical to deny that
money was a factor. But I would hate readers of the Financial Times to think
that by coming to America they are suddenly going to get rich. You get paid
a lot more money, but you pay a lot more money. Our daughter is at
university and that costs a lot. I'm living in a smaller house, driving
basically the same car and . . . anwyay, my life isn't really about making
money.'
Among the reasons he gave were restlessness, the presence at Princeton of
psychologists with whom he wanted to work - and vice versa - and government
cuts at the beginning of the Thatcher decade.
'I so hated what happened to universities as a result of the cuts. In many
ways it was not so much the lack of resources, but what it did to people's
morale. Money became the subject of conversation. Wherever you went, people
would ask you how were you coping.
'When I was professor at Sussex I had a traumatic year as chairman of the
faculty. It was the worst year of my life. It got to the point where we
wondered whether we would have enough money to buy the feed for the animals
in the laboratory.
'There is a saying in American academe that Thatcher did more for American
universities than anybody since Adolf Hitler. Now that's a gross
exaggeration. But it would be interesting to look at what's happening to
people in their later career. It's not just a matter of counting heads.'
Johnson-Laird said fewer of the brightest undergraduates were taking PhDs
because there was no obvious academic career in Britain.
Perhaps, I suggested, the government correctly took the view that academic
institutions had become bloated and inefficient. Wasn't there some
productivity gain to be made?
'There's always a proportion of dead wood in any walk of life,' he replied.
'The question you have to ask is whether measures of productivity are
appropriate to universities. With undergraduates you might want to count
heads, but the other thing, clearly, is research.'
Charles Darwin, he added, had spent years researching Origin of Species and
would have failed any modern productivity test applied by the Universities
Funding Council. 'My philosophy is - and this has nothing to do with my
socialist leanings - if you really want to get good research out of people
then you shouldn't have them looking over their shoulder to see whether they
are still going to have a job in a year's time. People have got to feel that
they can sit around - maybe not quite as long as Darwin did - but at least
not feel that pressure.
'The thing in Britain is that the politicians continue to run it as though
it was a super-power, spending for example vast sums of money on the
Falklands War (which incidentally I regarded as unnecessary) and still
spending money on maintaining armaments.
'My feeling about Britain is like Bertrand Russell's, who drew the analogy
with Holland's loss of empire in the 17th century. The great things about
Britain are the ideas the British have contributed in the arts and in the
sciences. The universities are not the only place where this happens: I'm
talking equally about the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre,
the art schools and so on. But we should put our money where our strengths
are.
'It's so easy to mess a system up and so hard to get it back in running
order. The worry is not what's going to happen in the next five or ten years
but what's going to be happening - maybe here in America, too - in the long
term. Will British universities survive to be productive and creative in 25
years time?'
Do you see yourself working in Britain again?
'Maybe. At the moment we are both very happy here.'
